WEBVTT

00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.080
so fine guys like i said so in today's class we are going to

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.980
talk about basically a lang chain we are going to talk about

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.840
a lang graph and we are going to talk about a lang serve now

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.240
what we are going to achieve with all these three so with

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.060
the help of lang chain so we are going to create a tools i

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.840
think we all know what is the meaning of a tools i believe i

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.140
talked about a tools a lot how we can try to create a tools

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.620
in case of a lang chain in case of a lama indexes in case of

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.760
a crew ai we have discussed about that even how to create a

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.460
agents we have already talked about all of these things now

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.540
it's time to combine couple of things together and then

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.380
deploy it deploy it somewhere where it can work in a real

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.720
time so everyone will be able to use my agents or tools that

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.460
i'm going to create and maybe if they would like to create

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.760
their own ui interface so they will be able to run it with

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.300
the help of their own ui interface that is something that

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.980
that we are going to see so a complete end to the lang chain

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:58.980
so we are going to talk about a tools i believe we are going

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.240
to end application till a deployment is something which i'm

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.540
going to demonstrate in my today's class based on the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.880
previous class understanding because uh we talked about we

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.740
all know that how to create an agent and in no time we all

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.040
will be able to create an agent in no time we can try to

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.960
pass a tools to my agent but it's time to like serve each

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.940
and everything and this is where i'm going to use a lang

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.180
serve framework again there are multiple ways there are

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.880
multiple framework to do it but i have chosen these three

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.940
things a lang chain lang graph and lang serve to build this

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.640
entire end to end application so let me share my screen i

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.740
believe my screen is visible to all of you so let me open up

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.640
my scribble ink so that i can draw something for all of you

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.700
okay

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.100
so let's let's try to understand that what we are going to

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.780
achieve in my today's class so first of all this is the

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.640
project let me share my screen

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.120
yeah so yeah

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.380
so this is the project that we are going to do so ai driven

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.140
medical diagnostic support system so where we are going to

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.800
basically create a different different kind of a tools we

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.500
are going to create a different different kind of agents the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.020
main part is a deployment and the main part is end to end

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.540
application building so starting from your back end so which

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.500
is going to activate your agents and a tools and then

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.820
building a front end so which is going to consume which is

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.340
running in a backend and again so whenever we try to do a

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.460
real-time project we always try to create a backend server

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.460
separately and a front-end server in a complete separate way

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.060
so that my front-end server will be able to communicate with

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.000
my back-end server so even this euron.one application or

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.080
this portal that you are able to see so the things that you

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.800
are able to see is basically a front-end but whenever you

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.620
are going to click on any of these courses or whenever you

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.840
are going to click on anything so it is trying to call an

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.860
api from a backend and because of that so each and

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.960
everything is up and running whether it's a internship

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.280
portal or whether it's a yuri or anything so yeah coming to

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.780
my international portal guys so like uh i told that by

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.420
friday intensive portal will be available but yeah so we

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.580
have released this intensive portal on a wednesday itself

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.060
and in an intensive portal you will be able to find out a

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.460
project based on the different different domain based on the

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.480
different different technology so far we have loaded 570

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.420
projects so you can go ahead and you can try to like uh you

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.900
know select any of the project of your choice or maybe based

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.720
on the domain you can try to filter out any of these

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.600
projects and you can try to enroll into any of this project

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.200
by looking into a prd by looking into a hld and by looking

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.400
into a lld so in this prd document in this hld document in

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.040
this ld document so very clearly we have defined all the

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.480
requirement that you are supposed to fulfill now why we are

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.620
keeping in this way the reason is very simple whenever you

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.720
are going to join any organization even as a fresher or

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.340
maybe as an experienced person so you will be able to see

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.760
this kind of a prd almost a similar kind of a prd a project

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.460
requirement documentation from your team maybe from your

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.780
lead or maybe from your client and similarly you have to

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.220
create a hld and you have to create a lld but here so we

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.340
have already created a hld and we have to create a lld and

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.520
we have to create a hld and we have to create we have

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.220
already created a LLD in general from your client or from

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.900
your lead you will be able to receive just a project

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.400
requirement document so where like a with respect to a

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.500
project a goals objective or maybe a feature maybe a user

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.300
story that how user is going to navigate or maybe a

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.320
functional requirement non-functional requirement everything

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.920
will be mentioned everything will be mentioned inside a PID

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.960
document and based on that you have to create your HLD and

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.500
LLD but for every project we have given you HLD and LLD as

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.400
well so that it will make your life little bit easier and

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.040
based on this PRD HLD and LLD you will be able to build end

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.820
-to-end project and you will be able to submit it now you

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.960
can try to use it as a fresher you can try to use it even as

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.820
an experienced person believe me even if you are going to

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.380
complete one or two project right one or two project you

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.740
will be able to get a complete real-time exposure this is

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.920
how this entire project will be able to get a complete real

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.440
-time exposure this is how this entire project will be built

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.020
and this is how real-time event development happens right so

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.260
whenever we say that okay fine so how real-time development

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.760
happens so this is how real-time development happens at the

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.920
end of the day so all of you are going to explore it all of

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.780
you are going to enroll it and very soon we are going to

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.040
even roll out the feature maybe by the end of this month

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.440
where if you would like to work as a team right maybe you if

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.120
you would like to work but like a with a two people three

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.440
people or five people you will be able to work as of now as

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.460
an individual you can come over here and here you can select

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.540
one single project and then you can try to start so once you

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.580
are going to click on enroll so here it is going to give you

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.440
a onboarding later like this is just onboarding later we are

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.520
giving you and this is official onboarding later anyone can

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.100
come over here and anyone even can verify that whether this

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.520
letter is a genuine or not so basically this later anyone

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.060
can verify so even with the help of qr code or with the help

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.000
of this id or just by clicking on the link so this is just a

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.880
onboarding later not a completion later so this is just a

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.200
onboarding later at all so completion later you will be able

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.820
to get it once you are going to submit the project after

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.800
doing it plus we have given you a kanban board kind of a

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.100
structure so where you can try to you know list down all the

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:09.460
tasks over here and then like a drag it from one place to

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.660
other places so as it is going to complete so this is just

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.560
for you so when you are trying to build a big project so

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.960
obviously we try to use a kanban board kind of a things and

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.260
this is where this kanban board is going to come into

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.720
picture for a respective project you can try to enroll into

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.320
one two or maybe a hundreds of project we don't have any

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.660
kind of issues and yeah for majority of technology projects

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.340
are already available for majority of domain projects are

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.040
already available for whichever domain projects are not

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.300
available for whichever tech projects are not available we

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.580
have given an option to request so here you can come and you

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.460
can even try to write your domain and just a technology my

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.700
team is going to evaluate it so you have requested doesn't

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.400
mean that project will be available for sure we are going to

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:53.880
evaluate it and we are going to evaluate it so if you are

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.480
making a project it the alignment with respect to this

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.460
particular portal that we have created and then we are going

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.460
to create a prd we are going to create a hld we are going to

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.200
create a lld and we'll try to make those project available

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:10.080
inside a internship portal so hope this entire portal is

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.460
like a fine with all of you if you have any question please

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.740
let me know this is nice will you be adding a legal area

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:20.860
also soon uh yeah you can request it basically you can go

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.300
ahead and you can request it so whatever project that we are

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.620
going to upload so we are going to upload it with respect to

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:29.080
a tech basically right with respect to our technology we are

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.000
going to like do it so maybe if you can try to fill up a

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.980
domain as a legal maybe technology as ai or maybe like a web

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.380
development so we can try to build a project and we can try

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.180
to make it available but yeah you can go ahead and request

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:44.340
it will take some time maybe like a sometime week of time it

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.380
is going to take some time maybe 10 days of time it is going

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:50.200
to take but if the project or domain or technology is a

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.060
feasible one we'll make it available

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:58.800
can when for our work management yes so basically we all use

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.600
this can be kind of a board right uh in terms of a task

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.040
allocation in terms of a work allocation for example uh

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.200
tomorrow you are going to basically like uh tomorrow you are

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.800
going to work with a multiple person right so maybe you can

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.360
create one of the tasks for you one of the tasks for your

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.820
team members and then you can try to allocate those tasks on

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.540
your team member and this is how even we do a project

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.960
development right whenever we do a project development so we

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.420
create a multiple different tasks technically you lead is

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.160
going to create a multiple different different kind of a

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.780
task they are going to assign it among a different different

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:33.180
team members so in a can-ban board itself you will be able

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:36.660
to see uh that particular option so where whoever you are

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:40.960
going to on board right for a particular project uh so you

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.100
can you can try to like do a project along with that and you

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.980
can try to allocate a task that okay you do this i will do

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:50.220
this something like this and then you can try to track your

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:54.120
own progress but yeah so the only objective behind this

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.680
intensive portal is to give you an experience and especially

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:01.220
for a fresher and dropout. So every colleges nowadays in a

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.780
final semester, or maybe even in a sixth semester, most of

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.580
the colleges, it's a rule nowadays, right? They like a look

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:11.120
for the internship. And generally what happens is a problem

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.280
with the internship, I'll talk about even a reality of the

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.260
internship. So the problem with the internship is that

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:21.960
majority of interns ends up doing a low level task whenever

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.920
they join as an intern and they will not end up learning

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.720
anything. They will maybe just get some sort of a completion

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.520
certificate for three months, for four months, for six

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.160
months, max to max. And at the end of the day, they don't

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.520
learn anything. They don't build anything, but this portal,

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.880
make sure, always make sure that you are building, you are

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:46.180
not just doing a low hanging task, basically generally like

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:49.420
this is what like interns does, but yeah, not here, not, not

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.340
in this one. And it is going to give you. A complete end to

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.860
end understanding because when you are going to submit the

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.620
project based on the project criteria, which means HLD, LLD

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.400
and PRD that we have given to you. So we are going to

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:05.020
evaluate and we are going to give you even a review if you

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.320
are rejecting your project. So you will be able to get a

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.240
review, a complete end to end review that, okay, this is

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.300
something that you have to do. You have not done that. And

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.920
based on the review, you can try to build a project once

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.480
again, and then you are going to resubmit it. Now once you

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.560
are going to resubmit it, then only. And once we are going

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.580
to, you are going to resubmit it. And then once we are going

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:27.000
to approve it, then only you will get a completion letter

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.480
for that duration. Duration means the day you have enrolled,

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.340
let's suppose today you have enrolled and you are submitting

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.300
your project maybe after three months, four months or five

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:37.680
months. So for that particular tenure, you will be able to

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:42.540
get a letter, authentic letter from our side. And again, in

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.740
every PRD, you will be able to find out that we have even

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.240
given you a tentative milestone. That how much time in the

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.480
general, this project should take. Okay. But yeah, you can

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.540
take a, even a less time or even you can take maybe a more

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.860
time. It's completely fine. At the end of the day, the

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.440
later, the final internship completion later that you will

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.700
be able to get or in terms of data that you are, you are

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.700
going to receive is for a tenure of submission till approval

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:11.580
is intensive accessible for all subscriber. I don't think

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.880
so. Intensive is not available for the all subscriber. It's

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.600
just available for a plus subscriber, whatever feature that

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.900
we are building, whatever feature that we are launching, it

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.560
is like a costing us a lot. So obviously like a, it's not

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.720
available to like a, anyone except a plus subscriber

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.120
basically.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:34.380
Okay. So I believe now internship portal is fine. Now coming

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:38.500
back to our discussion. So like I said, a generative AI with

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:42.740
NLP. So as I said that we are going to basically talk about

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:48.280
this particular project in my today's class. So this, this,

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.620
this, this, this label three project basically. Yeah. So AI

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:55.720
driven medical diagnosis support system. Now. Intention is

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.360
not to teach you how to build an agent. Intention is not to

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.920
teach you how to build a tools. But intention is to teach

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.760
you in this particular project, how to do it things end to

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.540
end so that any given project, right? Any given project

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.660
going forward that we are going to build. So we will go

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.220
ahead with the end to end approach, not just like a running

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.220
something in my local system. So today I will stop. I'll be

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.900
showing you a deployment in a render, but tomorrow maybe

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.260
I'll try to show you even a deployment with the AWS Azure

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.580
and maybe other services. But yeah. So like to see a

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.720
deployment or to do a deployment, you have to have that

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.520
account unless you don't have an account, you will not be

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.620
able to do a deployment. But yeah, from my side, obviously

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:32.620
I'm going to show it to you.

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:40.610
So shall we start guys?

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.820
Yeah. Okay. So Joey is the first person who used to comment

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:09.100
all the time. That's great. So fine. Let's get started. And

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.260
let me show you a end to end this entire things. And today

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.500
onwards, whatever you are going to build with respect to

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.540
agent TKI, please make sure that you are doing end to end.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.580
Okay. Not just like something which is running in your local

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:24.240
system, right? So we will like a leave that approach from

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:29.600
today onwards. Okay. So now to do this, let me close this

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:34.880
entire things. And here, what we are going to do is, so we

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.840
are going to build basically,

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:45.250
okay, what happened? So

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.780
technically we are going to build a backend.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:18.920
Backend. Now in a backend. I am going to keep our tools and

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:23.260
then I can try to keep my agents, right? I think we all know

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.280
what is the meaning of a tools. I think we all know what is

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.760
the meaning of agents. And then we are going to build our

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.820
front end separately, right? So both the servers are going

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:35.640
to be separate, like a backend will be called by my front

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:40.650
end, front end. So obviously front end, I'm going to create

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:45.750
a Streamlint app, Streamlint app. Now those who would like

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:48.590
to like create this entire things with the help of maybe a

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:52.890
react app, or maybe by using some other UI things, you can

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:55.670
go a graduate or maybe like a react. If you would like to

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:58.430
create or react native in which you would like to create it,

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:00.770
you can go ahead and you can try to create it at the end of

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:03.330
the day. My backend will be completely separate and this

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:06.470
backend can be called by anyone. It will be a complete

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:09.190
technology independent, right? It will be completely

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:11.890
technology independent. So my backend will be called. So I'm

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:15.770
going to expose my backend as an API and anyone and everyone

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:19.210
will be able to call that API. Anyone. I'm going to do a

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:22.370
testing for example. So even for a URI, right? Even for a

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:25.510
URI. So we have released a endpoint and that's an

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:28.790
authenticated authorized endpoint and something is running

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:31.530
in a backend, right? So whenever you are going to call URI

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:35.330
via API and whenever you are going to call a URI, even

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:39.230
through a UI interface by the chat system, right? So URI is

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:42.650
trying to hit some of the backend, right? Whether it's an

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:46.710
API or whether it's a UI chat interface. So URI is trying to

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:50.410
hit that backend. URI is trying to execute or do a

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:53.970
inferencing. It is trying to do a complete latex operation

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:57.150
in a backend so that you will be able to get an output in a

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.330
formatted way, whether it's a formula, whether it's a table

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.090
or whether it's any other things. And then you are able to

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:06.090
see some of the responses. So generally, whenever we try to

00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:08.990
create a production grid application, we always try to keep

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:12.350
my backend separate and always try to keep my frontend

00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:16.010
separate so that I can try to manage both of these things

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:19.090
separately. Okay. I will be able to develop my backend

00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:21.830
independently. I will be able to develop my frontend and

00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:25.090
then whenever it is required, I'll just try to call the APIs

00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:28.810
and I will be able to stitch it together, right? Stitch it

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:31.630
together. And this is something that I'm going to see. So

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:35.010
I'll try to keep all my executable things, executable things

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:38.930
means tools and the agents, because this is something that

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:41.310
we try to execute and whatever agent that we are going to

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:44.750
get, whatever tools that my agent is trying to call. So

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:47.470
these are the executable things. These are the things. These

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:50.930
are the things which is trying to do a real task, right? And

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:54.130
the frontend is just a UI, which is giving you a complete

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:58.890
user experience. And anyone without knowing about a tech in

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:02.990
a backend, right? They will be able to use it. So similar

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:05.890
kind of approach we are going to see in this particular

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:09.430
class. Now API wise, I will be using a URI API so that you

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:11.690
don't have to go anywhere because we all know that, that we

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.570
are trying to build an agentic AI project or anything that

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:18.090
you will build in a generative AI. Okay. So without API, you

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:20.450
can't do anything, right? I believe we all have that

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:23.110
understanding because we have taken a lot many classes and

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:28.510
so many times we have already used a URI API. So and we are

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:31.290
going to run this backend in a local system first of all,

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.550
frontend in a local system first of all, even we are going

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:36.330
to combine it and then we are going to run it in a local

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:40.050
system first of all and then I will host backend separately

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:44.050
on a separate server on a cloud and frontend on a separate

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:46.990
server on a cloud and then we'll see that whether it is able

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:49.950
to make an interaction or not in between frontend and a

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:53.130
backend in between my tools, agents and my frontend UI

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:55.770
interface, which has been built in a Streamlint. And then

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:57.910
I'll keep on writing more and more things as we are going to

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:05.610
progress. So let me open up our VS code, VS code, and

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:20.550
then let's create a new folder for this project,

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:29.700
medical project. Okay. I'm going to keep it as a name and

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:33.640
then select a folder. So this is my folder, a simple raw

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:39.680
blank folder I have created now inside this, inside this. So

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:43.000
what I can do is, so we are trying to build a AI medical

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.240
diagnostic system. Okay. So let's create a folder, AI

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:53.180
underscore MEDI CL underscore DIG NOSTICS.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.120
So let's create another folder, AI medical diagnostic. This

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.480
is my project folder by the way, main folder. And then I'm

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:03.120
going to create basically another folder and I can name it

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:08.280
as a Lang serve underscore backend. So Lang serve backend,

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:12.780
I'm going to create, and then inside this folder, inside

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:16.940
this Lang serve backend folder, I am going to create a

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:20.240
folder called as tools so that I can keep all my tools in

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:24.340
one place. So tools, and then I'm going to create another

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:27.300
folder inside this Lang serve backend, and I'm going to keep

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:31.680
it as a utility. So all the utility file, I'm going to keep

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.760
it here. So means like a URI file, you can say, so I'm going

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:38.840
to keep it here. So this is my product project structure by

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:44.180
the way, inside the Lang serve. And then once you are going

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:48.180
to like come, right, once you are going to like come here,

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:52.700
so maybe I can try to create for a backend, I can try to

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:56.120
create a file called as diagnostic

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:05.720
graph. Where I will be keeping all my agents and then inside

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:11.600
a Lang serve folder itself, I'm going to keep it my main

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:17.340
file. So main.py file, which will be called eventually in

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:20.840
Lang serve backend, I'll, I'll try to realign it. And then

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:24.920
inside my Lang serve backend itself, let's keep

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:33.350
requirements, R-E-Q-U-I-R-E-M-E-N-T-S.txt file. Okay. So

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:36.970
this is the folder structure guys we have to create. So

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:42.030
we're inside a Lang serve. I think there is something wrong

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:47.870
with main.py file is available, requirement.dxt is

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:53.050
available. Diagnostic is available. So requirement

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:56.110
diagnostic main.py file, everything is available inside the

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:59.770
Lang serve backend. Okay. Now, now it's aligned. So

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:02.210
everything is available inside my Lang serve backend. Now,

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:04.470
again, I'm going to click on my end. I'm going to create a

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:06.250
folder called AI medical agent. So there is a one folder

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:09.230
called as backend folder. And then here I'm going to click

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:12.750
again, AI medical diagnostic main folder. And I'm going to

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:19.410
create a folder called as S-T-R-E-A-M-L-I-T-T-U-U-I. So I'll

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:22.110
try to keep, keep all my front end code inside my streamlit

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:25.090
UI folder, this particular folder. Now what I'm going to

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:28.270
keep inside my streamlit UI folder. So I'm going to keep my

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:33.510
app.py file over here. And then a separate requirement.txt

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:36.590
format.txt. So separate because I have to deploy separately.

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:39.570
So keeping that in a mind, I'm going to keep a separate

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:45.510
requirement.txt file, R-E-Q-U-I-R-E-M-E-N-T-S.txt. So here,

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:50.840
this is my folder structure guys, close everything. This is

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.060
my folder structure. So this is the main folder, as you can

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:57.420
see, right? Then we have two folder inside the main folder.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.700
One is for backend. One is for front end. I have created now

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.780
inside a backend folder because backend will be all about a

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:08.780
tools and like a. Agents calling. So I'm going to create a

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:10.980
tools folder over here. That is a utility folder. There is a

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:13.860
diagnostic graph main and then requirement.txt file. And

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.020
then on my UI side, there will be only one file, which where

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.460
I'm going to create a basic UI and then requirement.txt

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:25.060
file. Now what I will do is I'll try to deploy this backend

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:29.120
separately. So this, and this will be independent of each

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.740
other. So backend will be separated the way we try to deploy

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:34.340
it in a real time. So I'm going to follow the exact same

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:37.600
approach. Nothing different. And I'm going to deploy my like

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:41.640
a UI in a completely separate way. And my front end is going

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:45.360
to call my backend whenever someone is going to hit it means

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:49.360
whenever someone is going to like a ask a question about a

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:52.980
medical diagnosis based on the symptoms, it is going to hit

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:55.740
my backend by the way. So this is the approach that we are

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:58.780
going to follow. So hope this approach is clear. Everyone.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:05.000
Yeah. Is this clear to every one of us? So what we are going

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:05.700
to do by the way.

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.100
Yeah. Yeah. We are going to create a folder structure guys,

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.280
just this folder structure, simple, right? Back end

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:27.220
separate, front end separate. And in both the folder, we

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:30.100
have a requirement.txt because deployment wise, although

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:32.220
when you are running these things in a local system, it's

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.340
not required because I will be using the exact same

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:37.680
environment for both the, like both the run, UI and back,

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:40.800
back end and front end. But yeah, so when you are going to

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:44.180
deploy it, so obviously you need a separate requirement.txt

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:47.000
file. Otherwise it is, it is not going to spin up the

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:47.280
machine.

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:10.790
Okay. Now let's get started now on my backend side. So we

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:13.730
have a tools and we have a utilities. So what we are going

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:16.890
to keep it inside our tools. So I'm going to create a one

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:19.510
tool that I'm going to create one tool over here. So it

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:21.710
means one Python file I'm going to create. So which is going

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:25.090
to do a diagnosis of the symptoms. So I'm going to name it

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:33.630
as a D I A G O G N O S I S diagnosis underscore T double O L

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:37.210
tool dot PI file. So simple Python file diagnosis tool. And

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:39.730
then I'm going to create another tool. So which is going to

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:43.870
check the symptoms. So here S Y M P T O M symptom underscore

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:48.850
checker dot PI file. So symptom checker. So these are the

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:50.970
tools which I'm going to create a two tools. One will

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:54.130
diagnose, one will try to check the symptoms and then there

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:56.650
is a utility file I'm going to create. So utility file is

00:25:56.650 --> 00:26:00.590
nothing but a my URI client basically. So URI, URI

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:04.370
underscore C L I E N T URI client dot PI file. So URI client

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:08.030
is something that I'm going to create over here. Okay. Now,

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:11.950
so inside tools, now we have two tools inside like a

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:15.290
utility. We have a URI client by the way. So where I'm going

00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:18.770
to call a URI because I need an access of LLMs. Without

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:23.410
LLMs, I can't do anything. So just create it and confirm me

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:27.350
guys in a chat. Just create all the folder structure, file

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:29.670
structure. Anyhow I'm going to share this entire project

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:30.790
inside your like a DICT.

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:40.150
You're on dashboard, but yeah, so as of now in a live class,

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:44.230
you all have to do it. So please confirm me guys, once

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:44.970
you're able to do it.

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:27.770
Okay. So we are able to create it. So I'll try to start with

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:31.410
the URI client and I'm going to use the exact same code that

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:35.650
we have been using even before. So where I'm going to call

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:39.850
this file. So let me show it to you. So where we are going

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:42.870
to call this code. Right. We are going to call it, solution.

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:45.610
So which is going to take some data side of a data content.

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:47.810
And then accordingly, it is going to give you the response

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:51.570
by taking the API. So this is something that I'm going to do

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:55.090
it in a very first place. Same code in a little bit modified

00:27:55.090 --> 00:28:00.190
way. I'm going to use it. So let's try to like create a URI

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:04.770
client. So here URI client wise. So this is my URI client.

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:08.730
Here you have to pass your own API key by the way, your

00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:20.650
API key and code is same. Code is same. the code that we

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:23.990
have already shared so it's the same code uh i have copy and

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:29.670
pasted so it's not different at all so this is the code guys

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:32.510
i have pinned you this code even inside your chat box so

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:35.430
that you can use it now yuri api key from where i can get it

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:37.990
i believe we all know the place go to authentication inside

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:43.350
yuri and copy it right copy this api key and then paste it

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:47.750
over here so simple to get my yuri api key what it is trying

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:51.070
to do nothing uh as per the sample code so it is trying to

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:54.210
take your like models so whatever model that you want you

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:56.730
can try to pass this model over here and then you can try to

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:59.510
pass temperature maximum token you can try to set and we

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:02.110
have parameterized it so that you can try to pass these

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:05.730
things even in a later stage and then you can try to pass

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:08.370
your message and we all know that that whatever things that

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:10.810
you are going to ask it is going to do it right it's a chat

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:13.650
gpt model that we are using a chat completion model that we

00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:16.450
are using so this will go inside our yuri client now once

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:19.610
yuri client is done which is available inside my yuri client

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:23.770
dot pi five file close it right close it because we are

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:26.650
going to use it inside the tools so we all know that that

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:30.030
tools is nothing but a function right we all know that tools

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:33.210
is nothing but a function at the end of the day a function

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:36.410
which is going to perform a specific task and just by

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:40.910
writing a like or just by doing some sort of annotation as a

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:45.770
tools we can convert any function as a tools for a lang

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:49.050
chain right guys everyone yes

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.900
convert any function as a tool can i say that i can i can

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:57.940
convert it so i think we have done a lot of a lot of these

00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:06.150
things so from lang chain lang c-h-a-i-n chain dot tools

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:10.810
import tools and let's suppose if i'm going to create any

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:14.230
function addition function and maybe it is taking two

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:19.250
parameter a and b and it is going to return maybe a plus b

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:22.490
over here so this is our normal simple function now if i

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:23.670
have to convert this entire function to a function now i

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:25.270
have to convert this entire function as a tool what i have

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:27.850
to do i just have to do the annotation generation from this

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:30.590
lang chain tool that we have called so at the rate of tool

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:33.930
and now this will become a tool that this will be

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:37.030
discoverable by the agents right so my agents will be able

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:39.810
to discover this tool as and when it is required so this is

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:43.750
how easy it is and we have already created our tools in lang

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:48.330
chain in lang grab we have also created in lama indexes we

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:51.110
have also created it and i believe even in crew ai

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:58.890
thing agree everyone this is the way by which we try to

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:00.590
create a tools okay

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:10.600
now so my tool is going to use basically a URI so I can try

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:14.060
to call utils utils is the folder inside this folder what I

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:16.880
have I have a URI client and then I am going to import

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:21.220
import what so import URI chat completion function URI chat

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:24.620
commission function because this is available here right so

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:28.280
inside utility folder I have this Python file as you can see

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:31.040
inside little folder I have this Python file and then import

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.580
URI chat completion so these are the only two things which

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:39.320
is required for me and before that right before that as like

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:43.740
environment conflicts gives you a lots and lots of issue so

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:46.700
let's do one thing let's try to create one separate

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:51.020
environments independent environment for this entire project

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:54.920
so to do that what I will do is I'll try to write maybe a

00:31:54.920 --> 00:32:00.360
conda conda, create and then environment name hyphen n and

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:05.180
this is a MIDI die so MIDI diagnostic so MIDI die I am going

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:09.120
to give a name Python pytho in Python is equals to three

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:13.260
point one zero I am going to keep and then install yes so

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:20.600
now this is going to create my new Python environment okay

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:32.540
so now once this new Python environment has been created now

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:36.260
once it's done so maybe I can try to activate this Python

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:38.880
environment so this Python environment is activated or maybe

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.500
I can try to even go in a command prompt and then activate

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:44.520
this environment so as you can see this environment is

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.840
activated we have done those things hundred times in our

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:50.360
class so nothing new so and then what we can do is we can

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:52.900
try to install the requirements so whatever requirements

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:56.100
that we have we can try to install it so that we can

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:59.820
mitigate a conflict going going forward so what we are going

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:03.880
to keep inside the requirement so here we are going to keep

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:09.100
all of these things which we are going to use so these are

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:11.000
something that we are going to keep it inside the

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.100
requirement.txt so we are going to keep a fast api so which

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:17.060
is going to help me out in terms of building a api uvconn

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:20.580
just to like execute or just to expose this api lang serve

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:24.240
so that i will be able to serve all the agents and all the

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:27.300
tools lang graph so that i will be able to build a graph of

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.620
the agents which can try to perform because i have to

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:32.940
combine the multiple things together so i am going to use a

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:35.160
graph approach so one after another it will try to connect

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.960
lang chain help which you can help me out in terms of

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.540
creating a tools and the agents request which can help me

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:43.920
out in terms of like requesting to my uri or streamlint for

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:48.540
a ui ssc basically which is required again to call your

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:50.840
agents so this is something that you have to keep inside

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:55.040
requirement.txt file and once you have all this things in

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:59.520
your fresh created environment just install it so dir and

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:05.120
just go to medical diagnostic so cd ai go to that folder

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:10.020
where we have a requirement.txt so cd lang serve backend and

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:13.720
then here we have a requirement.txt as you can see right we

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:16.880
have a requirement.txt so i can simply run pip install

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:21.760
hyphen r requirement.txt and everything it is going to

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:26.600
execute so whatever library that i have given it will try to

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.440
install each and everything in my system in this environment

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:33.280
so just do it guys create your own environment and then try

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:36.460
to install everything i have pinged you what will go inside

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:38.720
the requirement.txt file okay

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:50.310
so looks like almost everything is done without any kind of

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:54.050
a major issue so we are able to prepare our environment and

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:57.270
we should not be worried about anything now with respect to

00:34:57.270 --> 00:35:02.430
this environment okay now so once environment is done once

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:04.990
environment is done nothing is going to go wrong so let's

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:08.150
try to create our tools so first tool is for diagnosis

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:11.790
second tool is for a second symptom checker so it's going to

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:14.550
be a normal function but yeah at the end of the day i'm

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:17.630
going to just annotate it with a with a tool so it will just

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:26.670
try to behave as a tool now here right here file name is

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:29.370
diagnosis so basically i have to write some function so

00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:33.210
which is going to take an input from the user and And it is

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:36.830
supposed to diagnose that what kind of, you know, illness

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:39.370
that you have, what kind of a problem or health problem that

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:45.690
you have. Okay, so def AI underscore D I A G N O S diagnose.

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:53.010
And then here symptom underscore description it is going to

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:57.330
take. And as we are trying to convert something into a tool,

00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:00.910
so I have to give this doc string for each and every

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:06.390
function. That's a standard approach, right? So use URI to

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:07.850
provide

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:19.740
the diagnosis suggestion based on the symptom given by

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:23.740
users. Simple. So this is just a doc string, nothing much,

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.820
right? This is not a functionality. This is just a doc

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:28.840
string for this function that I have mentioned. Now, so what

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:32.560
I will do is I'll try to return, return something from URI

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:35.640
chat completion. Yep. I'll try to return something from a

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:37.920
URI chat completion means I'm going to call this URI chat

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.900
completion. Now, if you will go and check what is a input

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:45.280
URI chat completion takes. So URI chat completion is taking

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.580
a message, right? Whatever message that you are going to

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:50.380
pass. So maybe if I'm saying that I'm not feeling well or

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:54.100
today I have a headache or maybe a severe back pain I have.

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:57.300
So that is a kind of a messages you are going to pass. You

00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:00.100
can try to pick and choose the model. So if you are not

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:03.480
going to give a model by default GPT 4.1 nano, it is going

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:08.480
to take. But in case of URI, you have 10 model access as

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.740
simple as that. You have a deep thinking model access as

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:13.780
well. You have a real time search model access as well in

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:16.780
case of a URI, right? If you are trying to use OpenAI, so in

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:19.980
that case, obviously one model, one task. So you can use

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:22.040
that as well. But I don't have any kind of issue. But yeah,

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:24.860
so here you have a multimodal access. You can use it

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:27.260
temperature. I believe we all know what is the meaning of

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:29.700
temperature. If you are not going to override this one, in

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:33.000
that case, it will be 0.7, a maximum number of token. So a

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.180
thousand. If you are not overriding it. So here message, it

00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:39.300
is going to take now, what kind of a message I'm going to

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:42.160
pass, right? What kind of a messages I'm going to pass. So

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:45.380
let's create a message, M E double S A G message, which I'm

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:48.980
going to pass into my URI chat completion. So here I'm going

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:52.560
to create a message in a LLM way, basically, right? I'm

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:57.860
going to create a message in a LLM way now. So here, uh, I'm

00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:01.640
going to write it down that, uh, role. So what is the role

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:06.160
of the LLM? So behave it. Like user role is user basically,

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:12.580
and then content content. So content wise, what? So content

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:17.820
wise formatted a string. Okay. It's coming outside. So

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:22.460
content wise formatted a string and then here. So I can try

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:30.680
to write down a patient, patient reports, basically this

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:33.880
symptom, the symptom, which I'm trying to pass symptom

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.920
description. So whatever. So whatever symptom that user is

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:40.920
going to pass, uh, symptom. Now I can try to ask a question

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:46.400
that what are the possible diagnosis

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:57.820
and next step and even suggest me cure for this one. So this

00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:00.980
is the message which will go inside my URI LLM based on the

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:03.760
symptom description that my user is going to pass whenever

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.820
this will be called, whenever this tool will be called. And,

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:10.220
uh, eventually my, uh, like a URI is going to give me a

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:13.700
response. So here I'm going to pass. My message is equals to

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.960
message, right? This particular message will come here

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.820
inside my URI chat completion, and then it is going to call

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:22.940
this entire things. My API call will be done by the way,

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.140
and, uh, based on the API call. So it is going to perform

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:30.360
each and everything. Okay. So that's, that's completely fine

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:35.020
now. So here you have to change a URL. I believe I have

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:41.120
given you a wrong URL. So this URL is going to be guys and

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:50.410
the point, and, uh, can go to code example. So URL is going

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:53.850
to be this one chat completion URL. So alpha chat

00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:55.410
completion, you

00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:04.930
can check that out even from a URI. So this is the chat

00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:08.950
completion URL, by the way, let me ping you this. So just,

00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:12.150
just make this correction, chat completion URL. And, uh,

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:14.850
yeah. So based on this, this is going to perform this

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:17.290
operation. Okay. This is going to call as of now, this is

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:20.290
available just as a simple function. I will try to convert

00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:23.950
this as a tool so that my agents will be able to discover

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:27.850
this particular tool automatically. So at the rate T double

00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:31.210
L tool, and now this became tool. So agent will be able to

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:34.550
discover it in a easiest possible manner. And this is the

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:41.850
complete code for all of you. Fine. Everyone done. Well,

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:42.230
this point.

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:11.710
Yeah. Done everyone. So easy. I don't think that. Uh, none

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:14.370
of us, uh, any one of us are going to face any kind of a

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:16.930
issue because this is not the first time we are doing it,

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:21.290
right? We have done that multiple times already. Okay. So

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:24.310
this tool is done. One diagnosis tool is done, and this is

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:26.290
the message it will get. And then based on that, URI is

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:29.030
going to give you some sort of a response. Close it, close

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:32.490
everything. Now, now we have a second tool, which is a

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:35.270
symptom checker tool. So again, I'm going to write a couple

00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:42.180
of function over there. So here from lang chain, I can write

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:44.480
like all. If this tool in a single file, that's also fine,

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:47.300
but yeah, I'm just trying to maintain the modularity so that

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:49.900
anyone can come tomorrow and then try to add any number of

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:55.220
tools in the respective section. So Lang chain, Lang, C H I

00:41:55.220 --> 00:42:03.520
N chain dot dot T double O L S tools import tool simple. So

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:08.960
L A N G L A N G C H A I N yes, there should not be any kind

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:12.220
of a spelling mistake. And then here I'm going to create a

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:18.560
function. Call us check underscore S Y M P T S Y M P T O M

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:22.560
symptom. So user symptom

00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:28.420
is a input, some string input I'm going to give, and then it

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:31.880
is going to check the symptom. So what it is going to do,

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:35.300
let me write it down in a doc string. So it is going to. So

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:47.440
this tool will analyze the input. Symptom text and return

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:57.520
the relevant medical category that, okay, the symptom

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.400
belongs to which category this is what they're trying to do.

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:01.840
So if I would like to like to do something more, it can do

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:05.240
it now. User can try to input a symptom in a lower case in a

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:07.880
upper case. So I'm going to normalize it. So whatever user

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:10.940
is going to input, just try to convert it in a lower case.

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:14.640
So just to normalize it. Because user. Is user, right? So

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:22.940
user can try to like, uh, S Y M P T O M symptom is equal to

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:28.480
this one. Okay. Now, so I'm just going to write a kind of a

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.860
condition over here. I'm not going to call any kind of, uh,

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:34.680
APIs as well, API, even inside this one. So here, what I'm

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:41.360
going to do is that if user is going to input fever in

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:49.320
symptom, right. Or user. Is going to input body ache in

00:43:49.320 --> 00:44:01.710
symptom or chills in symptom. So return, what return

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:07.350
infection. Yeah. So simple. So based on the symptoms, it is

00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:15.650
going to do the return. Elif, T H R O A T throat in symptom.

00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:20.670
If user is going to say, or maybe. Maybe like a, if

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:26.700
user is saying cuff, c u g h cuff symptom,

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:33.630
then in that case, try to return it on what? So maybe you

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:40.030
have a respiratory infection. R E S P I R A T O R Y T O R Y

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:45.450
respiratory infection you have. Okay. Elif. If user is

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:51.730
saying that you have a headache, H E A D A C H E in symptom.

00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:57.730
symptom or maybe user is feeling dizzy symptom

00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:10.300
then do one thing so return nostrilogical or neurological

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:11.760
roll

00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:21.890
logical okay elif stomach

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:27.280
in symptom or

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:30.480
nausea in

00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:39.990
symptom then return basically

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:57.700
gastrointestinal symptom okay else try to return

00:46:03.590 --> 00:46:09.790
general examination is required so this is a very basic

00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:12.410
function again i have created and i'm not doing much over

00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:15.610
here as you can see so a simple function which is going to

00:46:15.610 --> 00:46:18.210
work on e-fails e-fails e-fails e-fails kind of things and

00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:20.970
it is going to return you some sort of a symptom now i have

00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:23.750
to convert this one into as a tool so that my agent will be

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:26.090
able to discover so i'm going to write it over here as a

00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:29.350
tools so now this entire function will become a tools and i

00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:32.050
can try to use it as a tools langchen tools right it will

00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:36.690
become a langchen tool by the way so again let me ping you

00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:38.170
this code so

00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:43.150
two tools we are able to create guys so one is basically a

00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:45.530
diagnosis tools and one is a symptom checker tool in a

00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:48.090
diagnosis tool i'm using llms in this one i'm not using llms

00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:52.570
if you would like to use the llms even over here do it not

00:46:52.570 --> 00:46:55.370
an issue even to find out the symptoms based on the user

00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:58.970
because llm will be more advanced and it will be able to you

00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:02.530
know understand the user input in a much much better way but

00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:05.830
yeah i'm not i'm just trying to show you the variations over

00:47:05.830 --> 00:47:08.970
here but you can you can feel free to use it and you can

00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:11.350
feel free to add more number of tools over here for

00:47:11.350 --> 00:47:14.470
diagnosis for our symptoms or maybe for anything else that

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:17.790
you want so making sense guys are we able to do it till this

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:23.390
point yeah so tool is done utility we have already created

00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:26.430
so these two things are done yeah

00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:45.880
done till this point so two things is closed our tools is

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:51.760
closed utility is closed utility is nothing but and tools is

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:56.280
nothing but like two tools two separate separate tools that

00:47:56.280 --> 00:48:02.660
we have created in this place okay now so we are going to

00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:05.600
create or we are going to write something into a diagnostic

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:09.500
graph diagnostic graph means so basically it is going to

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:13.160
like a use or it is going to basically create a separate

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:16.780
separate node so that it will be able to check the symptom

00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:19.300
term after checking the same term it will be able to do a

00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:22.300
diagnosis after doing a diagnosis it will be able to return

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:25.380
me something right it will be able to return me something

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:27.900
and eventually it is going to use the tools that i have

00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:31.420
already created so graph means what so we are going to

00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:36.060
create a multiple node you can see so one node we can try to

00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:40.220
create just for the symptom checker now this node is going

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:43.380
to give a response to this one and it is going to do a

00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:47.080
diagnostic based on this you will be able to get the output

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:50.160
right so this graph kind of a structure we are going to

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:54.720
create so here we will be using a symptom tool and here we

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:57.720
will be using basically a diagnostic tool so this is this is

00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:01.060
what i'm going to configure with the help of lang graph

00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:05.680
basically so lang chain is done i'm using lang chain just to

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:09.400
create a two tools so this is the use of lang chain i can

00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:11.680
even use it for creating an agent that's completely fine if

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:15.000
i have to create a single agent but yeah so i have to maybe

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.460
like a create a complete flow so maybe i'm going to use a

00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:22.080
lang graph over here i can try to use maybe a llama indexes

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:24.720
that is also fine we know that that we can try to call

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:27.880
multiple things over here we can even try to use a crew ai

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:32.220
in this particular place that is also going to work we can

00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:35.340
even try to use some sort of a ui based like a agent

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:39.400
creation tool or tools creation tool like a lang flow we can

00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:42.440
try to use so anything is completely fine at the end of the

00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:45.420
day you are going to achieve the exact same thing so here i

00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:45.580
have a complete flow so this is a complete flow and i'm have

00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:49.280
to create a diagnostic graph now to create a diagnostic

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:53.140
graph so what i am going to keep inside this one let's let's

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:57.980
do it one by one so here the very first thing that i'm going

00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:05.720
to call is a typing import type dictionary why i'll tell you

00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:13.160
then from lang graph lang graph dot graph graph so import

00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:16.860
basically a state graph which will help me how to create the

00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:22.000
graph and then end okay so lang graph import is done from

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:32.160
lang chain lang c-h-a-i-n chain a core dot runables so

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:35.360
import runables

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:41.900
and we have a runable lambda so call a runable lambda and

00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:44.300
then you have already created two tools right you have

00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:46.700
already created two tools inside the tool directory we have

00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:49.240
a two tools so diagnostic and symptom checker so let's call

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:54.260
that one so from a tools directory we have a diagnosis so

00:50:54.260 --> 00:51:00.570
import basically import what so import what is the function

00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:05.330
that we have created so import that function ai diagnosis

00:51:05.330 --> 00:51:09.850
and then check symptom okay so diagnosis tool ai diagnosis

00:51:09.850 --> 00:51:16.150
call it and then from tools dot so diagnosis tool import

00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:18.250
check oh

00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:26.810
i've imported again same thing symptom checker import import

00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:30.570
what so check symptom okay so all the imports are done over

00:51:30.570 --> 00:51:32.970
here so we are able to import a lang graph we are able to

00:51:32.970 --> 00:51:35.630
import a lang chain which will help me how to invoke my

00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:38.610
tools whatever tools that i've created and then typing which

00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:41.450
is going to help me out in terms of creating a dictionary so

00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:43.830
dictionary means so we have to align these things with the

00:51:43.830 --> 00:51:48.210
pidentic so pidentic library that is there to to pass a data

00:51:48.210 --> 00:51:54.350
so here uh which is required to build a graph basically so

00:51:54.350 --> 00:51:58.410
here we are going to create a pidentic like a class so

00:51:58.410 --> 00:52:07.750
diagnostic d i a g n o s t i c diagnostic state so now this

00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:10.330
is the class this is going to take a type dictionary as an

00:52:10.330 --> 00:52:14.110
input so at the end of the day it is going to accept input

00:52:14.110 --> 00:52:17.910
input as str I'm just trying to give a type and the input it

00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:23.510
is going to take symptom underscore a r e a str

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:30.960
so string it should be comma

00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:40.240
is not required in this pyrantic okay so input symptom area

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:41.420
d

00:52:44.170 --> 00:52:50.330
i a g n o s i s diagnosis again it's going to be str okay so

00:52:50.330 --> 00:52:53.610
these are the input I'm going to basically pass at the end

00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:55.930
of the day these are the input it is going to take and I've

00:52:55.930 --> 00:52:58.410
just like defined it in a pyrantic way because at the end of

00:52:58.410 --> 00:53:01.270
the day lang serve and lang graph requires this format of

00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:06.230
the input and then I can start creating a graph basically

00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:10.450
means I will start creating a node at the end of the day and

00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:16.750
graph needs this kind of inputs so here def and I can try to

00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:21.190
call a function called as build underscore gra ph build

00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:25.790
graph now this function is just going to build the entire

00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:29.870
end-to-end graphs simple so graph is equals to a state graph

00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:34.210
I'm going to call the import that I have done in a top and

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:37.510
then I'm going to say that that okay so basically I'm going

00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:40.370
to provide you input in this particular way to the graph and

00:53:41.650 --> 00:53:45.510
then what we are going to do is so we are going to create a

00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:50.010
node inside a graph and as I have already told you that we

00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:53.370
are going to create a two nodes so one is going to check the

00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:56.850
symptoms and one is going to basically do the diagnosis so a

00:53:56.850 --> 00:54:00.130
symptom node and then diagnosis mode we are going to create

00:54:00.130 --> 00:54:04.490
now to create these nodes a symptom node and a diagnosis

00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:08.850
mode so we have to define a function that what this node is

00:54:08.850 --> 00:54:12.450
going to technically do right so obviously these nodes are

00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:15.710
going to call my tools basically so whenever I'm going to

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:18.210
call symptoms so symptom tool it is going to call and

00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:20.590
whenever I'm going to call maybe a diagnosis it should call

00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:24.430
my diagnosis tool right so these graphs mode is supposed to

00:54:24.430 --> 00:54:27.250
call my symptom tool and the diagnosis tool okay let's do it

00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:31.690
then so here so I'm going to define the function so def and

00:54:31.690 --> 00:54:34.770
symptom step

00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:41.120
is a function and state I'm

00:54:45.050 --> 00:54:52.050
going to say and here so state I'm going to like a input and

00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:56.110
it is going to return R E T U R N return so what it is going

00:54:56.110 --> 00:55:00.030
to return by the way so it is going to return all three

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:03.450
things all three things it is supposed to return right so it

00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:06.970
is going to return basically a input let me copy the same

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:08.010
and

00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:16.660
just keep it as a key value pair okay

00:55:22.450 --> 00:55:24.890
so it is going to return three things so it is going to

00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:30.810
return input in symptom area and diagnosis now here state is

00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:38.070
nothing but input and then here I'm going to call my check

00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:44.990
symptoms and check symptoms dot invoke and invoke with what

00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:49.250
so invoke with this state input so whatever input that I'm

00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:52.730
giving as of now so based on that invoke it okay now

00:55:52.730 --> 00:56:05.110
diagnosis state dot get and then get me the diagnosis simple

00:56:05.110 --> 00:56:11.010
so this is basically one of the function so which is going

00:56:11.010 --> 00:56:13.450
to take the current state and based on that so it is going

00:56:13.450 --> 00:56:16.290
to basically give me all of these things so input symptom

00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:20.750
area and the diagnosis now this is just a function which I

00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:25.810
have created now I have to add this function into a graph

00:56:25.810 --> 00:56:29.150
node node means this node right the node that I'm trying to

00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:32.530
create I have to add this one into this particular node and

00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:35.810
this is already calling check symptom which is my tool

00:56:35.810 --> 00:56:38.530
eventually right check symptom is what thing check symptom

00:56:38.530 --> 00:56:42.350
is my technically a tool over there I have already written a

00:56:42.350 --> 00:56:45.990
code so it is going to call my tool this one is going to

00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:49.730
call my tool and I have to attach this one with a graph node

00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:53.170
this is the like a process that we are going to follow so

00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:58.310
how I will be able to attach this basically with my node so

00:56:58.310 --> 00:57:07.800
simple graph dot node graph dot node or graph dot add edge

00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:13.560
add underscore node yeah so graph dot add node so this is my

00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:16.340
graph this is my graph object basically this is my draft

00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:19.140
object so I am trying to add a node so when I'm trying to

00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:24.740
add a node so what I am trying to add over here so here node

00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:28.620
wise I can try to give a name over here so node wise the

00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:33.380
name of the node is going to be symptom check basically this

00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:36.980
is the name of the node and what this node will be holding

00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:40.260
so runable lambda this node will be holding the enable

00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:43.460
lambda so means this particular function this node will be

00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:47.820
holding symptom steps this is something that it will be

00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:52.560
holding so now I am able to create one node let me draw that

00:57:52.560 --> 00:58:00.560
once again so here I had a graph now I am able to add this

00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:06.840
symptom step symptom step as a first node and I have named

00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:10.400
that node as a name of this node is basically a symptom

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:16.740
check node symptom check node that's it this is the only

00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:21.080
thing that I'm trying to do now this symptom step so what it

00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:24.780
is trying to call so internally it is trying to call my tool

00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:28.640
this is my tool by the way so this graph node whenever this

00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:32.360
node will be executed eventually it is calling my tools

00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:35.220
whenever whenever you are going to invoke this one as we

00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:37.680
have written whenever we are going to invoke this one So it

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:41.200
will try to take the input, whatever input currently user

00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:46.000
has given and it is going to call ultimately a tool. So node

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:49.820
is technically calling my tool. Hope this is making sense to

00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:51.800
all of us. Yes guys, everyone.

00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:58.800
So one node we are able to create, someone is saying hello

00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:04.900
Danshu, hello. So one node we are able to create, right? One

00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:07.260
single node we are able to create, so which will be able to

00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:11.980
do a symptom check. Okay. Now we have to create another node

00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:15.380
and we have to bind it with a, like a, some other function

00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:18.660
over there and we have to call a tool inside it. So here

00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:22.380
what I will do is I'll try to create a diagnosis node or

00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:24.820
diagnosis function. I'll try to create and bind it with the

00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:29.080
diagnosis node. So likewise you can create hundreds of node

00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:31.940
now, right? Hundreds of node and we can try to bind it with

00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:34.420
any number of tools that you want that that's completely up

00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:40.780
to you. So here a diff diagnosis. D-I-A-G-N-O-S-I-S

00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:45.200
diagnosis underscore step. So this is the function I'm going

00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:48.580
to create for a node, which is going to execute in a current

00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:53.500
state. And then it is going to return me what? So it is R-E

00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:58.940
-T-U return. Return me what? By the way? Sorry. So return,

00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:02.380
return me what? By the way over here. So again, it is going

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:05.020
to return the input symptom area and diagnosis as per the

01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:07.980
pidentic alignment. So I'm just going to copy the same. I'll

01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:12.000
just change the. Internal one. So it is going to return what

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.320
it is going to return this one. Now it is going to take a

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:17.460
input from the current state, right? Current estate so that

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:21.540
you can do back and forth and then symptom area. So here it

01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:27.660
is going to like a symptom area. So here it is going to take

01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:34.200
not this one. So a state and whatever symptom area is

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:36.720
available because before this node, this will be executed.

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:40.040
So I will be having a symptom. By the way, right, I will be

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:42.480
having a symptom. So from the state, from the current

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:45.840
estate, from the current run, I am going to pass symptom

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:51.340
area. So I'm going to pass basically a symptom area over

01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:53.220
here. So whatever will be available in a current estate,

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:56.540
because before diagnosis, it is trying to check the symptom.

01:00:56.860 --> 01:01:00.960
And then at the time of diagnosis, I have, I'm going to call

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:04.580
my tool. So symptom estate is their input is there. So means

01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:07.060
user input is there and based on user input, whatever

01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:09.480
symptom has been observed, that is already there. So now I

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:13.640
can try to call my tool and a diagnosis, AI diagnosis,

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.520
invoke it and

01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:21.390
here state a

01:01:25.770 --> 01:01:28.630
state and it will try to take an input from the current

01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:33.950
estate basically. So this is the only changes because at the

01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:36.290
time of diagnosis, I have to run this one, run this tool at

01:01:36.290 --> 01:01:38.170
the time of symptom checker. I have to run this particular

01:01:38.170 --> 01:01:41.450
tool. Okay. And like a, both of this input is going even

01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:44.210
inside the diagnosis a step. Now, this is the function. I

01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:47.370
have defined for one of the other node, which will be

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:49.850
connected. So the node, which will come right after my

01:01:49.850 --> 01:01:52.350
symptom checker node. So I have just like a bind it. I have

01:01:52.350 --> 01:01:57.330
just connected it. Now in a graph, again, try to add node,

01:01:57.550 --> 01:02:00.850
again, try to add a node. This time I'm going to add this

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:04.570
node. So I'm going to like a name, this node AI diagnosis.

01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:11.070
This is the name. And whenever I'm going to execute this one

01:02:11.070 --> 01:02:13.930
or enable Lambda. So it is going to call which one it is

01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:17.510
going to call my diagnosis. A step function. And ultimately

01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:21.250
the diagnosis of function is calling my tool simple. So now

01:02:21.250 --> 01:02:26.110
successfully, I'm able to create over here, two nodes, a two

01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:29.470
independent node. You can say, right. As of now, two

01:02:29.470 --> 01:02:32.790
independent node, I'm going to create one is for a symptom

01:02:32.790 --> 01:02:36.410
and one is for a diagnosis. Two nodes has been created now.

01:02:36.730 --> 01:02:39.510
Now I have to connect this node. Even I have to say that

01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:43.170
which one will be invoked. When? Yeah. So in a graph, I have

01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:45.490
already added it. Now I have to like a, even say that, that,

01:02:45.490 --> 01:02:47.210
okay. So from where did it come from? Which sequence you are

01:02:47.210 --> 01:02:51.210
supposed to start yourself. Let's do it. So here, graph, add

01:02:51.210 --> 01:02:54.030
a node. I am in this way. I can try to add a number of node

01:02:54.030 --> 01:03:00.450
that I want. So here in a graph, graph, graph dot, there is

01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:03.250
something called a set entry point. I believe I've already

01:03:03.250 --> 01:03:07.030
used it, right? I've already used it. Even my previous, uh,

01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:10.810
execution when I was showing you the, uh, like a graph. So

01:03:10.810 --> 01:03:15.610
entry point is going to be what? So entry point is going to

01:03:15.610 --> 01:03:20.230
be my. This name name. So symptom check node, right? What is

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:22.930
the name of this node? So this is my entry point. So

01:03:22.930 --> 01:03:25.070
whenever you are going to start, start from my symptom

01:03:25.070 --> 01:03:27.230
checker first, you can try to start from diagnosis as well.

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:30.150
So depends upon your configuration that you are going to do.

01:03:30.330 --> 01:03:39.250
And then like a graph graph dot add edge. So we were adding

01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:42.370
node, right? You were adding node means we have created an

01:03:42.370 --> 01:03:45.390
independent node. Now we have to create even an edge. Edge

01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:48.650
means. So I'm going to start from here, right? I'm going to

01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:52.310
start from here. Now I'm going to create the edge. This is

01:03:52.310 --> 01:03:55.870
basically edge EDGE edge, right? So a starting point,

01:03:55.930 --> 01:04:00.310
starting point I have already defined. So this is going to

01:04:00.310 --> 01:04:02.550
my starting point. This node, I have already defined it

01:04:02.550 --> 01:04:06.090
here. Now I'm going to create a edge over here. So edge

01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:09.370
between which one? So this to this edge I have to create. So

01:04:09.370 --> 01:04:13.210
let me write it down that part. So edge I'm going to create

01:04:13.210 --> 01:04:17.030
between this one. So edge. I'm going to create between this

01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:23.790
name, this node. So this is the name of one node and my

01:04:23.790 --> 01:04:27.230
second node. So this is my second node, right? So I'm going

01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:30.330
to create an edge between these two nodes. So add edge. I'm

01:04:30.330 --> 01:04:32.430
adding it, right? So in this way, you will be able to get

01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:35.110
any kind of a complex graph, three kinds of things, whatever

01:04:35.110 --> 01:04:40.730
you want. You can try to create it right now. So again, so

01:04:40.730 --> 01:04:44.450
once you are able to create this edge. So it means I'm able

01:04:44.450 --> 01:04:47.810
to like. Build this particular bridge. Then it is going to

01:04:47.810 --> 01:04:51.630
give me the output, right? And this output should lead to

01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:53.790
the end, right? Endpoint that. Okay, fine. This is the end

01:04:53.790 --> 01:04:56.810
of this further. I don't have to do anything. So fine. I

01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:59.790
have to create even this edge and bind it to the end. Let's

01:04:59.790 --> 01:05:09.540
do it. So now here again, graph dot graph dot add edge. I

01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:13.100
have to create an edge between what? So edge between this

01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:20.240
last node. And then dot what? So dot end, right? So end is a

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:22.100
default parameter, which is available, which I have already

01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:24.540
done the import, as you can see from a line graph, right?

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:28.220
And I have already done the import. So end. So now my graph

01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:32.360
is binded and this entire graph is ready for me. This entire

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:36.160
graph is ready for me now. So once this entire graph is

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:40.120
ready for me, I have to return what from this function. So

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:41.800
everything I'm writing inside this function, build graph

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:45.100
function. So this build graph function is going to return.

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:48.920
Return what? So graph dot compile. So whenever you are going

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:51.360
to call it, it is going to compile it. And then it is going

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:54.560
to return you the graph. Is it making sense to all of us

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:57.860
guys? How we are able to like a build a different, different

01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:01.480
node inside, uh, like a land graph. And then how we are able

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:04.680
to bind it, how we are able to bind it with the tool that I

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:06.500
have created inside a language chain.

01:06:09.850 --> 01:06:15.590
Yes, everyone. Is it tough? I don't think that it's, it's

01:06:15.590 --> 01:06:19.830
tough. It's just like a writing a plain English. Right. It's

01:06:19.830 --> 01:06:21.930
just like a feel like a writing a literature by the way.

01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:29.270
Yeah. So those saying yes, Joey saying clear. Okay. What

01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:33.250
about other guys? So you, you're coming to a class just to

01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:35.310
watch a movies or like you are, you're trying to execute

01:06:35.310 --> 01:06:38.090
something because see, uh, it doesn't matter how much, how

01:06:38.090 --> 01:06:41.010
many things I'm going to teach you. Uh, unless and until you

01:06:41.010 --> 01:06:43.010
are not going to execute, unless you are not going to run,

01:06:43.090 --> 01:06:44.990
because when you will run, right, for sure, you will get an

01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:48.370
issue for sure. Right. Or should you are going to get an

01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:52.130
issue for sure. You have to fix it. And, uh, even I used to

01:06:52.130 --> 01:06:55.410
get a issue and just because of that, like, you know, I used

01:06:55.410 --> 01:06:58.090
to get a lot of issues. I used to fix it because of that. I

01:06:58.090 --> 01:07:00.290
can come, I can come inside the class and I can teach you

01:07:00.290 --> 01:07:03.490
because I know I can fix the issue. Uh, but yeah. So even

01:07:03.490 --> 01:07:07.510
you have to face the exact same thing on your end. Okay. Now

01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:09.750
many people are saying, yes, there'll be a Sanjay, Eric,

01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:17.250
Assis, Vijay, uh, Dave Kumar. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, uh, now

01:07:17.250 --> 01:07:19.790
what, what we are able to achieve so far. So we are. So we

01:07:19.790 --> 01:07:23.430
are able to basically create a tools tool is calling my LLMs

01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:26.770
right now we are able to create a graph. So graph, which is

01:07:26.770 --> 01:07:28.990
going to combine the node and which is going to build my

01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:32.890
entire use case. So technically graph is the one where it is

01:07:32.890 --> 01:07:35.570
going to connect my entire node. I can say like multiple

01:07:35.570 --> 01:07:40.330
agents I'm trying to connect together over there. Yeah. And

01:07:40.330 --> 01:07:47.190
now, now next is what now next is that to call this graph,

01:07:47.410 --> 01:07:51.670
to call this graph, basically, right. To call this entire

01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:55.310
graph that we have created to execute this entire graph that

01:07:55.310 --> 01:07:58.190
we have created. I can do it in a multiple way. So call this

01:07:58.190 --> 01:08:03.190
graph basically, and this graph will be calling each and

01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:05.810
everything, right? This graph will be calling each and

01:08:05.810 --> 01:08:10.170
everything, but I have to call it, right. I have to

01:08:10.170 --> 01:08:16.650
basically, uh, like, uh, call this entire things in such a

01:08:16.650 --> 01:08:22.050
way that, uh, you know, I will be able to convert this

01:08:22.050 --> 01:08:25.650
entire things as an API, right. I will be able to convert

01:08:25.650 --> 01:08:28.930
this entire agent and tool that I've created or the graph

01:08:28.930 --> 01:08:33.390
that I've created as an API. Yeah. Now that is a place where

01:08:33.390 --> 01:08:37.610
I will be using Lang serve. Basically Lang serve means are

01:08:37.610 --> 01:08:40.630
things by which you will be able to serve. You will be able

01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:44.050
to host, you will be able to expose something as an API,

01:08:44.230 --> 01:08:47.590
right? You will be able to expose something as an API. So

01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:51.510
that is something. Yeah. That I'm going to show you now that

01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:55.330
how, with the help of Lang serve, I will be able to call my

01:08:55.330 --> 01:08:59.670
graph by the way, right. I will be able to call my graph. I

01:08:59.670 --> 01:09:03.830
will be able to convert eventually everything as an API so

01:09:03.830 --> 01:09:07.130
that, uh, at a particular end point, right. At a particular

01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:11.830
URL, anyone can hit, and then anyone will be able to access

01:09:11.830 --> 01:09:14.390
this entire graph. That is something that I'm going to tell

01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:18.590
you now, and that code I will be writing inside main. Right.

01:09:18.970 --> 01:09:25.090
Main. So here I'm going to call fast API API to expose that

01:09:25.090 --> 01:09:34.710
as an API. So import, import fast F A S T API, import F A S

01:09:34.710 --> 01:09:42.770
T API. Okay. So fast API, all caps F A S T API. Okay. Now

01:09:42.770 --> 01:09:48.410
I'm going to call Lang serve over here. Lang S C R L A N G S

01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:55.010
C R V A N G. Lang serve. And then import, import what? So

01:09:55.010 --> 01:10:02.790
add underscore R O U T S add routes, R O U T S R O U T S add

01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:08.010
routes, routes. And then I'm going to import basically this

01:10:08.010 --> 01:10:09.930
diagnostic graph because this is something that I have to

01:10:09.930 --> 01:10:13.950
run, right? So diagnostic graph. And inside that we have a

01:10:13.950 --> 01:10:17.470
function build graph that we have created just now. So these

01:10:17.470 --> 01:10:20.370
are the import that I'm going to do. Now, with the help of

01:10:20.370 --> 01:10:24.130
Lang serve, I will be able to execute each and everything.

01:10:24.230 --> 01:10:27.370
Basically I will be able to convert everything as a route.

01:10:27.550 --> 01:10:30.850
Route means anyone can come and hit that particular route

01:10:30.850 --> 01:10:34.030
and they will be able to get the result as simple as that.

01:10:34.170 --> 01:10:39.290
Now here to do that, I have to create basically like a

01:10:39.290 --> 01:10:42.490
object of fast API. I have to create an object of basically

01:10:42.490 --> 01:10:45.690
this build graph as well. Both the objects is required. So

01:10:45.690 --> 01:10:48.910
one is a app object. App object is nothing. But this fast

01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:52.250
API. Okay. I'm going to call, and then I need basically a

01:10:52.250 --> 01:10:56.450
graph, G R A P H graph object, and which I will be able to

01:10:56.450 --> 01:11:01.030
create from the graph simple. And then I'm going to call add

01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:05.810
routes and here, so I'm going to pass app, uh, like a fast

01:11:05.810 --> 01:11:09.110
API app, just an instance I'm going to pass so that it will

01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:12.850
be able to convert it into as an app. And then I'm going to

01:11:12.850 --> 01:11:17.110
pass a graph. Eventually this route Lang serve route will be

01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:20.430
able to execute it when this will be able to be called. And

01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:23.950
then I'm going to give even a route. So which path anyone

01:11:23.950 --> 01:11:27.250
will be able to access my application. So I can give my own

01:11:27.250 --> 01:11:30.270
path over here. I can write any name. I can write S U D H

01:11:30.270 --> 01:11:35.010
that's completely fine. So I'm going to write D I A G N O S

01:11:35.010 --> 01:11:38.190
E, Diagnose. You can write even my name. That's fine. Right?

01:11:38.230 --> 01:11:40.970
This is my custom path. So at this path, what I'm trying to

01:11:40.970 --> 01:11:44.870
say is that, that at this path, at this particular path, you

01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:49.030
will be able to access this graph. Right? Now, what is that?

01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:52.430
This graph. So this is there inside this graph. So this

01:11:52.430 --> 01:11:56.210
graph is going to execute all of these things. It is going

01:11:56.210 --> 01:12:00.010
to take this kind of the nomenclature that we have defined.

01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:02.310
So this kind of an input, this graph is going to take,

01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:05.350
right? That's this is how like we have called this one. This

01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:07.530
is the kind of input this graph is going to take, and then

01:12:07.530 --> 01:12:09.610
it is going to perform each and everything. And then finally

01:12:09.610 --> 01:12:11.650
it is going to return, right? It is going to return

01:12:11.650 --> 01:12:14.750
something out of the graph. So this is what it means by the

01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:18.810
way. So this is, this will go inside your main.py file guys.

01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:24.450
This will go inside your main.py file. Yeah. Now. So now

01:12:24.450 --> 01:12:28.730
it's time to run this entire application. Now how I'm going

01:12:28.730 --> 01:12:33.070
to run this entire application. Let's try to understand it.

01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:37.170
So first of all, I have to go inside a lang serve backend as

01:12:37.170 --> 01:12:41.170
it's a fast API. So I'll try to use a uvcon. So lang serve

01:12:41.170 --> 01:12:43.990
backend. I'm already there. Yeah. Lang serve backend. I'm

01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:48.250
already here. Right? Now inside this, right? If I'll write

01:12:48.250 --> 01:12:52.810
dir. So I have this diagnostic graph, main, requirement

01:12:52.810 --> 01:12:56.430
.file, tools, utils, each and everything. I have to access

01:12:56.430 --> 01:13:00.270
my main file as an app, main file as an app, right? And then

01:13:00.270 --> 01:13:03.110
I have to execute it on some of the port number that I'm

01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:07.370
going to give. So CLS, and here I'm going to write uvcon as

01:13:07.370 --> 01:13:12.850
it's a fast API app. So uvcon, main I have to execute as an

01:13:12.850 --> 01:13:16.590
app, main file I have to execute as an app, and then hyphen

01:13:16.590 --> 01:13:21.210
hyphen, I can try to give host. So execute it at 0.0.0.0,

01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:25.330
right? And then I can give up port number. So port number is

01:13:25.330 --> 01:13:29.210
basically 8,000. I can try to give some other port. If this

01:13:29.210 --> 01:13:32.710
port will be busy, maybe 8,001, 8,002, 8,005, I can try to

01:13:32.710 --> 01:13:35.890
give. So this is something that you have to execute from

01:13:35.890 --> 01:13:38.410
where, from lang serve backend. So wherever you can see main

01:13:38.410 --> 01:13:41.790
file, right? Main file. Now, if I'm going to hit and if

01:13:41.790 --> 01:13:45.530
everything is going to work, then it's fine. Otherwise it is

01:13:45.530 --> 01:13:48.210
telling me that lang chain tool is not working. Not

01:13:48.210 --> 01:13:53.750
available. Okay. So maybe I have missed something. Are you

01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:55.030
able to do it guys till this point?

01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:16.450
Yeah. Till this point it's clear.

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:55.480
So let me check the library. This is the only place where it

01:14:55.480 --> 01:15:00.560
gives an issue most of the time. So it is giving me lang

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:05.320
serve diagnostic tool.py, lang serve diagnostic tool.py. So

01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:10.880
lang chain, it's a S by the way. So that's a mistake. Lang

01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:15.120
chain tool. Basically it's not a T double O L tool. So save

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:21.660
it. Now run again. Okay. So bingo. We are able to run it and

01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:28.640
my entire graph is live at this particular URL, right? And

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:33.260
then at this URL, I will be able to even check as a

01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:35.620
playground because this playground will be provided by your

01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:39.440
lang serve as you can see, right? The only mistake that I

01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:41.740
have made was in a diagnostic where it was giving me issues.

01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:44.660
It should not be tool. It should be S basically. So just

01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:48.560
correct that mistake. And now everything is live. My lang

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:52.280
serve is live guys, as you can see, right? In my local, by

01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:54.920
the way, as of now in my local, it's live, not in my global.

01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:57.800
I'll make it as a global as well, right? That's not a big

01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:02.500
deal. So it's live. Now I'll try to hit this URL and I'll

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:06.440
try to see that what is there at this URL. So there is

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:10.540
nothing at this URL. Okay, fine. Now I'll try to attach this

01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:13.680
diagnosis slash play. And hopefully you will be able to get

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:17.080
something. So at this URL, there is nothing. So diagnosis.

01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:20.440
So diagnosis is the route, which I have given. If you

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:21.740
remember, it's

01:16:28.530 --> 01:16:38.630
a 0.0.0, uh, okay. So local host, right? Let me change the

01:16:38.630 --> 01:16:48.490
port number here. Sorry. This one, 127.0.0.1. It's a local

01:16:48.490 --> 01:16:50.970
host, right? It's a local host. Even 0.0.0.0 should be a

01:16:50.970 --> 01:16:53.690
local host, but yeah, I don't know why it's giving me, not

01:16:53.690 --> 01:16:54.470
giving my application.

01:16:57.140 --> 01:17:00.880
So HTTPS and then, uh, not

01:17:04.910 --> 01:17:13.260
found. Okay. Slash slash 404. Okay. So I'm able to hit my,

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:18.940
uh, LAN serve by the way, and then playground. So it, it

01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:21.040
provides you a playground option by the way. So where you

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:23.920
can see each and everything. So this is my LAN serve

01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:27.100
playground guys. So by default. This is a diagnosis.

01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:31.160
Diagnosis is what diagnosis is technically my path, which I

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:33.800
have given. If you remember, this is my diagnosis. I can

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:36.740
give a name. My name is SUDH. It's going to work. So

01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:41.100
diagnosis. So basically it is reaching out to this URL. So

01:17:41.100 --> 01:17:43.340
which is a local host. Then it is reaching out to the port

01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:46.200
number, which is 8,000, which I have given. If your 8,000

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:48.600
port number is occupied at the runtime, you can try to

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:50.760
change your port number. You can try to make it 8,000, 1, 2,

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:53.660
5, or whatever you want. You can just try to make it, uh, we

01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:57.240
don't have any kind of issue. And, uh, once it is able to

01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:01.160
reach out to my system with this one, now it is reaching out

01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:04.500
to this URL, by the way, diagnosis URL, which I have given

01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:07.920
at this URL, I have a graph and my app up and running with

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:10.840
the help of lab app, my graph up and running. So this is

01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:14.480
something that you will be able to like, uh, find out here.

01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:18.880
Are you able to get it guys? And then at the diagnosis slash

01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:22.100
playground. So playground is something which by default LAN

01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:27.600
serve provides you, right? So where you will be able to give

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:30.640
your input. Now how this, these things are coming by the

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:32.780
way, right? How these things are coming. So basically this

01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:36.020
is coming from the class that I have created, right? So when

01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:39.200
I have like a created this graph, so if you remember, so

01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:42.300
this is the class and I was looking for input symptom area

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:44.880
and diagnostic. So this is the input that I have mentioned

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:48.140
in a pidentic way. And because of that, so it is giving me

01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:50.660
these three fields that there is nothing different, right?

01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:52.780
Input symptom area, same thing. You will be able to find

01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:56.500
out, right? Same thing. Uh, you will be able to find out and

01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:58.020
uh, yeah, so

01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:03.600
are you, are you able to get it guys? Are you able to see

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:03.820
it?

01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:32.660
Yeah. Executed. Are you able to see the langs of playground?

01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:35.840
Now this is basically your backend. You don't have a UI by

01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:38.420
the way, this UI that you are able to see. So don't get

01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:41.340
confused. This is not a UI that you have created. This is a

01:19:41.340 --> 01:19:44.220
default one, which langs of provides you based on the input

01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:46.340
that you are going to give that. Okay, fine. So give this

01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:48.700
input and they'll see what, what I'm going to do it. Right?

01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:51.680
So this is a UI. Uh, basically, uh, will be provided by, uh,

01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:54.740
a playground. Okay. So till this point, this is my URL. This

01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:56.960
is my URL. This is my API by the way. Diagnosis. Only till

01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:00.180
diagnosis. Playground is coming by default from a langs of

01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:02.660
site itself for a testing purpose, basically. That's the

01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:05.920
reason. So it's named, name it as a playground. So I am

01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:13.140
going to mention that I have a fever and body, body ache. So

01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:17.500
this is something which I'm going to give over here. Uh,

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:22.540
symptom area, nothing diagnosis, nothing. Now let me hit it.

01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:28.720
Right? So here, as you can see, so symptom check, right?

01:20:28.940 --> 01:20:31.400
Symptom check. It is trying to perform in a very first

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:34.260
place. I believe symptom check is a graph note that we have

01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:38.340
given. So when I'm saying I have a fever and body ache, so

01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:42.220
it is trying to tell me symptom area is infection. So I've

01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:45.160
just given, I have a fever and a body ache. So it is trying

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:48.940
to call my very first node by the way. Yeah. A very first

01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:51.560
node. It is trying to call and then fever and body ache.

01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:52.660
Now, what is the logic? What is the logic that we have

01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:55.500
written? What is the logic that we have written for a

01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:59.620
symptom checker? So if there is a body ache, right, if there

01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:02.700
is a body ache, not give me what return me infection. Yes,

01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:06.220
it is able to do it from one of the graph, right? It is able

01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:10.760
to perform that part. So symptom and a body ache now,

01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:16.560
now. So here I'm

01:21:19.530 --> 01:21:23.030
going to click on a, like a start once again.

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:35.620
So it should call me a diagnosis. Diagnosis step, which it

01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:38.400
is not calling start

01:21:57.020 --> 01:22:03.520
and let me check. What is the issue? So diagnosis.ai

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:07.360
diagnosis invoke fine. It is trying to invoke this one, but

01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:12.060
while invoking, so self run tool input. Okay. Run raise

01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:16.380
error. Okay. And then run this one. Then in this structure

01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:20.660
.py in line number 93. Medical project. Okay. Medical

01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:24.680
project. Diagnosis. So it is trying to call this one and

01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:31.440
return JSON or return response JSON choice fine. So it is

01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:41.730
returning me a wrong input. It seems okay. So

01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:47.380
that's a issue. We'll fix it.

01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:18.320
Let me give a wrong input, right? So input is equals to this

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:18.980
start.

01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:05.220
Hmm. Now there is a format stake and

01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:12.610
put a diagnosis is null.

01:24:17.450 --> 01:24:18.030
It

01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:39.360
is able to call one of my tool, which is correct. So

01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:42.720
infection tool it is able to call now after infection tool.

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:47.660
So it should call my diagnosis tool by the way. So let me

01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:54.880
check after this infection input fine. It is able to parse

01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:59.920
it. In this way as a list of the strings. So fine based on

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:04.580
that infection, it is able to call it is so partially it is

01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:14.040
correct as of now and nothing, nothing. So here input, I

01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:18.360
have a fever symptom area.

01:25:21.290 --> 01:25:24.590
I should not pass a symptom area over here. Right? Have

01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:45.380
a fever. That's fine. That's fine. Symptom area diagnosis.

01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:46.780
Okay.

01:25:49.430 --> 01:25:55.110
And, uh, what is the issue once again? So 200 hit, okay, 200

01:25:55.110 --> 01:25:57.290
hit diagnosis. Expansion

01:26:02.250 --> 01:26:05.170
choice, content error choice, post

01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:29.030
diagnosis. It was able to call error was basically line four

01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:33.330
zero three. Then ignore exceptions

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:41.660
and receive sender. Fine. Handle. As

01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:48.860
group once of exception. We

01:27:28.060 --> 01:27:30.400
enter this entire things are

01:27:35.130 --> 01:27:40.040
intermediate step diagnosis model that

01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:51.100
is giving me this error. Yes.

01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:09.480
So diagnosis messages

01:28:19.140 --> 01:28:22.040
is equals to message.

01:28:42.450 --> 01:28:46.730
Yeah, this is what I'm looking for. So there is a error with

01:28:46.730 --> 01:28:51.890
this one somewhere. Symptom description find. So message.

01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:56.190
I'm trying to pass. In a correct order. So URI is going to

01:28:56.190 --> 01:28:58.910
take a messages. Now this is the message symptom

01:28:58.910 --> 01:28:59.610
description.

01:29:02.630 --> 01:29:07.470
Okay. So symptom description, it is going to take.

01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:10.280
So

01:29:24.390 --> 01:29:31.430
there is no such correction. It was just like before and,

01:29:33.550 --> 01:29:39.290
uh, URI chat completion is returning me response choice. She

01:29:39.290 --> 01:29:43.650
wrote message and then content. Okay. So it is returning me

01:29:43.650 --> 01:29:44.750
just

01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:52.540
on data choice. Zero message content. Yeah, that's fine. Oh,

01:29:52.540 --> 01:29:58.640
let me check now. Once again, it's a minor issue guys. So

01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:05.120
anyhow, we'll be able to fix it. Okay. So now it's running

01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:07.280
once again, let me check.

01:30:11.050 --> 01:30:13.130
So input, I

01:30:17.130 --> 01:30:20.690
have a fever. Let's keep it blank. Let's keep it blank.

01:30:20.730 --> 01:30:23.810
Start. Infection. No,

01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:29.420
still getting this issue.

01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:47.010
E error choice. Why it is giving me again, this choice,

01:30:49.570 --> 01:30:55.210
it's a correct one, by the way. I don't think that because

01:30:57.580 --> 01:31:02.300
I've been using this multiple times API URI alpha chat

01:31:02.300 --> 01:31:05.740
completion. Okay.

01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:17.880
Because this format of the output is a completely correct.

01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:23.330
Even URI alpha. Then chat completion.

01:31:26.890 --> 01:31:32.070
Okay. Got the issue guys. This was the issue. So here base

01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:35.610
URL wise, I have mentioned this URL. And again, I have

01:31:35.610 --> 01:31:37.790
mentioned over here. This was the issue. That's the reason.

01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:41.110
So it was giving me the wrong. This one. Okay. Remove it

01:31:41.110 --> 01:31:42.270
from here. Alpha.

01:31:44.980 --> 01:31:50.080
Hmm. Terminated. Got the issue. Got the actual issue. CLS.

01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:55.860
And now run again. So backend up and running. Now is it

01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:59.520
coming? Let's try to execute and then try to give my input.

01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:03.360
I'll just try to keep it as a blank. I'll try to keep it.

01:32:03.380 --> 01:32:07.640
This is a blank. Now it's running. See now it's running.

01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:11.820
Yeah. So now it is able to give me a diagnosis. Okay. I have

01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:14.600
given too many things. Let me remove this part. I'll just

01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:19.600
get, I to give the input over here. Nothing much. So I have

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:27.100
like a fever and cough. Okay. Now start. So now it is

01:32:27.100 --> 01:32:31.320
starting and now it is trying to invoke and see. So it is

01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:34.620
able to check the symptoms, which is like a infection. First

01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:38.200
of all, a diagnosis was zero. There is no diagnosis at this

01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:42.000
point of a time. And then, uh, this one, this two one is

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.820
going into the second one, which is AI diagnosis, right? AI

01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:47.660
diagnosis node. So this is one of my node name, and this is

01:32:47.660 --> 01:32:50.500
another node name is going here. And diagnosis was, I'm

01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:52.580
sorry to hear you are experiencing the symptom fever and

01:32:52.580 --> 01:32:55.780
cough can be caused by variety of condition. Ranging from a

01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:59.180
mild to a more serious, here are some possible diagnosis and

01:32:59.180 --> 01:33:02.620
recommended a step possible diagnosis, common cold. So it

01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:05.040
has, it has given me the complete diagnosis as you can see.

01:33:05.300 --> 01:33:08.440
Right. And, uh, here, so intermediate a step wise, it is

01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:11.460
showing you will be able to see that what has been done in

01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:13.900
an intermediate. So first of all, it has executed this, uh,

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.500
node basically, then it has included this one. Then it has

01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:20.900
included this one. Yeah. So this is how this entire things

01:33:20.900 --> 01:33:23.180
has been done. So what has happened in diagnosis? Step. And

01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:26.280
then what has happened in, uh, again, diagnosis step over

01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:28.680
here, everything, everything you will be able to find out

01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:32.660
and, uh, yeah. So now everything is green 200. So

01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:36.860
successfully we are able to create a backend and, uh, now

01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:39.920
anyone can call this URL, not playground, basically

01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:42.380
playground is just for testing purpose, right? They're going

01:33:42.380 --> 01:33:45.220
to just for testing purpose. Now anyone can call this URL by

01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:49.880
the way, and anyone will be able to, you know, consume my

01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:53.580
entire application. Anyone can try to pass this input,

01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:56.900
right? So whatever symptom that user have, so anyone can

01:33:56.900 --> 01:34:00.080
pass it and they will be able to get up complete in depth,

01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:03.780
in detail analysis in a formatted way here, we are not able

01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:05.860
to see in a formatted way. We'll, we'll try to create a UI

01:34:05.860 --> 01:34:08.800
where we can see everything in a formatted way. Making

01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:09.300
sense. Guys.

01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:16.400
Mohit is asking this project is AI agent or agentic AI.

01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:25.240
Uh, Mohit. Yeah. Yeah. So first try to focus in a class

01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:30.660
second, join all the classes with your open eyes. Don't try

01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:34.540
to sleep in between the class. If you are going to ask me

01:34:34.540 --> 01:34:36.920
this kind of a question, I'm not able to understand that

01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:39.680
whether I should answer or whether I should not write, we

01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:43.300
are almost on a verge of completing the entire batch by the

01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:43.540
way.

01:34:47.090 --> 01:34:52.990
Okay. Fine. Uh, okay. So my backend is running. My backend

01:34:52.990 --> 01:34:55.870
server is up and running by the way. So Mohit, I don't think

01:34:55.870 --> 01:34:56.890
that you have executed. Even I don't think that you have

01:34:56.890 --> 01:34:58.770
executed. A single thing that I've taught you in a past,

01:34:58.950 --> 01:35:03.330
right? Because from your like comments, I can get the sense

01:35:03.330 --> 01:35:08.130
of it. And I don't think that it's a, uh, like, uh, it's

01:35:08.130 --> 01:35:11.650
going in a good way, but yeah, I don't want to say anything.

01:35:11.770 --> 01:35:17.390
It's fine. Your wish. Okay. So Lang, the lines of backend,

01:35:17.470 --> 01:35:20.770
we are able to create. Now let's go and create a, like a UI

01:35:20.770 --> 01:35:23.310
by the way. Right. A simple UI we are going to create. So

01:35:23.310 --> 01:35:25.870
where it is going to take the input and then it is going to

01:35:25.870 --> 01:35:29.890
give me the output. So I have already created the input. So

01:35:29.890 --> 01:35:35.190
let me call this app without PI basic, a stimulant app,

01:35:35.350 --> 01:35:40.350
which is going to give you a interface. So see what we are

01:35:40.350 --> 01:35:43.390
doing. Nothing. So here we are trying to list, ask you to

01:35:43.390 --> 01:35:46.350
describe your symptom, right? And once you are going to

01:35:46.350 --> 01:35:50.190
describe your symptom, basically, so input the symptom area

01:35:50.190 --> 01:35:52.550
and diagnosis symptom area is going to be blank diagnosis is

01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:54.870
going to be blank. Just we are trying to give an input as a

01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:58.010
symptom. So this is the data that we are trying to. To

01:35:58.010 --> 01:36:00.230
prepare, right? This is the data that we are trying to

01:36:00.230 --> 01:36:03.890
prepare. And then this data, this data, basically whatever

01:36:03.890 --> 01:36:06.710
input that you have given, whatever input, whatever, like a

01:36:06.710 --> 01:36:10.050
lengthy text that you have written. So it will come over

01:36:10.050 --> 01:36:13.910
here and then it is going to hit my API. So localhost 8,000

01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:16.850
diagnosis diagnosis is a place. So where everything is

01:36:16.850 --> 01:36:19.990
available invoke. So by this, it will be able to invoke

01:36:19.990 --> 01:36:23.530
whatever is available at a diagnosis. And then I'm trying to

01:36:23.530 --> 01:36:26.470
give a JSON input. This is the only things that we are

01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:28.690
trying to do with respect to API. API testing. That's it.

01:36:28.870 --> 01:36:31.430
Nothing much guys. Right? That's the only thing. So this is

01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:34.370
my API, by the way. This is my API call, right? This is my

01:36:34.370 --> 01:36:38.970
API call, right? So leave your up, leave your server up and

01:36:38.970 --> 01:36:41.470
running. If you are going to close the server, so it is not

01:36:41.470 --> 01:36:43.790
going to work. So what you can do is you can try to create

01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:45.810
another terminal over here, leave your server up and

01:36:45.810 --> 01:36:53.010
running. And then maybe I can try to like change my, yeah,

01:36:53.130 --> 01:36:57.870
so medi diagnosis, DIA, this is my environment. Okay. So

01:36:57.870 --> 01:37:03.210
medi DIA, Conda activate medi

01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:15.680
DIA, sorry, DIA, Conda ACTIVAT,

01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:18.420
activate medi DIA. What happened?

01:37:27.650 --> 01:37:34.350
Not able to recognize why? Okay. COD I have written, C-O-N-D

01:37:34.350 --> 01:37:39.210
-A, yeah. So fine. Activate this environment and then we are

01:37:39.210 --> 01:37:42.290
going to execute my like a stream lint, by the way. This is

01:37:42.290 --> 01:37:45.090
my UI and this UI is not doing anything much. So whatever

01:37:45.090 --> 01:37:47.770
response it will give it to you, it is trying to show it to

01:37:47.770 --> 01:37:51.070
you. So this is the only three line of a code. So this is

01:37:51.070 --> 01:37:54.270
for input formatting. The way I have configured the input in

01:37:54.270 --> 01:37:58.730
my pidentic class, and this is just for calling the API. It

01:37:58.730 --> 01:38:00.810
is going to give you the response. I'm going to show you the

01:38:00.810 --> 01:38:05.450
response. Now let's execute this stream lint. So here DIR

01:38:05.450 --> 01:38:10.190
and CDI medical, I'll go inside this folder. Then again,

01:38:10.270 --> 01:38:15.070
DIR. I'll go inside the stream lint UI and now I'm going to

01:38:15.070 --> 01:38:20.650
call S-T-R-E-M-L-I-T, stream lint run, run what? So run app

01:38:20.650 --> 01:38:25.930
.py file. And yeah, it's running AI medical diagnostic

01:38:25.930 --> 01:38:32.870
assistance. So I am not feeling good. I have, I have some

01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:38.550
fever. I have given that get diagnosis. So it is going to

01:38:38.550 --> 01:38:41.630
call my get diagnosis. And if there is no, nothing wrong. So

01:38:41.630 --> 01:38:45.450
yeah, so now see it is going to give you the entire things

01:38:45.450 --> 01:38:49.850
into a complete formatted way. So input is I'm not feeling

01:38:49.850 --> 01:38:53.390
well, symptom area infection diagnosis. It is able to like

01:38:53.390 --> 01:38:56.170
give you viral infection, bacterial infection, other

01:38:56.170 --> 01:38:58.810
illness, inflammatory infection, steps that you should take.

01:38:58.930 --> 01:39:03.110
So monitor your symptom, rest and hydrate over the counter

01:39:03.110 --> 01:39:06.350
readiness, seek the medical attention. So in a detail,

01:39:06.430 --> 01:39:08.990
whatever prompt that you have given. So it is going to give

01:39:08.990 --> 01:39:10.950
you each and every one. Everything. Yeah. It is giving,

01:39:10.970 --> 01:39:14.330
going to give you everything. This, this is, this is all,

01:39:14.350 --> 01:39:16.410
this is already, I'm able to get it. So I just have to

01:39:16.410 --> 01:39:19.830
change my little bit of code. So this is the raw output that

01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:25.110
you are able to get it guys. Is it making sense? Yeah. So

01:39:25.110 --> 01:39:28.070
I'm not doing anything much. So once my backend is ready, so

01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:31.250
my front end will never give me a pain because I just have

01:39:31.250 --> 01:39:34.530
to call the APIs. Now when I'm going to deploy it, right?

01:39:34.590 --> 01:39:36.710
When I'm going to deploy my backend, for example, if I'm

01:39:36.710 --> 01:39:39.250
going to deploy my backend, what I will do is I'll just

01:39:39.250 --> 01:39:42.470
change this API endpoint. So instead of this local host,

01:39:42.570 --> 01:39:46.690
I'll try to give my server API. So this is the only changes

01:39:46.690 --> 01:39:48.910
which I'm going to make apart from that, there is no changes

01:39:48.910 --> 01:39:52.770
which is required, uh, to like, uh, consume this one. So now

01:39:52.770 --> 01:39:56.750
what I will do is that I will try to deploy my backend

01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:59.330
first, right? I'll try to deploy my backend first

01:39:59.330 --> 01:40:02.390
separately, as I have discussed in a beginning of the class

01:40:02.390 --> 01:40:08.530
itself. So I'll try to deploy a backend now. So. Okay. Okay.

01:40:08.590 --> 01:40:11.670
So now I'll try to test a backend deployed backend URL

01:40:11.670 --> 01:40:15.490
deployed backend API from my local. And then eventually I'll

01:40:15.490 --> 01:40:18.670
try to deploy even my front end. So shall we go ahead guys

01:40:18.670 --> 01:40:19.950
for a deployment?

01:40:22.660 --> 01:40:23.840
Yeah. Shall we go ahead?

01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:37.900
Okay. Jitendra is asking one very good question. The project

01:40:37.900 --> 01:40:40.700
is really great creating from a scratch, but one layman

01:40:40.700 --> 01:40:44.180
question, if a user can give a symptom in a chat GPT and get

01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:47.860
a detailed answer, obviously see, uh, you will be able to

01:40:47.860 --> 01:40:50.540
give an input into a chat GPT. But here, I'm not trying to

01:40:50.540 --> 01:40:54.420
teach you that. What is, what can be done with a chat GPT or

01:40:54.420 --> 01:40:56.980
what can't be done with a chat GPT here? What I'm trying to

01:40:56.980 --> 01:41:01.120
teach you is that, that how you can create your own custom

01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:05.500
agent, how you can try to call your own custom tool, how you

01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:08.500
can connect each and everything, how you can try to even

01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:12.260
host it. So that going forward, let's suppose there is a

01:41:12.260 --> 01:41:15.000
document which is available inside your folder, or maybe on

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:18.960
a S3 or maybe in a blob. Right? Now you would like to read

01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:21.260
that document. So there is one tool, which is a reading

01:41:21.260 --> 01:41:23.600
those document. There is another tool, which is summarizing

01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:26.200
the document. There is another tool, which is going to even

01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:29.840
eventually like a, trying to generate a report out of it. So

01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:33.780
there can be a infinite number of tasks. You can say that

01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:36.760
we, as a human, we would like to perform and where we would

01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:39.400
like to like, uh, you know, involve a tooling, involve

01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:43.000
agents and involve our LLMs together. Obviously for this

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:46.160
question, your chat GPT is going to give the answer, but if

01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:49.060
I'm going to change the scenario that let's suppose, uh, my

01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:53.320
entire things is available, my symptom, my health report,

01:41:53.700 --> 01:41:56.300
right? Let's suppose my health here, I'm trying to enter the

01:41:56.300 --> 01:41:59.300
symptom. I agree. Right? So I'm trying to enter the symptom,

01:41:59.460 --> 01:42:02.520
but let's suppose my entire health report is available in a

01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:06.480
S3 bucket, right? Or in my local system, or maybe it's

01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:09.040
available on a blob storage or maybe into some databases.

01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:13.200
Right? Will your chat GPT will be able to give an answer?

01:42:15.130 --> 01:42:16.430
Guys? Yes or no?

01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:22.380
You, you, you are not entering anything from here. You're

01:42:22.380 --> 01:42:24.620
not entering anything from here. Now you want a detailed

01:42:24.620 --> 01:42:27.260
response. You want a detailed diagnosis, just like a doctor,

01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:29.140
right? And everything is available, not in your system,

01:42:29.220 --> 01:42:32.380
maybe on a S3 bucket, maybe into some databases, right? So

01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:37.740
will you be able to like use just a chat GPT by prompting it

01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:41.040
and then say that, okay, fine. Like, uh, just give me the

01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:45.920
analysis. No. Inside a chat GPT, you have to call MCP tools.

01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:48.540
There is an MCP tool provision, which is available for us.

01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:53.100
Now, uh, or else you can try to create an agent. Now that

01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:57.520
agent is going to call the tools. Yeah. So what is the

01:42:57.520 --> 01:42:59.400
meaning of this agent? Agent is trying to perform some

01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:01.700
specific tasks, only a specific task, right? What is a tool

01:43:01.700 --> 01:43:04.780
again? A more specific one, the worker one, right? So it is

01:43:04.780 --> 01:43:07.320
trying to perform on a specific task. So there are millions

01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:10.540
of specific tasks that you will be able to find out in your

01:43:10.540 --> 01:43:14.080
day to day as well as inside the industry. Yeah. So we are

01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:16.680
not learning that what can't be done with a chat GPT because

01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:18.640
that, that is all something. That is something that we

01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:21.960
already know. Right. We're trying to learn that how we can

01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:25.600
try to customize it so that any number of tools which

01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:28.600
available in an entire universe, maybe my Gmail, maybe my

01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:31.320
WhatsApp, maybe my telegram, right? Maybe my, like a

01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:33.920
storage, maybe my, some other different kind of API, maybe

01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:36.800
my, my analytics dashboard. I will be able to access

01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:39.360
everything altogether sequentially. I will be able to

01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:42.460
attach. And then one after another AI will be able to take a

01:43:42.460 --> 01:43:43.920
decision and execute the task.

01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:51.180
Yeah. So that, that was a whole idea. That was a whole idea

01:43:51.180 --> 01:43:53.960
behind teaching you, or that is the whole idea behind even

01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:57.040
learning generative AI. Right. And inside generative AI. So

01:43:57.040 --> 01:44:01.020
learning agentic AI, or you can say a tool calling or all of

01:44:01.020 --> 01:44:03.800
this framework, whether it's a Lang chain or maybe a Lama

01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:08.120
indexes, maybe a Lang serve, maybe a Lang flow, maybe like a

01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:10.100
crew AI or maybe N8N.

01:44:12.770 --> 01:44:15.510
Yeah. And after some time, believe me, after execution

01:44:15.510 --> 01:44:18.250
couple of code, you will be able to find out that now give

01:44:18.250 --> 01:44:22.310
me any framework. I'll do it. Because the core framework.

01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:25.150
The core philosophy of most of the framework is exactly

01:44:25.150 --> 01:44:28.150
same. They have just created their own API because obviously

01:44:28.150 --> 01:44:30.030
they have to run the business, right? It's just a business.

01:44:30.190 --> 01:44:34.250
So, but yeah, someone is giving you some, just like a, some

01:44:34.250 --> 01:44:38.010
advantage. Someone is not. And tomorrow, even like that will

01:44:38.010 --> 01:44:41.150
be available in the, the other one, this is how this

01:44:41.150 --> 01:44:43.590
industry is growing. And every day we are able to heard

01:44:43.590 --> 01:44:49.590
about a new, new things basically. Yeah. Okay. So this is

01:44:49.590 --> 01:44:52.250
done. Now, what I can do is that. Yeah. So I'll try to,

01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:55.870
first of all, like a host, my backend, right? I'll try to

01:44:55.870 --> 01:44:59.050
push my backend and then I'll try to test it from my local.

01:44:59.170 --> 01:45:01.270
And even you guys will be able to test it from the local

01:45:01.270 --> 01:45:04.190
now. So the platform, which I'm going to use for a

01:45:04.190 --> 01:45:10.320
deployment is going to be a render platform. So hope all of

01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:12.220
you are enjoying guys, all of you are able to learn

01:45:12.220 --> 01:45:14.500
something in a real time. And I don't think that anyone will

01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:19.640
have a problem with respect to a agent or something. Yep. So

01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:23.480
just go to Google and try to search. If you search for

01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:25.840
render, I believe I have already used render platform in

01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:30.520
your class as well. So render just login, login with the

01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:34.280
Google sign in a simple one step. So render is basically a

01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:37.280
platform which is giving you a free, like a hosting

01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:40.600
solution. You can try to use Azure or AWS as well. I'll try

01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:43.340
to show you that part as well, that how you can try to host

01:45:43.340 --> 01:45:45.640
it. But yeah, even inside the render, you can try to make it

01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:49.160
scalable. If you are going with the paid one in a free one,

01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:52.400
they're not giving you that option by the way. Yeah. So here

01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:56.680
I have to deploy that on a render cloud platform. Now to

01:45:56.680 --> 01:45:59.780
deploy that, I have to keep my code inside a GitHub or I

01:45:59.780 --> 01:46:03.660
have to convert everything into my, into, into a Docker

01:46:03.660 --> 01:46:05.600
file, basically I have to convert everything into a Docker

01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:08.280
version of it. So what I will do is I'll try to push my

01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:13.400
code, right? I'll try to push my complete code inside a

01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:16.820
GitHub repository in a very first place. Yep. Inside a

01:46:16.820 --> 01:46:21.180
GitHub repository. So let's do it. So here. Yeah. So I can

01:46:21.180 --> 01:46:24.380
try to create two separate repository, one for front end,

01:46:24.420 --> 01:46:27.380
one for backend, or maybe I can try to create one

01:46:27.380 --> 01:46:30.300
repository, but two directory structure I can try to

01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:32.320
maintain the way I'm maintaining in my local. So either way,

01:46:32.380 --> 01:46:35.260
it's completely fine. I will be able to recognize it at the

01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:37.200
time of deployment. So let's see how we can deploy

01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:40.520
separately a front end and separately a backend. So

01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:44.320
repository, and I'm going to create a new repository over

01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:50.880
here, Medidiag, Medidiagnosis, Medidiag. Something like

01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:54.460
that. Create repository. So create it with your own name,

01:46:54.580 --> 01:47:03.300
and then let's start pushing up code. So here, let me open

01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:09.200
up a new command prompt. So dir, now cd ai-medical, okay,

01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:13.960
dir. So okay, front end, backend, the both are available. So

01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:17.400
I'll try to push both of this, right? In a later stage, if I

01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:21.360
have to update it, I'll update it. So here, git init, git

01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:24.740
init, initialize it. Git init. Now, as you can see, color

01:47:24.740 --> 01:47:29.440
has changed. So git init, and then I can write git add, add

01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:31.920
everything. So git add dot. That's the reason I have written

01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:36.220
git add. Now after that, so commit, basically. So git

01:47:36.220 --> 01:47:41.400
commit, or message. So git c-o-m-m-i-t, and then message. So

01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:49.780
message, message, my first agent

01:47:52.060 --> 01:47:57.400
deploy, okay. So these are the file. It is able to check in,

01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:01.340
and then once after that, so git branch main, it's a very,

01:48:01.420 --> 01:48:04.600
like a baby step that we are taking. So git is already

01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:09.020
providing you all those steps. Now git remote, done. Git

01:48:09.020 --> 01:48:14.380
push origin main, okay, done. So this is the only step, and

01:48:14.380 --> 01:48:16.420
anyhow, whenever you are going to create the repository, it

01:48:16.420 --> 01:48:19.140
is going to give you all the steps, as simple as that. Now

01:48:19.140 --> 01:48:22.320
refresh it, refresh your git, and now all these files are

01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:24.500
available. So langs of backend I have created, it's

01:48:24.500 --> 01:48:28.760
available over here, as you can see. And lang, streamlint

01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:31.200
ui, so this is the frontend which I have created, so it's

01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:35.340
available. Requirement.txt, it's blank, right. Okay let me

01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:37.960
keep something inside there. Streamlit is the only thing

01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:43.160
which I have to keep, or maybe I can, okay, leave it. Commit

01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:45.360
changes, commit, okay.

01:48:47.540 --> 01:48:50.340
So here, langs of backend, so first of all, I'll try to

01:48:50.340 --> 01:48:52.780
deploy the backend. So how I'm going to deploy the backend,

01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:55.160
let's try to understand that part. So all these things have

01:48:55.160 --> 01:48:57.900
been pushed. Are you able to push your code into a git hub?

01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:00.900
Git hub guys, it's just a two minute of job, yeah,

01:49:05.790 --> 01:49:11.710
are you able to like push it inside your git hub, everyone,

01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:12.950
okay.

01:49:22.250 --> 01:49:25.690
So once you are able to push it, come to render, now click

01:49:25.690 --> 01:49:29.570
on new, click on web services, yeah, click on new, click on

01:49:29.570 --> 01:49:32.650
web services. Now so here, if you are doing it for the very

01:49:32.650 --> 01:49:34.950
first time, so it is going to ask you to connect basically.

01:49:35.130 --> 01:49:37.330
So connect to the git hub and it is asking you for the

01:49:37.330 --> 01:49:39.570
authorization, so you can try to provide the authorization,

01:49:39.790 --> 01:49:43.090
user ID and password, and then you will be able to connect

01:49:43.090 --> 01:49:45.350
with your git hub. You can try to connect with a git lab as

01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:47.310
well, you can try to connect with a bit bucket. So these are

01:49:47.310 --> 01:49:50.650
basically a git, they try to provide you a version

01:49:50.650 --> 01:49:52.710
management with respect to a code, whether it's a git lab,

01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:55.390
whether it's a bit bucket, you can use any of these, that's

01:49:55.390 --> 01:49:57.970
completely fine. If you're not, if you're not keeping a code

01:49:57.970 --> 01:50:00.150
inside the git, then you can try to like go ahead with the

01:50:00.150 --> 01:50:03.390
docker file, docker container, so that is also fine. Now so

01:50:03.390 --> 01:50:06.370
git provider, I'm able to connect, now here I'm able to see

01:50:06.370 --> 01:50:08.850
my repository, right. Here I'm able to see my repository,

01:50:08.910 --> 01:50:11.210
which is a midi diag. This is the repository which I have

01:50:11.210 --> 01:50:15.330
created, right. Two things, one is my backend, one folder is

01:50:15.330 --> 01:50:18.410
holding my backend, one folder is holding my frontend. I'll

01:50:18.410 --> 01:50:20.810
not focus on frontend at all, I'll try to focus on backend

01:50:20.810 --> 01:50:23.630
first. I'll try to deploy backend separately and frontend

01:50:23.630 --> 01:50:26.310
separately. I could have done both together, that's also

01:50:26.310 --> 01:50:29.870
fine, but I just wanted to show you that how things happens

01:50:29.870 --> 01:50:33.010
in reality, right. In a backend, so we try to deploy and we

01:50:33.010 --> 01:50:36.030
try to host the APIs, then in a frontend, we try to consume

01:50:36.030 --> 01:50:38.390
it. So that's the reason, so I'm trying to show you like

01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:42.250
separately, otherwise I would have done that altogether. So

01:50:42.250 --> 01:50:46.410
not a big deal. It's like the same thing, but maybe you will

01:50:46.410 --> 01:50:50.350
not be able to get like a reality check over here. So that's

01:50:50.350 --> 01:50:55.550
the only reason I'm like doing this. Making sense guys?

01:50:55.670 --> 01:50:56.350
Shall we move ahead?

01:51:09.930 --> 01:51:12.130
Yeah everyone, yes

01:52:06.050 --> 01:52:12.290
okay, so here see, this is my main directory, midi diag,

01:52:12.290 --> 01:52:16.690
inside that so basically we have like, we have basically,

01:52:16.750 --> 01:52:20.130
like a file in two places. is one is a back end one is a

01:52:20.130 --> 01:52:22.950
front end. So I'll just have to deploy lang serve back end,

01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:25.710
what I can do is I can try to keep it in a separate separate

01:52:25.710 --> 01:52:28.730
repository or else as of now, it's available in my same

01:52:28.730 --> 01:52:31.850
repository. So I can copy this one. And then as a root

01:52:31.850 --> 01:52:34.350
directory, there is option so I can try to pass this to

01:52:34.350 --> 01:52:36.850
directory. So this root directory option is available that

01:52:36.850 --> 01:52:40.330
okay, for this app, what is the root directory, so it will

01:52:40.330 --> 01:52:43.190
not even look into your other directory, it will only look

01:52:43.190 --> 01:52:46.270
into this particular directory, although the repository is

01:52:46.270 --> 01:52:50.130
same, right. But here I can try to branch it here, I can try

01:52:50.130 --> 01:52:52.530
to separate it basically. So this is what I have done lang

01:52:52.530 --> 01:52:55.110
serve back end. So whatever is the name, keep it as it is.

01:52:55.190 --> 01:52:58.030
And here you will be able to see that things have changed.

01:52:58.130 --> 01:53:00.070
So build command is basically what people install

01:53:00.070 --> 01:53:02.430
requirement or txt, that is going to be the build command.

01:53:02.830 --> 01:53:06.650
Now you have to even give a start command. So if you

01:53:06.650 --> 01:53:09.890
remember, we have given a start command for a UV corn,

01:53:10.030 --> 01:53:13.330
right? What was the start command? So basically, for me, a

01:53:13.330 --> 01:53:16.710
start command was this one. Right? I'm not going to give a

01:53:16.710 --> 01:53:19.870
127 by the way over here. So start command was this one you

01:53:19.870 --> 01:53:23.510
will call main app and then here, so just try to give a

01:53:23.510 --> 01:53:29.210
global one. So 0.0 dot 0.0, port number 8000, it's

01:53:29.210 --> 01:53:32.690
completely fine, you can even try to change it. So this is

01:53:32.690 --> 01:53:37.730
something that you have to give as a start command. Follow

01:53:37.730 --> 01:53:40.190
along with me guys, you will be able to deploy it in no

01:53:40.190 --> 01:53:43.790
time. Right? Just follow along with me. So here I have just

01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:46.190
branched it. i have just selected the root directory why

01:53:46.190 --> 01:53:48.830
because i just have to deploy my lancer backend i don't have

01:53:48.830 --> 01:53:51.990
to buy my front end okay and then this is my start command

01:53:51.990 --> 01:53:54.410
the same start command which i have executed in my local

01:53:54.410 --> 01:53:57.850
machine same i am trying to give it over here 0.0.0.0 port

01:53:57.850 --> 01:54:01.150
number this one okay now here so you have to select a free

01:54:01.150 --> 01:54:04.710
right otherwise you have to go for the payment now here you

01:54:04.710 --> 01:54:08.430
will have to pass the environment variable as of now i have

01:54:08.430 --> 01:54:11.810
hardcoded right as of now i have hardcoded it but let's

01:54:11.810 --> 01:54:14.730
suppose if you are not hard coding it because hard the way i

01:54:14.730 --> 01:54:17.850
have i'm trying to like a save or i'm trying to keep my apis

01:54:17.850 --> 01:54:21.570
key is wrong we should not do it right we should keep it

01:54:21.570 --> 01:54:25.110
inside a dot env file or maybe somewhere secret so that i

01:54:25.110 --> 01:54:28.250
can pass it as a run time so here whenever you are going to

01:54:28.250 --> 01:54:31.890
like a you know deploy it you can try to pass it here uri

01:54:31.890 --> 01:54:35.090
api key and upi values simple and system will be able to

01:54:35.090 --> 01:54:37.810
call it automatically so how let me let me like do that as

01:54:37.810 --> 01:54:41.610
well so here i can go to you're on i can go to uri i can go

01:54:41.610 --> 01:54:46.370
to apis i can go to authenticate and then copy and values

01:54:46.370 --> 01:54:49.890
right and then advanced options so secret file if you have

01:54:49.890 --> 01:54:52.150
any kind of a secret file that we try to check or health

01:54:52.150 --> 01:54:55.030
check or pre-deployment command so before deployment you

01:54:55.030 --> 01:54:58.070
have to do it auto deployment command or build filter so

01:54:58.070 --> 01:55:01.790
it's a standard approach that we try to follow and

01:55:01.790 --> 01:55:05.410
everything is available even inside a render and even inside

01:55:05.410 --> 01:55:07.430
awc if you're going to deploy all the services are available

01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:10.330
azure same thing is available going forward i'm going to

01:55:10.330 --> 01:55:13.310
show you that part as well so here deploy a web service now

01:55:13.310 --> 01:55:17.270
if everything goes fine right if everything goes fine it

01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:21.110
will start deploying your services it is going to take some

01:55:21.110 --> 01:55:24.690
time as you can see it's building right it's building just

01:55:24.690 --> 01:55:27.010
wait for three to four minute or maybe five minute it will

01:55:27.010 --> 01:55:31.970
be able to deploy and then what i will do is once it will be

01:55:31.970 --> 01:55:36.770
able to deploy i will try to take my api key right i'll try

01:55:36.770 --> 01:55:42.550
to take my api key basically and then i'll try to deploy

01:55:42.550 --> 01:55:47.110
even a streamlint app both i'll deploy but first i'll try to

01:55:47.110 --> 01:55:50.830
test my apis and even you guys can test it so here i'm using

01:55:50.830 --> 01:55:52.770
a localhost i will not be using localhost

01:55:55.210 --> 01:55:55.610
yeah

01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:04.440
your key is there inside the code sir exactly my kid is

01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:06.780
already there this is the reason i told you that it's a

01:56:06.780 --> 01:56:09.280
wrong approach right we should not keep a key in a hard

01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:12.240
-coded way we should keep a key in a dot env file i believe

01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:15.180
in my previous like classes i have already shown you that

01:56:15.180 --> 01:56:17.360
how to like a create a dot env file you can do that as well

01:56:17.380 --> 01:56:20.640
and then try to call load underscore environment and then

01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:24.740
load it so that is the ideal approach by the way i've just

01:56:24.740 --> 01:56:26.840
shown you the placeholder that there is a placeholder render

01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:29.940
is giving you where you can try to place your key plus those

01:56:29.940 --> 01:56:32.300
who are worried about the scalability so like let's suppose

01:56:32.300 --> 01:56:35.980
uh 10 000 people are calling my uh like this system this api

01:56:35.980 --> 01:56:38.880
right 10 000 people are going to hit my apis so there is a

01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:41.660
scaling option which is available there is a disk there is a

01:56:41.660 --> 01:56:43.740
job option which is available there is a log you will be

01:56:43.740 --> 01:56:47.480
able to observe there is a matrix you will be able to see

01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:49.280
that the application is available in a paid version it's not

01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:54.300
available in a free version by the way so now you can see

01:56:54.300 --> 01:56:57.400
that whatever i have done in my local system step by step it

01:56:57.400 --> 01:57:02.420
is doing the exact same thing so basically whatever you do

01:57:02.420 --> 01:57:07.070
in a local system right this is also a system cloud is what

01:57:07.070 --> 01:57:09.630
cloud is also a system which you are able to access it from

01:57:09.630 --> 01:57:09.930
a remote

01:57:18.220 --> 01:57:23.780
so anyone who have started deploying this application okay

01:57:23.780 --> 01:57:27.080
so it's showing me build is successful but still it will

01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:29.520
take some time so it's still building as you can see so it

01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:34.380
will take some time and remember i have just deployed my

01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:37.220
back end not my front end i'll deploy a front end as a

01:57:37.220 --> 01:57:40.580
different app different so this is a midi app right this is

01:57:40.580 --> 01:57:42.360
for a back end let's suppose right i'll try to create a

01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:44.480
different app for my front end so both app is going to be

01:57:44.480 --> 01:57:48.080
different uh build successful and then deploying and this is

01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:50.540
how even in a real time deployment happens and if you are

01:57:50.540 --> 01:57:54.460
going to change anything in my git right in this git if you

01:57:54.460 --> 01:57:57.340
are going to change anything automatically it will start

01:57:57.340 --> 01:58:01.140
deploying once it you will be able to deploy for once so you

01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:04.720
can try to it on auto deploy as well auto deployments so by

01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:07.980
the time it will it will keep on observing your github so by

01:58:07.980 --> 01:58:10.780
the time you are going to push a new set of the code updated

01:58:10.780 --> 01:58:14.360
version it will call the deployment simple okay

01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:21.660
building this this this this and in progress yeah it will

01:58:21.660 --> 01:58:23.680
take some time especially for this one it will take some

01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:26.320
time for a ui it is not going to take some time because here

01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:29.240
installation is heavy right so we are trying to install a

01:58:29.240 --> 01:58:32.700
lot of things over here lang chain lang serve okay see guys

01:58:32.700 --> 01:58:38.320
so whatever we were able to see in my local system can i say

01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:43.780
that exact same thing i am able to see even over here yes

01:58:43.780 --> 01:58:49.160
everyone yeah this is something that i was able to see it

01:58:49.160 --> 01:58:55.620
right yes so successfully i am able to deploy just wait for

01:58:55.620 --> 01:58:58.220
some time it is still in progress i'll tell you how to

01:58:58.220 --> 01:59:03.540
access it yeah so now see it is giving you this binding port

01:59:03.540 --> 01:59:06.160
and url just wait for a couple of minutes this url that you

01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:08.180
are able to see it is going to work and this is a like a

01:59:08.180 --> 01:59:10.920
public one anyone can access it anyone can hit my system now

01:59:10.920 --> 01:59:16.200
yeah just just wait for a couple of more seconds so it's

01:59:16.200 --> 01:59:20.900
still in progress i'm starting the reply i'm waiting for the

01:59:20.900 --> 01:59:23.800
issues okay and don't worry i don't think that it will give

01:59:23.800 --> 01:59:26.320
you issue if it does not give you issue in my system then

01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:29.860
and if it is working fine locally then ideally it will not

01:59:29.860 --> 01:59:34.260
give yeah your service is live see and now tag has changed

01:59:34.260 --> 01:59:38.120
live live it is right now i'll try to hit this one uh detail

01:59:38.120 --> 01:59:39.780
not found now what i've been doing is i'm going to do is

01:59:39.780 --> 01:59:45.500
i'll try to hit my slash diagnose right see slash diagnose

01:59:45.500 --> 01:59:49.520
slash playground and we are able to see a playground and

01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:52.720
this playground is live yes this is not available in my

01:59:52.720 --> 01:59:57.180
local system this is running globally 200 okay now if i'm

01:59:57.180 --> 02:00:02.660
going to pass some sort of an input i am not feeling well i

02:00:02.660 --> 02:00:11.560
am not feeling well so yeah just try to pass something so

02:00:11.560 --> 02:00:17.320
intermediate step and now it is like running yeah

02:00:19.460 --> 02:00:22.920
see it is able to do the diagnosis and it is able to give me

02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:26.560
all the things now this is my api by the way guys this is my

02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:28.980
api the selected one playground is we know that playground

02:00:28.980 --> 02:00:31.360
is something that lang serve automatically provides so that

02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:35.300
you will be able to test it right so this is my api this is

02:00:35.300 --> 02:00:39.200
my api api without authentication so anyone can use it so

02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:41.980
the way you are using a yuri api right obviously we have

02:00:41.980 --> 02:00:45.640
given you what we have given you the url and at that url my

02:00:45.640 --> 02:00:47.980
yuri is up and running that's the reason so you are able to

02:00:47.980 --> 02:00:51.860
hit our api similarly we are able to create my api this is

02:00:51.860 --> 02:00:55.660
my api and again no authentication in yuri we have given the

02:00:55.660 --> 02:00:58.620
authentication we have attached the authentication so even

02:00:58.620 --> 02:01:01.060
with this one i can attach the authentication so that you

02:01:01.060 --> 02:01:04.360
will not be able to access it right even i can change this

02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:07.500
url in case of yuri so it's basically a your own url that we

02:01:07.500 --> 02:01:11.720
have given right at a urls but here so as you are using a

02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:14.580
free service in a paid they will allow you to bind the url

02:01:14.580 --> 02:01:17.400
so that this url will not be visible so you can try to bind

02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:22.340
it with your own url so okay i have tested it it's working

02:01:22.340 --> 02:01:26.360
it's up and running it's fine now i can test it even with my

02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:30.920
ui so even with my ui so where i was using a local host i

02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:35.840
can try to use what this one yeah i can try to use this one

02:01:35.840 --> 02:01:41.160
invoke and then if i am going to execute my streamlint app

02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:45.740
now i am going to terminate this one and i am going to

02:01:45.740 --> 02:01:54.880
execute my streamlint app once again now i have fever now

02:01:54.880 --> 02:01:58.000
obviously it is not going to call my local if you will come

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:01.840
and check over here sorry if you will come and check over

02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:06.200
here so you will be able to find a 200 200 wins so someone

02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:09.940
is trying to hit my apis and someone is trying to get the

02:02:09.940 --> 02:02:13.840
result i have a fever and everything is like a and running

02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:18.940
and if you if you'll go and check see 200 right just not 200

02:02:18.940 --> 02:02:23.060
200 means it has invoked the diagnosis and 200 okay so now

02:02:23.060 --> 02:02:28.260
it is trying to hit my global api now it is not hitting my

02:02:28.260 --> 02:02:32.320
local one is it making sense to all of us guys yes

02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:38.860
everyone how many of you are able to deploy and test your

02:02:38.860 --> 02:02:41.540
apis and i believe you all are able to understand that how

02:02:41.540 --> 02:02:48.040
i'm trying to make my agent and this this ui in my local and

02:02:48.040 --> 02:02:50.740
i'm doing our api testing which i have already hosted right

02:02:50.740 --> 02:02:58.440
from my local yes so now my agent is live simple so if i can

02:02:58.440 --> 02:03:01.380
make one agent live i can make thousands of agent lives and

02:03:01.380 --> 02:03:04.340
then i can try to do any number of tool calling so my tools

02:03:04.340 --> 02:03:07.280
are live my agents my graph is live my entire things is live

02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:12.260
and even now the api which i have painted to you right so

02:03:12.260 --> 02:03:18.300
this one this one even you can test it all of you can test

02:03:18.300 --> 02:03:24.830
it yes so just do slash playground try to input your symptom

02:03:24.830 --> 02:03:28.150
you will be able to test it and i will be able to see a load

02:03:28.150 --> 02:03:31.090
over here that how many of you are testing it by the way how

02:03:31.090 --> 02:03:35.110
many of you are hitting it by the way yeah so this backend

02:03:35.110 --> 02:03:40.270
is live now it's time to make my front end live yeah it's

02:03:40.270 --> 02:03:43.870
time to make my front end live okay many people are trying

02:03:43.870 --> 02:03:47.690
to hit now i can see it yes many people are trying to hit it

02:03:47.690 --> 02:03:51.690
see in a real time i can see it now if i have to bring it on

02:03:51.690 --> 02:03:54.030
a scale i will be using a scaling feature so that even ten

02:03:54.030 --> 02:03:55.790
thousand people twenty thousand people will be able to hit

02:03:55.790 --> 02:03:59.630
it if i have to observe the logs right that someone is

02:03:59.630 --> 02:04:02.370
facing an issue someone is not facing an issue i can observe

02:04:02.370 --> 02:04:06.170
all the logs and those things and from where you are hitting

02:04:06.170 --> 02:04:10.030
it your ip address right your ip address your information i

02:04:10.030 --> 02:04:13.330
will be able to get it here see so from how many system i'm

02:04:13.330 --> 02:04:15.570
getting a hit see i'm not hitting it all this hate is coming

02:04:15.570 --> 02:04:18.630
from your side right my students who have who are live

02:04:18.630 --> 02:04:23.090
inside a class will be even able to observe the matrixes but

02:04:23.090 --> 02:04:25.370
this will be available with the paid version they are not

02:04:25.370 --> 02:04:28.530
making it available for a free so that i can observe my

02:04:28.530 --> 02:04:31.810
entire network traffic like based on that i can try to

02:04:31.810 --> 02:04:34.930
configure the scaling i can even try to maybe like trigger

02:04:34.930 --> 02:04:38.310
it as a jobs so in a particular interval it will keep on

02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:41.070
like running that job keep on checking something so there is

02:04:41.070 --> 02:04:43.970
there is lot that i can do right there is a lot of things

02:04:43.970 --> 02:04:48.490
that i can try to do over here at any point of a time okay

02:04:48.490 --> 02:04:56.150
so now As my backend is live, and my front end is running on

02:04:56.150 --> 02:04:58.990
a local host, I will try to do one thing. I'll try to even

02:04:58.990 --> 02:05:02.090
make my front end live. So that even my front end and back

02:05:02.090 --> 02:05:04.430
end, and separate obviously, I'm going to create a separate

02:05:04.430 --> 02:05:07.850
app. So let's go ahead and let's try to do it, where is my

02:05:07.850 --> 02:05:10.930
render, close this one.

02:05:18.770 --> 02:05:22.450
So I'm closing this, this is my local host by the way, and

02:05:22.450 --> 02:05:25.050
yeah, it's been tested on a playground, which is a global

02:05:25.050 --> 02:05:28.710
one. Now, so I

02:05:30.410 --> 02:05:34.530
have made a little bit of changes inside my app.py file. So

02:05:34.530 --> 02:05:38.950
I have to push a fresh app.py file, basically, unless and

02:05:38.950 --> 02:05:41.050
until I'm not pushing it. So it is not going to basically

02:05:41.050 --> 02:05:44.170
work. So let's push it then guys.

02:05:47.970 --> 02:05:51.590
Finally deployment has executed without any issue. Yeah, if

02:05:51.590 --> 02:05:53.670
there is an issue, we'll try to fix it.

02:06:11.520 --> 02:06:16.780
So how many of you are able to do it, anyone? They be saying

02:06:16.780 --> 02:06:17.900
that. He's able to do it.

02:06:25.300 --> 02:06:27.820
Okay so I'm into a medical diagnostic.

02:06:35.800 --> 02:06:39.500
Okay I think chat has been ended. Just a minute guys, I'm

02:06:39.500 --> 02:06:43.280
going to reactivate the chat, I think because of time.

02:06:53.210 --> 02:06:56.490
Just a minute guys, wait, I think chat has been deactivated,

02:06:56.610 --> 02:07:01.290
no it was, time was given till 5.30pm.

02:07:07.300 --> 02:07:12.820
Okay chat is live, I can see it. So now what we have to do

02:07:12.820 --> 02:07:16.040
is basically we have to push the updated code. Whatever like

02:07:16.040 --> 02:07:18.820
a updation that we have done and inside the requirement.txt,

02:07:18.960 --> 02:07:24.960
so I have to keep my streamlint, okay. So let me push this

02:07:27.200 --> 02:07:36.700
changes, so git add, git add. So okay, okay deployment done,

02:07:36.840 --> 02:07:42.200
great. So git add and then basically we can try to, we can

02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:44.520
try to add a specific file if you want, otherwise we can try

02:07:44.520 --> 02:07:48.280
to like add everything. So git c-o-m-m-i-t after add

02:07:48.280 --> 02:07:55.600
message. So this is my changes in UI side. Okay fine two

02:07:55.600 --> 02:08:00.340
file has changed and then we can try to basically push this

02:08:00.340 --> 02:08:02.720
code in this repository.

02:08:07.720 --> 02:08:11.480
Copy this one, okay.

02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:23.580
And then here, so we can try to do git remote add origin,

02:08:26.030 --> 02:08:29.710
although it's been added, i-g-i-n.

02:08:33.500 --> 02:08:36.200
Okay, so yeah, like I said, so it's already available, it's

02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:40.000
already added. Git push, here

02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:52.000
rejected, okay, maybe it has been rejected because of, ah,

02:08:58.030 --> 02:09:01.170
okay. So basically I haven't merged and because without

02:09:01.170 --> 02:09:05.050
merging, so I'm doing it and I have done some sort of a

02:09:05.050 --> 02:09:06.590
manual changes, that's the reason.

02:09:09.690 --> 02:09:17.090
So here what I can write. So git pull origin main and then

02:09:17.090 --> 02:09:23.830
rebase. Okay. So that, ah, everything will be r-e-b-a-s-c,

02:09:23.970 --> 02:09:31.850
git pull origin main hyphen hyphen rebase. Yeah. So we are

02:09:31.850 --> 02:09:36.130
rebasing it and then resolve in a merge edit, fine, complete

02:09:36.130 --> 02:09:38.410
merger, complete with conflict, complete with conflict,

02:09:38.630 --> 02:09:49.530
fine, continue, sync changes, okay. So if you remember guys,

02:09:49.590 --> 02:09:52.290
I have done one of the changes. Ah. So, ah, basically in a

02:09:52.290 --> 02:09:55.730
git directly, which was a requirement dot txt file and

02:09:55.730 --> 02:09:58.650
because of that it is giving me this issue, nothing else. So

02:09:58.650 --> 02:10:03.670
now it's a requirement dot txt, so it seems again blank.

02:10:18.660 --> 02:10:27.820
Streamlit, control s, git add, git commit, commit with a

02:10:27.820 --> 02:10:34.080
message, so changed requirement, okay. So one insertion, one

02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:38.440
file have changed. Okay. And then I can try to do

02:10:40.970 --> 02:10:47.810
git push origin main. So after rebasing it, origin main.

02:10:49.630 --> 02:10:54.790
Okay. It's done. So now if I'll go and check my git, so it

02:10:54.790 --> 02:11:00.150
should be up to date. Streamlit UI, requirement dot txt,

02:11:00.210 --> 02:11:03.910
there is a streamlit, which is available and then app dot py

02:11:03.910 --> 02:11:08.210
file. So there is a, my API available, right? My online API,

02:11:08.250 --> 02:11:11.230
which is available. Okay. Now I'll start deploying it guys.

02:11:11.410 --> 02:11:15.250
I'll just try to like a deploy this entire app. So just push

02:11:15.250 --> 02:11:18.450
it inside your GitHub once again, and then start deploying.

02:11:18.730 --> 02:11:22.190
So to deploy it, ah, you can go to a main dashboard. You can

02:11:22.190 --> 02:11:25.850
click on new again, web service, right? Ah, you have already

02:11:25.850 --> 02:11:30.550
attached your, like, ah, this one, GitHub. So select that

02:11:30.550 --> 02:11:37.630
one. And then name is medi dia, underscore UI. Okay. Under

02:11:37.630 --> 02:11:40.790
school. If his interface, this is the new name, which I have

02:11:40.790 --> 02:11:43.290
given, this is the new app, which I'm trying to create. And

02:11:43.290 --> 02:11:46.490
then now for this one, what is the root directory? So my

02:11:46.490 --> 02:11:48.770
root directory is going to be this one is streaming to UI.

02:11:48.910 --> 02:11:51.330
This is going to my router. So I'm saying that just look

02:11:51.330 --> 02:11:55.290
into this one. This is for my UI. So whatever changes I'm

02:11:55.290 --> 02:11:58.070
going to do it with respect to UI, I'll be keeping it. Yeah.

02:11:58.470 --> 02:12:02.870
Okay. So people saw requirement or txt, it is going to do.

02:12:03.730 --> 02:12:09.570
And then it is going to basically. Ah, run the streamlint

02:12:09.570 --> 02:12:17.210
app basically. So here is streamlit run app.py. And I can

02:12:17.210 --> 02:12:20.430
try to give basically a server port number, something like

02:12:20.430 --> 02:12:25.330
this so that it will be able to run the streamlint app. So

02:12:25.330 --> 02:12:27.810
this is the command guys. This is a start command. So

02:12:27.810 --> 02:12:30.530
generally in a local, we try to give this one here. I'm

02:12:30.530 --> 02:12:32.610
trying to give you in a server port, and then I'm trying to

02:12:32.610 --> 02:12:38.910
enable cross is equal to false. Now free environment, no

02:12:38.910 --> 02:12:44.880
environment is required, deploy. What happened? Yeah. This

02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:50.180
looks fine. pip install hyphen r requirement or txt. Let me

02:12:50.180 --> 02:12:51.920
re-execute media

02:12:56.300 --> 02:13:01.400
underscore UI, then main, then root directory, streamlit UI,

02:13:01.620 --> 02:13:05.220
fine. Streamlit app, this, this, this, this, this, this,

02:13:05.220 --> 02:13:10.600
okay, free deploy. There was no issue. So sometime what

02:13:10.600 --> 02:13:15.800
happens is it gives you like a field error. So just deploy

02:13:15.800 --> 02:13:17.920
your front end as well guys, but yeah, in a front end, so

02:13:17.920 --> 02:13:22.440
you should call your backend by the way, means you should

02:13:22.440 --> 02:13:25.720
call, you should change the API and this will be done in no

02:13:25.720 --> 02:13:30.560
time because it's a very light-witted application, right? A

02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:35.100
simple file, which is calling the API. So this is how guys

02:13:35.100 --> 02:13:38.000
I'm deploying my front end. And now you can go ahead, you

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.920
can create a front end in any of the language or technology

02:13:40.920 --> 02:13:41.880
or framework that you know.

02:13:48.340 --> 02:13:53.340
So two separate app. I'm able to maintain with respect to

02:13:53.340 --> 02:13:55.260
the front end and with respect to the backend

02:13:58.390 --> 02:14:01.030
and those things. No, why? No. What happened?

02:14:14.460 --> 02:14:17.340
Okay. So build a successful, like I said, so it will be

02:14:17.340 --> 02:14:19.920
quick because there is nothing much to install and set up,

02:14:19.960 --> 02:14:23.620
uh, just a streamlit, uh, package, which it is going to

02:14:23.620 --> 02:14:26.700
install. So it will not take much time and

02:14:30.380 --> 02:14:35.320
successfully two separate application, the way we used to

02:14:35.320 --> 02:14:37.980
deploy it in real time. We are able to do it. And then now.

02:14:38.740 --> 02:14:40.920
Pay and scale it, scale it for any number of users that you

02:14:40.920 --> 02:14:45.680
want. Yeah. So now this is live. I can click it over here

02:14:45.680 --> 02:14:50.780
and even you guys can use it, right? Every one of us can use

02:14:50.780 --> 02:14:57.620
this one by the way. So I am not, or I have fewer, anything

02:14:57.620 --> 02:15:01.380
I can write good diagnosis and the way it was running in my

02:15:01.380 --> 02:15:05.360
local, in the similar manner, it is going to call my API,

02:15:05.700 --> 02:15:09.520
which is again hosting on a global server. And it is going

02:15:09.520 --> 02:15:10.260
to give me the response.

02:15:19.760 --> 02:15:23.420
Hmm. I'm able to get the response guys. Yeah. I'm able to

02:15:23.420 --> 02:15:27.320
get the response. So yes, I'm able to get the response. Even

02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:29.740
you guys can hit it and then you will be able to get the

02:15:29.740 --> 02:15:32.640
response. Now, if I'll go into my dashboard, I will be able

02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:36.500
to see that this immediate DAG. So, which is like, uh, my,

02:15:36.660 --> 02:15:39.220
uh, backend service, this is up and running and then media

02:15:39.220 --> 02:15:41.220
UI. So these are the two different, different services, two

02:15:41.220 --> 02:15:43.980
different, different app. Basically I'm running the way we

02:15:43.980 --> 02:15:47.400
try to run it in a global, uh, server, or maybe for any kind

02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:49.760
of application. Even you're on kind of application that we

02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:53.300
are running and, uh, yeah, so you can go and you can try to

02:15:53.300 --> 02:15:55.560
check the logs. You can try to check the metrics as who is

02:15:55.560 --> 02:15:58.820
hitting, when it is hitting. So just now someone has hit,

02:15:58.940 --> 02:16:03.300
right. So one has a hit on my like, uh, APIs and just now

02:16:03.300 --> 02:16:05.860
someone is trying to like, uh, you know, uh, hit my UI. So

02:16:05.860 --> 02:16:09.360
everything I will be able to maintain monitor separately and

02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:11.720
both the applications are completely separate. So I can try

02:16:11.720 --> 02:16:14.440
to develop both application in a separate, separate,

02:16:14.560 --> 02:16:17.380
separate, separate manner. If I have to bring it on a scale.

02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:21.640
Not an issue at all. So here is option scale option, which

02:16:21.640 --> 02:16:24.100
is available to me. And there are other configuration as

02:16:24.100 --> 02:16:26.620
well, which is available. So which will, uh, with the help

02:16:26.620 --> 02:16:29.720
of that, I will be able to like, you know, uh, make it

02:16:29.720 --> 02:16:33.240
available to millions of people, by the way, there are so

02:16:33.240 --> 02:16:35.280
many things which comes in between, but yeah, for now I

02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:39.900
think this is more than enough. So finally guys, we are able

02:16:39.900 --> 02:16:45.400
to do it and hope all of you are able to do it together. Now

02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:54.130
so here. Come to your own once again and, uh, generative AI

02:16:54.130 --> 02:16:59.290
with NLP and agentic AI, try to come here. Now similar kind

02:16:59.290 --> 02:17:02.190
of a project I have given you similar exact similar kind of

02:17:02.190 --> 02:17:06.030
a project I have given you in level three, level three. So

02:17:06.030 --> 02:17:09.330
one I have done right. And many other project agent creation

02:17:09.330 --> 02:17:12.450
and everything I have done. Now what I want you to do is

02:17:12.450 --> 02:17:17.030
before tomorrow's class, right before tomorrow's class, I

02:17:17.030 --> 02:17:22.530
want you to build this, this, this, and this all four

02:17:22.530 --> 02:17:26.750
project. You have to build it. I'm going to give you a demo

02:17:26.750 --> 02:17:29.510
of all of this for four project work because for me building

02:17:29.510 --> 02:17:33.110
these things are not at all a big deal. It's again, not to

02:17:33.110 --> 02:17:37.250
just for me, for any one of us now, now, so just try to

02:17:37.250 --> 02:17:40.590
complete this four project tomorrow. I'm going to give a

02:17:40.590 --> 02:17:44.890
demo with my code base, but whenever you are trying to build

02:17:44.890 --> 02:17:47.890
a project, make sure that you are following. The exact same

02:17:47.890 --> 02:17:50.350
thing, front end separate back end separate. You have to

02:17:50.350 --> 02:17:53.350
create the agent. You have to host the agent. You can try to

02:17:53.350 --> 02:17:55.090
use maybe something different. I don't have any kind of

02:17:55.090 --> 02:17:57.530
issue, right? Maybe you can use a Lama index. Maybe you can

02:17:57.530 --> 02:18:00.750
use a crew AI. I'm completely okay with it because we all

02:18:00.750 --> 02:18:04.550
know that now we can use it right at the end of the day. I

02:18:04.550 --> 02:18:07.530
want an application as simple as that.

02:18:11.850 --> 02:18:12.250
Yes.

02:18:16.680 --> 02:18:17.900
Fine guys making sense.

02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:50.720
So Ranjit is asking, do you have example of adding

02:18:50.720 --> 02:18:54.500
authentication used to this one? I can add authentication. I

02:18:54.500 --> 02:18:55.440
can add authentication. I can add authentication in no time

02:18:55.440 --> 02:18:59.080
by the way. So authentication is not at all a big deal. So

02:18:59.080 --> 02:19:02.920
we had a main.py right where we are exposing like a each,

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:06.440
each and everything. Yeah. So what we can do is so we can

02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:12.480
try to, you know, create one simple file or simple like a,

02:19:12.580 --> 02:19:15.400
you know, a function over here and we can try to attach it.

02:19:15.460 --> 02:19:18.720
So the roles and responsibility of that function will be to

02:19:18.720 --> 02:19:22.820
first check the authentication. So here there is something

02:19:22.820 --> 02:19:25.420
called as whenever. We are trying to like make it public.

02:19:25.640 --> 02:19:30.040
There is something called as dependencies, D E P N D N C I E

02:19:30.040 --> 02:19:34.040
S dependencies. And here dependencies wise, we can try to

02:19:34.040 --> 02:19:38.740
call a function. For example, as you have asked, depends on

02:19:38.740 --> 02:19:44.760
depends upon what? So depends upon a API, API underscore

02:19:44.760 --> 02:19:48.220
key, the way you are dependent upon the URI API key, right?

02:19:48.280 --> 02:19:52.260
So dependencies. Now this API key is nothing but a function,

02:19:52.380 --> 02:19:55.280
which I can write. Okay. Basically API key is basically a

02:19:55.280 --> 02:19:59.940
function that I can write. So which is going to take the API

02:19:59.940 --> 02:20:02.620
key and then eventually it is going to give you the final

02:20:02.620 --> 02:20:07.140
authentication. So let me do it, do that as well. So here

02:20:07.140 --> 02:20:11.720
you have to write only this much of the code. See what I'm

02:20:11.720 --> 02:20:16.520
doing, just a fast API, HTTPS security. So security is a

02:20:16.520 --> 02:20:19.600
model which I'm trying to import and fast API security, API

02:20:19.600 --> 02:20:23.260
key auth header. Let me change this name. So verify API key

02:20:23.260 --> 02:20:27.220
should be the name. So in a easiest possible way, guys, you

02:20:27.220 --> 02:20:31.060
will be able to attach the authentication. So how? Create

02:20:31.060 --> 02:20:33.440
one simple function. Now this simple function is trying to

02:20:33.440 --> 02:20:35.720
use what? This simple function is trying to use the

02:20:35.720 --> 02:20:38.820
security. Security is a feature inside the fast API. We are

02:20:38.820 --> 02:20:42.160
already using fast API app over here, right? So which is

02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:45.560
going to ask for the key name and the authentication, and

02:20:45.560 --> 02:20:48.100
then you are going to provide the API key. The way you are

02:20:48.100 --> 02:20:53.160
providing it for the, like a URI, by the way. Right? So this

02:20:53.160 --> 02:20:57.720
is how easy it is. So unless you don't have this key, I

02:20:57.720 --> 02:21:01.620
don't have this key, you will not be able to use it. Yeah, I

02:21:01.620 --> 02:21:04.580
can even try to make this key dynamic the way we have made a

02:21:04.580 --> 02:21:07.100
key dynamic for a URI because URI key is different for

02:21:07.100 --> 02:21:10.360
everyone, right? So on. So this is the key, right? This is

02:21:10.360 --> 02:21:12.760
the key. So this key is going to be different for everyone

02:21:12.760 --> 02:21:15.840
till this bearer. Everything is same. Just like a URI. Now I

02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:17.920
have to make it dynamic. So what I can do is I can write

02:21:17.920 --> 02:21:22.160
another function. So which will try to generate a key. Okay.

02:21:22.180 --> 02:21:26.720
Basically the way I want, then problem will be solved. So

02:21:26.720 --> 02:21:30.140
for one user that there is a, like a key for other user,

02:21:30.260 --> 02:21:32.700
there will be a different key. So this is how even we are

02:21:32.700 --> 02:21:34.140
maintaining the entire authorization.

02:21:46.640 --> 02:21:50.000
Yeah. So know about child window clue is a very good with

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.060
URI. It's a very good with code.

02:21:55.950 --> 02:21:58.810
Okay. So those who have asked me, I think Ranjit has asked

02:21:58.810 --> 02:22:00.950
me this question, right? So Ranjit, if you would like to

02:22:00.950 --> 02:22:04.750
like apply the authentication in no time, you can apply the

02:22:04.750 --> 02:22:07.750
authentication. As of now, this is your key, whoever is

02:22:07.750 --> 02:22:10.630
calling the URL. Yeah. This is the key. Whoever is calling

02:22:10.630 --> 02:22:16.030
the URL. You can try to even make it dynamic if you want. So

02:22:16.030 --> 02:22:18.910
this is all about today's class guys. So how many of you are

02:22:18.910 --> 02:22:21.530
going to give me a project, this four project before

02:22:21.530 --> 02:22:24.990
tomorrow or even today itself in next, like a five hour, max

02:22:24.990 --> 02:22:29.550
to max hub from how many of you I can expect the project

02:22:29.550 --> 02:22:34.520
guys up and running and deployed with the URL and the code,

02:22:34.680 --> 02:22:37.920
all four projects. So how many of you are going to do that?

02:22:37.920 --> 02:22:38.460
How many of you are going to give it to me?

02:22:44.560 --> 02:22:45.460
Yes. Everyone.

02:23:01.570 --> 02:23:03.690
I'm going to be asking question that how's the answer. Are

02:23:03.690 --> 02:23:06.010
there any metrics or evaluation method for an agent of this

02:23:06.010 --> 02:23:08.630
kind of interview question I have faced two days back,

02:23:08.730 --> 02:23:12.050
please give me your suggestion. Yeah. So there is something

02:23:12.050 --> 02:23:15.490
that we try to observe obviously, and that too, like a

02:23:15.490 --> 02:23:18.810
depends upon the task. So if you will ask me like about the,

02:23:18.850 --> 02:23:23.810
like agents, right? So basically, uh, we generally try to

02:23:23.810 --> 02:23:27.790
evaluate our agents in a way that how many number of steps?

02:23:27.790 --> 02:23:30.150
How many steps my agent is trying to take to complete a

02:23:30.150 --> 02:23:34.090
particular task, unless it will be better. And the second

02:23:34.090 --> 02:23:36.990
one is we are going to evaluate the agent based on its

02:23:36.990 --> 02:23:39.250
decision-making capability, because we all know that that

02:23:39.250 --> 02:23:42.670
agent is an entity, uh, which can try to call, right? So

02:23:42.670 --> 02:23:47.270
which can try to technically call, uh, I would say like a

02:23:47.270 --> 02:23:50.490
tools automatically, uh, with its own consent, right?

02:23:50.590 --> 02:23:53.910
Automatically it will be able to call it. So how good my

02:23:53.910 --> 02:23:57.870
agent is in terms of making that decision. Okay. What

02:23:57.870 --> 02:24:01.190
particular tool? And based on that, we can try to like, uh,

02:24:01.350 --> 02:24:03.410
observe the agent. So there is something called as agent

02:24:03.410 --> 02:24:06.890
workflow matrixes. We try to create basically, right. Uh,

02:24:07.010 --> 02:24:10.750
which we try to evaluate the number of steps. We start to

02:24:10.750 --> 02:24:13.730
evaluate a loop detection, basically, which try to even

02:24:13.730 --> 02:24:17.610
detect that tool uses that how, how good it is in terms of

02:24:17.610 --> 02:24:21.510
like, uh, using our tools. Uh, so this is, this is something

02:24:21.510 --> 02:24:24.330
which happens with respect to the agent. Now, uh, there is

02:24:24.330 --> 02:24:26.570
another, uh, like a matrixes, which we try to evaluate

02:24:26.570 --> 02:24:29.470
callers. Error and failure metrics. So how many times my

02:24:29.470 --> 02:24:32.150
agent is going to fail, fail to load the tools, fail to

02:24:32.150 --> 02:24:36.870
utilize a proper tool or miss using our tools. So these are

02:24:36.870 --> 02:24:39.010
the metrics that you should like, uh, observe and then

02:24:39.010 --> 02:24:42.850
output quality, obviously, right. That how, uh, like a less

02:24:42.850 --> 02:24:46.690
hallucinated your output is how faithful your output is. So

02:24:46.690 --> 02:24:49.450
we try to generate a faithful accuracy. And based on that,

02:24:49.470 --> 02:24:51.510
we try to evaluate it. So the other parameter, you can use

02:24:51.510 --> 02:24:54.650
it or not. And that should be your answer for

02:24:57.470 --> 02:25:00.090
maybe two, three. Yeah. Just let's, let's see how many of

02:25:00.090 --> 02:25:04.750
you are able to do it by the way. And uh, let me share this

02:25:04.750 --> 02:25:14.340
entire code inside your directories. So much of code by the

02:25:14.340 --> 02:25:15.320
way, what

02:25:19.640 --> 02:25:22.400
is my folder name for today? Medical project.

02:25:42.580 --> 02:25:46.760
Fine guys, I'm sharing my code, a full code with all of you,

02:25:46.820 --> 02:25:47.640
but

02:26:02.270 --> 02:26:04.530
yeah, let's see how many of you will be able to complete the

02:26:04.530 --> 02:26:07.370
task. So tomorrow, most probably what I'm going to do is.

02:26:07.410 --> 02:26:10.650
So. Uh, I'll give you a quick run of all the project because

02:26:10.650 --> 02:26:12.910
all the project will be almost similar if you will go and

02:26:12.910 --> 02:26:16.230
read out, right. And then I believe we all know how to

02:26:16.230 --> 02:26:18.590
deploy it. So no need to repeat the same process again and

02:26:18.590 --> 02:26:21.470
again, uh, we just wanted to see that how many different,

02:26:21.530 --> 02:26:23.750
different kinds of application as per the syllabus we can

02:26:23.750 --> 02:26:26.170
try to create, right? So starting from here, so tech

02:26:26.170 --> 02:26:29.070
summarization or opinion mining, personalized AI interview

02:26:29.070 --> 02:26:31.910
question generator, medical AI chat bot, symptom checkers,

02:26:31.930 --> 02:26:35.250
all, all these things we can do it. Then tomorrow I will try

02:26:35.250 --> 02:26:37.910
to give you, this is also a small application. So here I

02:26:37.910 --> 02:26:40.430
will be using a Gemini API. And then with the help of that,

02:26:40.510 --> 02:26:44.690
I'm going to pass a image and a plus I will be using a Lang

02:26:44.690 --> 02:26:47.630
chain. So here I will be using an agent plus our vision

02:26:47.630 --> 02:26:51.630
model so that it will be able to even understand what is

02:26:51.630 --> 02:26:54.090
like inside the image. And then it will be able to give you

02:26:54.090 --> 02:26:57.050
the full description. So this is again, one of the small

02:26:57.050 --> 02:27:00.590
project, it's a very, very small body that we have. And then

02:27:00.590 --> 02:27:03.710
we will move ahead. Almost this one we have completed.

02:27:03.890 --> 02:27:08.090
Right. Then we will move ahead with the fine tuning. So most

02:27:08.090 --> 02:27:11.450
probably tomorrow, we will try to complete most of the

02:27:11.450 --> 02:27:16.350
things and then whatever will be left, we'll try to complete

02:27:16.350 --> 02:27:21.690
it next weekend on Saturday itself, right? So I think by

02:27:21.690 --> 02:27:24.630
Saturday, we will close, we'll close the class, we'll close

02:27:24.630 --> 02:27:28.450
the lecture. So tomorrow, I believe I have already told you

02:27:28.450 --> 02:27:30.810
what we are going to do, but yeah, there is a task for you.

02:27:30.870 --> 02:27:34.070
So if you are serious enough, please do the task. And we

02:27:34.070 --> 02:27:36.190
will close the class. Ping me in a group whenever you are

02:27:36.190 --> 02:27:39.070
able to complete the task so that all of us can see it and

02:27:39.070 --> 02:27:42.210
hope all of you are able to enjoy and all of you are able to

02:27:42.210 --> 02:27:44.250
learn a lot with that. Thank you so much, everyone. Take

02:27:44.250 --> 02:27:47.070
care. And we are already available in a group so we can

02:27:47.070 --> 02:27:47.910
initiate a chat over there.
