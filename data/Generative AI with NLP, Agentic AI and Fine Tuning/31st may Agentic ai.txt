WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
yeah so as i said so today we are going to talk about

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.920
basically a agentic ai and probably we are going to see a

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.040
four different different kind of a framework it as a part of

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.780
this agentic ai framework so we are going to talk about a

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.000
lang chain first of all then we'll be talking about a lang

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.800
graph which is again like a multiple lang chain and again

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.540
you will be able to create a lang graph then we are going to

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.480
see a llama indexes and then we are going to see a crew ai

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.400
and we'll try to understand even a difference between uh

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.120
these four uh platform although there is a very minor

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.240
difference you will be able to find out and by using any of

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.320
these platform you will be able to create any kind of agents

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.280
uh you will be able to configure any kind of a tools for a

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.500
particular agent and you will be able to do any kind of

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.300
agentic ai operations and i believe after this class so

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.480
things will be even much more uh clear so let me uh call my

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.100
browser and uh here so there is a platform called as lang

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.820
chain and i believe we all are aware about this that this

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.600
platform a lang chain exists now inside lang chain you will

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.740
be able to find out two framework one is a lang graph

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.600
framework and one is a lang chain framework so lang chain is

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.720
basically a base framework and graph is a kind of a

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.940
framework so where it allows you to even achieve a more

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.440
complex task by creating a multiple graph connecting one

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.540
agent with the another agent or one tool with another tool

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.380
so this is where lang graph comes into a picture just like a

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.700
graphical architecture but yeah so it is been designed to

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.940
even achieve a complex task and again a multi-agent

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.640
communication in between now if you will come over here so

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.880
you will be able to find out a python documentation for both

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.940
so for a lang graph you will be able to find out the python

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.600
documentation and it's not very difficult to go through

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.460
these documentation it's a very like a easy way they have

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.960
created this entire things it's one of the popular framework

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.240
we are talking about by the way right and i believe after

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.160
today's class you all will be like in a position that you

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.140
can go through this documentation and you will be able to uh

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.240
you know understand each and everything uh based on the

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.340
previous things that we have already discussed with respect

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.580
to uh rag's or with respect to uh a vector databases and uh

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.520
and the discussion that we are going to do it today so lang

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.600
chain and lang graph is available inside this lang chain

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.780
itself and then there is something called as lama index so

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.800
lama index is another platform you will be able to find out

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.980
and you will be able to find this one as a at a llama index

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.520
.ai it's a complete different platform right it's a

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.880
completely different platform and initially it was basically

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.940
built to create a index for a documents or for a data so

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.820
that you will be able to run a faster search operation you

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.200
will be able to like do a faster checking operation but

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.940
eventually that is like uh that has also started providing a

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.100
lot of like a different kind of agents as platform has grown

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.700
but yeah that was the initial things uh many of you may be

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.180
not able to understand but that's completely fine that's not

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.800
a concern for me because anyhow we are going to uh talk

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.800
about that okay now there is another platform called as crew

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.460
ai's c-r-e-w crew ai so crew ai is again one of the famous

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.880
platform nowadays and where you can come and you can try to

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.440
like create a multiple different different kind of agents

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.100
you will be able to connect uh you will be able to create a

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.560
communication between the agent and base for again crew ai

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.540
is going to be a lang chain the things that we are going to

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.260
discuss in a very very first place so base is going to be

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.240
basically a lang chain so these four things we are going to

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.700
see we are going to connect we are going to execute some of

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.480
the not some i would say we are going to execute but believe

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.660
me uh building an agent is one of the very simple thing you

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.280
will be able to find out after today's class establishing a

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.320
communication between the agent is going to be very very

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.700
easy for any one of us and i don't think that after today's

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.220
class anyone will be having uh any kind of a doubt in terms

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.740
of you know like what is agent what happens inside that what

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.500
is a potential of the agent and again after tomorrow

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.040
tomorrow's class so tomorrow again we have a class right so

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.300
after tomorrow's class where i'm i will be talking about

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.260
like a lot of projects uh things will be even like i will go

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.160
even more deeper and deeper and uh yeah so i think i think

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.940
uh you can just go after that and then start creating any

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.200
kind of a task and start automating any kind of a task now

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.340
so we are talking about these agents uh very frequently that

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.640
uh and again so many times we talk about our tools and again

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.120
like these agents are here since a very very long time but

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.740
still many of us don't understand the exact meaning of a

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.620
agent or i have i've asked this question to many people that

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.360
can you please explain me a difference between agent and a

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.240
tool and people seems confused in general right so when i

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.120
ask them to you know explain me a difference between what is

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.740
the difference between agents and tools and uh What do you

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.320
understand by even agentic AI? So again, people feel

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.400
confused a lot, right? And they're not able to give a proper

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.420
answer for that. So here is my answer for an agent, by the

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:48.300
way. So what exactly call as agent, how you can explain or

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.380
how you can say or which entity you can say as an agent. So,

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.360
see guys, automation is not something that we are able to

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.500
achieve after AI. Automation is something that we have been

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.380
doing even before, much, much before, right? So even a

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.460
decade back, so we were trying to do automation, a lot of

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.480
automation, right? A lot of automation we have been doing.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.840
And at that point of time, the meaning of automation is

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.700
writing a set of rule. Set of rule means, if this is going

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.560
to happen, then do this. Right? So whenever system is going

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.620
to observe, right, whenever system is going to observe that

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.260
kind of event, system will try to trigger something. Trigger

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.040
something means, so system will try to execute some sort of

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.840
a function. So for example, right, for example, so let's

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.660
suppose you are trying to make a transaction of one lakh

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.600
rupees, one lakh Indian rupees, right? So you are trying to

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.400
make a transaction or maybe one lakh or a hundred K dollar.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.720
You're trying to make a transaction. You're trying to make a

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.240
transaction of a hundred K dollar, right? So basically, uh,

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.720
like a bank have already written a lot of set of conditions

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.060
in a backend that if transaction size is more than a hundred

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.740
K, then directly immediately give a call to a customer and

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.820
ask for the confirmation, right? So it will automatically

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.700
trigger a call. Is it making sense? Now let me open up my

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.980
scribble link and let me like draw something over here. So

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.360
see, uh, let's talk about one situation. I think traditional

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.200
situation, uh, we, we all have like a gone through at some

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.060
point of a time in our life. So let's suppose I'm trying to

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:33.580
do a transaction of maybe a hundred K dollar, a hundred K

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.700
dollar. So as soon as this transaction is going to happen,

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:41.500
as soon as this transaction is going to happen, so it is

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.780
going to a, like a bank is going to basically bank is going

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.620
to trigger what bank is going to trigger a call. Now it is

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:55.700
going to ask a person, right? Okay. Person once person will

00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:02.480
say, yes, it is going to approve. If person is saying no, it

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:08.270
is going to disapprove, right? So this is how things are

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:11.870
going to happen in general. So here you must be able to see

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.670
that as soon as you are trying to do something, right? As

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:17.910
soon as you are trying to like a, uh, like a do a hundred K

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:22.090
of transaction. So automatically the banking system that is

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.910
in place, and even 10 year back, that was in place, right?

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:29.710
Maybe in a different tech, not, not by using AI. So it was

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:33.450
trying to trigger something. It was trying to make some sort

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:37.330
of a decision. And then while taking those decision, it was

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:43.030
trying to execute, or you can say it was trying to do a

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.430
different, different kind of activity. For example, a

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:48.390
calling activity, taking approval activity. If there is a

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:51.070
disapproval, then what is going to happen? So this was the

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:53.930
entire flow, which was created. Now, if I'll talk to you.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.910
Let's talk about this entire system, our kind of a system,

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:01.310
which was able to take a certain decision automatically, a

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:04.070
kind of a system, which was able to take a decision

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:08.470
automatically. Now that is called as what in a world of AI,

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:12.910
it's called as agent, a kind of a system which can take an

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:16.270
autonomous decision. That entity may be a small, maybe big

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:20.310
depends, right? Depends. But yeah, so a kind of a system

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:23.750
which will be able to take a decision automatically. Not.

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.730
That is in a world of AI or especially in the world of

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:30.150
agentic AI. It's called as nowadays, a agent. People have

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:33.990
introduced a new word, a new term called as agent. Now agent

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.670
is what? Taking autonomous decision. That's it, right? Maybe

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:42.330
for one part or from other part. Now what is a tool? So in

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.710
an agent, again and again, you all are going to encounter

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:49.190
this term called as tool. Now what is this tool by the way?

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:52.550
So here in the same situation, try to understand. So

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.450
whenever. Whenever I'm going to do a transaction, so there

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.350
must be some function. There must be some function, right?

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.150
So if I'm trying to do online transaction, bank to bank

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:03.870
transaction or something, maybe ATM card transaction. So

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:06.630
there must be some function which will be called to a bank

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:10.050
server. Transaction function. It will try to check basically

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:12.670
check what, whether you have this much of balance or not.

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:17.270
Then it will also try to check the account where you are

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.930
trying to transfer that account is valid or not. Right? And

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:24.890
if. Like. If you have a balance, you have a valid

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:28.110
transaction, you have a like other party is having a bank

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:31.250
account, a correct bank account, right? Then it is going to

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.530
make a transaction then in between. So we are like a, this

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:38.090
agent automatically is trying to call a baby customer as

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:41.650
well taking approval. Yes or no. Right? Again, it is trying

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:45.890
to call like a further things. So these is small, small unit

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:48.510
that I'm talking about, whether it's a transaction

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:51.910
validation, whether it's a API, which is checking your bank

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:55.530
balance. Uh. Which is trying to like a check whether other

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:59.450
parties, uh, you know, the, the account exists or not. The

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.330
kind of a function which is trying to trigger a call for

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.950
you, a kind of a function which is going to take approval.

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:08.230
Yes or no. Or it is going to ask you that press one on your

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:09.970
mobile, press two on your mobile, something like that.

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.770
Right? So these are small, small, small, small, small,

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:17.030
small, what a small, small functions, right? As per the need

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:20.930
agent is going to call so that agent will be able to fulfill

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:25.850
its work. Yeah. So these are small, small function, which is

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:29.850
callable at any point of a time by a agent is actually

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:34.630
called as tool. That's it. Is it making sense guys now that

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:40.640
what is the difference between agent and a tool and in a

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.420
world of agent guy, what is called as agent? Is it clear?

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:52.030
Yes. Everyone.

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:03.550
Yeah. So this is like in a modern world. So we are calling

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:07.510
that as a agent and a here. So technically we have our LMS,

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:10.610
right? So because all of these terms and all of this

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:14.150
framework has been introduced after introducing these LLMs,

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:17.710
large language model that we see, whether it's our open AI

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:19.790
model, whether it's a Gemini model, whether it's a llama

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:22.910
series, whether it's a mistral series, whether it's a deep

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:25.370
seek series that we are talking about all of these LLMs,

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:30.050
right? All of these LLMs. So this basically like a came into

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:34.090
picture because now LLM understands a broader things, right?

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:38.630
LLMs can interact with you. You just by a natural language

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:42.050
NLP, right? So you say something and then LLMs will be able

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:44.690
to understand LLMs will be able to generate the code. LLMs

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:48.710
will be able to go like a generate the command. So now, so

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:51.590
people have started creating a, like a saying that, that,

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:55.330
okay, so because of this LLMs existence, right, what I can

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:59.630
do is so I can try to do a better automation. Right? So

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:02.070
previously we were writing conditions, if and else, if else,

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:04.150
if else, but now what we are trying to do. So we are trying

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.970
to use our power of this NLP. Okay. A power of this natural

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:11.810
language, technically doing the same thing, but in a other

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:15.910
way, in a, in a, like a best way, a better version, you can

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:19.190
say, right? A best version of it. We are trying to see as of

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:21.630
now. So here, right?

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:32.130
Basically the let's try to like see that how this four

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:35.370
platform, which I was talking about a four platform, which

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:37.210
is basically a Lang chain.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:46.500
Lang chain, Lang graph,

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:57.550
Lama index crew AI, right? So there are other platforms as

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:59.990
well, like, and it is a platform. And again, there are so

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:02.270
many hundreds of upcoming platform, which is coming into a

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:05.310
market. More or less all are doing the exact same work. They

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.230
are not doing very different. So I don't think that you will

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:09.870
not be able to understand even if something new, which will

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.430
come into the market because under the hood, everyone is

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:15.790
going to use the power of LMS. Simple. So any, so they need

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.790
an access of your large language model without this large

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:22.370
level model. These agents are nothing basically. Right? So

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:25.850
basically this LMS are oxygen for those large language,

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:28.550
sorry, but like those, whatever, whatever agent you are

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.390
going to create by using this framework. Now people have

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:34.730
just created this framework so that, uh, it will be easy for

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:37.710
you. Even for a non-coder by writing maybe two, three line

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.950
of things, uh, people can create their agent. They can like

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:44.150
a plug and play with anything that they want. Right? So

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.870
keeping that in our mind, this framework comes into a

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:51.130
picture, but this doesn't mean that you can't write a, or we

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.870
can't create an agent just by writing a raw Python code. I

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.090
believe in my previous classes, we have already done that,

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:59.990
right? Maybe we have not called that as an agent, but yes,

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:03.270
it was an agent. We have done that with the help of our

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:06.290
Python code, a raw Python code, but here, same thing. I'm

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:08.970
going to do it with the help of these popular framework.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.770
That's it. Right? Maybe tomorrow, some more framework will

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:14.630
come into picture. It will get more popularity. People will

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.490
start talking about it. People will eventually start using

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.850
it. That's completely fine. This is what is happening since

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:21.370
last two and a half years and there is no end of it. Right?

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:23.730
But I believe if you are able to understand the core

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:26.210
concept, a core fundamentals, doesn't matter which

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:28.290
framework, which platform you are going to use, it's

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:31.270
completely fine. And eventually we'll feel like everything

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:34.110
is just a hype that people are trying to create because they

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:38.490
have to sell their product. That's it right now. So here,

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:43.110
uh, what we are going to do is now that. Uh. Let's try to

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:46.550
understand our difference between a Lang chain, Lang graph,

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:51.570
uh, Lama indexes and a crew AI basically, right? Uh, crew

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:55.810
AI. So when we are talking about this, uh, Lang chain,

00:15:56.050 --> 00:16:01.230
right, when we're talking about this Lang chain, so it's

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:06.070
nothing but again, a simple LLM, large language model,

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:09.630
application framework, application framework. So it means

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:12.510
you can try to give an access of those LLMs. Maybe. Maybe

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:16.770
Gemini or any models and just ask to do some tasks like, uh,

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:19.690
maybe go and browse something for me, maybe try to let's

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:22.230
grab this particular data and it is going to do it for you.

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:24.930
Simple. So you can, you can just try to configure it in that

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:29.030
way now. So when I talk about a Lang graph, so basically

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:32.530
it's a graph based agentic workflow means there will be a

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:35.670
multiple agent. It will be connected with a different one

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:38.870
and one and other will be able to communicate. So it's

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:41.870
basically a graph based, right? Graph based. Graph based

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:45.190
Lama index, as I said in a beginning itself. So initially it

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:49.230
was created for a data indexing for a RIG operation,

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:52.990
retrieval, augmented generation operation. But now we can

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:55.670
start even creating a agents inside it. So that was the

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:58.030
initial purpose of creating a, that's the reason it's, it's,

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:01.170
it was actually named it as a, a GPT index by the way,

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:03.530
right? GPT index. And then people have like, uh, you know,

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:08.150
started calling it as a Lama indexes. So initial purpose was

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:11.350
very different. Uh, like, uh, but now it's very different.

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:15.190
Uh, so now it supports chucking. It supports basically, uh,

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:18.030
like, uh, embeddings index things it supports. And then

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:20.990
eventually you will be able to even create a agent over

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:26.230
there and a crew AI. So crew AI basically. So it's again,

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:38.860
our role based crew AI role based multi agent system that

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:43.120
you will be able to find out now. So, uh. Okay. So if I'll

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.960
talk about a Lang chain, so it's basically an independent

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.360
system. So it doesn't depends upon like, uh, any other

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.580
things except, uh, LLMs, I would say, uh, but if I'll talk

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:55.160
about a Lang graph, so Lang graph, I have already shown you.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:58.080
So Lang graph, you will be able to find out on Lang chain

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.860
itself, right? So basically these agents that I'm talking

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:05.600
about, so it's a Lang chain or Lang chain agent connecting

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:11.860
with each other. So basically it's built on, built on Lang

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:18.370
chain itself. Yeah. Built on Lang chain, uh, it's LLMA

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:21.190
index. It's independent of Lang chain. So independent,

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:22.570
independent

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:29.620
of Lang chain, I would say, but yeah. So if you wanted to

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:33.760
use Lang chain chains agents, we can use it over here. Crew

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:41.700
AI is basically built on Lang chain itself. So crew AI that

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.540
we are going to talk about, it's actually, so it's

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.720
connected. This is what I'm trying to show you that it's,

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.780
it's actually connected, right? It's connected. Now. So if

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:54.500
I'll talk about a Lang chain, by the way, so Lang chain, uh,

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:58.720
basically, uh, like, uh, you know, um, uh, it's, it's like,

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:03.680
uh, going to help you out in terms of creating a simple or

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.360
basic agent. So basic, simple

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.380
agent, it is going to help you out in terms of creating it

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:14.340
now. So if I'll talk about a Lang graph, so basically it's a

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.800
graph, right? So graph means multiple agent, by the way.

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:20.480
Yeah. Multiple agent. LLMA index in general, like I said. So

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.280
no native agent support, you will be able to find it, but

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.520
yeah, you can create one. Yeah. You can create one and crew

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:30.080
AI. So a agent which can communicate with each other, you

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:34.880
will be able to find out now. So use case wise, I can try to

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:40.420
use a Lang chain in terms of, so use case wise, I can try to

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:48.040
use Lang chain. So for what purposes? A chat bot. Chat bot.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:52.900
Chat bot for RIG application. I can try to use it Lang

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:58.510
graph. So I can use it for, uh, maybe like a complex

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:00.090
workflow, which

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:08.160
I'm going to show you. And then if I have to like, uh, LLMA

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.600
index, so

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:18.050
maybe I can use it for a Q and a and a custom document

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.350
document.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:29.100
Yeah. And then if I have to use a crew AI crew AI. So

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.480
basically we can use it for end to end.

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:38.350
AI task automation.

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:45.280
So again, these are just a theory, uh, nothing much, uh,

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.280
again, you can just go to any platform and, uh, search for

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.580
it. You will be able to get it. Maybe I can try to like, uh,

00:20:51.700 --> 00:21:01.280
go to your own platform itself. Uh, yeah. So I can go to

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:04.920
your own platform itself. I can just go to URI and ask that.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:09.120
Give me, uh, give me, uh, okay. Okay. So you can see the

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.240
difference between Lang

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:24.290
chain, Lang graph, LLMA index and crew AI. So obviously it

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:26.490
is going to give me a beautiful differences. I'm probably

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:30.250
like, uh, uh, with the table. Yeah. So as you can see, so

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:34.290
use case and support and like what it's supports. It's

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:36.510
almost same thing that I have discussed and you will be able

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:40.110
to find out the exact, uh, same thing over here as well. And

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:42.830
you can, you can try to explore more and more. But again,

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:46.070
this is just a theory, I would say, unless you're not doing

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:49.230
a practical, you will not be able to understand much. This

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:51.490
is what I always believe. And once you are going to write a

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:54.470
couple of line of a code, then everything will be fixed

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.770
automatically. You don't have to like, you know, like

00:21:56.770 --> 00:22:01.550
memorize anything. So let's start writing a code. And this

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:07.110
is where this API will come into a picture. Yeah. So we are

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:10.790
going to use a URI API, by the way, for all of these four

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:16.910
framework. A reason is I need an access of a model. And I

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:20.130
believe there are enough number of model which is available

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:24.190
over here, right? Even if I'm trying to build a agent, which

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:28.210
has to go to a Google and do some sort of a search, right

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:31.730
for some sort of operation, we have those models as well.

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:35.750
Gemini 2.0 Flash. So which is helping you out in terms of

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:39.350
doing a real time Google search, right? Real time Google

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:42.170
search. Again, so we have that. If I'm looking for an

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:45.190
advanced reasoning, if I'm looking for the fastest one, we

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:49.770
have all of those categories available inside of your own

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:52.690
URI platform itself. If I'm looking for embeddings, that is

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:57.710
also available. So I believe using a URI API is always a

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:01.250
wise decision. Now, so authentication wise, it's already

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:05.210
given a sample code wise. It's also given to all of us. So

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:09.910
we just need two things. One is this URL, basically. And

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:14.570
then we just have. To like, uh, give our API key. So instead

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:17.950
of this static, I just had to change my API key. We have a

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:21.550
URI API as a, sorry, we have a URI SDK as well. Pipe a

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:24.430
package as well. But today I will not be using that one. So

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:27.950
today I will be showing you just by using this raw code and

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:31.030
this code is nothing. So it's time to hit the URL, uh,

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:34.670
trying to like, uh, say something, uh, like ask something to

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:37.710
the LLMs and then respond. That's it. Right. So I'll be

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:41.710
using this one complete for the chat completion. So open up

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:44.730
your VS code guys, and, uh, let's start doing a practical

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:47.930
for all of these four framework and, uh, LLM provider wise,

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:51.190
I'm going to use URI, those who would like to use open AI,

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:54.430
go ahead, free to use it, uh, feel free to use it. Those who

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:56.590
would like to use something from a group. I don't have any

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:58.470
kind of a issue. You can go ahead and you can try to use

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:00.750
something from a group. It's completely fine. At the end of

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:05.150
the day, you have to feed a LLMs. That's it. Right? So any

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:08.430
platform which is providing you those LLMs, you can use any

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:11.510
of this platform. Uh, LLMs. Uh, it is, it is not going to

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:13.570
like, uh, affect much and you don't have to like do any kind

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:18.130
of a code changes for that. Uh, so yeah, let me open up our

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:23.630
new folder and code is

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:31.170
an tick AI gen AI class.

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:38.940
Okay. Now, so first of all, try to create a file called as

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:45.800
requirement dot TXT R D Q U I R E M E N T S dot T X T. Okay.

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.680
So try to create this particular file. We are going to

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:51.040
create an environment and uh, inside that environment, we

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.940
are going to keep everything. So request Lama index, Lang

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:59.520
chain, Lang graph, and crew AI. Sometime a version may give

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.600
you a pain, uh, especially if I'll talk about a Lama index.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:06.060
So Lama index gives you a pain in terms of a worsening. Uh,

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:07.740
so that's the reason. So we are going to create one

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:10.660
environment and in that environment, I have already tested

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:13.800
the code, uh, so that you won't face any kind of issue. So

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.000
these are the version, which is going to work. Fine. For

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.160
you. Uh, as I said, Wilson may give you an issue. These

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.800
libraries are like a new people are trying to modify it.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:27.280
People are trying to push a new code and new changes, uh,

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:30.380
for these libraries on a regular basis. Uh, so it's, it's

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.640
not that stable. So sometime it's a volatile and it will

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.280
give you an issue. And even dependencies issue, it is going

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:39.280
to give it to you. Uh, so I'm going to use just a middle

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.160
person or stable person. You can say that's the reason. So I

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.120
have written even the version, which is the stable one, and

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:47.580
which is working for me. Now. So for that you have to

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.600
create, um, uh,

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:58.050
one, uh, like a environment. Uh, so here I can write Conda

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:08.290
create hyphen N and, um, A G N T I C agentic AI Python is

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:14.960
equal to 3.1, 0 all ears. Yeah. So just try to create an

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.580
environment guys, you

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.140
can change your environment accordingly.

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:28.890
And once it's done. So activate the environment. So I'm

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:32.390
activating my environment over here. So as you can see, and,

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:36.310
uh, DIR, so my requirement or TXT is available over here. So

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:39.050
I'm going to just call pip install inside this environment,

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:44.390
pip install a hyphen R requirements dot TXT. And eventually

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:46.850
it will try to install each and everything, whatever I have

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:50.170
kept inside the requirement or TXT and some, some of the

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:53.410
things maybe we'll need it in between. So we'll try to do

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:54.330
that installation as well.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.160
So done everyone.

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:16.390
Yeah. So is it done still

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:40.400
it's going on inside my system, so we'll have to wait.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:28.020
Okay. So just wait guys, uh, we'll wait for my system to do

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:28.660
all the execution.

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:20.620
Okay. So still installing in my system.

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:06.030
Okay. So it's taking longer than expected operation

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:12.510
canceled by user.

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.680
Hmm. Hmm. It's taking time.

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:53.700
So do we activate environment to serve a mean while I'm

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:56.620
using, I have activated then only I'm installing, right?

00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:59.880
What does the meaning of, so do we activate it's already

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:00.480
activated?

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.220
I'm like, yeah. So in your system, obviously you should

00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:15.020
activate if, if your question is that one, but in mine, so

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:16.020
it's already done.

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:34.990
Uh, it's taking, uh, I think it's already taken, it has like

00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:39.790
more than enough amount of time. I'll just. I'll go back to

00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:41.890
my base environment, even

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:47.670
in my base, all the requirements are already installed by

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:51.850
the way. I'm just like using it so that you should not get

00:34:51.850 --> 00:35:00.840
any kind of a conflict. So Conda and deactivate, I'm in a

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:06.040
base environment. So okay, let's start doing it guys. So

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.080
this is the isolation, whatever time it is going to take,

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:11.060
obviously it's, it's like a taking time. So you have to give

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:15.180
like a, that much amount of time. Then come over here and,

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:18.280
uh, try to create one file, which we are going to use in

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:23.420
general and name it as a URI underscore LLM dot PI file as

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:28.680
simple as that. Oh, okay. So let me delete this one and, uh,

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:34.540
here. So URI underscore LLM dot PI file. So just try to

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:39.580
create one PI file for a URI and, uh, we can go here and

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:41.980
this is the sample code. This is the code which is already

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:46.160
given to us. So we can try to use this, uh, chat completion,

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:50.480
like I said, so you just need two things. You need a URL and

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:53.300
you need a authentication. That's it. Apart from that,

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:57.140
nothing is required. So here, what I have done that, that I

00:35:57.140 --> 00:36:02.580
have created a clean function for this URI. And here is my

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:06.940
API key. So you can try to replace it with your API key.

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:10.360
Like I said, now API key is like a easily available and

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:18.200
accessible. To all of us. So here, your API key, you can try

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:22.460
to use it in this particular place and, uh, yeah, so you can

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:30.360
try to use it. Now this is the code guys. Just replace your

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:34.640
API key with your actual API key. So here I'll go, I'll come

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:37.560
click on authentication and I'll try to select this

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:40.680
authentication API token. And, uh, in this case, this is the

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.580
API token. Instead of this, your API key, I'm going to

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:47.860
replace it with mine. That's it. So this is one of the

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:53.240
module you have to create. So wherever I need a chat

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:56.760
completion, URI chat completion, I'll try to call URI LLM

00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:00.640
dot URI completion. And my work will be done by the way,

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:04.120
because I need a LLM access without LLM access, I can't do

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:08.980
anything. Okay. Now let's get started with the lang chain

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:11.620
first. So in a lang chain, what we are going to do is, so we

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:14.280
are going to create an agent, right? We are going to create

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.540
an agent. We are going to do the different, different kinds

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:20.460
of things. So here I will go once again, and I'll try to

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:24.160
create a new Python file, lang chain. You can do it in a

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.440
Jupyter notebook as well, your wish. So lang chain

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:33.680
underscore demo dot PI file. Yeah. Lang chain demo. Now, so

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:38.020
what lang chain can do? So lang chain can help you out to

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:43.060
create an agent. Right? Now internally, those agents can try

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:47.020
to call a different, different kind of a tool as and when it

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:49.140
is required, because this is what agent does by the way,

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:53.720
right? This is what agent does. So here, what I can do is I

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:57.120
can try to do some sort of a import from a lang chain. So

00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:01.780
here import a agent here, import the output parser, import a

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:05.220
lang chain prompt, lang chain tools, and then lang chain LLM

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:09.240
base, and then URI LLM. So URI chat completion. This is

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.860
something which I'm trying to import it over here and rest

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:14.820
import. I'm trying to do it from a lang chain itself. I'll

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:17.460
try to explain you. So why all these imports and which

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:20.060
import will be used where? So anyhow, when I'm going to

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:24.500
create a tools or I'm going to create a agent, you will be

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:28.160
able to like understand these tools in a easiest possible

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:34.040
manner. So just try to do this import and keep your URI LLM

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:35.940
ready. Simple.

00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:56.770
Done guys. Everyone.

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:23.650
Yeah. So once this part is done, then what we can do is, so

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:27.510
first of all, I'm going to create a small tool. I'm not

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:31.070
going to create something very meaningful because that those

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:33.670
meaningful things, anyhow, we are going to do it in a

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:36.530
project. So I'm just going to create some random tools,

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:40.110
which is going to do some sort of a work. Now what kind of a

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:45.230
work? So I'm going to create a one tool. So which is going

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:49.570
to generate a poem, right? Poem. So based on the topic which

00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:52.430
I'm going to give, so it is going to generate the poem or

00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:54.930
maybe some sort of a story or like a essay it is going to

00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:58.730
write. And then another tool I'm going to create, so which

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:02.510
is going to basically do some sort of a calculation for me.

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:06.470
Yeah. So one is a mathematics tool I'm going to create and

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:10.290
one is a writing tool I'm going to create. Tool means what?

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:14.350
So tool means I'm actually talking about a function, right?

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:19.090
I'm actually talking about the function. So here. Right. So

00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:22.810
here, if I have to like a, you know, create such kind of a

00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:26.650
function. So which will be able to take some sort of an

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:30.950
input and then it is supposed to like do something. So how,

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:34.670
how we can like actually do it. So let me write down one

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:38.990
from the scratch. So def and then here I'm going to create a

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:43.850
tool tool means function, right? So exp RT, exp RT expert

00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:47.730
writer tool. Let's suppose I'm going to create. I'm going to

00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:50.750
take some input. So input means you are going to give some

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:54.090
sort of a topic you, you may say that, okay, so like, uh,

00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:57.570
uh, on an environment day, give me a poem or give me a

00:40:57.570 --> 00:40:59.390
essay, something like that. Right. So you are going to give

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:03.350
some sort of a input, uh, to basically this particular, like

00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:07.050
a export writer. And then what this export writer is going

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:10.590
to do. So this export writer is going to create a message,

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:16.190
uh, message basically. And uh, it is going to set that.

00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:22.050
Okay. So a role is what the role is basically a user for

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:30.450
LLMs input user, and then content content, content, content

00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:34.310
is what? So content is basically write

00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:44.030
a sort poem on the input that the user is going to input

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:48.770
that user is going to give. So this is something. That I'm

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:52.470
going to ask. And then whatever message, uh, whatever,

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:55.390
whatever input that you are going to give, right? So I'm

00:41:55.390 --> 00:42:00.270
going to basically pass this entire things to my URI. So R E

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:06.270
T U R N URI completion, I'm going to call. And what URI is

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:09.370
taking as an input URI is taking message as an input, right?

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:13.070
Temperature is already set. If I would like to override it,

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:15.630
I can override it. Uh, maximum token is thousand. It's

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:18.710
already set. Okay. So I'm just trying to call what I'm just

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:22.850
trying to call a URI chat completion and here. So I will

00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:27.970
simply try to pass my message, right? So message is equals

00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:31.670
to message. I'm going to pass my own message. I'm going to

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:34.310
pass. Now we know that, that this is what URI does, right?

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:37.830
So if you are going to pass a message, right, if you're

00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:40.970
going to pass a message, so based on the message, it is

00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:43.710
going to hit this particular model and then it is going to

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:48.010
give me a response, right? Guys, everyone. This is what any

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:51.210
LLM does. Any LLM you are going to call, whether it's a LLM

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:55.150
from a URI or maybe something else. Now what it will do. So

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:57.610
if you're going to pass a message, it is going to give you a

00:42:57.610 --> 00:43:01.630
response as simple as that. Right. And I'm just calling that

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:05.050
as what, as a tool I'm trying to call. So this is

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:07.890
technically a simple function I have written. Now this

00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:11.650
function is trying to call my URI. That's it. Right. A very

00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:15.550
simple one, very basic one. So we are not doing like a, uh,

00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:18.030
something very different. Over here. And I believe all of us

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:23.990
are able to understand in this one now. So, uh, this is one

00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:27.930
of the function. So which can do a small task by the way,

00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:31.590
right. Which can do a small task. Now this is trying to like

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:34.630
a, do a small task in terms of taking an input and then

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:37.270
based on the input, it is going to give you some response

00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:40.930
because LLMs is like a very much comfortable with this kind

00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:43.670
of an input and based on this input, it can generate, right.

00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:46.890
This is what LLM does by the way. Now. I'm going to create,

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:52.270
uh, another, uh, basically, uh, like a function, right. I'm

00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:55.730
going to create another function over here. Now what this

00:43:55.730 --> 00:44:00.210
function is going to do. So this function is going to be,

00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:04.390
uh, behave like a export mathematician by the way, right. So

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:09.170
behave like a export mathematician. So where it is going to

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:12.570
basically take some sort of an input and then, uh, whatever

00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:15.130
mathematical expression you are going to give, it is going

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:17.050
to evaluate it. And it is going to like a, give you the

00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:20.530
response, for example, uh, so here another function means

00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:24.130
another tool I'm going to create as of now, uh, don't call

00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:28.650
it as a tool. Yeah. So just call it as a function, simple

00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:31.290
plain Python function. Don't even call it as a tool for now.

00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:34.950
I'll tell you the reason behind it. So exprt export

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:38.370
underscore what export and underscore math. Okay. Now this

00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:41.090
will also take input fine. So you are going to give an

00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:44.410
input. Uh, maybe you will ask that like, uh, what is a

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:47.510
hundred into 90? What is a hundred by 90, anything,

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:50.430
anything, any mathematical expression, complex, easy,

00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:53.230
whatever you want, you can just try to give, right? Because

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:57.170
LLM can understand those things. Now it is going to take

00:44:57.170 --> 00:45:01.930
this input. It is going to evaluate it, right? So EVL

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:05.610
evaluated basically, and eventually it is going to give you

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:09.750
like evaluation is going to take the input and, uh, it is

00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:13.310
going to give you basically what it is going to give you. So

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:16.830
it is going to call internal magic. Okay. It is going to

00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:21.180
give you like a built in underscore, underscore.

00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:34.470
Yeah. So evaluate it and return that as a result, R

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:51.710
E T U R N return, return what? So return basically result,

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:56.830
okay, fine. So this is another function, uh, which we have

00:45:56.830 --> 00:46:00.210
created. Now this function is going to take any kind of a

00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:03.830
input and then it is going to like, uh, evaluate it. And

00:46:03.830 --> 00:46:06.630
then it is going to give you some sort. Is it making sense

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.870
guys?

00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:31.010
Yeah. So basically EVL, so those who are getting confused

00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:33.550
with the EVL, so EVL is nothing but it can take any kind of

00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:36.870
a mathematical expression and then eventually it is going to

00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:39.550
give you the final output. This is, this is just a simple

00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:42.410
Pythonic function. So if you would like me to showcase that

00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:47.070
part, maybe I can try to create one file, a test dot I P Y N

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:50.270
B. And then I can try to show you that part as well. So if

00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:54.270
you are calling EVL, E V A L. EVL. And let's suppose I'm

00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:56.750
going to pass just as a string, I'm going to pass, right?

00:46:56.790 --> 00:47:01.430
Not like a four plus five. So what EVL will do? So EVL will

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:06.110
just try to evaluate it. Yeah. So as you can see, I'm

00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:08.590
calling EVL and I'm trying to pass this as a string, this

00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:11.650
mathematical expression as a string. So EVL will always try

00:47:11.650 --> 00:47:14.830
to like, you know, uh, like, uh, try to evaluate anything,

00:47:14.970 --> 00:47:18.110
right? Try to evaluate anything at any point of a time. Now

00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:20.930
same thing I'm trying to call over here. So EVL, and I'm

00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:23.510
trying to pass the user input. And the, whenever I'm trying

00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:27.410
to pass the user input. So I'm, I'm just trying to like, uh,

00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:30.610
pass those user input as a parameter. And that's the reason.

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:33.310
So I'm trying to call a built-ins over here. Nothing much,

00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:37.730
but yeah, the EVL, what it does technically EVL evaluate any

00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:40.190
kind of a string expression that you are going to pass. It's

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:43.630
a Pythonic one. It's not like nothing related to LLMs by the

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:48.090
way. Yeah. So these are the two functions we have already

00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:53.930
created. Okay. That's great. Now. Uh, so we, we have already

00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:59.970
created these, uh, two functions now. So, uh, there is

00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:04.150
something called as create react agent, right? It's not a

00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:06.610
react, react. It's not a react, which is coming from a front

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:09.870
end backend or monostack. So I'll, I'll talk about this

00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:13.050
react as well. What this like, uh, actually react to means,

00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:17.070
right? So there is a import that I have done in terms of

00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:20.690
creating agents from a lang chain and this import calls.

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:26.310
Create react agent, create react agent. Now what it is going

00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:30.310
to do basically. So if I'm going to call this create react

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:34.510
agent, it takes a couple of inputs by the way. So the very

00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:38.410
first input, which it requires is LLM access, right? LLM

00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:42.690
access. Second, what it is required is a tools, right?

00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:46.410
Second it requires is a tools. Third, you can try to

00:48:46.410 --> 00:48:48.970
parametrize Barbos. So I think we all know what is the

00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:52.130
meaning of Barbos by the way. Okay. Yep. Uh, if, if you

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:55.510
want, otherwise leave it, it's fine. So LLMs tools, then

00:48:55.510 --> 00:49:00.750
prompt it requires, and then it requires output, output,

00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:05.970
underscore PR, SCR, output parser. So how you are expecting

00:49:05.970 --> 00:49:08.810
the output, this is what it is like, uh, uh, talking about.

00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:14.610
So create react agent. Now how I'm going to create an agent

00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:18.110
by the way, see some functions are available to me, right?

00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:21.410
Some functions are available to me. So to function like a in

00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:24.690
total, and one is using some LLMs and one is not even using

00:49:24.690 --> 00:49:29.070
LLMs, just like a simple mathematical evaluation. Now I'm

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:32.950
trying to create a agent, right? I'm trying to create an

00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:36.610
agent. So where, what I will do is that I will try to pass

00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:40.510
some sort of input. What kind of input I'm going to pass. So

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:44.010
I'm going to say what kind of kind of input, let me write it

00:49:44.010 --> 00:49:47.510
down, write down that as well, that. But, uh, give me a

00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:59.610
poem, right? Based on, uh, based on ERTH night and try to

00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:01.090
execute

00:50:03.110 --> 00:50:08.890
four into six, right? So I'm going to give maybe this kind

00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:11.930
of a prompt, this kind of a, uh, like a input I'm going to

00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:15.090
give a technically whenever I'm going to call the agent. Now

00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:19.390
what is agent? So agent is a smart input. Right? Agent is a

00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:23.130
smart entity. So agent should be able to decide

00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:28.170
automatically that which one I'm supposed to use when, which

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:31.550
one I'm supposed to use, like when I see, I'm just going to

00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:34.410
talk to my agent in a natural language way, right? So this

00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:36.890
is my natural language. This is my natural language as a

00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:39.510
human being, right? So I will be using this natural

00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:42.250
language. I will be using this very simple line line with a

00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:45.590
lot of grammatical mistake. You can say, right, uh, I'm

00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:48.810
going to use it now. My agent. My agent must be able to

00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:53.310
understand that. Okay. Uh, so when I have to generate a

00:50:53.310 --> 00:50:57.230
poem, I have to use maybe this one, right? This function.

00:50:57.610 --> 00:51:01.550
Uh, when I have to execute this, maybe I have to use this

00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:04.330
one and that decision I'm not going to take that decision

00:51:04.330 --> 00:51:06.990
should be taken by whom my agent, that's the reason I'm

00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:09.630
using agent, right? And that to AI agent I'm talking about.

00:51:09.850 --> 00:51:13.610
So it's similar to this example that I've given to you that

00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:16.070
there is a agent system. Now system will take decision

00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:18.570
automatically based on the event. That when it is supposed

00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:21.090
to call, uh, like a check balance function, when it is

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:23.010
supposed to give a call, when it's supposed to take the

00:51:23.010 --> 00:51:25.610
approval, when it's supposed to disapprove all those things.

00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:29.490
So same situation we are trying to replicate even over here

00:51:29.490 --> 00:51:34.030
that I will just talk to my like a system by using unnatural

00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:37.610
language and my system should decide automatically that

00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:39.970
okay, when to use this function and when to use this

00:51:39.970 --> 00:51:43.210
function, is it making sense to all of us guys? What would,

00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:49.730
what we're trying to achieve over here? Yeah. Everyone. Is

00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:51.910
it, is it making sense? Like what, what actually we are

00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:53.950
trying to achieve by the way, uh,

00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:02.350
what is evil? I will, I think I have already discussed about

00:52:02.350 --> 00:52:04.510
that. I've even given you the example of that.

00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:15.640
Yeah. Okay. So, uh, this is where agent comes into a

00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:18.780
picture, right? This is where agent will come. So here, what

00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:21.960
I will do is, so I have these tools isolated and independent

00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:26.120
function. It will become tool, right? It will become tool.

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:29.460
Tool means what? Tool means something which can be used by

00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:33.020
my agent. Okay. Yeah. In an autonomous way. So something

00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:36.200
which can be used by my agent. So how I can convert this as

00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:39.700
a tool, I will be using a decorator decorator from where?

00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:43.840
Lang chain core so that it will be able to get a

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:46.840
functionality of tools means it will be able to get a power

00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:50.420
of tools. So just decorate it. So I believe we all know

00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:53.580
Python, uh, like, uh, we all have gone through a decorator.

00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:56.660
Yeah. And we all understand what is decorator. So now this

00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:59.320
becomes what? Now this becomes a tool. Tool means what?

00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:02.960
Something which can be used by my agent when I'm going to

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:08.120
create it. Yes. Okay. Now I have a multiple tools. So I'm

00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:11.520
going to create a list, basically tools list I'm going to

00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:15.180
create, and then I'm going to pass that. Okay, fine. So my

00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:17.900
agent is having, I can create hundreds of such kind of a

00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:21.300
different, different tools, right? As many functions as I

00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:23.860
want, I can try to create it for a different, different

00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:28.120
purposes. It's a headache. It's a headache of my agent to

00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:31.540
choose which one. At what point of time I'm just leaving

00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:34.620
this a decision to my agent, right? That my agent can

00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:37.220
understand the tools and then it will be able to invoke it

00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:41.320
as per like a it's, it's requirement by the way. So okay. So

00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:43.960
all the tools, if I'm going to create 10 tools, I'm going to

00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:46.580
keep 10 tools over there. That's completely fine. Yep.

00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:51.240
That's completely fine. Now. So tool is done. This is what a

00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:57.460
tool is now. So here my agent create react agent, my agent

00:53:57.460 --> 00:54:01.760
need a tools. Okay. So I try to give a tools, simple tool is

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:04.400
what these two tools I've created. So both the tool access,

00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:07.680
I'm going to give it to my, uh, like a agents by the way.

00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:14.160
Okay. Now agent also require a access of LLMs URI, right? It

00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:17.220
requires URI access or any model access for sure it is

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:20.440
required so that it will be able to take a decision. So how

00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:24.220
I'm going to pass a URI. So chat completion, we are already

00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:27.660
calling it URI completion. Now here you have to do a little

00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:29.780
bit of modification. Okay. So here I have created a class,

00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:34.540
which I have already done to use this URI inside your lang

00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:36.880
chain all the time. All the time is literally all the time,

00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:40.920
right? You have to keep this particular class. Now this

00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:44.240
class has been aligned the class. So this is basically a

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:46.700
static code, right? This class is basically aligned with

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:49.520
this class I have already created. So which will make a URI

00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:52.560
compatible with a lang chain. Similarly I have created a

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:56.180
class which can make it compatible with the Lama indexes and

00:54:56.180 --> 00:55:00.560
all the others one. Okay. So here URI LLMs I can try to

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:05.480
pass. Okay. So I'm going to pass LLM wise what URI LLMs by

00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:08.800
the way. So URI LLM I'm going to pass, right? So this is

00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:13.320
something that I have to keep. Now it requires a prompt. So

00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:16.840
tool I'm able to pass LLMs I'm able to pass, right? So a

00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:20.600
capability of actual AI, the raw AI I'm able to pass now the

00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:24.620
prompt, right? The prompt. Now what should be the prompt? I

00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:27.220
think we all understand prompt, right? We all understand

00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:31.620
prompt. So here I have written a beautiful prompt for this

00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:35.820
particular purpose, right? So I have written this particular

00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:39.520
prompt. Let me show you that part. So it requires a prompt.

00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:42.760
Now see what I have written as a prompt. I think we all know

00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:44.760
what is the meaning of prompt, right? Like it's a plain

00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:48.000
simple English that we write. So here I'm trying to call a

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.240
prompt template from a lang chain itself, right? So that I

00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:55.020
can create a lang chain compatible prompt. So prompt

00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:57.540
template from template. So you are an intelligent agent with

00:55:57.540 --> 00:56:01.940
the access of tool and tool names. Yeah. So what I'm trying

00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:06.480
to do is that I'm saying that, that, okay, so you have this,

00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:11.360
uh, like a access of this particular tool, right? And uh,

00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:15.360
you can try to provide a tool names if you want. So this is

00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:19.640
the tools you have access this tool access. So I'm just

00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:22.960
trying to say my AI agent basically, right? That you are the

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:26.100
agent and you have this particular tool. Yeah. You have this

00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:28.960
particular tool. Strictly what format? So first of all,

00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:32.560
whenever I'm going to give you a task, whenever I'm asking

00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:37.340
you to do something, so first describe what you want to do,

00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:42.180
then try to call the action. So the tool to use one of the

00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:46.360
tool name, which we are going to use, then take a input into

00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:50.140
maybe a black of format and then observation result of the

00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:52.500
action. So repeat thought, action, observation, if needed.

00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:55.940
Thought. I, uh, I now know that. So I'm going to give you

00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:58.520
the final answer. The final answer response to the user then

00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:01.660
begins. So question you are supposed to showcase, and then

00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:06.660
you are basically supposed to give the final answer, right?

00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:09.260
You are supposed to give the final answer. So this is the

00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:13.080
prompting, which I'm trying to do. Now this prompting is

00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:18.040
going to take a input of this LLMs URI LLM. This prompt is

00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:21.880
taking an input of what a tools tools means the functions,

00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:25.300
which I'm going to give. Okay. And then this prompt is

00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:28.740
equals to what this prompt is equal to prompt. Yeah. Now my

00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:32.580
agent is having prompt as well. So comma, comma, comma,

00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:36.440
yeah. So LM access, I have given to my agent, my smart

00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:39.400
agent, right, which can take a decision on itself. Now those

00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:41.420
tool access, I have already given tool miss function access.

00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:44.680
I have already given, right? Uh, again, so a system can

00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:47.040
decide my agent can decide automatically that which one to

00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:49.720
use when a prompt I have given, I have clearly said my

00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:52.540
thoughts and you can change this prompt, right? Just a plain

00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:55.260
single English. So you can keep on modifying your prompt as

00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:58.300
much as you can. It's completely fine. So this system can

00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:00.820
decide a tool. Now there is something called as output

00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:04.720
parser, right? Output parser. So there is something called

00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:11.840
as react this one, this import that I have done. So this

00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:16.480
output parser react single input output parser. So this is

00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:20.240
something which I'm, I'm like a trying to use over here. I

00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:24.140
will be like a. Uh, talking about what is this like a react,

00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:27.720
there is something called as zero sought react. Uh,

00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:30.860
basically what it, uh, what it does is that, uh, it will, it

00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:34.380
will try to like, uh, think first, then it will try to call

00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:37.520
the action. It will try to like, uh, take a action input

00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:41.060
decision. It will try to observe, think again, observe,

00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:43.420
think again, and then it is going to give you the final

00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:45.880
answer. So that is something called as a react single output

00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:48.840
parser. So which is going to help me out in terms of getting

00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:51.460
the output in our best possible way as per that. The output,

00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:55.740
which I'm drawing to give. Yeah. So, okay. So all this four

00:58:55.740 --> 00:59:04.700
thing is done. Now I will, uh, I will try to call this as my

00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:10.000
agent. So this became my A G E N T. So we are able to create

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:13.900
our very first agent. Now this is called as agent agent,

00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:17.100
which is trying to access elements, which is trying to like,

00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:19.880
uh, get an access of multiple functions, which you can, it

00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:23.200
will, it will decide which one to use, then prompt, and then

00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:25.800
what kind of output, which I'm looking for. So this is

00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:30.840
became the agent. Now once you are able to create the agent,

00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:35.160
right, then you have to execute the agent. Yeah. You have to

00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:38.340
create, execute the agent. So that is the reason. So we have

00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:42.820
done the import of agent executor, agent executor. So I can

00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:45.500
try to create a one agent. I can try to create a multiple

00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:49.480
agent, right? Which eventually we are going to create. So A

00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:53.180
G E N T. Agent executor, I can try to call and here, so it

00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:55.940
takes again, couple of parameters. So agent parameters. So

00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:58.800
agent is equal to the agent that I have already created.

00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:03.540
First one, tools, basically. So tool is the tool that we

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:06.960
have already like, uh, created above. I'm going to give an

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:11.680
access, verbose, V E R B O S verbose so that I can try to

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:18.120
see some sort of output. V E R, uh, V E R B O S, B O S C,

01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:21.640
verbose. Verbose is equal to agent. Equals to true. So show

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:26.020
me the things which is going inside the agent and then a

01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:26.940
handle parsing error.

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:37.790
Error is equals to true. Okay. So this is going to be the

01:00:37.790 --> 01:00:41.130
executor, which is going to execute this agent because till

01:00:41.130 --> 01:00:43.350
this point I just created the agent, nothing much, right?

01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:46.830
Uh, maybe I have to create like a multiple agents and one

01:00:46.830 --> 01:00:52.450
agent is calling multiple tools. So here executor variable

01:00:52.450 --> 01:00:55.130
I'm going to create. Now. Now this will be executed, which

01:00:55.130 --> 01:00:57.390
is going to execute my, this particular agent. So here

01:00:57.390 --> 01:01:02.470
executor dot, I can try to call executor dot invoke

01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:07.850
function. So this is how I can execute I N V O K E invoke

01:01:07.850 --> 01:01:14.090
function. Now here I am going to pass my input. Uh, I can

01:01:14.090 --> 01:01:16.830
try to create a UI and then I can try to pass it. So here

01:01:16.830 --> 01:01:19.230
I'm just going to show you like all the execution into a

01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:22.150
command prompt itself. Uh, but yeah, in a later stage in a

01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:25.570
project, I'm going to even show you the UI. Same thing, uh,

01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:28.370
even through a UI. So I'm going to give an input. So my

01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:31.730
input is going to be what? So my input is going to be this

01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:36.900
one simple, give me a poem based on the earth and try to

01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:40.100
execute four plus six executor dot invoke, right? It is

01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:43.400
going to give me some sort of, uh, it is going to give me

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:47.840
some sort of a response, right? So whatever response it is

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:52.300
going to give it to me, I am going to just print what

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:53.700
response?

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.220
Uh. Output response

01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:02.600
output. I'm going to print. So whatever it is going to, uh,

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:08.180
do it. So now this code became fully compatible, I believe.

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:13.900
And now I can create, I can execute this agent with the help

01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:17.400
of this one. Uh, and it says agent is going to understand

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:20.580
this particular part. It is going to understand that when to

01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:23.980
call which tool internally, the tool which I have assigned

01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:28.220
and in a smartest possible way. It will. It will try to give

01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:32.000
me the final answer. Now let me ping you this entire piece

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.660
of the code so that all of you can execute it. Yeah. Now let

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:42.020
me, let me test this code first. Uh, so to test this code, I

01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:51.100
think I am this folder. Yeah. So CLS, Python, Lang chain

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:55.900
demo dot PI function must have dog string if the discussion

01:02:55.900 --> 01:03:00.440
is not provided. Okay. So there is some error. Uh, Lang

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.620
chain importing from the Lang chain community, I would pass

01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:05.120
this, this, this, this, this guard rail warning this, this,

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:08.100
this at the rate tool, which tool is giving me issue by the

01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:11.360
way, line number eight function

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:45.420
must have a dog string. It description is not provided, not

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:48.040
an issue. So what I will do is, uh, I will just try to

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:53.740
create a dog string over here. Uh, this is my expert writer

01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:58.260
for my agent. And then this is my. Yeah. Yeah. This is my

01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:01.340
dog string. I think we all know how to provide it. This is

01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:10.740
my, this is my export math tool. Okay. Now CLS execute

01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:11.020
again.

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:24.980
Hmm. Now see this verbose, you are able to see, right. Uh,

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:27.720
just, uh, mentioned dog string guys, anything you can

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:29.860
mention, whatever line you want, uh, you can try to mention

01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:32.600
it, right. Just as a dog string. And then things are going

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:37.140
to actually work for you. Okay. So here, uh, you must be

01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:41.020
able to see that, uh, I have passed what I have given, uh,

01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:46.260
input as four into six. Okay. Fine. Uh, so I'm able to get

01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:49.900
like a 24. So the result of, uh, like a result of four

01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:53.460
multiplied by six, uh, I have just given this aesthetic and

01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:57.780
a system is able to understand each and everything, uh, and,

01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:02.800
uh, here, just try to see from the beginning. Okay. So

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:07.300
entering new agent execution chain, chain is trying to call

01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:10.520
right chain of thought. So first of all, it is thinking

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:15.160
thought is what, what is the thought of my agent by the way?

01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:18.060
Sorry. So what is the thought of my agent? So I will

01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:20.980
generate a poem about the earth using export writer tool,

01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:24.860
and also perform a calculation four into six using our

01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:29.060
expert math, right now it is trying to call the action

01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:31.580
automatically. So it is trying to call my expert writer

01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:35.160
automatically. Okay. And, uh, action input, please, uh,

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:38.620
please write a poem about the earth, highlighting its

01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:41.460
beauty, diversity, and significance. See, I have not

01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:44.820
mentioned that beauty, diversity, and significance, right?

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:49.020
But it is able to understand the meaning of a earth, the

01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:52.780
context of a earth, right? It is able to understand. And

01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:56.560
then this is the input. This is the input, which is

01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:00.740
eventually going where this is the input eventually going

01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:05.920
inside. Are you? This is here, this place, right? So see, we

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:09.660
are trying to call two times LLMs. One is this LLM. Now this

01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:12.500
LLM, first time when you are trying to call, so basically it

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:15.460
is trying to generate this input action. And then that is

01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:18.340
going in the other one, right? Other one. Now observation,

01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:21.580
waiting for the poem to be generated. So earth, a jewel in

01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:24.120
the cosmic space with the endless beauty, boundless grace,

01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:28.800
mountain rise in the regal might, forest luscious, a word in

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:31.840
sight, right? Ocean deep with the sea grid vast. Diverse

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:35.440
life that holds us fast. Wow. Amazing. It's rhyming. So,

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:38.740
yeah. Uh, so this is something that it is able to do, right?

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:41.300
This is something that it is able to do now. So Lange and

01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:44.160
core expert passing LLM output produce both final answer and

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:47.560
parse able to action thought. I will now perform the

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:52.000
multiplication using the expert math tool. So for a math

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.020
tool, it is creating a input automatically. See

01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:57.640
automatically it is doing it right. I'm not creating a

01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:00.940
separate input for this one, right? I'm not getting a

01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:02.060
separate input. I'm getting a separate input for this one

01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:05.240
and a system is trying to create it automatically right.

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.900
With the help of LLMs observation 24 thought, I know the

01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:11.880
final answer, uh, uh, again, it is the thing. So here is a

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:16.660
poem about the earth and then the result, right? During a

01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:18.600
holding the observation, another exception occurred. Some

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:22.360
exception though. It's fine. Then again, some thinking, uh,

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:25.800
again, it's trying to think right. Final thought. And again,

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:28.720
it is trying to, but I'll home both the strong and fair,

01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:31.960
let's cherish the earth. Our Paris space and result of the

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:35.260
multiply this, this, this, we are able to get as a final

01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:41.260
answer over here. So isn't it beautiful. Are you able to

01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:44.380
understand guys how agent is working actually? And this is

01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:46.200
the very first agent that we are able to create.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Are you guys able to execute it by the way?

01:08:11.890 --> 01:08:16.150
Yes. Yeah. So just check the things like how system is

01:08:16.150 --> 01:08:18.830
behaving and how like system is. This is where the beauty of

01:08:18.830 --> 01:08:22.030
agent comes into a picture. So the very first agent. We are

01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:25.810
able to create. Agent is able to take its own decision to

01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:29.130
call a tool. And now whatever format of the data, those

01:08:29.130 --> 01:08:32.310
tools are required, it is able to pass in that form. It is

01:08:32.310 --> 01:08:34.850
able to generate the data, create a data. It is able to pass

01:08:34.850 --> 01:08:38.730
it. And then it is finally able to give you the answer and

01:08:38.730 --> 01:08:42.230
whatever thought processes, which I have given that part of

01:08:42.230 --> 01:08:45.230
an action, then action input, then observation. It is trying

01:08:45.230 --> 01:08:48.470
to follow all of these steps, right? So means the way I have

01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:52.270
configured my agent. It is behaving in the exact same

01:08:52.270 --> 01:08:58.140
manner. Yeah. So this is the very first agent that we are

01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:03.140
able to create, uh, again, I'm paying you the code. Uh, so

01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:09.660
yeah, you can try to test it. So with Lang chain, I'm able

01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:15.360
to create the agent. Okay. That's good. Now, now what I will

01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:20.500
do is I will try to show you something with a Lang graph.

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:25.910
Now they're going to say yes. Facing. No. No sign up on this

01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:28.470
queue. Yeah. Cool. Now close everything. Yeah. Close

01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:32.230
everything. Now I'll try to create one more file lengthy. G

01:09:32.230 --> 01:09:36.470
Natalie pH dot PI file, or maybe I can write it as a Lang

01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:42.310
graph, uh, underscored demo demo dot by five. Now under the

01:09:42.310 --> 01:09:45.310
hood, right? Under the hood, LAING graph is using Lang

01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:48.430
chains itself. Landigh is not different, even plate

01:09:48.430 --> 01:09:52.130
permetha. is available or Lang Pro authority itself. The

01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:55.950
only thing is. The way we try to create a graphpped. where

01:09:55.950 --> 01:09:58.910
we will be having a node a different different nodes right

01:09:58.910 --> 01:10:00.990
this is the meaning of a graph a different different kind of

01:10:00.990 --> 01:10:03.970
a node now all those nodes will be connected to each other

01:10:03.970 --> 01:10:07.890
right connected to each other with some logics so this is

01:10:07.890 --> 01:10:10.530
where this lang graph comes into a picture which helps you

01:10:10.530 --> 01:10:15.310
out in terms of solving a complex query right complex query

01:10:15.310 --> 01:10:20.950
so let's move ahead and quickly quickly try to create a lang

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:23.930
graph demo which i have already prepared and it's very easy

01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:27.030
to understand believe me right so i'm calling what lang

01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:30.330
graph i'm calling like a dictionary type i'm calling uri

01:10:30.330 --> 01:10:33.010
same uri llm i'm trying to call yeah nothing different

01:10:33.010 --> 01:10:37.310
because llm is required now so here i'm trying to use a

01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:42.350
pidentic one uh try to define the graph state and here so

01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:45.490
i'm trying to create two functions so one is a researcher

01:10:45.490 --> 01:10:49.450
function and one is a summarizer function so that researcher

01:10:49.450 --> 01:10:52.410
will be able to do a research and summarizer will be able to

01:10:52.410 --> 01:10:56.190
summarize it both is internally calling uri completion now

01:10:56.190 --> 01:10:59.930
both are basically what both are independent function not

01:10:59.930 --> 01:11:03.730
connected to each other at all yeah i am going to connect it

01:11:03.730 --> 01:11:06.910
i'm going to connect it with what so i'm going to connect it

01:11:06.910 --> 01:11:10.550
with the help of this graph i'm going to connect it with the

01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:14.230
help of this graph so here i'm trying to create this graph

01:11:14.230 --> 01:11:18.850
object as you can see and graph dot add node so here

01:11:18.850 --> 01:11:23.630
technically what i'm trying to do is that i am trying to

01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:27.670
create one node of the graph i'm trying to call this graph

01:11:27.670 --> 01:11:33.970
node as a research node yeah research node which will try to

01:11:33.970 --> 01:11:36.750
do a research now what this node will do whatever i'm going

01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:39.530
to keep it here so it is going to just do a research just a

01:11:39.530 --> 01:11:43.250
research nothing much right and then there is a another

01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:46.650
graph i'm going to create which is going to give me what

01:11:46.650 --> 01:11:49.510
summary as of now I am just using two but believe me very

01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:53.170
soon I will try to show you that I am going to use a tense

01:11:53.170 --> 01:11:56.410
as per your project basically because as of now I am

01:11:56.410 --> 01:11:59.110
learning I am just trying to teach you the basic so it's

01:11:59.110 --> 01:12:02.150
just a ABCD of that but yeah very soon the things is going

01:12:02.150 --> 01:12:06.370
to change. So here this is the one node this is another node

01:12:06.370 --> 01:12:09.150
now both node is a specialized in itself a specialized means

01:12:09.150 --> 01:12:11.450
like whatever I have written inside the function it will

01:12:11.450 --> 01:12:13.930
just do that simple if I have written that okay fine just

01:12:13.930 --> 01:12:17.390
like do the research I have written that research this one

01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:20.250
so it will just research right now I have written that

01:12:20.250 --> 01:12:23.970
summarize whatever like I am giving you so it will summarize

01:12:23.970 --> 01:12:27.110
very simple right so one is going to do a research one is

01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:29.770
going to do a summarization as per the input which I am

01:12:29.770 --> 01:12:34.790
going to pass nothing much okay so both are independent

01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:37.470
function at the end of the day you can say you can call that

01:12:37.470 --> 01:12:41.390
as a tool as well. Now so this one now I am trying to set

01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:44.530
the entry point. That from anywhere you have to start right

01:12:44.530 --> 01:12:46.750
either you should give an input to a summary and ask

01:12:46.750 --> 01:12:50.010
summarize first and then research later or you can try to

01:12:50.010 --> 01:12:52.650
ask research first and then summarize later whatever suits

01:12:52.650 --> 01:12:55.850
you right whatever suits you so I am trying to say that that

01:12:55.850 --> 01:13:00.690
no first do what so entry first do the research now whatever

01:13:00.690 --> 01:13:04.250
output it is going to give you then try to do this one so

01:13:04.250 --> 01:13:06.770
this is what I have written set entry point so researcher is

01:13:06.770 --> 01:13:10.310
going to be my entry point this is the name of the node I

01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:12.710
have given you can try to give. You can give whatever name

01:13:12.710 --> 01:13:16.730
that you want x y g does not matter at all right then add

01:13:16.730 --> 01:13:20.490
edge. Edge means this one connecting add edge, edge means

01:13:20.490 --> 01:13:23.490
what connect right connect this one if I have to create

01:13:23.490 --> 01:13:26.890
another graph I will try to add one more edge right again I

01:13:26.890 --> 01:13:28.770
will try to create one more node if I have to create another

01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:31.470
graph I will try to create another one at the edge so this

01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:34.610
is how easy it is right connecting one one one one through

01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:37.390
another one right if I have to connect parallel to this one

01:13:37.390 --> 01:13:41.970
I can do that as well possible right so add edge. So, I am

01:13:41.970 --> 01:13:45.870
trying to add edge so like a researcher with summarizer

01:13:45.870 --> 01:13:49.070
researcher this is my researcher with summarizer I am trying

01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:51.610
to just connect it just connect these two right just connect

01:13:51.610 --> 01:13:55.150
these two and set finish point so where it should finish so

01:13:55.150 --> 01:13:57.590
it should finish at the summary if I am going to write down

01:13:57.590 --> 01:14:01.630
that okay finish at researcher but those two are added so it

01:14:01.630 --> 01:14:04.790
will do what it will do a research right it will go to the

01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:07.630
summarizer then summarizer will come back to the researcher

01:14:07.630 --> 01:14:11.490
once again both are connected. So, I can try to add a

01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:13.970
finisher. Finish point and it will keep on like running

01:14:13.970 --> 01:14:17.630
through those one those finish point and then what so then

01:14:17.630 --> 01:14:23.070
call the compilation and then invoke it invoke it and here

01:14:23.070 --> 01:14:26.090
so by invoking so I am trying to give an input that impact

01:14:26.090 --> 01:14:29.950
of AI in healthcare now this is my input right this is my

01:14:29.950 --> 01:14:34.990
input so now it will go where so it will go to the graph it

01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:38.390
will technically go where so it will go to the graph simple

01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:41.190
when you are going to invoke this one graph invoke compile

01:14:41.190 --> 01:14:44.410
graph. So, it will go to the graph and we have basically two

01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:47.750
things two node connected to each other entry point is what

01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:51.790
entry point is basically a research one research one and

01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:54.350
this is the basically summarized one so here it is supposed

01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:59.650
to end so this is my entry and this is my end point right so

01:14:59.650 --> 01:15:02.750
it will try to enter into this one it will try to give some

01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:05.090
output it will try to send this output to the summarizer

01:15:05.090 --> 01:15:07.270
summarizer will summarize it and then it is going to end it

01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:12.570
now these are the two separate separate things. I am able to

01:15:12.570 --> 01:15:16.070
a separate separate tool I am able to connect inside a graph

01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:21.910
edge you can see is it making sense to all of us guys so

01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:26.610
isn't it easy I think it looks easy to all of us right guys

01:15:26.610 --> 01:15:27.490
so

01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:38.640
this is basically graph yeah

01:15:46.450 --> 01:15:51.950
okay let's let's go ahead and execute it so CLS and here so

01:15:51.950 --> 01:15:53.710
python python

01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:02.400
lang graph demo dot pi. Now see what it is. What is it? What

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:03.900
is going to happen okay

01:16:12.030 --> 01:16:15.170
so now final summary I am going to get it the article

01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:17.450
discussed how artificial intelligence is transforming

01:16:17.450 --> 01:16:21.030
healthcare across a domain AI enhances this this this this

01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:25.790
this so in no time I am able to like a get this one right I

01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:28.410
am able to get the final summary this is what I was looking

01:16:28.410 --> 01:16:32.550
for right this is what ultimately I was looking for and yes

01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:38.330
I am able to get this particular summary this is how graph

01:16:38.330 --> 01:16:41.990
works guys you can try to create as many. Nodes as possible

01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:46.050
and you can just like a keep on calling it as much as you

01:16:46.050 --> 01:16:48.110
want as much as you can okay

01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:02.010
so now.

01:17:05.690 --> 01:17:11.130
Let's try to execute a basically a llama index yeah llama

01:17:11.130 --> 01:17:15.250
index so here let's try to create again we are going to

01:17:15.250 --> 01:17:20.130
create the agent and then execute it so llama index llama

01:17:20.130 --> 01:17:27.990
index dot. Undo. underscore demo dot pi file okay so let's

01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:35.050
try to execute it now to use this URI inside a llama index

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:39.110
you can't use it directly by the way you can't use it

01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:43.350
directly so I have created a wrapper now going forward

01:17:43.350 --> 01:17:47.870
whenever you are going to use URI for a llama index you

01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:50.990
don't have to do anything basically just use this one simple

01:17:50.990 --> 01:17:54.670
right. Just. Use this one and it is it is going to work for

01:17:54.670 --> 01:18:00.590
you so this is a llama index wrapper which I have already

01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:04.070
created this is going to be the constant one this is going

01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:08.610
to be the constant one at any point of a time here you have

01:18:08.610 --> 01:18:11.390
to change the tools so I'll tell you like what you have to

01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:14.510
change by the way so here you have to change but yeah rest

01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:17.390
of the things is going to be same you don't have to do

01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:20.410
anything means literally you don't have to do anything till.

01:18:20.410 --> 01:18:24.610
Until a callback manager this piece of code is required to

01:18:24.610 --> 01:18:31.110
make my URI compatible directly with a llama index and again

01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:34.650
if version is going to change so even this is going to

01:18:34.650 --> 01:18:40.430
change now so llama index again so it will be able to you

01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:46.070
know execute a different different kind of a tools like is

01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:48.230
it it is going to execute a different different kind of a

01:18:48.230 --> 01:18:52.330
tools and. You can try to pass any kind of a chat based on

01:18:52.330 --> 01:18:54.810
the chat it is going to work it is going to behave so let me

01:18:54.810 --> 01:18:59.230
show you that part creating a tool and invoking those tools

01:18:59.230 --> 01:19:03.790
via agent is not a big deal even in llama index so here let

01:19:03.790 --> 01:19:11.550
me like do something so I have created a couple of tools

01:19:11.550 --> 01:19:15.790
over here so one tool simple

01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:21.160
python function so tools are nothing but just a basic python

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:25.720
function. I have written to give you a demo and that that

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:27.720
too it's a very small one I have written

01:19:31.290 --> 01:19:35.310
okay so there is a three tools uppercase means whatever

01:19:35.310 --> 01:19:38.390
input you will give it will convert that into a uppercase

01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:42.710
simple right string function Wikipedia search so I am trying

01:19:42.710 --> 01:19:46.250
to import over here a Wikipedia what it will do is it will

01:19:46.250 --> 01:19:49.170
try to go and search whatever input that you are going to

01:19:49.170 --> 01:19:53.310
give it is going to search a Wikipedia simple calculator so

01:19:53.310 --> 01:19:57.470
whatever like a string you are going to pass just now we

01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:59.830
have used it right just now we have used it so it is going

01:19:59.830 --> 01:20:02.670
to evaluate it and it is going to give you the final answer

01:20:03.670 --> 01:20:07.890
okay so these are the three tools uppercase Wikipedia search

01:20:07.890 --> 01:20:10.810
and calculator so there are three tools that we have created

01:20:10.810 --> 01:20:14.690
right a tool means three functions we have created and I am

01:20:14.690 --> 01:20:18.730
going to use all of these tools inside a llama index how I

01:20:18.730 --> 01:20:24.790
can use it so there is a wrapper. Okay. Called as function

01:20:24.790 --> 01:20:31.190
tool dot from from default

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:39.000
and then here as a function parameter you can try to pass to

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:43.080
uppercase yeah you can try to pass to uppercase so whatever

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:46.760
tool that you have created for example even in langchain we

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:50.100
had a multiple tools and we were keeping those tools as a

01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:54.280
list as a list same you have to do over here is that same

01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:57.420
thing right. So the only thing is like this became one tool

01:20:57.420 --> 01:21:00.340
so function tool function tool which is a part of which will

01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:04.500
help to like a which will help basically these these

01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:09.060
functions to become a tool for example in a langchain so we

01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:11.480
were trying to do this one we were trying to basically

01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:14.340
decorate it right so decorator is a function which was

01:21:14.340 --> 01:21:17.320
available inside the langchain here in case of a llama index

01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:20.420
we are doing the exact same thing not very different at all

01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:23.860
but yeah only the way is different function tool so how I

01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:25.960
can convert those things into a function tool by calling

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:28.820
function tool from defaults and it is going to convert it D

01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:32.880
E F A U L T S by the way yeah so one tool I am able to

01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:38.420
convert it and then again like a call same thing so three

01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:41.660
tools in total I have so three times I am going to call it

01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:53.720
okay so three times one is basically a Wikipedia search and

01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:56.760
then another one is what so calculator I believe that we

01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:59.860
have created so okay to uppercase Wikipedia search and

01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:03.920
calculate so three tool. Now this is just a process and it's

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:06.160
not very different from a langchain even in langchain we

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:07.900
have done the same thing we have kept all the tool inside

01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:11.380
the list right and we had a process of converting a simple

01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:14.540
plain function to a tool by using a decorator now here we

01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:17.180
are using just this function this is the provision which has

01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:19.480
been given into a llama index because llama index belongs to

01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:22.080
a different organization so people have written a code into

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:25.440
a different way but technically doing the same thing so

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:29.080
tools so this is my three tools which I have provided okay.

01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:37.240
tools right now what I can do is so I can try to call my

01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:47.410
react agent react agent a g e n t a react agent dot from

01:22:47.410 --> 01:22:53.630
underscore tools right from underscore tools and then here

01:22:53.630 --> 01:22:59.950
you can try to pass your tool. So inside this you can try to

01:22:59.950 --> 01:23:06.910
pass your tools. LLM. LLM is equals to URI AI LLM URI

01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:13.040
AI LLM the class that you have created you have to use this

01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:16.400
one and this class is using other things so LLM is required

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:21.480
so LLM I have provided just like even a langchain right. So

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:25.240
what was required so basically LLM is required tool was

01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:28.700
required prompt I have already mentioned same thing I am

01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:34.360
trying to do it over here so tool LLM and we are our BOS

01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:44.130
Barbos we are our BOS Barbos is equals to TRUE and here

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:50.180
tool

01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:59.000
choice mode is equals to always always it can try to choose

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.540
the tools to make a decision to like a run things okay.

01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:10.720
Now so what we can do is this is my agent by the way. So

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:17.620
this is called as a g e n t agent inside this one this is my

01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:20.480
agent so technically it's not very different from a

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:24.000
langchain that we have created right the only way is like

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.520
it's library little bit different and that library was

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:30.000
little bit different and here so the major portion is

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.100
basically my URI compatibility. So my URI compatibility soon

01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:38.120
I am going to push this particular piece of a code inside

01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:42.000
URI SDK pi pi as well. So that you don't have to even call

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.140
this entire class you just have to call one single like a

01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:50.200
line over here so URI AI and then URI for LAMA indexes so

01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:53.180
like all these things will be gone in single sort everything

01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:56.500
will be gone from here till here right everything will be

01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:59.100
gone that I will do it I was not able to get a time to like

01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:02.840
maintain my SDKs so I have not done that but yeah so as and

01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:05.260
when I will get time I will just make it in a single

01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:09.980
function itself okay. So URI LLM everything is fine. Like

01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:15.760
this is my agent now if I have to like a execute my agent so

01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:24.160
agent dot chat now chat what chat what so I can say that

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:31.940
that okay now tell me something about something about a

01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:39.780
first world war from wikipedia. See. See. See. So you can

01:25:39.780 --> 01:25:42.740
see that I have given a multiple tool axis 3 tool axis right

01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:47.200
it will decide automatically that which one to use this is

01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:49.880
what agent does right this is what agent does so here agent

01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:53.060
dot chat and I'm just going to chat chat with my agent so

01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:57.340
what I'm going to do is I'm going to like a clean everything

01:25:57.340 --> 01:26:01.260
and then I'm going to call Python double

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:15.160
LMA Lama index demo and let's see. So you everything will be

01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:16.220
fine. So yeah.

01:26:22.770 --> 01:26:26.790
it is initiating a chain of thoughts we'll go through the

01:26:26.790 --> 01:26:29.390
chain of thoughts this is coming from verbose is equal to

01:26:29.390 --> 01:26:35.050
true reached a maximum iterations okay the

01:26:41.130 --> 01:26:43.710
most wikipedia page id the

01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:11.680
okay so from wikipedia it is like uh not matching it has

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:15.680
tried very hard error from wikipedia page id first world war

01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:21.600
uh match uh try another id okay so error from wikipedia so

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:24.400
again and again it is trying so again again destroying it is

01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:29.500
trying to build a plan and uh yeah it is not able to like uh

01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:35.520
hit this wikipedia by the way so wikipedia search so

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:44.020
there is an issue with a wikipedia search let

01:27:51.890 --> 01:27:55.850
me share this code with all of you guys that even you can

01:27:55.850 --> 01:27:59.710
test it so you can test it guys okay

01:28:02.590 --> 01:28:05.310
i'll just try to give some other query then yeah let's see

01:28:05.310 --> 01:28:09.030
whether it's going to work or not so because with traces it

01:28:09.030 --> 01:28:15.490
is telling me that so i have a upper case right function so

01:28:15.490 --> 01:28:20.530
maybe let's try to access uppercase so here uh

01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:25.290
i'm going to like a call convert

01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:33.080
my name and

01:28:35.830 --> 01:28:42.070
convert my url convert my name is sudhanshu to upper case

01:28:42.070 --> 01:28:46.550
okay so let's see whether it is able to understand my nlp or

01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:50.010
not and based on that it is able to invoke a tools or not

01:28:50.010 --> 01:28:50.910
yeah

01:28:55.070 --> 01:29:00.870
so amazing right see i have given a query just by using nlp

01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:04.690
right it was having three tools access it was having three

01:29:04.690 --> 01:29:08.930
tools access now automatically it is able to use one of the

01:29:08.930 --> 01:29:14.010
tool yes everyone so as you can see wikipedia was giving

01:29:14.010 --> 01:29:17.670
some issues so like it is able to call what see action wise

01:29:17.670 --> 01:29:20.630
it is able to call two uppercase what is my two uppercase by

01:29:20.630 --> 01:29:23.770
the way two uppercase is my function right this function so

01:29:23.770 --> 01:29:27.250
two uppercase it is able to prepare its input which is my

01:29:27.250 --> 01:29:30.910
name is sudhanshu only this part right i have written

01:29:30.910 --> 01:29:34.510
something in our english very much english right up not very

01:29:34.510 --> 01:29:37.710
much english it is a complete english nlp and it is able to

01:29:37.710 --> 01:29:40.830
understand my agent is able to understand and now based on

01:29:40.830 --> 01:29:46.110
the task which i have asked to do it it is able to do that

01:29:46.110 --> 01:29:49.790
task by choosing a particular tool automatically that's

01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:55.720
the reason so nowadays mcps are getting very much popular

01:29:55.720 --> 01:30:00.020
right because what mcp does so basically mcp is going to

01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:02.960
like it's a model contest protocol right so basically mcp

01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:06.520
will be able to invoke some of the tools and those who are

01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:10.160
not aware about mcp those who don't know how to build mcp so

01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:13.340
please go through my mcp 10 projects which is already

01:30:13.340 --> 01:30:16.140
available to all of you that too with the code and

01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:20.560
explanation you will be able to understand i have created

01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:24.640
multiple mcps i have integrated those mcp with the cloud a i

01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:29.840
have integrated those mcp with the mcp inspectors so yeah so

01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:36.140
isn't it amazing guys yes okay

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:41.460
i can try to invoke mp calculator right so i can try to like

01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:44.340
a write a query over here multiple queries i can try to

01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:48.940
write agent dot chat and then i can try to write over here

01:30:48.940 --> 01:30:55.460
that give me a 3 cross 4 i'm just writing this i'm leaving

01:30:55.460 --> 01:31:01.980
up to my agents to do whatever like it want and execute it

01:31:01.980 --> 01:31:08.180
can i say this tool act as a mcp exactly it is going to work

01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:11.180
as a mcp what you have to do is see the way i'm converting

01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:14.740
this tool in case of Lama index by using this one, right?

01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:17.880
I'm trying to make it as a tool in case of language and I'm

01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:20.680
using a decorator function because every library will be

01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:22.900
having its own way, right? People have written that. So here

01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:26.000
I'm converting this function by using what, by using this

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:30.080
decorator in the case of MCP, you try to use MCP decorator

01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:34.980
and you convert your function into a tools. So this is

01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:37.660
nothing very different as you can see, right? So it's just a

01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:41.020
way of like, uh, doing it so that this tool will be now see,

01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:44.740
uh, so, uh, it is automatic. So I have asked two questions,

01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:48.340
convert my name, my name is Ranshu in uppercase. So it is

01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:52.180
able to do that. And for seeing it is able to convert. So

01:31:52.180 --> 01:31:55.880
first task, second task was, uh, uh, give me three cross

01:31:55.880 --> 01:32:00.060
four. Now system itself is able to decide that which tool it

01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:03.240
is supposed to call. See calculator tool automatically. I

01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:05.800
never said that go and call calculator tool. I have just

01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:08.520
given the choice. I have just given like, let's suppose I

01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:13.080
have created maybe, uh, 200 tools, 300 tools, 500 tools,

01:32:13.220 --> 01:32:16.460
right? One tool is sending an email at email. One tool is

01:32:16.460 --> 01:32:18.880
doing this. One tool is doing that. Right? So likewise, I

01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:22.400
have created a multiple tool means multiple functions. Now I

01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:25.200
just have to chat with my agent. So in, in your next class,

01:32:25.300 --> 01:32:28.100
I'm going to show you like, I just have to configure this as

01:32:28.100 --> 01:32:31.520
a UI, right? So I'm going to create a stimulate UI and

01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:34.240
through UI, you will like, uh, write this one and whatever,

01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:37.160
whatever you want. And the system will execute it.

01:32:41.330 --> 01:32:44.290
Yeah. So system is taking a decision that out of this two

01:32:44.290 --> 01:32:47.190
tools or maybe 2000 tools, which one I'm supposed to call in

01:32:47.190 --> 01:32:50.950
which situation. So it, it is able to like decide that,

01:32:51.010 --> 01:32:54.890
okay, in case of uppercase call one function in case of like

01:32:54.890 --> 01:32:58.030
a, this one called the other one, right? Calculator one. And

01:32:58.030 --> 01:33:02.010
that you are able to see in your verbose. Is it making sense

01:33:02.010 --> 01:33:05.810
to all of us guys, are we able to understand what is agent,

01:33:05.970 --> 01:33:08.410
how we are creating an agent? How does behaving? How it is

01:33:08.410 --> 01:33:11.030
working? What is the meaning of a tool? What is the meaning

01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:14.630
of an agent? And this frameworks is this clear?

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:25.900
Yeah. So they will be saying your MCPC is also amazing.

01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:28.640
Yeah. You can just go through it and see, I don't like, uh,

01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:31.380
you know, like talking about things in a black, uh,

01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:33.680
theoretical manner, because at the end of the, it doesn't

01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:36.660
matter how much theory you are going to teach. It is not

01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:39.100
going to help anyone because we are not here to give some

01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:41.920
exam. We are here to build something. Well, you know,

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.220
practical manner, I have explained you even like a, in that

01:33:44.220 --> 01:33:49.940
MCP. So you can just go explore, reuse it. Yeah. So is it

01:33:49.940 --> 01:33:53.620
clear to all of you that what is a meaning of agent guys?

01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:56.100
See, try to understand core concept doesn't matter which

01:33:56.100 --> 01:33:57.880
framework you are going to use tomorrow. Maybe you are going

01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:02.200
to use in it. And I'm like, it is not different under the

01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:05.000
hood, it's doing the same thing, right? The only thing is it

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.960
has been created by someone else. So it's library works in a

01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:09.960
different way. See, that's the reason why I'm showing you

01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:12.740
comparison between this llama index and land chain. Now,

01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:15.120
this organization is different. This organization is

01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:18.160
different. So they both have created their like a library.

01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:20.980
They have written the code in a different way, but under the

01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:23.580
hood, you are able to understand when you see altogether

01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:26.600
that philosophy is same philosophy is not different at all.

01:34:29.210 --> 01:34:34.530
Can you show that course? Just try to search like a MCP. You

01:34:34.530 --> 01:34:40.620
can go to here and then search for MCP yellow color. This

01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:44.380
one is this one. So 10 project I have like a given to you

01:34:44.380 --> 01:34:50.080
over here. Yeah. A good one. By the way, the project that

01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:54.020
you can write into a resume. So here, right? So under the

01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:57.420
hood, whether I'm going to go ahead with the land chain, or

01:34:57.420 --> 01:35:00.020
maybe I'm going ahead with the llama indexes, not making

01:35:00.020 --> 01:35:03.920
very much different for me. Yeah. It's like the concept of

01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:06.820
tool, the concept of agent, the concept of LLMs that it is

01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:10.000
trying to invoke exactly same philosophy is exactly same.

01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:13.300
The only part is libraries are different. That's it.

01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:21.420
Automatically request is mapping to the function. This is

01:35:21.420 --> 01:35:23.680
where agent comes into. The picture that this is where the

01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:27.480
beauty of agent is right. So automatically. So now, even if

01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:30.180
I am going to create, now I can create thousands of

01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:34.040
functions, right? X, Y, G, any kind of function, any number

01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:36.000
of function, I can try to create thousands of functions. I

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.660
can try to create, or someone else has created thousands of

01:35:38.660 --> 01:35:41.680
functions, right? Maybe to connect to my Excel sheet, maybe

01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:44.580
to like a send email, maybe to send a notification to my

01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:48.380
user, uh, maybe to like, uh, you know, uh, do some sort of

01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:52.600
a, like a scrapping of the website. Okay. And I'll just

01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:56.160
chat, I'll just chat with my like a agent with the help of

01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:58.780
some UI or here itself. I'll just chat. I'll just give a,

01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:01.680
uh, like, you know, command or not a command. I would say

01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:04.420
just like a human being, I'll ask that, okay, do this for

01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:07.200
me. It will decide automatically that, okay, this tool I'm

01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:10.560
going to use or that tool I'm going to use. So this is where

01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:13.340
beauty of agent comes into a picture by the way. Okay. Now

01:36:13.340 --> 01:36:17.200
moving to the next. So this, all these things are done right

01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:23.160
now. Let me show you. Now a crew AI demo, three platform is

01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:28.490
done, right? Now I'll show you the crew AI demo, crew AI

01:36:28.490 --> 01:36:33.530
underscore demo dot PI. Not very different, right? Under the

01:36:33.530 --> 01:36:36.350
hood, it is using Langchain by the way. So crew AI is

01:36:36.350 --> 01:36:40.730
actually going to use a Langchain and, uh, again, so, uh, to

01:36:40.730 --> 01:36:45.250
make URI compatible with a crew AI. So there is a wrapper,

01:36:45.390 --> 01:36:48.770
which I have written, right? So you have to basically, uh,

01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:51.570
use those wrappers. Then only. Similarly, you will be able

01:36:51.570 --> 01:36:55.390
to use like a URI with the LLMs, otherwise, uh, you won't be

01:36:55.390 --> 01:36:57.090
able to use it because

01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:05.700
these are very much dependent on other different, different.

01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:07.820
So this is just a wrapper guys. I just have to push this

01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:10.940
code to a PiPi. Uh, once I'm going to put this code to a

01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:14.920
PiPi, the only line which is required by you will be this

01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:18.000
one, nothing much, only this much LLM, URI, LLM wrapper.

01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:21.980
That's it. And all done. Yeah. So this, this, you don't have

01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:25.320
to do, this is just a wrapper to make it compatible. So this

01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:27.400
is the reason I have written that. Right? Because every

01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:30.780
library that they have created, whether it's a crew, whether

01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:34.500
it's a LLM, whether it's a LANG, right? So they are taking a

01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:37.880
LLM inputs into a different, different way, right? And

01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:41.220
again, the way they're changing the version. So again, that

01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:44.820
expectations and the way it is trying to do a mapping of the

01:37:44.820 --> 01:37:48.440
input and the output is like a changing. So keeping that in

01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:52.540
our mind. So I have to align my URI accordingly because URI

01:37:52.540 --> 01:37:55.200
is LLM, it can do everything, but I have to make it

01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:58.760
compatible with that. With their input. So after some time

01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:01.460
you will just need only this much, 27 number line. You don't

01:38:01.460 --> 01:38:04.520
have to like go ahead and like write anything and

01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:17.880
okay. So LLM I'm able to create, LLM is something which a

01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:24.200
crew will need, right? Now let's do one thing, right? So now

01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:27.920
let's go ahead and let's try to create the agent. So crew

01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:33.080
AI, generally it's famous for a multi agent system, right?

01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:35.560
Multi agents, like a land graph, we were using a multiple

01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:39.400
agents, even crew is or multiple tools over there. So you

01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:44.380
can connect the tools in between. So a crew AI, which is

01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:49.180
going to like allow you to use a multiple agent, configure a

01:38:49.180 --> 01:38:54.220
multiple agent, uh, give a task to a multiple agent into a

01:38:54.220 --> 01:38:56.600
different, different way. And this is something I'm going to

01:38:56.600 --> 01:39:00.780
show you now. So with a simple example, so this is my

01:39:00.780 --> 01:39:04.260
researcher agent. So in crew. It's very easy, plain and

01:39:04.260 --> 01:39:06.980
simple to create the agent, simple call agent function,

01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:11.080
simple call agent function. Fine. So in a crew AI, there is

01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:14.740
a agent function. Now what agent take? So agent takes

01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:18.300
basically a role. So you can say that what you are, right?

01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:23.080
What this particular agent is now goal. Yeah. Goal. Then you

01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:25.780
can try to add some backstory if you want. I have written a

01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:28.000
very small, small, like a things, but yeah, you can try to

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.500
like, uh, do more. Barbos is equal to true so that you can

01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:34.840
get a output in a, this one. And then LLM is equal to LLM.

01:39:34.900 --> 01:39:37.920
So fine. Agent is this. Now there is a researcher agent.

01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:40.360
There is a writer agent. I have created over here, role,

01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:42.660
technical writer, goal, this, this, this, this, this, and

01:39:42.660 --> 01:39:46.140
simple. So researcher and writer agent, I'm able to create

01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:51.740
now. So once you are able to create a agent, uh, basically,

01:39:51.740 --> 01:39:56.340
so you have to give a task to this agent. Uh, so researcher

01:39:56.340 --> 01:39:58.700
agent, writer agent, two agent I have created, right? Two

01:39:58.700 --> 01:40:02.200
person I have created. Then to all this two person, I'm

01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:05.080
going to assign a task. So description, research on a future

01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:08.540
of generative AI, expected output, a detailed summary of the

01:40:08.540 --> 01:40:10.960
current and the future trend of generative AI, then agent,

01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:14.460
which agent. So researcher agent is supposed to use and then

01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:18.680
task. So again, for task task two. So I'm giving this to my

01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:24.780
writer agent now. So I can try to create any number of

01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:27.660
tasks. First of all, I can try to create any number of agent

01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:32.120
second of all, but, but the main thing is a configuration.

01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:36.100
Okay. So this is where this crew comes into picture. Crew

01:40:36.100 --> 01:40:38.820
means what crew means bunch of people, right? Crew means

01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:43.480
what crew means bunch of people, by the way. So here I am

01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:48.420
trying to configure a crew, crew of agent, and then a task

01:40:48.420 --> 01:40:51.820
and verbose is nothing but just to get a print over here. So

01:40:51.820 --> 01:40:56.460
this is going to be two agent. And whatever I'm going to ask

01:40:56.460 --> 01:41:02.200
to this particular agent, they are basically going to do it

01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:08.180
based on the task, which I am going to define as simple as

01:41:08.180 --> 01:41:11.460
that. Yeah. So based on the task, which I'm going to define,

01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:16.760
so these agents are basically going to do the task. Okay.

01:41:16.940 --> 01:41:21.000
Fine. By accessing the access, by accessing the LLMs, by the

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:24.020
way. So here URI

01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:28.000
LLM, let me pass that.

01:41:42.740 --> 01:41:46.900
Can we discuss even a flow also in the next classes? What

01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:47.720
flow by the way?

01:41:54.570 --> 01:41:58.510
Okay. So once my crew is created, what I can do is I can try

01:41:58.510 --> 01:42:03.390
to call crew.kickoff. So here what I can do is I can try to

01:42:03.390 --> 01:42:07.950
call a result to function and result is nothing but crew. My

01:42:07.950 --> 01:42:13.990
crew that I have created crew.kickoff, K-I-C-K-O-F-F, crew

01:42:13.990 --> 01:42:18.570
.kickoff. And this is going to like give me the result. I

01:42:18.570 --> 01:42:22.370
can try to print basically what result over.

01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:29.960
I can try to print the result over. Here as simple as that.

01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:37.820
Yeah. As simple as that. So this is what crew is going to do

01:42:37.820 --> 01:42:41.220
guys. And then it is going to print the result, a final

01:42:41.220 --> 01:42:44.380
result. Let me test it now,

01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:54.500
CLS and here Python.

01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:01.140
Let's see if there is an error because it will give you an

01:43:01.140 --> 01:43:03.800
error max to max with respect to the LLMs that I'm using.

01:43:04.900 --> 01:43:08.740
Working agent. AI research. Starting the work. Observation.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:09.880
Okay. Fine.

01:43:13.370 --> 01:43:16.050
Dedicated work to the co-worker, which is our technical

01:43:16.050 --> 01:43:20.490
writer. So technical writer awaiting for the response from

01:43:20.490 --> 01:43:26.080
the technical writer. Okay so entering a new crew agent

01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:26.560
chain.

01:43:32.380 --> 01:43:40.780
So whatever I have asked for, it is able to generate things

01:43:40.780 --> 01:43:43.960
for me it seems. So working agent. Technical writer.

01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:46.480
Starting task. Writing an article based on the research.

01:43:46.660 --> 01:43:49.840
Okay. Research is done. So now it is like going for the

01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:55.200
article writing. Conclusion. Okay. So now see how

01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:58.160
beautifully I'll show you the complete flow. This is the

01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:03.080
beauty of the verbose. So here I'm just trying to call my

01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:06.480
crew. Right. I'm just going to call my crew. And I simply

01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:10.060
said that that try to go ahead and like do some sort of a

01:44:10.060 --> 01:44:13.320
research and then try to, you know, write something. Some

01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:17.600
article on top of this one. So here in it is, it is trying

01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:20.320
to call working agent AI researcher. Right. So that is my

01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:24.380
entry point. Starting task research on the future of

01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:28.480
generative AI. So entering a new crew AI chain thought I

01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:30.320
need to gather the comprehensive and detailed information.

01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:33.340
Current trend. Future. This, this, this. Action. Dedicated

01:44:33.340 --> 01:44:38.360
worker to co-worker. So once like it will be able to. So I

01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:41.240
should first collect the recent research paper. Industry

01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:45.160
report. And expert opinion that analyze the state of the art

01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:47.040
generative AI, including a technology advancement,

01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:50.500
application challenges and emerging research area to the

01:44:50.500 --> 01:44:54.120
accuracy and depth. I will dedicate the task of compiling

01:44:54.120 --> 01:44:57.160
this information to the technical writer, providing them

01:44:57.160 --> 01:44:59.760
with all the relevant context and a specific instu

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:02.800
instruction to provide a thoughts and detail summary of the.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:07.360
So see, this is a thought it is able to generate. Right. And

01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:10.120
then action. What dedicate this to the co-worker. Now, who

01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:13.540
is the co-worker? The next agent, right? The next agent, the

01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:17.100
technical writer. Now it is trying to define the task for

01:45:17.100 --> 01:45:19.480
this one. It is trying to define the context for this one

01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:22.900
automatically. Then observation. I need to correct the

01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:25.640
format of the action input. So back and forth, back and

01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:29.440
forth. As you can see that these agent is trying to connect

01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:31.700
with each other back and forth, back and forth, back and

01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:36.940
forth. And then it is trying to complete a like a task. It

01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:40.200
is trying to prepare the final answer for me. Right. And

01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:42.760
then eventually it will try to form it each and everything

01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:46.520
below. Right. So once it is going to like a finish the

01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:49.560
entire chain and once it will be able to do the research and

01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:52.340
once it will be able to basically like a generate something.

01:45:52.620 --> 01:45:57.500
So it will then come up with the final answer. So finished

01:45:57.500 --> 01:46:04.600
chain, AI research task output, this one. So multi-modal

01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:06.980
capability, current trend of this one is scaling the large

01:46:06.980 --> 01:46:10.400
models, fine tuning and retrieval. This is again. If you see

01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:13.820
the sustainability key application across the industry. So

01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:17.960
each and every information it is able to do. And again, so

01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:21.880
it is, it is like a working on everything. Right. Every time

01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:24.860
it is, it is like a working on everything. And then after a

01:46:24.860 --> 01:46:29.400
multiple iterations, this is going to give you the final

01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:33.600
conclusion. Yeah. This is going to give you the final

01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:37.580
conclusion. So this is again like a beauty of this example

01:46:37.580 --> 01:46:42.320
that we are able to see. So is it making sense to all of us

01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:42.540
guys?

01:46:59.510 --> 01:47:05.870
Yeah. So crew AI. So basically it's like a invoking a chain

01:47:05.870 --> 01:47:09.790
of the agent. And then both of this agent will keep on

01:47:09.790 --> 01:47:12.890
talking to each other. And then finally I will be able to

01:47:12.890 --> 01:47:13.930
see output.

01:47:17.610 --> 01:47:21.310
If we are using any other LLM APIs like open AI, how to

01:47:21.310 --> 01:47:25.570
create those wrapper for every framework. For open AI, they

01:47:25.570 --> 01:47:28.310
support directly. So you don't have to do anything. You just

01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:32.270
have to install like a pip install open AI and then open AI

01:47:32.270 --> 01:47:38.360
LLM you have to call. So means this line only. So the way

01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:41.620
I'm calling URI LLM, URI LLM wrapper right now, this is

01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:44.120
nothing but just this class, which I have created. It's my

01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:48.240
own custom class for this crew. Right. So open AI, you will

01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:50.400
be able to use it from here. So this is the reason I'm

01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:52.600
telling you, like in some day, I'm going to push this entire

01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:58.860
things into a URI AI SDK so that you don't have to do or

01:47:58.860 --> 01:48:01.280
like a, you don't have to do even create this classes or

01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:04.920
even call this one. Simple pip install URI AI, work done.

01:48:14.580 --> 01:48:17.800
Okay. So crew AI seems

01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:21.430
to be done.

01:48:49.110 --> 01:48:51.990
So hope all of you are able to understand. Now I have

01:48:51.990 --> 01:48:54.770
already prepared a lot of like examples based on the

01:48:54.770 --> 01:48:58.910
syllabus that you have where I'm not just using one single

01:48:58.910 --> 01:49:01.510
agent, but as you can see one, two, three, four, so

01:49:01.510 --> 01:49:03.590
somewhere three agents, somewhere four agents, somewhere 10

01:49:03.590 --> 01:49:07.110
agents, I am going to use somewhere like a complex task. I'm

01:49:07.110 --> 01:49:13.190
trying to like a use basically. So, but again, it's, it's

01:49:13.190 --> 01:49:17.010
like not, not very tough. So simple call the agent, create

01:49:17.010 --> 01:49:19.890
the agent, assign role, goal and backstory, simple role,

01:49:19.970 --> 01:49:21.970
goal and backstory, assign the task, give a description

01:49:21.970 --> 01:49:25.910
output, and then like just call the crew. This is how easy

01:49:25.910 --> 01:49:29.550
it is. Right. This is how easy it is. So this is something

01:49:29.550 --> 01:49:33.150
which I will be discussing with all of you in my tomorrow's

01:49:33.150 --> 01:49:40.430
class. So. So technically I'm talking about, you're on and

01:49:40.430 --> 01:49:47.330
if you will come to the syllabus part. So here, so

01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:53.980
I've already prepared the material, but yeah, let's, let's

01:49:53.980 --> 01:49:57.260
discuss tomorrow. So this one, label two application,

01:49:57.260 --> 01:50:01.160
advanced use case, bonding, efficient document indexing

01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:04.920
pipeline, hybrid search, custom data connector for the AI

01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:09.400
model. Yeah. So this is a lang chain and this, this entire

01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:11.940
application. This entire application. So medically I chat

01:50:11.940 --> 01:50:14.620
board with symptom checker and personalized advice,

01:50:14.780 --> 01:50:18.000
personalized AI interview question generator, uh, opinion

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.940
mining and key inside extractor, all of these things, all of

01:50:20.940 --> 01:50:23.340
these things I'm going to discuss with all of you tomorrow.

01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:26.180
And then this will be like a little bit of fuller skill

01:50:26.180 --> 01:50:29.120
project. So five project enterprise grade RIGs based

01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:31.280
knowledge management system. So where I'm going to use our

01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:34.620
agents by the way. Yeah. RIG we have already seen that, but

01:50:34.620 --> 01:50:37.140
yes, this time. So I'll try to show you the implementation

01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:41.780
with these frameworks. Okay. Then, uh, AI driven medical

01:50:41.780 --> 01:50:43.920
diagnosis support system, AI powered research assistance,

01:50:44.100 --> 01:50:48.200
scientific paper, uh, with agent things are even like a more

01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:51.760
easy, I would say. So individual individual tasks we can try

01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:55.380
to assign, and then it is going to do a rest of the things

01:50:55.380 --> 01:50:55.720
for me.

01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:07.950
Could you please explain what is SDK? Okay. SDK is nothing

01:51:07.950 --> 01:51:12.590
but, uh, layman way. It's just a function, uh, for example.

01:51:13.810 --> 01:51:16.590
So let me show you here. The example, which I have shown

01:51:16.590 --> 01:51:20.010
you. Just now all the examples. So here, uh,

01:51:22.900 --> 01:51:28.600
where is my language crew? Yeah. So SDK is nothing but a

01:51:28.600 --> 01:51:30.920
software development kit where you just have to do the

01:51:30.920 --> 01:51:33.880
installation and then write just this kind of a line. So

01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:38.500
ultimately this line is calling what the above one, right?

01:51:38.860 --> 01:51:42.280
This is basically called as SDK. So if you will go to Pi Pi,

01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:46.380
uh, you will be able to find out SDK for the URI that we

01:51:46.380 --> 01:51:54.020
have released. So, uh, Pi Pi, Pi Pi, Pi Pi is a package

01:51:54.020 --> 01:52:01.100
manager. So URI, URI, AI. So URI SDK is available over here.

01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:05.560
See people saw URI AI and then like, uh, just call it in a

01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:08.880
simple way. This is the SDK, right? So writing like those

01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:12.120
line of a code, we have already handled it in a backend. So

01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:14.760
even for Langchain, I have released it. Uh, but I'm, I'm

01:52:14.760 --> 01:52:17.540
just trying to modify it for Langchain. For Lang graph or

01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:20.780
Lama index and for a crew, I have not released the SDK part.

01:52:20.980 --> 01:52:23.080
So I'll, I'll try to release the SDK part. Even for

01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:24.280
embeddings, we have released the SDK.

01:52:27.350 --> 01:52:30.870
And even if SDKs are not available, that doesn't matter

01:52:30.870 --> 01:52:34.050
because code example is already given to you. Right? Code

01:52:34.050 --> 01:52:37.190
example is already given. So before the SDK, so here we have

01:52:37.190 --> 01:52:40.430
given you the SDKs, uh, so that you can just install and use

01:52:40.430 --> 01:52:43.090
it. This is called as SDK. So which you can install and use

01:52:43.090 --> 01:52:46.050
it. If you don't want to install and use it, then go with

01:52:46.050 --> 01:52:49.610
the raw coding example. Right? So that day you are hitting

01:52:49.610 --> 01:52:52.250
our system, which is available at this particular URL with

01:52:52.250 --> 01:52:54.390
this authentication. That's it.

01:52:58.200 --> 01:53:01.220
Fine tuning is covered or will it be no, no, we have not

01:53:01.220 --> 01:53:03.760
reached till that point. So I think fine tuning, uh, we'll

01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:06.600
be discussing next week that that is going to be the last

01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:09.520
chapter. I mean like whatever we have inside the fine

01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:12.320
tuning, uh, once we are going to finish that, then after

01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:14.820
that we'll wrap up the batch. So most probably by next week,

01:53:14.920 --> 01:53:18.980
uh, by taking, uh, by investing some extra hours, uh, we'll

01:53:18.980 --> 01:53:23.540
try to wrap up those classes. Most probably. Uh, I will be

01:53:23.540 --> 01:53:26.240
able to finish your syllabus, uh, if not, then obviously

01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:30.740
next to next week, but yeah, uh, we'll move through our

01:53:30.740 --> 01:53:31.800
syllabus. Simple.

01:53:35.390 --> 01:53:39.490
Okay. So hope this looks good and great to all of you and

01:53:39.490 --> 01:53:41.890
all of you are able to understand at least something from

01:53:41.890 --> 01:53:43.630
this, uh, uh,

01:53:46.140 --> 01:53:51.120
like, uh, agentic AI. And tomorrow again, we have agentic

01:53:51.120 --> 01:53:53.740
AI. Tomorrow we'll see back to back, back to back so many,

01:53:53.820 --> 01:53:56.940
uh, different, different kinds of applications. And, uh,

01:53:56.940 --> 01:53:59.860
there is a 10% offer that we are running on your own plus.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:04.100
So I think this offer will be live for two more days. Uh, so

01:54:04.100 --> 01:54:06.460
if your friends and family or someone who would like to like

01:54:06.460 --> 01:54:09.880
access this one, so please ask them to take it after that,

01:54:09.980 --> 01:54:13.180
we are going to remove the 10%. Uh, anyhow, we will not be

01:54:13.180 --> 01:54:15.780
able to give even a more discount in our future. The reason

01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:19.680
is very simple. Uh, we are very affordable and we are giving

01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:22.140
too many things, which I don't think that anyone is

01:54:22.140 --> 01:54:24.700
providing. So if someone is interested from your friends and

01:54:24.700 --> 01:54:27.440
family. So they can try to like, uh, take a subscription of

01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:31.640
this entire one year and they can enjoy the learning and the

01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:33.640
things that we are trying to bring. Yeah.

01:54:39.180 --> 01:54:41.780
Okay. So we'll agentic a class. We'll continue. Obviously

01:54:41.780 --> 01:54:45.160
like we have class tomorrow. I'm like, why people ask such

01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:47.380
kind of a question. Just you have to ask something and you

01:54:47.380 --> 01:54:49.780
have a, uh, like, uh, you know, privilege of writing

01:54:49.780 --> 01:54:51.940
something in a chat. It doesn't mean that you should ask

01:54:51.940 --> 01:54:56.360
some like a question, which doesn't suit to your

01:54:56.360 --> 01:54:59.180
personality. Right. Right. Because this is how people are

01:54:59.180 --> 01:55:01.440
going to judge you. I mean, like, uh, people are asking,

01:55:01.540 --> 01:55:04.080
will agentic AI will continue. I mean, like what I was

01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:06.940
trying to say since last five minutes that we have to

01:55:06.940 --> 01:55:08.960
discuss this, we have to discuss this. We have to discuss

01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:11.000
this. I have shown the syllabus. What does that mean?

01:55:15.390 --> 01:55:18.390
Uh, later on agentic AI course, hybrid course will come. I

01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:20.390
think I have already launched that. So you can go and check.

01:55:20.630 --> 01:55:21.530
It's already available.

01:55:27.450 --> 01:55:30.110
Uh, agentic AI. I'm not sure. Generative AI I have launched.

01:55:30.190 --> 01:55:34.390
REG I have launched. So maybe agentic AI. But yeah, like if,

01:55:34.410 --> 01:55:36.810
if I'm like, uh, teaching you something now. So maybe

01:55:36.810 --> 01:55:38.490
agentic AI. So maybe you can try to understand, try to

01:55:38.490 --> 01:55:41.930
learn, try to experiment and then move on. And obviously

01:55:41.930 --> 01:55:44.490
I'll keep on bringing more and more courses. That's my plan.

01:55:48.790 --> 01:55:51.570
Okay. So, uh, if you have any questions for me, so please

01:55:51.570 --> 01:55:54.430
try to put up those questions. Uh, otherwise we'll wind up

01:55:54.430 --> 01:55:58.630
the class for today. And let me like share this entire

01:55:58.630 --> 01:56:04.250
folder with all of you. So agentic AI, generative AI class.

01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:27.660
Agentic AI.

01:56:39.380 --> 01:56:43.840
Okay. Production ready project for agentic AI. Hi. So I'm

01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:46.240
going to show you like a multi-cloud deployment, as I have

01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:48.400
already mentioned, and that's also a part of your syllabus.

01:56:49.060 --> 01:56:54.080
So anyhow, I have to showcase. So fine guys with that. Thank

01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:56.640
you so much. See you again tomorrow. Same time, 2 30 PM IST.

01:56:56.640 --> 01:57:00.540
And I believe we all know the agenda that, uh, what we are

01:57:00.540 --> 01:57:04.160
going to discuss in my tomorrow's class with that. Thank you

01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:05.700
so much. Take care. See you again.
