WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
okay guys so in today's discussion so obviously we have

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.340
talked about vector databases so in today's discussion i'll

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.620
be talking about an application basically and because going

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.220
forward so we have to talk about a lang serve we have to

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.900
talk about lang smith we have to talk about a lang chain we

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.080
have to talk about lang graph we have to talk about a crew

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.480
ai now all of these frameworks are going to help you out to

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.180
build something out of your llms right so this large

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.800
language models and that is something that we are going to

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.220
do inside a class so in my today's class i'll be showing you

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.700
one simple smart project right one simple smart project so

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.820
where we are going to create a multiple agents now many of

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.880
you don't even understand what is the meaning of agents

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.740
that's completely fine right so we are going to build a

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.020
project so where we are going to create a multiple agents

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.960
and then i'll explain you what is the meaning of those

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.560
agents by the way and that agent a different different

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.900
agents are going to perform a different different task into

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.360
a different different sequences they are going to perform

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.140
the task and finally all together they will be able to

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.920
perform one final task that i will be looking for so it's

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.700
like a team right it's like a team so like as a part of the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.400
team so everyone try to like a take care of their own

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.440
responsibility and then finally we use to deliver something

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.540
to our client or maybe we will be able to build some of the

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.920
product so in the similar manner so we are going to like do

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.420
some sort of a work we are going to do some sort of a task

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.840
where multiple agents will come together and then they are

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.200
going to perform one common task now that one common task

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.000
that i have chosen for my today's discussion is a very

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.780
amazing one so generally like you go outside or maybe you go

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.580
on youtube or maybe you go on other platforms and try to

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.580
search for basically a roadmap right that okay so if i'm

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.380
trying to learn agent tki if i'm trying to learn mcps if i'm

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.380
trying to learn agent tki if i'm trying to learn agent tki

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.220
if i'm trying to learn agent i'm trying to learn like a rag

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.420
if i'm trying to learn maybe a data science big data devops

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.140
cloud docker kubernetes dsa system design whatever right so

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.580
what should be the roadmap right generally like we try to

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.600
like watch those videos our roadmap videos right that okay

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.900
so this is going to be the roadmap for this particular one

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.200
now so similar kind of a roadmap for any topic any given

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.380
topic right or any kind of a mind map we all will be able to

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.200
create with the help of this particular project which we are

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.900
going to discuss in my today's class in a step-by-step

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.620
manner obviously right so in a step-by-step manner we are

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.460
going to talk about all of these like components and then we

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.760
are going to combine it and then we will be able to build a

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.460
project so where i can just try to type that give me a

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.820
roadmap for machine learning give me a roadmap for a

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.640
generative ai give me a roadmap for mcps give me a roadmap

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.240
for agent tki or maybe a fine tuning maybe for a big data

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.300
maybe for aws right it will be a solution architect and it

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.660
will be able to give you a roadmap then and there that too

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.540
with the graph right in a complete like a graph way it is

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.440
going to give you the roadmap so and this project is going

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.360
to help you out to understand not just one or two concept

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.460
but a multiple concept all together and like i said so i

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.100
will be using a agent over here a multiple agent i will be

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.880
using a framework called as lang graph and that is going to

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.140
help me out in terms of like you know building this entire

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.040
project so are we ready guys every one of us how

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.200
llm model is learning when applications send a message to

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.680
the model or chat query without updating weight or how llm

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.020
model is learning when applications send a message to the

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.420
model or chat query without updating weights or model no

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.260
it's not learning by the way so maybe if you are using a

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.880
search model so basically it goes to google try to do a

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.900
search and then it gives you the answer otherwise if i'm

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.080
going to talk about maybe like a chat gpt 4o they are not

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.520
learning as of now so basically they try to do a training in

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.200
offline mode uh obviously by like acquiring the new sort of

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.960
the data and then they try to release those models that's

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.780
the reason so everyday people are using the new new models

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.140
right so those models are not learning in a real time they

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.940
learn like offline basically okay so let's get started let

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.140
me share my screen first of all guys and let me open up the

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.040
project and i'll just try to run the project and show you

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.280
what is the final outcome that we are looking for and then

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.100
we are going to like uh build this project i am going to

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.680
explain you that project in a one by one manner so where is

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.900
my project let me search multi

00:04:50.850 --> 00:05:02.200
agent mcp i think yeah this is the project okay yeah this is

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.400
the project fine so quickly what i will do is i'll just try

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.580
to like run this entire project requirement.txt everything

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.440
is fine and here i'm using urei by the way so i'm going to

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.940
run this project quickly so

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:37.700
here streamlit s-t-r-e-m-s-t-r-e-m-l-i-t streamlit run and

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.480
then run what so app dot oh why

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.020
it is not able to knowledge graph builder okay cd knowledge

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.720
graph streamlit app.py just

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.200
wait guys so i have just created this project day before

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.880
yesterday uh two days back so i'm just trying to check um

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:20.920
yeah

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.440
so what kind of output this project is going to give it to

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.860
you so let me show you the output first i have just stored

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.500
one of the output and then i'll like try to explain you in a

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.800
detailed way and then we are going to execute this project

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.100
in a step-by-step manner yeah

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.450
so basically the output of this entire project is going to

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.210
be this one the one which I'm going to show you open with

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:14.670
let's open with Google yeah so output of this project is

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:17.770
basically this one so this I have created basically like a

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:22.570
roadmap for a machine learning and as you can see so it is

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:25.390
telling me that what I'm supposed to prepare in a very first

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.010
place like a fundamental programming language python how

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.370
much time I am supposed to take so three week I can I can

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.410
even further drill it down but yeah I'm trying to show you

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.290
that this basic project is solving a lot of problem for me

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.650
this is what I'm trying to show it to you so fundamental

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.370
mathematics for machine learning linear algebra calculus

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:44.410
four week you are supposed to spend data handling so sql and

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.210
pandas three week you are supposed to spend I can even

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.890
further drill it down and then I can further like try to

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.890
even print the topics that what is like required inside this

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.830
topic this topic whatever topic you want but yeah this is

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.090
the roadmap then data visualization matplotlib and seaborg

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.230
machine learning basics so supervised unsupervised machine

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.170
learning four week of time you are supposed to spend then

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:03.550
what I'm trying to show you is that this is the basic

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:03.970
project is solving a lot of problem for me what you are

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.150
supposed to do a specialization wise if you are looking for

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:08.290
a machine learning specialization so in that case ml

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:11.030
algorithm so this is the algorithm three week of time is

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.450
given to you module version of feature engineering deep

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:17.210
learning so this is as a specialization wise then project

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.870
and practice so how you are supposed to do what you are

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:21.650
supposed to do everything you can try to print then

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:24.010
deployment so model deployment and apis you have to learn

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.910
flask and docker you have to learn tool and framework wise

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:29.650
scikit learn tensorflow pytorch and then advanced technique

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:32.850
wise so reinforcement learning and generative models you are

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:34.690
supposed to learn and you should have spent this much of

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:38.130
time and the search it is stay updated so follow your own

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:42.650
latest courses and tutorials ongoing one yep so now just

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:45.730
with one single prompt it is able to print each and

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:49.410
everything even if I want that what is like what I can learn

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.830
and this entire image that I'm showing you right this is

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:56.310
created by system itself I'm not like I have written a code

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.510
so basically I have written a code and code is populating

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:02.550
this entire image and the graph that you are able to see so

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:03.450
I'm not doing anything but I'm going to show you how to

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.130
print this entire image by the way so it's not like we have

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.470
designed it manually no not at all so we are using a graph

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.550
which library over here with the help of graph which library

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:13.210
so we are able to do that and this entire analytics research

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:16.330
all these things has been done by yuri ai and then finally

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.810
we are using a lang graph so lang graph where we are trying

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:21.710
to configure the multiple agents means multiple worker we

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:25.170
are trying to configure this is the overall idea but yeah so

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.990
this is the final outcome of the project you will be able to

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:32.290
see you can even try to extend this project I can extend

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:35.450
this project here like here I can say that with every topic

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:38.710
try to give me some subtopics as well or try to give me some

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:42.250
sub syllabus as well I can going forward going good go and

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:46.790
configure my entire neuron platform db access so here I can

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:50.010
say that that okay if I have to learn this one so now show

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:53.510
me in which video this one is available or which courses

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.730
this entire things is available so I can even do a mapping

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.910
with that so in this way it is going to be a pure authentic

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:03.770
dynamic roadmap in a real time if my data is going to change

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.430
if your query is going to change things will change

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:09.390
automatically right so this is the project that we are going

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:13.490
to work today so as a objective of this project so this

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:16.970
project is going to give you a final roadmap this roadmap

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:20.410
that you are talking about or in while like a teaching you

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:22.870
itself so maybe i'll try to change my prompt i'll try to

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:26.390
change a little bit and it will be able to even do more for

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:30.610
me making sense guys what we are going to do today yes

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:36.200
everyone making sense okay

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.980
so let's start doing it now why we are doing this one

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:06.460
because if you will go through your syllabus right so let me

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:09.560
now give you a walkthrough of your syllabus first a little

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:16.240
bit so basically uh your syllabus hybrid live so yeah so we

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:20.060
have your syllabus here now if i'll go through your syllabus

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.420
so after this vector db right after this vector db i'm going

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:22.420
to go to my syllabus and i'm going to go to my syllabus and

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.540
i'm going to So we have to understand what, introduction and

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:29.120
architecture of generative AI application. So here basic

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.380
architecture overview, advanced gen AI application

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:34.460
architecture, multi-level architecture exploration, preview

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:38.480
of the professional gen AI application. Now advanced gen AI

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.420
application, selecting a right foundational model,

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.900
comprehensive tool for generative AI, all those things we

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.420
have to understand and then we have to get into the RAG. So

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:49.220
which we will get into it from next week onwards because

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.360
next week we are going to start Saturday, we are going to

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.060
start with the RAG basically. So to understand this entire

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.320
chapter, unless and until we are not going to build

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.200
something small or big, we will not be able to understand

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.440
and that's the reason why I'm trying to give you this

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.000
understanding in a very, very first place. So I'm trying to

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.380
cover basically this portion of your chapters. So by showing

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:11.380
you the application, we will try to understand this entire

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.220
overview. But yeah, if I'll talk about the application,

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.840
application wise, there are millions of application which is

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.240
possible, not just one or two. Not millions, I would say

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:23.340
multi-million. Number of applications which is possible.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.080
Sachin is saying joined a little late, sorry, not an issue

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.300
Sachin, you have not missed much. It's fine. We are about to

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.860
start the project part. Just to explain that topic. So hope

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:38.640
all of you are able to understand the objective that I have

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.860
set for this particular session. Now let's get started in a

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:47.120
very first place. So there is a lot of platform you will be

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:51.260
able to find out over internet guys and those platforms. So

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.080
one of those platforms are one of those platforms are

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:58.060
Langchain by the way. So you can go to a Langchain and then

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.200
maybe we can try to go through this entire Langchain

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.600
platform. I'll try to explain you that what Langchain can do

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.020
and why and where you are going to use this Langchain at the

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:13.000
end of the day. Then there is a platform called as Crew AI,

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:21.140
C R E W Crew AI, there is a platform called as. There is a

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:27.560
platform called as N 8 N fine. So likewise, there are so

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:32.180
many platforms people have created. So where you can go, you

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:35.800
can try to maybe just drag and drop, or maybe you can write

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.480
a minimalistic code, or maybe you will be able to just call

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:43.600
their APIs. And then end to end, you will be able to create

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:48.060
your own AI agent. You can try to bring those agent to a

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:53.300
production. Now, I have taken a name of agent. Now you will

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.720
ask me a question that what is this agent by the way, what

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.100
is the definition of the agent that that because you said

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.400
that that you can go to any of this platform, and then maybe

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.800
you will be able to create an agent I go here, it's written

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.480
multi agent, right, I just go here. Now it is going to tell

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.000
me like somewhere that you can go and create the agents at

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.460
the end of the day. Now I'll go here on in it and it will

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.660
again tell me that go and create any kind of agent. Okay.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.620
Now what is a meaning of an agent anyone guys who can

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.140
explain me?

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:28.610
What do label one to three means label one means a basic

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:31.950
understanding two means building theme is deployment, then

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:32.810
sending it to production.

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:38.340
You mentioned you cover I think you have joined a little bit

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:41.020
later cause so I have already like said that I'll cover that

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:44.400
will take just a minute of time. So it's not a big one. But

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.140
yeah, so I'm just starting this project first, maybe at the

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:48.840
end of this class itself, I'll cover that part.

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:54.800
Fine, just another vector DB, I'll be using UD API convert

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.540
to embeddings and then I'll I'll just do a pip install

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:01.300
Facebook, a semantic search in my local and store it and

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.620
then search it. That's it. Okay, so anyone who understands

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:08.640
this agent, by the way, anyone, what is the meaning of the

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:13.220
agent by the way? Yeah, so agent is the entity which takes

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:17.760
autonomous decision based on the task is given. Okay. Okay.

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:26.230
So maybe if I have agent is accomplished to a specific goal

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:32.270
leveraging the LLM as a reasoning engine. Yeah. So I'll say

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:35.030
that forget about those elements and everything, right? So

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:38.530
if I have to compare agent with some like agent with like a

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:43.430
employee who is working in a company. So again, when we are

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:46.870
working in a company, so we have our own roles and

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:49.150
responsibilities, right? We have our own responsibilities.

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:54.010
And everyone like agents are the elements which gives a

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:56.130
specific task. Okay, that's also correct. It automatically

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:59.870
uses elements and take a decision. Okay, fine. Fine. Fine.

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:04.030
Yeah. So almost everyone is able to understand a little bit

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:07.350
but just hear me out, hear me out like what is my definition

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:11.770
as per the agent as per my understanding, right? So agent is

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:15.310
nothing but a kind of an employee who has been hired or who

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:20.030
has been deployed just for a specific task. So that employee

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:23.010
is just going to do that particular task. For example, so

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:26.970
let's suppose if I'm going to like deploy a gatekeeper at

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:30.890
your like office door, right? So what gatekeeper will do, so

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:34.610
gatekeeper will just open the gate and close the gate. If I

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.830
have deployed someone to take attendance, what that person

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:40.510
will do, that person will just try to like maintain the

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.950
books, right? Let's suppose if I have in my IT team, so if I

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:46.990
have deployed someone, so who will just track everyone's

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:50.750
tasks that what everyone is doing on a daily basis, right?

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:54.190
And then they that person will try to analyze the you know,

00:16:54.230 --> 00:17:00.330
like the productivity of the entire. Team. I think PMO used

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:03.450
to do the same thing in many companies, right? Very soon

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:08.610
that job is going to be like gone very soon. So basically,

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:11.310
this is what PMO does, by the way, right project management

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:14.570
officer, even I was not able to understand like, when I was

00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:16.950
working with multiple clients and companies, there was a

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:20.030
there was a lot of PMOs and I was not able to understand

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:24.070
like, why these PMOs even exist in this company, or what

00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:27.750
they're doing, but yeah, task is task basically, right? So

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:31.450
basically, like, let's suppose we have hired up someone in

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.810
the PMO, what they do, they will just try to observe

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:36.370
everyone, they will just go to everyone asked like, or maybe

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:38.390
they will just go to Jira, they will track each and

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:41.870
everything, like what what kind of a work these people have

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:43.750
done this person has done, what is the overall productivity

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:45.490
of the team, and then accordingly, they will create the

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:50.630
report. So here, agents are exact same thing, right? Agents

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:53.710
are nothing but again, in a layman way, it's a piece of

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:58.150
code, right? It's a piece of code. Maybe. Maybe by drag and

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:01.090
drop, we are doing it or maybe by writing some line of the

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:03.870
code, we are doing it. But yeah, at the end of the day, it's

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:08.930
a piece of the code, which you are writing to do some sort

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:13.250
of a task in an automated way, with the help of your LLMs,

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:17.230
obviously, right with the help of LLMs, because now LLMs are

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:20.650
very much powerful. So LLMs, so by leveraging a capability

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:23.810
of LLMs, you have written a piece of the code. Now that

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:29.400
behaves as a LLMs. That's it. Fine. So that's it. So this is

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.540
an example of something called as agent. But yeah, if you

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:35.460
have like related with the real time, simple, maybe related

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.920
with the gatekeeper, related with the bookkeeper, related

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:41.480
with the attendance taker, right? Or maybe related with the

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:46.040
PMOs. That's okay. So this person is been designed to like,

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.700
do their own tasks. And again, so if I'm talking about the

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.360
human being, so whenever they will do their tasks, they will

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:55.300
do their tasks with their own knowledge, guts and feelings,

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.380
right on a daily basis, not like a robot, right? guts and

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.440
feelings this is where lms comes into picture so lms is

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.160
having its own knowledge base its own guts its own feeling

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.980
its own analysis or analogy and based on that so it is

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:12.160
advising the code to do that do this simple this is called

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.200
as agent and this is where people have started talking about

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:20.680
the agentic ai right agentic and this is where again these

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:24.460
all these platforms or ecosystem which has been introduced

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:28.060
very recently in a market right which was not even available

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:30.800
no one even heard about this one two year or two and a half

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.920
year back so now everyone is talking about it basically and

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.240
everyone is talking about a next level of automation so

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.420
whether i'm going to use a crew ai or i'm going to use a

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:43.340
lang chain or i'm going to use basically a net and everyone

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.780
is helping me out to achieve almost a similar kind of things

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:50.460
in a different different way obviously some is providing you

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.380
something some is not providing you something that's a

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.120
different story but yeah at the end of the day this is what

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:59.100
you all will be able to find out now learning these things

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:03.060
is important uh if you would like to make a career into a

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:06.800
like a gen ai but believe me if you understand fundamentals

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:12.540
learning these things are not at all a big deal anyone can

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.280
learn it anyone means literally anyone and everyone can

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.680
learn it in a easiest possible way even uh without me you

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.560
will be able to learn it right this is a different story but

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.560
yeah at the end of the day this is how easy it is believe me

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:27.080
this is how easy it is so it's it's not at all tough uh to

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.300
learn these things to experiment these things or to build

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.100
these things or to build a product out of it or maybe like

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:37.860
to solve uh some sort of a problem uh by using these tools

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:42.580
so here in my today's class i will be using a lang graph

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:48.020
basically right now so inside a lang ecosystem so lang

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:50.720
basically lang is providing you an ecosystem so inside the

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.360
lang ecosystem you will be able to find out a couple of

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:57.920
things now what are those couple of things by the way inside

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.980
only lang ecosystem so lang is let's suppose one framework

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:05.120
right so lang so this basically inside a lang framework

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.780
itself you will be able to see or you will be able to find

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:16.200
out basically something called as a lang chain and then you

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.060
will be able to find out something called

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.180
then you will be able to find out something called as lang

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:28.620
graph and then you will be able to find out something called

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:34.520
as lang serve basically so these are the four things that

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:37.860
you will be able to find out inside a lang ecosystem and

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.720
many people i have seen i have seen many people even like

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.560
experienced ones so they get confused with the lang chain

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.140
lang smith lang graph and lang serve first of all let me

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.780
clarify you these things that it's a part of same ecosystem

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.980
now i'll talk about this in a little bit but let me clarify

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:51.980
you these things that it's a part of same ecosystem now i'll

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.560
talk about this high level use cases that what lang chain

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:59.440
does so basically lang chain is a core framework from this

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:03.460
entire lang system that has been created it's a core system

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:08.100
so here it allows you or it focuses in terms of building a

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:12.240
logic right in terms of building a logic and here so you

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:16.200
will be able to build a series of the chain series of chain

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.180
means so agent number one let's suppose there is a agent

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.540
number two means person number one person number two person

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:22.360
number three person number four person person number three

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:27.260
and person number four for example so like a attendance

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:30.760
taker person right so a person will take attendance and then

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.360
he will forward attendance to the next one they will do the

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.920
analysis then they will try to forward to the account like a

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:40.420
HR department so HR department will try to like make leave

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:42.780
or no leave kind of things then HR department will try to

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:45.760
forward to the like a finance department now finance

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.040
department will do what so finance department will try to

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.520
based on the attendance so they will try to release the

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:54.260
salary Is it making sense guys? So can I say that in this

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:56.940
situation, so from attendance taker itself, so let's suppose

00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:00.260
attendance taker is a low level agent, a first agent, right?

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:03.400
So attendance taker has passed this attendance like to a

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.500
auditor, auditor has passed these things to the HR, HR has

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.920
passed to the finance department. Now finally finance

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:12.440
department will try to release the salary. So ultimately we

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.400
are taking attendance so that we can deduct your salaries,

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.000
right? We can deduct your salaries if you are absent. That

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.860
was the whole idea. That was the whole objective, right? So

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:24.460
what we have done, so we have basically created a multiple

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:28.320
separate, separate agent. We have defined their own like a,

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:34.000
like a functionality. So for each and every agent, now every

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.720
agent is going to do a task in a sequential manner. And then

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.980
finally it is going to give you the output, whatever output

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.700
that you are looking for, right? Whatever project that you

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.380
are trying to build, whatever problem that you are trying to

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:49.140
solve. Now, Langchain provides you a library. You can do it.

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:51.160
You can do it. It means you can try to write multiple

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.780
different. Different kind of a function one by one in a

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.260
sequence. You can try to arrange it. We'll, we'll try to get

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:59.660
into that more. Uh, but as a layman way, this is what you

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:03.040
can understand. Then if we are trying to build maybe a RIG

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.380
application, I think we all understand. So what is the

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.520
meaning of RIG application? So retrieval augmented

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.760
generation application is nothing but a kind of application.

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:16.000
So where we are trying to use a publicly available elements

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.100
knowledge, plus we are trying to use our own knowledge base.

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:24.300
Right? So before sending, uh, like, uh, uh, like embeddings

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:27.880
or before sending a query to our LM. So what we do is we try

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.600
to send some of the information from my knowledge as well,

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:34.160
or I can say my own repository, my private data set as well.

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:36.080
So that based on that, it will be able to give me the

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.940
answer. So you can try to build RIG kind of application over

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:43.740
here in a easiest possible way, right? Any kind of a tools,

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.640
tools means technically a function by the way, right? Any

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.100
kind of a tools you can try to build it over here. For

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.460
example, recently I've been talking about a lot of MCB

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:55.540
projects, a lot of like a functions, our MCB tools. I have

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:57.660
written over there if you will go through, or if you'll

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:00.520
follow along those lectures, right? In every project. So

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.640
this is where LangChain comes into a pictures. LangChain can

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.840
do all of these things. Frameworks is available. Library is

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:09.320
given to you. Code is already written, just call the library

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:13.060
and then you will be able to do it. Now where this Lang

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:17.340
Smith fit fits in. So whenever you are trying to build any

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:20.220
application, for example, with the help of LangChain, which

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:24.480
is a core library, right? So obviously when you will try to

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:28.940
build those applications, so you need some sort of a setup

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:31.960
by which you will be able to do a debugging,

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.160
debugging, monitoring,

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:43.790
right? So you will have to like a do a debugging. You will

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:46.870
have to go ahead and do a monitoring. You will have to check

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:50.250
whether things are working fine or not. Means. You have to

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:53.490
visualize the chain. You have to visualize the agent. You

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:57.070
have to find out the output or errors or anything, right? To

00:25:57.070 --> 00:26:01.630
maintain these entire things. So this is where this Lang

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:05.170
Smith comes into a picture. I believe I, I have shown you a

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:09.070
tensor, uh, like, uh, uh, in my, in my class, I have shown

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:12.510
you a tensor board, right? Guys, if you remember anyone who

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:16.630
remembers a tensor board, by the way, yep.

00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:21.950
Anyone guys who remembers a tensor board?

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.440
Technically Lang Smith, you can consider that as a tensor

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:44.140
board. So where you can see all the final outcome, you can

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:46.880
try to visualize it means you can visualize all the agents

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.060
chain. So basically Lang Smith provides you those APIs, or

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:53.180
you can say those methods or functions Lang Smith is going

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:56.580
to provide you. So same thing it's doing, but yeah, it's

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.900
just like a supporting a Lang chain. You can say, it's just

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:01.460
going to support a Lang chain over here. So debugging,

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:04.500
monitoring, and then visualization, all of these things, you

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.980
will be able to do it with the help of Lang Smith library.

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:09.820
So whatever you have built in Lang chain. You can just use a

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:13.160
Lang Smith to do the same thing. So it's like a tensor board

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:17.220
of a Lang, simple, right? And so board of the Lang, you will

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:22.260
be able to find out. Now, uh, third one is basically a Lang

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:25.540
graph, right? So Lang graph. So what is this Lang graph and

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:30.240
how it is like a different, so Lang graph is again, like

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.260
Lang Smith is a core framework. You went over there. You can

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:36.260
try to create a multiple agents, but Lang graph technically

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:41.340
supports a multi agent complete. Yeah. Yeah. And it will be

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:44.520
able to control the, or you will be able to, you will be

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.200
having a flexibility so that you will be able to control the

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:51.140
state of the agent at any point of a time. This is where

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:57.360
this Lang graph comes into a picture. So here it's to try to

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.780
provide you, where

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.460
is my pencil? Yeah. So here it tried to provide you, multi

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.140
agent

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.040
workflow.

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:24.260
You will be able to create, plus you will be able to like do

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:27.640
a stateful conversation in between the agents, or you can

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.580
try to create a agent, which will be able to collaborate

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:34.040
with each other. Now, what is the meaning of this? Right? So

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.560
I have given you one example in this place, right? So where

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.740
there is a attendance taker and then attendance taker is

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:44.300
passing those data to the auditor, then to HR and then to a

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:49.440
finance guy. Yeah. Now, so here in the one chain in one

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:52.920
sequence. We are trying to pass the information, but maybe

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:56.760
here in case of a Lang graph, so this is the core property

00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:00.220
of line chain. So maybe into a Lang graph, you can try to

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:03.940
create a collaborative agent means you do this. I'll do

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:06.400
this. If I'll do this mistake, I'll come back to you. You

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.240
will again, correct this one. I'll again, do this kind of

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.000
this one means back and forth, back and forth, back and

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.380
forth. I can try to go ahead. I can try to give an

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:15.420
instruction to this one. This will revert back. Then again,

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.740
I'll come back, then revert back, then come back then this

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:20.500
way. So basically you will be able to do that. To create a

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:27.970
collaborative, collaborative agents. This is where this Lang

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:31.010
graph comes into a picture. So in point, today's project, I

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:34.510
will be using a Lang graph by the way. Right. Uh, so to do

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:36.930
that, uh, that one, so I am going to create three agent over

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:41.170
there. So this is what, uh, like, uh, where Lang graph comes

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:43.890
into a picture. So wherever you are trying to build a

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:48.990
workflow bear, one agent is going to pass a control to the

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:51.930
different agent based on the condition. So over there. I can

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:55.810
try to use a Lang graph kind of a library today itself. You

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:58.430
will be able to see a demo of a Lang graph in my class, in

00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:02.110
my project. So where I'm going to create a, like a project.

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:05.510
So which can generate any kind of a roadmap after doing a

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:08.430
lot of research, synthesizing, and then finally a graph

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:12.310
builder. Now there is something called as Lang serve, right?

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:15.130
So we are able to build the multiple chain season,

00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:17.070
everything, debug, monitoring, all those things are

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:22.290
completely fine. Right? So. Uh, now. Now we have to

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:26.030
basically like, uh, deploy those application, right? We have

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:28.810
to like, uh, send those application over to the sub server.

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:32.410
Now this is where this Lang serve comes into a picture. So

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:35.750
this gives you a capability so that it's, it's more like a

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:36.650
deployment tool

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:44.520
deployment tool, right? It's more like, like a deployment

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.580
tool that you will be able to find out, which is going to

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:50.300
help you out in terms of doing a deployment of all of these

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:53.960
agent at any point of a time. So is it making sense to all

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:57.740
of us? Guys, any confusion between all this for, in terms of

00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:58.040
definition?

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:05.010
Yeah. In terms of definition, are you able to understand? So

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:07.950
I don't think that you will get confused with any of these

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:12.050
four, uh, going forward, right now, you know, that inside a

00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:15.470
Lang family. So what is basically like, uh, things that we

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:18.130
have and what we are going to use for what purposes?

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:21.550
Yeah,

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:36.550
fine. Everyone. So please let me know. Yes or no. Fine. Yep.

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:40.050
Lang chain only for single agent, not for single agent, a

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:42.890
chain of agent. You can try to create, you can solve our RIG

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:45.210
problems over there. You can try to create a multiple tool

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:48.050
over there, right? Our individual agent, you can try to

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:50.810
create, or maybe a chain of agent. You can try to create

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:54.830
over there. So it's not like it's just for the single agent.

00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:57.410
You can create a multiple agent. You can even connect each

00:31:57.410 --> 00:32:01.550
and every agent with each and every one Lang Smith and

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:04.890
serve, please repeat. So see Lang is Smith has been used for

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:08.250
a debugging and monitoring. And visualization, just like a

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:11.910
tensor board, right? Just like a tensor board. So where you

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:14.570
will be able to track the application. If there will be some

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:17.050
error, you will be able to debug it. You will be able to

00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:19.510
check the logs at the end of the day. This is where Lang is

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:22.170
with comes into a picture because for any real time

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:25.090
application that we are going to build, obviously we have to

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:27.630
observe those application. We have to debug. If there will

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:30.270
be an error, we have to monitor all those application into a

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:32.730
production. This is where Lang Smith comes into picture. If

00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:35.550
I'll talk about solve. So basically it's, it's allowing you

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:39.310
to expose. Yeah. Your entire things, entire system as a API

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:42.830
to the outer world, right? So it's more like a deployment

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:43.410
tool.

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:50.340
Can we do a multi-agent without a Lang graph? Obviously you

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:56.100
can do it. Yes. So this is the Lang family. Do this agent

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:59.180
have to be sequential in a workflow or can we make a complex

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.500
workflow with nonlinear kind of a workflow among these

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:04.260
agents? You can create a nonlinear workflow in a easiest

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:07.840
possible way. That is possible, right? That is possible. And

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:10.580
again, so with the help of graph, that is all that is

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:10.860
possible.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:19.320
Uh, then why multi agent system were created like a crew AI

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:22.440
land graph and autochains land graph is a part of like a

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:25.940
same land family itself. Crew AI is a different company

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.680
altogether. So let's suppose you're like a friends has

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:31.900
created one company. Now you think that, okay, fine. So your

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:34.660
friends, the business is doing good. Uh, let's go and create

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.640
one more. So this is where crew comes into a picture. This

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:44.900
is where auto gen comes into a picture. Fine. Hmm. So

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:47.320
basically. They are the competitor in between. They're just

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:48.360
fighting for the market share.

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:57.280
And these are the, not the only like a framework. So almost

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:00.460
all the biggies are now bringing this select things. So

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:03.180
where you can create a multiple agents, we

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:10.890
are even working on some projects. So we are like, um, we

00:34:10.890 --> 00:34:13.810
are creating a agent hub by the way, uh, very soon you will

00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:17.490
be able to see it. So, uh, basically we have a URI inside

00:34:17.490 --> 00:34:21.050
this one, right? So we have like, uh, now we are thinking a

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:24.490
different kind of a feature. Our future, you can say for our

00:34:24.490 --> 00:34:27.630
URI. So URI is one of the amazing and one of the useful

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:30.150
platform that we have created and people are literally

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:32.290
loving it. The kind of feedback that are the kind of, uh,

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:35.450
consumption that we are able to observe over here. So

00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:37.910
obviously we are trying to make it better and better, but

00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:41.730
now we are trying to like, uh, create a separate app just

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:46.110
for URI, uh, kind of a family app. You can say, uh, where,

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:50.070
uh, pay as you go basis, people will be able to access it.

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:52.630
It means you are going to like do a top up. Just like a SIM

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:55.650
card, top up, and then you and your entire family will be

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:59.050
able to use the capability of AI. Plus we are trying to, we

00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:02.910
are even planning to bring a agent hub over there so that

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:05.370
let's suppose you have created some agent, which is going to

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:08.110
do some sort of a task. So this is like an app store and a

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:10.290
play store, right? So just like an app store and play store.

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:13.250
So we are trying to create even a marketplace in a separate

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:16.930
URI ecosystem. So where you can try to dump your own agents

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:19.130
and many more things, many more things. So we are already

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:22.870
like working on it. So maybe by the end. Of June, you will

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:26.090
be able to see some responses from a URI and you will be

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:28.890
able to see a complete separate app for URI like Android and

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:31.710
iOS, both a plus this agent hub and many, many things,

00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:34.990
right? Because obviously future is going to be all about,

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:38.710
uh, agents and the AI and all of these things altogether.

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:41.910
Right? So we are, we are just trying to build in that way.

00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:47.910
They were asking, we are supposed to assume that agent is a

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:50.910
combination of LLM properties and tools, combination of

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:53.330
different, different chains property. I mean like chain

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:56.650
tool, all this. Things are basically like a kind of a

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:59.950
technical word. Don't run after that. Uh, I don't taking

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:02.810
like a, those names, like technical words. It simply means

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:06.490
that our program with the access of LLMs, right? A program,

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:09.610
a simple program with the access of LLMs defined for the

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:11.630
specific task. That's it. That's this, that is something

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:14.190
called as agent. And then we, you create a multiple agents,

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:17.310
combine it all together. You can say that as a chain, or

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:20.950
maybe you can say that as a nonlinear, like a graph, simple

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:24.190
agno framework. Yeah. Likewise. There are so many tons of

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:26.970
free. Most are available and every framework is almost

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:29.450
trying to do the same thing. And they're like trying to

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:30.610
release the similar kind of a feature.

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:35.890
Can we build an agent on a local server? You can build it

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:42.170
anywhere. Should we learn all, not at all, learn one, learn

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:45.250
the fundamentals, and then just go and explore once and

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:47.770
leave it because this is how easy these things are.

00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:01.160
Okay. So now let's go ahead. This is the future that we are

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:03.520
thinking about. So even inside a URI, so we are trying to

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:07.520
bring, uh, not this kind of a platform, but yeah. So. Kind

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:12.180
of, uh, agent hub, uh, we are building, uh, so very soon.

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:15.200
And over there, uh, even we can publish the agents and even

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.400
you can publish your own agent. And then in a later stage,

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:21.300
even you can monetize your own agents. So we are, we are

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:24.760
just working on it. So project is in a initial stages of

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:28.580
now. So hopefully by June and you will start looking into

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:33.440
those like outcomes that we are working on as of now. Okay.

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:36.640
So now, uh, there is another platform called a screw AI,

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:40.660
right? Again, what you will do, create a multiple agents,

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:44.600
multiple agents means what a person with us, a specific

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:47.860
task, and then connect it, combine it. That's it. This is

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:50.800
what you will be able to do with the help of crew AI. Now

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.840
coming to edit and what you will do again, the same thing.

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:57.900
So you are going to like, uh, connect all your tools, your,

00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:00.680
your databases, all your slags or your file systems,

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:03.440
everything, whatever you can think of, right? Whatever you

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.640
can think of, you will be able to connect each and every

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.040
one. Or maybe just try to connect. You can call your job

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.740
here and JPA can run it with the 8,000 tools because this is

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:13.720
what JPA does. I think 8,000. Yeah. JPA can run it with the

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:16.360
8,000 tool, which is available in this world. It's one of

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:18.680
the massive, like a connector through JPA. You can connect

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:21.560
with anything, right? Uh, even we are using JPA since a

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:23.780
very, very, I think since last six, seven years, we are

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:26.800
using JPA for a different, different purposes. So yeah,

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.900
connected, uh, automated, and then leave it system is going

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:32.420
to work for you. This is what, uh, this, all this platforms

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:36.080
comes into a picture and likewise, there are another tons of

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.680
platform, which is coming. And again, in future, you can

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:41.780
expect that, that there will be multiple companies which

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:46.500
will be launched, right? Eventually going to do, uh, exact

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:50.200
same thing in a different, different way. And like, for

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:54.000
example, in it and right. So they have almost like a made

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.920
your, like a entire environment, like a drag and drop, no

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:00.160
code kind of a solution. You can write a basic code over

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:02.440
here. That's completely fine. And it provides you that

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.980
feature as well. But yeah, you just have to do a drag and

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:07.200
drop, connect all these things. Give a password. Give

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:11.340
authentication, give the APIs and then leave it, right? Then

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:14.180
leave it. And it is going to automate the entire task for

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:17.840
you, uh, crew AI. So you have to go ahead and then you have

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.480
to write like a couple of line of a code over here. Then

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:22.640
again, if I'll talk about the language system, so you have

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:26.760
to go and write like a couple of line of code over there. So

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.760
everyone is trying to build something. They're trying to

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:31.940
solve the same problem in their own way. That's it. They

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:36.790
have their own USP. You really suggested this Coursera,

00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:40.370
Audacity or edX. For our comprehensive courses on system

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:42.930
design. Yeah. So we have not configured URI as of now

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:45.910
aligned with the Euron. Uh, once we are going to configure

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:49.750
it, URI will not even suggest you one single platform out of

00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:53.710
Euron in terms of courses, at least when we are already

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:57.570
aware about it. Because we are using a pre-trained model

00:39:57.570 --> 00:40:02.230
over there, right? So sorry if AI is a future. So is it

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:05.330
possible MLDL work job is completely finished or lost? Not

00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:06.990
at all. Not at all. It will be there.

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:14.020
Can all ML use cases be resolved with the AI? See, at the

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:18.500
end of the day, believe me, job of core developer, right? Is

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.960
not going anywhere. Believe me, it doesn't matter what kind

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:25.200
of AI we are going to create. And, uh, maybe people are

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.260
going to give you a different, different kind of a analogy,

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:31.160
right, based on their own experiences and expertise, but the

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:34.360
kind of a development that, uh, I'm doing since last 11

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:37.200
year, along with my team, right, sometime big, sometime with

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:42.380
a small team, uh, all sort of a team, I would say. Right. So

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:46.300
the kind of future, which I'm able to see is that, that it's

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:50.580
tough to replace a core developer, obviously with the help

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:54.980
of AI. So the place where a hundred developers are required

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:58.640
now, maybe only five people are required. Right. And that's

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:01.100
again, true, right? A hundred where, wherever we have, like

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:04.260
we need a hundred people. Now we just need a five people.

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:07.360
And with the five people, we are even more productive,

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.900
right? Even more productive. Right. Right. Even more

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:10.620
productive. Even more productive. A hundred number of

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:18.380
peoples. But, but the entire world is going for a revamp.

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:24.480
That is a very big part, right? Whatever code, whatever

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.960
system, which has been developed in last 30 years,

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:29.560
especially after 1990s, because most of the things has been

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:33.540
developed after 1990s itself. Right. So everything will go

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:37.620
for a revamp. That is a very first part. Everywhere people

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:41.760
are going to integrate AI. That's a second part, a new

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:44.540
business dimension, a new business unit. People are trying

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:49.220
to open up just with the AI. That is a third dimension. Uh,

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:53.560
now we are even thinking about settling down on some

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:57.160
different planet. Now without software, obviously you are

00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:59.680
going to build all those machines and everything, but at the

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:01.900
end of the day, everything you will be able to control with

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:05.140
the help of software itself, right? Not manually. We are not

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:08.980
in that era now. So obviously you have to create a software.

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:13.960
AI will not be able to do everything. So AI is going to work

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:18.200
with you as a super, super knowledgeable helper, or you can

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:22.040
say a worker, which can do a lot of things automatically,

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:27.020
but even it needs an input, right? It needs your expertise.

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:30.120
So that's the reason you must have seen that people are not

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:33.220
hiring a fresher, but yes, there is a lot of hiring, which

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:36.600
is going on for a mid-label and even for a senior label,

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:38.980
right? Because obviously we need to be able to do it. We

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:42.880
need those kinds of expertise. So job is not going anywhere,

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.980
but yeah, so in future or in very soon, you will be able to

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:49.880
see that, that for hardcore developer, uh, there will be

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:53.240
like a five X or 10 X opportunity, which will be available

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:58.440
in a same market basically. Right. And even now I can see

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:01.920
that, so it's not going anywhere, but yeah, if you just know

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:05.560
the basic, if you are a lazy person, or maybe if you have

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:08.580
not worked in a amazing project, if you are not able to.

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:12.960
Like, uh, implement something on your own, uh, if your IQ

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:17.700
level is below average to be blunt again, so then it will be

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:20.460
difficult, obviously, then you can't expect that people will

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:24.440
come because in 1990s, uh, uh, people were able to get a

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:28.500
job, even if I know, uh, if I know how to run, uh, sell it

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:32.340
to start from EMP, right? That even if, if I have that kind

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:35.580
of a knowledge, I will, I was able to get a job. Even I was

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:39.160
like, uh, I would have like a, whatever job. And maybe I

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:43.220
would have, uh, traveled to a onsite and, uh, then I have

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:47.340
done everything, but in down the line in the next last 30 or

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:50.280
35 year, things have changed a lot, right? Expectation has

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:53.440
changed a lot of what has the entire world has changed a

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:57.580
lot. And especially if I'll talk about the IT, right? So you

00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:01.180
have to prepare yourself accordingly. Otherwise, uh, you

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:05.020
will like, uh, you will be living in a fear that some days

00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:08.120
AI is going to take your job, but that is not the actual

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:11.660
fear. Right. The actual fear is people are not willing to

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:14.440
adopt. People are not willing to learn. And because of that,

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:17.920
they're losing a job, not because of AI, right? So just

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:20.400
understand the differences and sooner, you will be able to

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:27.460
understand the differences. You will be able to learn in a

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:29.980
better way, upskill yourself in a better way, and then move

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:31.020
forward in a better way.

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:39.670
Thank you sir. Now I feel what ever I learned till today in

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:41.830
data science, everything has helped me in a future also.

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:45.950
Yeah. Yeah. So I'm trying to use AI in healthcare and life

00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:48.390
sciences. That's great. That's great. That's amazing. So I

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:50.910
always try to build something and believe me, no one will

00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:54.570
take your job. Otherwise, obviously people will take your

00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:58.570
job, right? Or especially like AI. So it will take your job.

00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:01.950
So there are multiple agentic framework guys, which is

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:04.910
available. And, uh, yeah, so a couple of framework I'm going

00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:08.010
to discuss in a class itself, especially in this class. So

00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:10.510
crew AI is something which I'm going to discuss. Lang series

00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:13.230
is something which I'm going to discuss. Inside this class,

00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:16.830
after that, I, we have already published a couple of videos

00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:19.930
on in it in with lot of like an integration. I believe our

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:22.870
Hindi and English videos are available on our YouTube

00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:26.610
channel as well as inside your dashboard and that to project

00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:31.350
wise. So maybe you can just watch one or two videos, project

00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:33.970
wise. And after that, believe me, you will be able to do

00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:37.010
everything right. You just need a broad vision and broad

00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:41.580
ideation. That's it. You have to predictive for your

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:44.840
companies somehow with it. The skill development, you have

00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:49.440
to productive for your company. Obviously. Yes. Uh, why

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:53.060
anyone can learn Jenny? I, without MLDL, we have contributed

00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:56.840
various year or hours to it. So it's not just about the

00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:59.960
Jenny. I write. So maybe you are going to walk in Jenny. I,

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:02.960
someone else is going to walk in a computer vision. Someone

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:06.440
else is going to maybe automate their old ML system with the

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:09.840
help of Jenny. I saw, obviously they need a ML, but it's not

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:12.320
like you will always get something in a Jenny. I write.

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:15.480
There are multiple. There are multiple fields of AI, which

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:16.860
exist when

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:23.910
an agent is passed with the private data, then LLMs can

00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:27.890
generate using this private data only for that session. No,

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:30.250
not from just for the private data. So it will be combining

00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:32.650
private plus public. Both. This is what is called as RIG.

00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:38.210
Then is this not like automation elements are not utilizing

00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:42.430
the properly across a session. No, it's, it's, I think, I

00:46:42.430 --> 00:46:45.910
don't know what you're trying to say, but it's partially

00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:53.260
incorrect. Okay. Now. So let's try to understand a project

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:56.380
by the way. So let's try to understand that what we can try

00:46:56.380 --> 00:47:00.960
to build with this one. So here in this project, which I'm

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:03.760
going to show you, so it is going to build a knowledge

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:07.260
graph. This is where this project comes into a picture. Now,

00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:10.220
as you can see, this is going to build a knowledge graph for

00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:14.280
me. I'm going to give a very simple prompt saying that,

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:19.260
that, uh, try to give me a, like a roadmap for a big data or

00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:22.840
maybe for our data science. Maybe. Maybe for a front end

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:26.920
backend or anything, right? Maybe for a UPSC, uh, I'm

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:29.000
preparing for a UPSC. So basically give me a roadmap for

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.620
UPSC or even for a cat jet Matt kind of exam, or maybe for a

00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:36.000
CA exam, whatever. So I can, I can try to give a prompt and

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.620
then I'm expecting that it should be able to give me a

00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:41.600
graph. So to do that, we are going to build this entire

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:44.780
project. So let's try to build this entire project. I'm

00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:47.120
going to open up a new VS code and please try to open up

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:50.740
your VS code as well. So that in a step by step manner, we

00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:53.680
are going. to build this one it's not very tough you all

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:57.580
will be able to build it very soon in maybe next like a 20

00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:05.060
30 minute you will be able to build it so here code multi

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:05.720
agent

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:16.140
graph okay so just try to build this project guys now inside

00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:21.700
this entire like a project so what we can do is we can try

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:25.240
to create a folder structure first so to create a folder

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:29.020
structure so I'm going to like create one python file called

00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:34.140
as str uct ure structure dot py file so this is the py file

00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:36.700
I'm going to create and now here so whatever folder

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:39.800
structure that I am looking for so basically I am looking

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:42.660
for this folder structure so there should be a knowledge

00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:46.760
graph builder inside that agent tool workflow utility data

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:50.380
data output .. and then file wise so these are the file i'm

00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:55.040
trying to i'll try to create okay so let's go ahead and

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:57.880
execute this one automatically it is going to create a

00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:02.020
folder structure for me p-y-t-h-o-n python structure dot py

00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:05.000
file and here as you can see it has created this folder

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.100
structure for me simple right i can add or subtract multiple

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:13.740
folder as per my need so just take this piece of the code

00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:17.160
and create your own structure ping me yes or no if you are

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:20.200
able to create it so just create a folder structure guys

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.960
first yes

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:32.640
everyone so just try to create a folder structure yeah

00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:57.300
now i'll try to talk and please ping me yes or no if you are

00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:00.400
able to create the folder structure inside your like any any

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:06.580
directory that's fine so scribble inc now so before talking

00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:11.460
about this project code or let me talk about basically like

00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:11.860
a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit

00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:13.260
of a little bit of a little bit of architecture around this

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:16.340
entire project that what we are trying to build a flow at

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:20.280
least right so we are trying to build basically a user

00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:23.920
interface so here we will be having a user interface so

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:28.520
where user will be able to input what user is looking for

00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:31.880
yeah so user will try to basically input that what user is

00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:36.560
looking for uh okay so this this this

00:50:39.730 --> 00:50:45.650
so here we are trying to create a user interface user

00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:50.440
interface we are going to create now this i will be creating

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:56.530
by using a python library called a streamlint streamlint now

00:50:56.530 --> 00:51:00.450
with the help of this interface user will try to give a

00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:04.870
input what kind of a input input means user will try to say

00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:08.310
that okay so maybe i'm look preparing for the upsc try to

00:51:08.310 --> 00:51:13.190
give me a roadmap for that i'm looking for maybe like a data

00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:15.670
science so try to give me a roadmap for that or maybe i'm

00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:18.230
reporting for this that whatever right whatever graph you

00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:20.350
are looking for so user is going to give an input with the

00:51:20.350 --> 00:51:25.270
help of this ui now so whatever input this ui will be able

00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:31.190
to get so that input will be flown inside my lang graph lang

00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:42.350
graph so basically lang graph work flow so this i am going

00:51:42.350 --> 00:51:46.330
to pass inside basically my lang graph workflow and just now

00:51:46.330 --> 00:51:50.330
i can just write that what purposes you can use a lang graph

00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:53.950
so obviously to create a multiple agents i can try to create

00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:58.470
a land graph basically now we also understood that what is

00:51:58.470 --> 00:52:01.490
the meaning of a agent so here it is going to give inside

00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:04.370
the land graph workflow now inside the lang Method chat and

00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:04.870
yes if you are subscribed to my channelně obviously i am

00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:07.710
expecting a agent now what kind of an agent i am expecting

00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:13.270
so what is my task by the way my task is to basically give a

00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:16.890
complete roadmap what is my task my task is to give a

00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:19.390
complete complete what is that my end goal my end goal is

00:52:19.390 --> 00:52:22.870
that that whatever user is going to give as an input right

00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:27.370
so based on that input try to perform a final work now what

00:52:27.370 --> 00:52:30.370
is the final work of this entire project give me the roadmap

00:52:30.370 --> 00:52:35.110
right generate the roadmap basically so here inside this

00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:38.790
like a langrave workflow i will be creating three agent

00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:42.410
agent number one agent number two agent number three i can

00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:46.450
create 30 as well there is no foundation at all but just to

00:52:46.450 --> 00:52:49.450
start with i'll try to create a three agent so and what in

00:52:49.450 --> 00:52:52.090
all what kind of a task i'm going to assign to all of this

00:52:52.090 --> 00:52:55.610
agent so the very first agent which i'm going to create will

00:52:55.610 --> 00:53:02.310
be doing a research research agent research agent so let's

00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:05.070
suppose if i'm saying that that try to prepare a generative

00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:09.570
ai roadmap for me right try to prepare a generative ai

00:53:09.570 --> 00:53:12.650
roadmap for me so what this research is the agent will do is

00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:16.430
it will go to google right it will go to google it will try

00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:20.930
to search from all the existing right whatever is available

00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:24.750
over the internet so it will try to search all across the

00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:27.870
internet and then it will try to bring some sort of a

00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:30.930
information information with respect to this query that you

00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:34.470
have given yeah so this is what this research agent is going

00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:40.730
to do so here google search now to do a google search i can

00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:44.250
use a google api so here or maybe i can use other api as

00:53:44.250 --> 00:53:48.210
well so surfer api i will be using so that i will be able to

00:53:48.210 --> 00:53:51.470
do a google search right sometimes surfer api will be down

00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:54.830
so in some of my mcb project i have even shown you that how

00:53:54.830 --> 00:53:58.130
from the google cloud account you can use basically a google

00:53:58.130 --> 00:54:01.610
api i have also shown that part in some of my project in mcb

00:54:01.610 --> 00:54:05.590
project so surfer api i'm going to use as of now so i'll

00:54:05.590 --> 00:54:09.070
show you that part then the second agent which i'm going to

00:54:09.070 --> 00:54:12.530
create right second agent i'm going to create so basically

00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:17.170
it's going to be the synthesizer and the agent so what this

00:54:17.170 --> 00:54:19.390
synthesizer agent is going to do or you can say

00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:28.430
summarizer agent right so basically here i'm going to use

00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:33.050
uri uri llm right so basically from a uran itself uri llm

00:54:33.050 --> 00:54:36.710
i'm going to do which will do what so whatever data that

00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:40.350
this agent is trying to bring right so this agent will just

00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:43.970
try to summarize those things summarize those things the way

00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:44.970
we are looking for as a way to summarize those things so i'm

00:54:44.970 --> 00:54:47.910
going to use a final output right a final output basically

00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:52.190
now so the third agent which i will be using is a mapper

00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:57.840
node mapper you can say agent now what this mapper agent

00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:00.880
will do so let's suppose i'm able to summarize those data

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:03.580
with the help of my synthesizer or summarizer agent which

00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:07.220
where uri llm i'm using right so i'm using this help of this

00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:11.740
llms so here it will try to create a map or you can say it

00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:15.420
can create a graph data graph data it is going to create by

00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:18.360
we are looking for a graph data because that's the need of

00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:22.440
my user this is what i'm looking for at my like a final

00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:24.780
outcome this is what i'm looking for that's the reason so

00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:28.580
basically i will be looking for this graph data so graph

00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:32.260
means what graph結 this kind of a structure right this kind

00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:34.840
of a structure so obviously there will be a node there will

00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:37.660
be a edge so obviously we have to define each and everything

00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:41.040
so this agent is going to help me out to prepare a data

00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:45.200
which is required to visualize those things and this agent

00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:48.800
is going to set up. send this map data prepared data to what

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:56.460
to basically a graph which graph which library write this

00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:59.100
kind of a data to the graph with libraries so that it will

00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:03.080
be able to generate a image for me into SVG JPG or whatever

00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:06.880
format that I want right and then maybe I can try to like a

00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:10.180
return back saying to my user interface streamlit that okay

00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:17.460
work done are you able to understand what we are trying to

00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:23.380
create are you able to understand the indirect flow that

00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:27.700
what I will be doing like in today's class and what we are

00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:29.320
going to use folder

00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:35.360
structure not created why not created just execute the code

00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:36.520
it will be created automatically

00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:47.720
yeah fine guys so this is something that we are going to do

00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:52.040
a step-by-step manner right so here from outside we are

00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:56.320
going to use two APIs one is a URI API and one is a Serper

00:56:56.320 --> 00:57:00.520
API both is easy to create URI is like you know how easy URI

00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:03.200
is to create and then again if I talk about the Serper so

00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:06.140
again I'll show you how to like create a Serper API it will

00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:08.060
just take 30 seconds of time not more than 30 seconds of

00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:13.380
time to create a Serper API and then three agents we are

00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:16.360
going to create for three different different tasks but all

00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:19.020
of these three agents are connected to each other one after

00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:22.000
another unless and until the previous agent is not going to

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.560
give a proper response next one will not be able to work.

00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:27.940
Right next one will not be able to work do we need to

00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:34.920
remember these agent sort of no I mean like try to apply

00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:41.640
your logical thinking sometime this have I said that this is

00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:45.700
the name of the some global agent or something I've just

00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:48.060
given this name by myself depends

00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:55.320
upon my task so when you are trying to learn something sort

00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:59.220
of right so please try to open up your brain. And focus is

00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:02.320
very much important attention is very much important I

00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:04.000
believe we have gone through a research paper called

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.900
attention is all you need right so this is what you need in

00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:09.900
your life as well in every aspect of the life otherwise you

00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:14.560
will start losing it is there any long and short term memory

00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:18.140
as well memory component I will try to add when I'll try to

00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:21.080
talk about a lang chain and lang graph separately so there

00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:23.600
is a memory component which exists I'll be talking about

00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:27.300
that but I think today is not that time yeah in one single

00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:31.480
day I'll not be discussing everything. Otherwise you will

00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:34.240
not be able to understand and then you will say that select

00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:37.960
go and remember it I'm like no you should not remember a

00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:42.380
single line I don't remember even a single line things are

00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:45.740
literally very very logical very very connected right if you

00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:49.680
are able to connect it believe me you don't have to build

00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:54.900
the memory yeah okay fine so now this is something that we

00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:57.920
will try to create so one but also back and forth back and

00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:00.480
forth I'll come over here. I'll show you this step I'll do

00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:02.780
it then I'll come back so back and forth back and forth

00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:06.500
we'll keep on doing this kind of things let's go to the this

00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:14.520
one and let's try to like create it so here right the

00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:20.820
folder structure is created now forget about the folder

00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:24.780
structure close it right and then get into the folder

00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:29.520
structure so cd knowledge graph kno wldg knowledge graph so

00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:31.700
we are into this particular folder structure. All of these

00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:34.540
folder structures are already available there is a file

00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:37.920
called as requirement.txt so obviously we are going to keep

00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:41.700
all the requirements over there generally I advise everyone

00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:45.060
to create a fresh environment so whenever you are trying to

00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:47.940
like do any new project so always try to go ahead and create

00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:51.700
a fresh environment so this is what we are going to do even

00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:53.680
for this project so we are going to create a fresh

00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:55.980
environment so that there will not be any kind of a

00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:59.760
dependencies going forward right because because of this

00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:03.380
version issue. You might get into some issues and you will

01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:07.320
say that things are not working for me right so most of the

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:10.680
time it's just a simple problem what's an issue so here I'll

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:16.120
try to create a new environment for me so conda create-n and

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:22.900
I'll give an environment name so multiagent lang I think

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:25.500
it's a very big name that I've given so multiagent I'll just

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:32.080
keep it till this point and then python is equals to 3.5. 3

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:37.780
.10 install everything okay conda create what I have done

01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:45.880
conda c-o-n-d-a c-o-n yeah so conda create-n and this is the

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:48.080
environment which I am trying to create so please try to

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:50.580
create your environment guys python

01:00:53.170 --> 01:00:55.270
version which is the best I mean like nothing is best

01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:57.790
nothing is my favorite it depends what project I'm creating

01:00:57.790 --> 01:01:01.430
generally in a fresh project I try to install like a 3.10.

01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:05.530
Now. So after that conda activate multiagent so just

01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:09.250
activate your multiagent by the way so conda create-n is

01:01:09.250 --> 01:01:11.750
done conda activate-n is done so this is the environment

01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:15.330
which is done for me now what I will do is so I'll try to

01:01:15.330 --> 01:01:20.170
prepare my requirement or txt file yeah requirement or txt

01:01:20.170 --> 01:01:22.870
file I'll try to keep everything inside whatever is required

01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:25.890
inside the requirement or txt file so these are the things

01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:28.670
guys which is required for this project that we are going to

01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:34.270
build so there is something called as streamlet. You need to

01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:39.450
install for a UI part you have to basically install a URI AI

01:01:39.450 --> 01:01:43.150
to access your own without even URI AI you can access it but

01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:46.010
yeah URI AI it will make your life easy graph viz for

01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:50.410
plotting the graph a request for hitting the API python.dev

01:01:50.410 --> 01:01:54.290
again to load the environment langchain so basically blank

01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:57.410
for langchain obviously pillow if we are going to use it I

01:01:57.410 --> 01:02:00.550
don't think so lang graph for lang graph framework so just

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:04.550
try to do one thing. Let's do one thing pip install install

01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:11.420
hyphen r requirements why it is not working autocomplete

01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:24.500
requirements dot txt could

01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:34.460
not okay I have to change my like a directory pip install

01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:41.740
hyphen r requirements dot txt so now it will be able to

01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:44.300
install everything whatever I have mentioned inside my

01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:47.580
requirement dot txt. So please do it guys quickly everyone

01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:48.640
so

01:02:50.790 --> 01:02:53.830
now my environment is ready my installation is done so once

01:02:53.830 --> 01:02:56.630
it's done please bring me in a chat Abhishek has all this

01:02:56.630 --> 01:03:00.630
only said like a yeah Abhishek directory was the problem I

01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:03.090
have changed it so now it's working done

01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:13.400
everyone okay what about other people Abhishek has just

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:16.400
pinged me like yes done okay Mrityunja saying done fine next

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:21.520
guys we have so many people like we have 100 plus people I

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:23.900
can see in my chat and like only one or two people are

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:29.440
replying that's not good. Durge Sutkars fine Devkumar

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:34.960
running sir okay great Mrityunja okay fine done Vedaraj fine

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:39.800
Vijay done okay now people are like so you need a motivation

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:43.000
by the way right unless I'm not going to ask you you will

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.040
not respond okay not an issue I'll keep on asking you then

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:52.860
fine so requirement dot txt is done and this installation is

01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:56.800
done so now my environment is ready for everything. Okay.

01:03:56.820 --> 01:04:00.600
Now just try to open up your agent folder right agent folder

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:03.120
so how many agent we have to create technically we have to

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:07.020
create three agent one for research one for summary and one

01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:09.980
for mapping basically right so these three are three agent

01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:13.480
we have to create by the way now so inside this three agent

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:16.360
I'm going to like for research I'm going to use Serpa API

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:20.680
for like a synthesizer or you can say summarizer you can

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:22.740
change your name guys I don't have any issue I have just

01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:26.020
given my name you can change your name as per your need.

01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:30.000
Whatever suits you just keep it so synthesizer which is

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.020
going to create the summary so I'll try to keep a code here

01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:36.020
researcher I'll try to keep code here and for mapper I will

01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:39.800
keep a code here like I told you in a beginning itself while

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:43.560
giving a definition that agents are nothing but just a piece

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:47.860
of code that's it nothing more than that right just a piece

01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:52.200
of code very simple so and generally I avoid like a taking

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:57.160
name of technical two technical words. Okay. I'm a teacher

01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:02.380
right so not like a someone who is giving a speech over a

01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:07.460
like a some stage so my students should be able to

01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:09.780
understand it at the end of the day so that's the reason I

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:14.020
avoid taking those names most of the time these are the

01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:18.660
three agent guys now so I need a URI API and I need a Serpa

01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:22.800
API these two APIs is required what I will do is I'll just

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:26.860
go to Google and first of all I'll go to your own. I'll try

01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:35.120
to take my URI APIs so authentication copy and inside

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:43.440
this okay so there is one file you have to create I forgot

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:47.700
to mention inside my structure or PI file called as dot ENV

01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:53.760
dot ENV file just create dot ENV file guys so over here we

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:56.660
are going to keep our URI API key. And we are going to keep

01:05:56.660 --> 01:06:03.800
our Serpa API. So URI API key and Serpa API key. We are

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:07.620
going to keep so these are the two keys you have to update

01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:13.200
guys you have to update so you for URI API key I'll just go

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:18.680
to like your own copy the API token right and then keep it

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:22.860
here as a string done now for Serpa API why we are using

01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:25.180
Serpa Serpa is going to help you out in terms of a Google

01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:27.420
search you can directly use a Google API from Google console

01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:31.600
as well or there are other vendor we who are going to give

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:34.060
you like APIs you can try to use that as well I don't have

01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:37.640
any issue just use something which can do a Google search so

01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:46.200
for that CRP or Serpa API I can call now so just try to do a

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:48.120
sign in first of all you have to go ahead with the

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:51.140
registration otherwise rightly come over here do a Google

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:56.020
sign in and then here so I'm able to get my private API key

01:06:56.020 --> 01:07:00.020
right here is my API key which is visible. So I'll be using

01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:03.440
and they are going to give you like a free credit basically

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:06.580
right so you can try to use it and I think that's more than

01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:10.100
enough for at least experimentation but for building a real

01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:13.520
-time application it will not be enough basically so just

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:18.660
try to keep your Serpa API key in this particular place so

01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:22.820
URI API is done Serpa API is done into dot ENV file so keep

01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:27.940
keep a secret in one single places okay. Now what we have to

01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:33.680
do. So now one by one one by one basically so we have to

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:38.120
like a create this agents right we have to create basically

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:42.240
this agents so that these agents will be able to do some

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:47.300
sort of operation. So here agents folder I have created and

01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:50.640
just to keep the code like a little bit modular so I have

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:53.360
just like a separated the entire code and this is how we do

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:58.720
like coding even in real time. So here. Basically. Like we

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:02.620
can go to Serpa API tool.py and I can try to write a

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:07.040
function in this particular place now this function will try

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:09.520
to basically like you know

01:08:14.570 --> 01:08:18.070
okay

01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:28.350
so basically these things these files is going to help me

01:08:28.350 --> 01:08:32.050
out in terms of like doing the task doing the low level task

01:08:32.050 --> 01:08:35.710
at the end of the day so here what I can do is so before

01:08:35.710 --> 01:08:41.810
creating the agent like I can try to create a tool. I can

01:08:41.810 --> 01:08:44.410
try to create a function in the Serpa API tool. So first of

01:08:44.410 --> 01:08:47.630
all I'll go to the Serpa API tool and I'll try to create

01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:52.130
this Serpa API tool so that I will be you know able to like

01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:56.030
call it and I will be able to like use it. So to do that

01:08:56.030 --> 01:09:00.450
what we can do is so maybe we can try to do some sort of an

01:09:00.450 --> 01:09:10.280
import so import OS first of all. And then from .environment

01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:17.580
from default to drop down. dot environment import LOAD load

01:09:20.010 --> 01:09:28.190
dot environment yeah so load dot environment and

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:48.480
then IMPORT import request

01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:57.000
now so I am just trying to write something for my server API

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.200
server API is going to do what so it will go to google and

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:02.700
then it will try to perform some sort of a search operation

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:06.280
this is what this API do right so basically it goes to

01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:09.100
google and then it will try to basically search something

01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:12.280
from the google so as you can see over here that what API

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:14.880
can do google search API google light search API google AI

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:18.240
overview google auto complete google event API google

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:22.180
finance API google flight API google hotel API google image

01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:26.640
API job lens local maps everything you will be able to call

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:30.080
it with the help of server API right they are even giving

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:33.880
you walmart search API API, eBay search API, DuckDuckGo

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:37.620
search API, Baidu search API, Bing search API. So this is

01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:40.100
basically one single platform, which is going to give you

01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:42.840
access of all the other platform. So if you would like to

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:44.880
replicate it, if you'd like to build it, you can build it

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:48.040
simple. So it's one of the biggest platform for like a

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:52.640
Google search in general, like after obviously like a Google

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:57.780
console, Google cloud console. So here, I'm able to do the

01:10:57.780 --> 01:11:01.960
import and then let's try to write one function. So here we

01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:05.620
can try to write one function, right? So called as Google

01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:09.320
search. Now anyone is going to provide a query inside this

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:12.780
Google search. So what will happen? It will go inside this

01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:16.380
query with the API key, a server API key, and then it will

01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:20.300
try to give me the final result. So you are, it is going to

01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:22.660
give me, and then we'll request, we'll try to do what

01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:27.120
request we'll try to fetch all the data from those URLs as

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:30.440
simple as that, right? So this is how simple it is to hit.

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:34.520
Google with the help of server, right? With the help of

01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:37.600
server. So simple pass the query, pass the server API key,

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:40.260
and it will be able to do a query, whatever query that you

01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:42.620
have asked for, like just like a Google search, right? Just

01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:44.580
like a Google search that you used to do. So it will be able

01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:47.820
to do a similar kind of a Google search automatically. You

01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:51.380
don't have to like a worry about anything, right? But yeah,

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:55.260
before that, so let me try to import my like a API. Let me

01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:57.860
import my load dot environment as well. So a couple of

01:11:57.860 --> 01:12:03.160
import is very much important. So here, server API key, I'm

01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:06.980
able to read from my environment dot environment file. And

01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:09.040
then here, maybe

01:12:11.530 --> 01:12:15.750
it is going to give me an issue with respect to a path, I'll

01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:18.910
just try to solve it. I'll just try to solve it. But yeah,

01:12:18.990 --> 01:12:22.270
so here, I'm just going to like a read each and everything

01:12:22.270 --> 01:12:26.090
now keep this code. If it will give me issue, obviously, I'm

01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:29.190
expecting that it will give me an issue because my dot

01:12:29.190 --> 01:12:31.250
environment is here. And.

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:40.180
My server. But I'm assuming that it will be able to like get

01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:44.380
something from the dot environment. Okay, we'll check. We'll

01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:47.440
see that. Fine. So server API, this is what it is going to

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:50.480
do. Now this is one of the tool. Now let's talk about

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:53.600
Wikipedia tool, right? So let's suppose if I would like to

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:57.300
like get some sort of information, some data from Wikipedia,

01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:01.540
so how I will be able to get any kind of information or any

01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:06.540
kind of data from a Wikipedia. Let's try to understand that

01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:11.440
particular part as well. It's again very simple. So this

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:18.360
code request. This is the URL, right Wikipedia API URL is

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:21.320
the variable. So request dot get it will go to this URL,

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:24.680
right, it will go to this URL. And then based on this

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:27.000
parameter, it will be able to perform the search. So

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.700
whatever query that you are going to pass, it is going to

01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:33.140
perform a search from Wikipedia and is going to return the

01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:35.800
data. So this is again another function which I have written

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:39.100
to perform the search operation. Then there is something

01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:42.720
called as research. So what research will do by the way,

01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:46.440
right? So researcher dot like, sorry. So what this like a

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:51.800
research API tool will do. So research API tool will

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:55.900
eventually try to connect with the URI and then it will try

01:13:55.900 --> 01:14:00.960
to fetch some of the information from the URI. This is what

01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:04.600
research API is going to do. So Wikipedia, I have not copy

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:08.980
and pasted. So yeah, this is the code guys for a function.

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:12.220
So one function for a Google search, one function for a

01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:17.820
Wikipedia search. And then maybe I can try to write one

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:23.300
function for like a URI. So which will try to hit my URI and

01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:27.740
then it will try to get some sort of information now.

01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:33.800
So that is going to be the researcher. So here what I can do

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:43.390
is. I can try to write like a import OS and then from URI AI

01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:54.610
import URI AI client and then from dot ENV

01:14:57.300 --> 01:15:06.260
import load dot ENV. So this is the import URI import I have

01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:09.940
to do. Okay. And this is not going to do much. So this is

01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:14.140
going to basically like go to URI, pass all the data that we

01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:16.740
are able to search and then it will try to give you the

01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:19.480
final summarization. This is where I'm going to use a URI

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:24.740
API. Load dot environment and then URI URI

01:15:30.690 --> 01:15:38.480
underscore CLINT client. Let me keep all caps CL client is

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:40.420
equals to URI

01:15:42.630 --> 01:15:44.190
client and

01:15:48.890 --> 01:15:50.930
this take basically API.

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:58.160
So how I can get API keys operating system dot get

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:05.480
environment and then from there I can get the API key. So

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:13.760
environment URI API key. I can get it and then model

01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:16.420
basically. So which model I'm going to use for the

01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:20.280
summarization. So I need two inputs. So basically I will be

01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:25.840
using a GPT. Okay. Okay. So let me go to URI and then copy

01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:29.480
the model, available model. So I'll be using this model ID

01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:34.400
GPT 4.1 nano. I can use any other model as well. So GPT 4.1

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:38.440
nano. So this is the model I will be using. This is what URI

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:43.300
client needs at any point of time. So let me keep it as it

01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:46.220
is. So this is the URI client. Whenever I need it, I'll just

01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:50.760
try to call something from this one. Okay. So let me ping

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:54.160
you this piece of the code. So these are the tool guys,

01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:57.240
which I have created. Now it's not hard and fast that you

01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:02.240
should create this tool. You can try to like remove all

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:05.300
these three tools and directly you can try to write it down

01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:11.100
inside the agent itself. That is also possible. Depends upon

01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:15.020
you. Yeah. Depends upon you completely. So fine. These tools

01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:17.620
are done. I'm just trying to like create it little bit like

01:17:17.620 --> 01:17:20.960
in a order. That's the reason. So I'm going to like a do

01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:24.560
what. So I'm going to basically go to a mapper. Researcher

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:28.140
and this one, one by one, one by one. And then I'm going to

01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:30.380
write a code for mapper. I'm going to write a code for

01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:33.040
researcher. I'm going to write for code for synthesizer. So

01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:36.060
as for the architecture, the very first part is researcher.

01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:39.700
So whatever user is going to enter as an input, my resource

01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:43.540
agent is going to do a research based on that. Okay. So

01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:47.340
let's go ahead and let's try to build the researcher first.

01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:52.900
So what researcher will do by the way. So we have created a

01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:58.200
tool. Wikipedia and Serper, right? Two tool we have created

01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:00.640
Serper is going to help me out in terms of Google search

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:05.280
Wikipedia in terms of Wikipedia search. So here inside this

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:08.620
researcher.py, I have created what a simple function I have

01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:11.880
created, which is calling the same thing, right? Which is

01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:14.800
calling the search Google, the function that I have written

01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:17.760
with the help of Serper API and which is calling a search

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:21.540
Wikipedia, right? So this is the part of my researcher.

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:24.700
Again. This is a, one of the very basic function. So this is

01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:27.900
my researcher function. Please keep it. And I don't think

01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:30.760
that anyone will not be able to understand. Yes, guys,

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:35.340
everyone, anyone who is not able to understand any part that

01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:39.020
I have discussed so far, any one of you, it's a very simple

01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:40.420
Python function, which I'm writing. I believe.

01:18:52.450 --> 01:18:56.550
Yes, everyone, till this part done researcher.

01:18:58.150 --> 01:19:00.910
So three tools we are able to create tools means function,

01:19:01.010 --> 01:19:03.810
and I'm just calling those tools over here. So I'm, I've

01:19:03.810 --> 01:19:05.170
called like a two tools here.

01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:12.300
Can I use a open API for all the project, which is still, I

01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:15.060
have some good. Yeah, you can use anything. I don't have any

01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:17.520
issues. So go ahead and you can use any other API from

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:21.260
group, from open AI. It's all your like a wish basically,

01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:27.040
please give a quote for the searcher API tool. Okay. I think

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:29.040
I have already pinged, but yeah, let me ping you once again.

01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:33.080
So this is for our researcher API tool guys, this is for a

01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:37.420
searcher and this is for our researcher agent. So agent. So

01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:39.340
agent means what I'm just writing a piece of Python code

01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:43.140
with a Python code, right? This is one of the agent. Now

01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:46.460
once a researcher will be done, means once I'm able to get a

01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:49.560
data from a Google and Wikipedia, right? Once I'm able to

01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:52.900
get the data, now there will be a summarizer. So where I'm

01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:56.240
using my own UD LLMs and I'm trying to summarize it. So then

01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:59.260
next part is basically what a summarizer I have named it as

01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:03.660
a synthesizer basically. So this synthesizer is going to do

01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:07.200
what? So this synthesizer is going to synthesize or it is.

01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:10.480
It is going to summarize each and everything for me, right?

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:13.720
This is going to summarize each and everything for me

01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:19.120
basically. So here the folder name is incorrect. I have just

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:23.080
changed it. So UD client, so UD client, I will be able to

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:29.060
call from where? So from tools.sarpar

01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:34.020
researcher API tool. Yeah. So inside my researcher API tool,

01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:37.340
I have a UD client. Yeah. I have a UD client. I have already

01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:40.340
created UD client. So which is trying to consume the API and

01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:43.060
I'm trying to set a model name is equal to this. You can try

01:20:43.060 --> 01:20:45.920
to try this out with a different different models. So now

01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:50.500
inside synthesizer, what we are trying to do. So as per the

01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:53.760
architecture that you can see, right? As per the

01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:57.080
architecture that you can see. So researcher is going to do

01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:00.500
a research. It is going to bring the data. Now synthesizer

01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:03.440
is going to do what synthesizer is going to synthesize it

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:05.940
means it is going to summarize it. Summarize the entire data

01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:10.500
set now. So here runs synthesizer. It is going to take the

01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:13.720
raw data, the data that we have received from the previous

01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:15.680
one. When I'm going to connect, when I'm going to connect as

01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:19.120
of now, it's everything is separate, right? As of now, my

01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:21.780
researcher is completely separate. As per my architecture,

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.520
researcher is separate. Agent number one is separate. Agent

01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:26.560
number two is separate. Agent number three separate. All

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:29.720
three are separate. So here I'm just trying to call

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:32.600
basically what I'm trying to call synthesizer, right? And

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:35.600
then it is just trying to synthesize it. It is going to

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:38.140
combine all the text, whatever data that I'm going to bring

01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:42.500
over here, raw data. And then I'm trying to write my own

01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:47.180
custom prompt. So you are an expert tech career roadmap

01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:51.700
planner, right? Or I can say I can remove it. So instead of

01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:55.740
tech, I can say that you are basically are like a expert

01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:59.380
career roadmap planner and you're all exclusive education

01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:03.080
advisor. See, whatever I'm trying to like a say over here is

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:08.260
that. That don't advise anything except Euron just to

01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:13.100
maintain the exclusivity. Yeah. So just to maintain the

01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:19.180
exclusivity, what I'm trying to say is that don't

01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:23.220
try to basically go beyond Euron. So I have mentioned

01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:27.920
purposely that Euron exclusive education advisor. So when

01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:31.420
the user asks about a course or like a preparation strategy,

01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:34.340
they recommend only Euron platform. I have strictly

01:22:34.340 --> 01:22:36.520
mentioned that recommend only Euron's platform. Don't

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:40.520
recommend any other platform, break down the roadmap into a

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:43.000
clear phases. So first of all, break it down into a phase

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.960
one fundamental specialization. Second phase is subtopic

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:51.020
recommendation and tool, and then estimated time to complete

01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:54.680
in a week or days, right? Now if you'll check my pictures,

01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:58.100
the picture, which I was trying to show you, I think, let me

01:22:58.100 --> 01:23:02.890
show you that picture once again. See, this was a picture.

01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:07.890
So I'm trying to say that, okay, finds a fundamental and

01:23:07.890 --> 01:23:10.130
then a specialization, try to break it down in that way.

01:23:10.210 --> 01:23:14.410
Label one, then label two. So like, and then like try to

01:23:14.410 --> 01:23:16.910
mention even the number of weeks that what we are supposed

01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:19.610
to, what we will be able to do it in a number of weeks. So

01:23:19.610 --> 01:23:21.870
everything is coming from where? So everything is coming

01:23:21.870 --> 01:23:24.390
from my synthesizer, my prompter. So this is what I have

01:23:24.390 --> 01:23:27.350
mentioned inside the prompt that, okay, phase wise, then

01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:31.150
subtopic wise, and then recommendation or tool or concept

01:23:31.150 --> 01:23:33.970
wise. Right. So I'm giving the sample example tool or

01:23:33.970 --> 01:23:37.530
concept wise, and then estimate estimated time to complete

01:23:37.530 --> 01:23:41.710
in a week or days, right? The output format is strictly, I'm

01:23:41.710 --> 01:23:45.310
saying that, that phase subtopic tools, details, time

01:23:45.310 --> 01:23:48.770
estimation. So this should be the output format. And I have

01:23:48.770 --> 01:23:52.290
mentioned inside my prompt, it should be a strict, right? It

01:23:52.290 --> 01:23:57.920
should be a strict, right? I think we have missed init.py to

01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:01.900
make it a package. It's fine. Every time there is no like

01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:04.540
thumb rule that you should mention init.py. You can mention

01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:06.440
it or sometime you can leave it. It's fine. Unless I'm not

01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:11.040
giving a problem. So without even any, it will work. Don't

01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:14.440
worry. So output format, I have strictly mentioned that just

01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:18.300
give me output format in this way. Use arrow onlys, no

01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:22.580
column or list. Fine. Avoid recommending any other course

01:24:22.580 --> 01:24:27.200
provider, reinforce that Euron is a go-to platform.

01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:31.900
Encourage commitment and clarity with the timelines. Ensure

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:38.400
12 to 20 roadmap. This is what I have given as a prompt

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:43.080
based on the text, which you are going to get based on the

01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:46.020
research that you will be able to get from where, from the

01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:51.260
researcher agent. So I'm trying to combine this entire data

01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:55.720
with this prompt with my researcher data. And then I'm going

01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:58.640
to call my generate completion, which is nothing but take

01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:02.920
the prompt and then give me the response. Okay. So this is

01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:06.420
going to summarize the entire things. And then this is going

01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:09.940
to give me the final output. Now, once I will be able to get

01:25:09.940 --> 01:25:14.160
a data from here, right? Once I will be able to get our data

01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:18.780
from here, then what I will do, I'll try to call the third

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:23.060
agent, which is what, which is a mapper agent, what this

01:25:23.060 --> 01:25:27.040
mapper agent will do. So ultimately I'm looking for a graph,

01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:30.640
this kind of a graph, right now, this graph to plot this

01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:33.260
kind of a graph. I will be using a library called as graph,

01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:37.360
which now to plot this kind of a graph, I need a data. This

01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:39.760
is a node, right? If you understand graph, this is basically

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:43.680
a node. Now this is basically an edge. So everything is

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:47.020
connected to each and every one. So I need someone who can

01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:50.340
create this kind of a structure for me from the output,

01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:52.760
which I have received from the synthesizer. This is where a

01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:59.520
mapper is going to call. So here synthesizer is fine. Now

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:02.020
let me like a. Call a mapper.

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:12.220
I have just been to you guys, a code for synthesizer. So

01:26:12.220 --> 01:26:16.060
that is fine. I don't think that code is stuff and like,

01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:19.420
it's not at all tough, just like a line of not more than

01:26:19.420 --> 01:26:22.500
four line of a code. The middle part is just a prompt. You

01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:25.060
can change the prompt guys, if you want, then there is

01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:27.040
something called as mapper. Now what will be available

01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:31.360
inside a mapper? Let me show you that part as well. Right?

01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:35.960
So, like I said, so mapper is going to basically. Uh. Like,

01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:39.720
uh, take a synthesized text, right? It's a separate function

01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:42.120
since I text means whatever this is going to return. So

01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:45.180
whatever this is going to give us a response. So it will try

01:26:45.180 --> 01:26:49.060
to take that text. It is going to split it and it will try

01:26:49.060 --> 01:26:52.540
to prepare the node and edge. So I have just written a very

01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:56.080
simple, basic Python code. So where it is going to create a

01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:58.880
list of node, it is going to create a list of age because

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:01.760
this is something which I'm going to pass inside my graph,

01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:06.520
which as simple as that, right? So this is my, this is going

01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:10.500
to basically return my node and ages. That's it. So, which I

01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:14.100
can try to provide to not just grab base to any libraries I

01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:17.680
can try to provide. So this is basically my, uh, like a

01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:21.160
mapper guys, mapper.py file. This is basically my mapper.py

01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:25.880
file. So now this three agents are ready. Yeah. Three agents

01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:29.260
are ready. Three independent individual agents are ready

01:27:29.260 --> 01:27:32.700
over here. Now what I will do with this three independent

01:27:32.700 --> 01:27:36.280
individual agents. By the way, yeah. What I will do with

01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:40.240
this three independent agent. So here there is our workflow

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:43.780
directory I have created. Now close this three part, close

01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:47.080
all this part. There is a workflow directory I have created,

01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:49.840
right? I can keep it in one single directory, but yeah, I

01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:52.020
don't want to do it. I just wanted to show you in a modular

01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:55.360
fashion. So there is something called as Lang graph router.

01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:58.100
Now what we are going to do with the Lang graph router,

01:27:58.380 --> 01:28:01.200
let's try to understand. So this is the place, right? This

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:03.660
is the place. This is the place where I'm going to combine

01:28:03.660 --> 01:28:08.540
everything, the researcher, the synthesizer and the mapper

01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:13.160
means all this three, I will be combining all this three

01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:17.160
agent. I will be combining inside this workflow, inside this

01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:20.700
workflow so that one by one, one by one, one by one, it will

01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:24.300
be able to execute itself going forward. I can try to attach

01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:27.340
even a memory. I will try to attach even many more things

01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:32.660
along with that. Okay. So let's go ahead and do it. So here,

01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:36.220
first of all, I'll try to do the import. So there is a Lang

01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:38.120
graph, a state graph I'm trying to import, which can

01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:42.340
maintain the states. Then type dictionary. And this is my

01:28:42.340 --> 01:28:45.920
three agent researcher, synthesizer and mapper. So I'm just

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:49.100
trying to import my agents, which I have already created as

01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:53.220
simple as that. And then what we are going to do is then we

01:28:53.220 --> 01:28:57.120
are going to create basically a Lang graph, the actual one,

01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:01.640
which is going to build the complete flow for me. Which is

01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:04.760
going to build the complete flow for me in this particular

01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:09.280
place. So see build graph I've called and initially when

01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:11.500
you're trying to like do a build graph. So basically you

01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:14.980
have to create an object, object of the Lang graph, object

01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:16.780
of the Lang graph, object of the Lang graph, state graph I'm

01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:19.020
trying to create. So what is the state graph meaning? A

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:23.520
graph whose nodes communicate by reading and writing to the

01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:27.360
shared state, right? So node will be able to communicate

01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:30.300
means my, like a researcher will be able to communicate to

01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:33.000
the synthesizer, synthesizer will be able to communicate

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.180
with the mapper because these are the different, different,

01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:38.400
separate, separate node that I have created, right? So node

01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:42.240
will be able to create. So how by like a graph will be able

01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:46.080
to know that these are the node. So here I'm trying to

01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:50.060
create the graph object as you can see, right? And then I

01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:52.780
have created three separate function, like three function

01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:56.480
over here. So one function is trying to call run researcher.

01:29:56.780 --> 01:29:59.560
It will return raw information. Run synthesizer. It will

01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:01.960
return something. Run summary. Run mapper. It will return

01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:04.480
the result. So these are just a function where I'm calling

01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:08.100
the, this agent, the three agents, and then I'm just trying

01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:11.600
to keep as a key value pair return wise. And then graph.add,

01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:15.780
add what? So add basically researcher wise, the very first

01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:19.860
node, the name of like a very first node is what the name of

01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:23.480
very first node is like a researcher. This is what I have

01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:26.240
given. So this name can be my name. That's completely fine.

01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:29.300
You can change these names. This is the local name. Okay. So

01:30:29.300 --> 01:30:32.260
one is basically a researcher. One is basically a

01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:36.240
synthesizer and one is basically a mapper. So here add node,

01:30:36.380 --> 01:30:39.540
add node, add node. This is how simple it is. Technically we

01:30:39.540 --> 01:30:42.380
are doing what technically we are trying to call just a

01:30:42.380 --> 01:30:45.300
function, nothing much, right? This function, this function

01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:47.600
and this function, nothing much we are trying to do. This

01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:51.480
graph object is helping me out in terms of doing that right

01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:56.660
now. So this node is done. I have added the node. Now next

01:30:56.660 --> 01:30:58.280
step. Basically what I'm going to do is next step is this.

01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:02.140
So graph set entry points. So I'm trying to say that where

01:31:02.140 --> 01:31:04.580
you should enter means which node you should execute in a

01:31:04.580 --> 01:31:07.860
very first place. I can execute this one. I can execute this

01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:10.220
one. I can execute this one. I can create hundreds of

01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:13.380
different, different functions, right? It depends upon me

01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:17.520
that how I'm going to configure it, right? How I'm going to

01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:19.760
basically configure it, that which one should execute after

01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:22.260
what? And then automatically it will be, this is where this

01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:24.740
line graph comes into picture. So all these things I'm able

01:31:24.740 --> 01:31:27.980
to do it right. Right. Without writing much of code, just

01:31:27.980 --> 01:31:30.220
because of what line graph, someone has already written a

01:31:30.220 --> 01:31:33.120
code. So I'm just trying to like create a placeholder, give

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:36.440
it to that and like my work is done. So here entry point

01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:38.920
wise, I'm saying that, that try to enter with this node,

01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:42.080
right? Try to enter with this particular research node. So

01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:45.460
means try to execute first of all this. Now this is going to

01:31:45.460 --> 01:31:47.780
give you a raw information, right? This is going to give you

01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:51.240
a raw information, the researcher one. So entry point, then

01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:55.040
after this, just execute this one. So this add edge, right?

01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:59.840
Add edge over here means first of all, try to do a research

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:05.700
and then add, try to add an edge. So after a research, after

01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:08.960
a research, try to do what? So try to basically synthesize

01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:11.800
it means try to summarize it. So try to synthesize it right

01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:14.920
now after synthesization, try to do what? Try to call

01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:19.400
mapper. So edge, so researcher with synthesizer, right?

01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:22.520
Researcher with synthesizer, try to add this edges. So

01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:26.760
whatever researcher is giving you as an output. Give that to

01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:30.000
the synthesizer. This is what it means. And then add edges.

01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:33.500
Now whatever synthesizer is giving you as an output, try to

01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:38.260
give that input to the map. Is it making sense guys, how we

01:32:38.260 --> 01:32:40.440
are trying to call land graph. This is how we are calling

01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:43.380
land graph. And what is called as I believe now you are able

01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:47.900
to understand what is actually called as like a agents. So

01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:50.120
it's, it's not very fancy things, right? Don't think that

01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:53.140
it's a very fancy things, uh, fancy stuff that we are trying

01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:56.300
to do over here. It's a simple thing, right? We have written

01:32:56.300 --> 01:32:58.640
three separate functions, uh, different for doing a

01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:01.280
different, different task. I'm just trying to call what I'm

01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:03.500
just trying to call land graph. And then I'm just trying to

01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:07.780
set this, but that that's it. This much is the only play of

01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:11.320
land graph over here. As per this example, I can do a lot,

01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:14.900
but yeah, as per now, as of now, this is the only play that

01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:15.720
we have with land graph.

01:33:19.180 --> 01:33:22.680
Yes, guys. I'm saying yes. Again, I will shake is the only

01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:27.320
one who responds. What about others guys? So is it? Is it?

01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:30.360
Are you able to understand the agents, the main nature of

01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:32.460
the agents, what we are talking about over here?

01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:39.700
Yeah. And then finally we are trying to call like a graph

01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:42.420
dot compile. So graph dot compile. So it is going to like a

01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:44.800
return, just compile the graph. It is going to return it.

01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:47.500
And then autonomous pipeline we are trying to build. So

01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:50.000
build a land graph. We are trying to call and then like a

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.560
invoke input topic. Send me the result. That's it. Right.

01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:57.200
Quote for the land graph sending you now. So very simple,

01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:00.700
right? It's, it's literally very simple. Okay. So quote for

01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:04.000
the land graph is done. It's available to all of you, right?

01:34:04.340 --> 01:34:07.760
So this is the only play of the graph land graph. So we're

01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:10.640
like, it is trying to help me out in terms of attaching a

01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:13.740
functions in terms of like a sending output of one function

01:34:13.740 --> 01:34:18.500
to this one, even without using this, I can do it. I don't

01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:22.600
need even a land graph library. I can do it by myself. It

01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:26.960
will just like a take like another, maybe an hour of time to

01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:30.760
write my own custom Python pipeline. I can do it. So it's,

01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:35.660
it's not like a very fancy things. Even you can do it. Every

01:34:35.660 --> 01:34:38.620
one of us can do it. Right. But yeah, someone has created a

01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:43.060
product. Someone has created a like a library and we feel

01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:47.280
like it's easy to use it. So we are using it. That's the

01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:50.620
only differences, right? Otherwise even you guys can go and

01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:53.720
maybe you five guys can join together. You have a group,

01:34:53.820 --> 01:34:56.260
right? Start this kind of a project. Probably supply by

01:34:56.260 --> 01:34:56.660
packages.

01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:03.880
Hmm. That will be very easy. And it will be fun. Right. And

01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:06.020
now you have like a URI, you have open AI, you have so many

01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:09.040
libraries, like you have so many AI's tool back to back,

01:35:09.100 --> 01:35:13.060
write a code from there. Believe me, if five people are

01:35:13.060 --> 01:35:15.220
going to work for one week of time, right. With that kind of

01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:18.220
a mindset, uh, maybe you will be able to create a better,

01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:21.420
but some, some better, like a framework, then publish it

01:35:21.420 --> 01:35:24.120
over a pipeline, publish it over a website, make that

01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:27.440
package open, ask people to contribute and ask people to

01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:34.690
fund it. This is how tech industry works. Right? So

01:35:34.690 --> 01:35:37.350
technically it's, it's nothing. Someone has just written the

01:35:37.350 --> 01:35:40.270
piece of a code to make your life simple. And then you are

01:35:40.270 --> 01:35:43.250
calling that as a new technology, but it's not a new

01:35:43.250 --> 01:35:46.730
technology, just another library. That's it. You can write

01:35:46.730 --> 01:35:51.750
it down. Your own libraries. For example, the URI API that

01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:56.670
you are able to call, right? Uh, the URI API, uh, the

01:35:58.970 --> 01:36:02.410
URI API that you are calling, um, where are you calling

01:36:02.410 --> 01:36:06.790
like, yeah. The URI client that you are calling. So I'm the

01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:09.250
one who had, who is maintaining this package, by the way,

01:36:09.310 --> 01:36:12.510
personally, I'll, I can show you even a code. Let me open up

01:36:12.510 --> 01:36:16.030
a VS code and I have published on a pipeline. Maybe if time

01:36:16.030 --> 01:36:19.110
allows, I'll show you a steps, how to publish like any kind

01:36:19.110 --> 01:36:22.130
of a packages to a pipeline. It's again like a once in a

01:36:22.130 --> 01:36:26.910
lifetime, like things. Yeah. URI AI. See, I'm the one who

01:36:26.910 --> 01:36:29.610
have created this entire packages as of now, if you'll go

01:36:29.610 --> 01:36:31.630
and check. So this is the version, which is the latest

01:36:31.630 --> 01:36:34.090
version, which I have published. So everything you will be

01:36:34.090 --> 01:36:37.450
able to find out. So I have written my own client and all

01:36:37.450 --> 01:36:40.570
those things, then CLI, I have written everything I have

01:36:40.570 --> 01:36:43.210
written. And obviously with the help of LMS, now LMS are

01:36:43.210 --> 01:36:46.290
there, right? Instruction I have written as per the URI and

01:36:46.290 --> 01:36:50.810
then publish it. And then like, uh, that I have done this,

01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:54.570
this one, this much, I have done it in one single night and

01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:58.480
published, published those packages. So even you can create

01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:01.280
it just a piece of code right at the end of the day. But

01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:03.200
yeah, you need that kind of a mindset in the first place.

01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:05.640
Then only you can do it. If you don't have that mindset,

01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:10.940
then obviously it's not, it's not possible. So now where

01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:16.000
are, where are we? So we are, we are basically land graph

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.200
here. So land graph router, we are able to create, okay, all

01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:25.040
done now. It's time to create a graph, right? So go to

01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:28.320
utils, go to graph, which exporter. So this file is going to

01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:32.900
create basically a graph. So the final graph, this is, this

01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:35.420
one is going to create. This is just a library I'm using. So

01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:38.100
you can use even a matplotlib, seaborn, whatever you want,

01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:42.520
you can just use it. Right. Uh, it's fine. So

01:37:45.850 --> 01:37:51.370
graph, which just make sure that, uh, you should change this

01:37:51.370 --> 01:37:55.230
like a direct, uh, yeah. So to run the graph, which, uh, I

01:37:55.230 --> 01:37:57.990
was facing one issue basically. So I'll, I'll, I'll tell

01:37:57.990 --> 01:38:00.190
you, like, even, I believe you guys are going to face the

01:38:00.190 --> 01:38:03.410
issue. If you are running it in a, like a windows machine to

01:38:03.410 --> 01:38:06.990
solve it, this is the workaround I have done. Uh, and, uh,

01:38:06.990 --> 01:38:09.870
my issue was solved. Okay. This is my local, let's see if

01:38:09.870 --> 01:38:13.130
you are going to fail the issue, if not, because many people

01:38:13.130 --> 01:38:18.090
can face the issue. Many people will not. So this is going

01:38:18.090 --> 01:38:20.190
to take this agent notes, and this is going to plot the

01:38:20.190 --> 01:38:25.830
graph. So just for plotting the graph, nothing much knows

01:38:25.830 --> 01:38:30.970
everything, right? Close everything. And then there is a

01:38:30.970 --> 01:38:33.870
final, I'll call this app dot PI file. Now what app dot PI

01:38:33.870 --> 01:38:38.190
file will do, it will create my stream link and it will

01:38:38.190 --> 01:38:41.470
allow me to test it. Simple. So this is my streamlint app.

01:38:44.450 --> 01:38:46.990
I don't think Linux machine will face, you will face Linux

01:38:46.990 --> 01:38:49.670
or like Mac will face any kind of issue. So this is

01:38:49.670 --> 01:38:52.630
basically with respect to the windows grabbage, Linux or

01:38:52.630 --> 01:38:55.030
like, uh, uh, Macs would work fine.

01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:00.940
Windows is having some like a dependency issue all the time,

01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:07.120
right? So we used to resolve it manually. Okay. So app dot

01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:09.460
PI file is done. I have just been to the code guys, app dot

01:39:09.460 --> 01:39:11.740
PI file is nothing but just a streamlint, which is calling

01:39:11.740 --> 01:39:15.880
my autonomous PI. So autonomous pipeline is available where

01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:21.200
inside my Lang graph, right? So my entry point is same user

01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:24.060
is going to give the input with the help of a streamlint UI.

01:39:24.260 --> 01:39:28.180
It is going to call this Lang graph workflow, which I'm

01:39:28.180 --> 01:39:31.740
calling here, right? Which I'm calling inside the autonomous

01:39:31.740 --> 01:39:35.240
pipeline. This autonomous pipeline will automatically call a

01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:37.960
build graph, which is this one. So build graph will be

01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:41.480
executed. Build graph is automatically calling all of these

01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:43.820
things, right? Build graph is automatically calling all of

01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:44.660
these things, right? It is automatically calling all of

01:39:44.660 --> 01:39:47.800
these things one by one. Now once everything will be done,

01:39:47.980 --> 01:39:52.200
then export to SVG. So where we are trying to like use a

01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:55.560
graph wedge, right where we are trying to use the graph of

01:39:55.560 --> 01:40:00.340
this as simple as that simple. Okay. So these two functions

01:40:00.340 --> 01:40:04.340
are, we are trying to call rest is just my UI, like input

01:40:04.340 --> 01:40:07.680
the text or maybe like, uh, this Markdown page title,

01:40:07.780 --> 01:40:10.460
everything. So we are just calling the autonomous pipeline

01:40:10.460 --> 01:40:14.040
means I'm just trying to call the Lang graph workflow. My

01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:17.480
work will be done. Rest Lang graph workflow is calling in

01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:20.720
itself, as we have already mentioned, means my entry point

01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:24.480
is basically this as a, sorry, not garbage. My entry point

01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:27.420
is basically this one. That's it. The rest will be called

01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:30.900
automatically. It is calling, uh, like, uh, agents. As you

01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:34.340
can see, agents are calling tools automatically, uh, tools

01:40:34.340 --> 01:40:38.540
means again, a function agency is also a function. Okay. Now

01:40:38.540 --> 01:40:41.540
I have to test it. So let's try to see. So how I can test

01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:46.840
it. So here. Here I can write like a stream, let run app dot

01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:59.580
PI file. Okay. Stream S T R E M S T R S T R E A M S T R E A

01:40:59.580 --> 01:41:01.520
M L I T streamlet.

01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:07.980
Okay. So I'm like, uh, facing some issues. So it's saying

01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:11.060
that cannot import a name, Vicky API URL from a utils

01:41:11.060 --> 01:41:14.820
config, uh, not an issue. If something is missing, I'll make

01:41:14.820 --> 01:41:19.400
sure it is available. So Vicky, Vicky, Vicky, where is my

01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:23.940
tool? Vicky, Vicky API URL, and,

01:41:25.810 --> 01:41:32.550
uh, it is expecting from config, oh, remove it.

01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:40.930
I'm creating a local variable here. So just update your

01:41:40.930 --> 01:41:43.430
Wikipedia tool. I've just removed it. Nothing much.

01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:49.170
Yeah. So this is my Wikipedia tool. Not PI file guys.

01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:54.270
Updated one. As per the error. Current error. Now refresh

01:41:54.270 --> 01:41:58.330
once again. Okay. Now multi agent knowledge graph builder.

01:41:58.490 --> 01:42:02.430
This is my UI, which is available. I'm going to call just

01:42:02.430 --> 01:42:13.790
build, uh, give me a roadmap for agentic AI. Let's see. So

01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:17.050
generating our detail, knowledge, roadmap, uh, knowledge

01:42:17.050 --> 01:42:21.970
graph, for agentic AI, I'm trying to generate. Okay. Great.

01:42:21.970 --> 01:42:25.950
So grab, which this was expected, uh, grab is backend

01:42:25.950 --> 01:42:29.650
execute, uh, call processor command windows path. So there

01:42:29.650 --> 01:42:33.990
is some issue with the path, which I was expecting with a

01:42:33.990 --> 01:42:39.930
grab, which line number 26 export to SVG. Okay. Let me go

01:42:39.930 --> 01:42:44.230
and check and fix this issue. This was the expected one.

01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:52.340
Hmm. So export

01:42:54.260 --> 01:43:01.820
to SVG 26 number line. And the path D drive release. Okay.

01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:06.620
So here I have this one, which is available. That's fine.

01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:09.100
What is the actual error?

01:43:12.780 --> 01:43:16.380
Command window. Not this one. Okay. Line number 19. Done.

01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:21.580
Check all processor arcs. Done. Non-zero exit status. This

01:43:21.580 --> 01:43:23.000
one, a starter B. Okay.

01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:30.580
Oh, sanitize it. Export to SVG. Okay.

01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:34.970
Okay.

01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:49.700
So it's a little bit more difficult, but that was a little

01:43:49.700 --> 01:43:50.040
bit more difficult. It's going to show us the stuff that

01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:50.160
happened in the past. So it is now going to show you guys

01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:54.000
what kind of analysis system is trying to do. So everything.

01:43:54.260 --> 01:43:58.060
So see, uh, till here, uh, basically I'm not able to create,

01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:01.760
uh, just our final UI or means final images, which I will

01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:05.160
create it now itself. Right. right but see my digraph is

01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:08.140
generated I'm saving that digraph as well so I have just

01:44:08.140 --> 01:44:10.960
asked that what was my question my question was give me a

01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:14.620
roadmap for the agentic AI right now here it has started

01:44:14.620 --> 01:44:18.640
giving me a roadmap for the agentic AI so large language

01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:21.120
model so first of all python programming then neuron python

01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:23.640
course you have to go ahead with then machine learning then

01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:25.040
you know machine learning you have to go with then

01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:28.260
fundamentals NLP you have to go with and then fundamentals

01:44:28.260 --> 01:44:30.860
deep learning you have to go with and then basically a

01:44:30.860 --> 01:44:34.000
specialization so large language model you're on LLM mastery

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.820
courses you have to go with then a specialization

01:44:35.820 --> 01:44:39.800
reinforcement learning AI programming framework right so it

01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:43.780
has given me a detail detail roadmap plus it is able to even

01:44:43.780 --> 01:44:48.140
create a like a complete graph as you can see edge and nodes

01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:50.880
edge and nodes it is able to create now this data will be

01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:54.200
used to populate a kind of images which I'm talking about

01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:58.520
right so sometime I'm going to fix it and then you will be

01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:02.420
able to see that yeah so like we will be having like a

01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:06.560
images but as you can see this is my output result this is

01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:10.100
what I am able to build it from my elements and everything

01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:15.900
fine guys yeah so let me go ahead and fix the issue by the

01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:19.340
way and then you will be able to see the final result but

01:45:19.340 --> 01:45:23.560
all those results are able to populate from there itself and

01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:26.020
anyone who is able to run it guys and please check that

01:45:26.020 --> 01:45:28.660
change the directory don't use my directory because it's not

01:45:28.660 --> 01:45:30.380
going to work for you so

01:45:50.380 --> 01:45:51.760
anyone who is able to execute

01:45:59.190 --> 01:46:02.110
ok so it's done working for me ok that's great like I said

01:46:02.110 --> 01:46:06.350
so this this is basically a path issue and I always try to

01:46:06.350 --> 01:46:09.650
face this one with like a so

01:46:25.110 --> 01:46:31.850
Windows 10 make release graph let me check into my D drive I

01:46:31.850 --> 01:46:35.550
don't think that I have deleted this drive but yeah Windows

01:46:35.550 --> 01:46:42.150
graph viz and then bin so this path is available it seems

01:46:43.060 --> 01:46:48.530
graph viz gravis win path is available this

01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:57.540
uh application is an example of reg this is application is

01:46:57.540 --> 01:47:01.380
the example of multi-agent basically multi-agent with lang

01:47:01.380 --> 01:47:05.340
graph i mean you should not ask this question after two hour

01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:08.260
of discussion at least this this is not what i what i was

01:47:08.260 --> 01:47:13.100
expecting by the way uh maybe you have joined a little bit

01:47:13.100 --> 01:47:17.000
late i can understand in that case okay so os environment

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:22.920
then graph base digraph okay so basically import os os dot

01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:26.900
environment and then like uh let

01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:39.660
me change this digraph so

01:47:42.570 --> 01:47:44.890
those who are running it for the very first time so please

01:47:44.890 --> 01:47:49.170
go to google and try to download a graph which this is just

01:47:49.170 --> 01:47:52.290
a library to plot the graph but yeah it gives you issue so

01:47:52.290 --> 01:47:55.450
please try to download the graph which and for windows and

01:47:55.450 --> 01:47:58.270
mac and linux for everything it is simple available so you

01:47:58.270 --> 01:48:01.350
can you can try to download it right everything is available

01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:08.990
now let me recheck i have just made the update let

01:48:17.530 --> 01:48:19.950
me ping the roadmap for machine learning only

01:48:26.490 --> 01:48:31.530
name re is not defined multi-graph knowledge builder graph

01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:43.130
which line number seven in sanitize clean re so re

01:48:47.870 --> 01:48:50.630
is not defined okay regex

01:48:55.590 --> 01:48:56.990
as re no

01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:08.880
module name regex okay

01:49:18.700 --> 01:49:21.880
import re directly then roadmap

01:49:28.060 --> 01:49:29.420
for machine learning

01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:44.620
same kind of issue graph is backend execute multiple okay

01:49:48.610 --> 01:49:52.810
my graph which is available it was working day for yesterday

01:49:53.590 --> 01:49:57.770
uh but yeah again so when i restart the system so maybe i'll

01:49:57.770 --> 01:50:02.830
have to go and check something open command prompt done

01:51:03.380 --> 01:51:03.940
i did copy and paste it, so let me do that and repost it, so

01:51:03.940 --> 01:51:06.400
let me further conda install it on windows and it worked

01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:10.560
yeah it it actually works but uh sometime what happens is

01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:15.020
like uh it gives you as well let

01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:22.610
me

01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:39.680
conda install i'll do it okay

01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:13.780
let me check uh i have even like given a path uh directly

01:52:13.780 --> 01:52:16.680
but sometime streamlit

01:52:19.010 --> 01:52:21.210
run app.py only

01:52:32.060 --> 01:52:34.540
my graph generation part is given error that image part

01:52:34.540 --> 01:52:35.440
again

01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:40.200
same issue it's

01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:45.740
already available it is not able to recognize

01:52:55.330 --> 01:52:55.890
cls

01:54:21.430 --> 01:54:25.590
so just a minute guys just fixing a very very minor issue

01:54:25.590 --> 01:54:30.870
but that's a big issue we always face in terms of a windows

01:54:30.870 --> 01:54:35.310
machine uh i'm not doesn't mean that you guys will face the

01:54:35.310 --> 01:54:36.730
same issue so

01:54:39.060 --> 01:54:41.240
i'm assuming that most of you will not face the same issue

01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:44.440
it's my system depending on the system an issue where it is

01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:47.900
not able to organize the actual like a graph with

01:54:47.900 --> 01:54:49.440
installation let

01:55:40.930 --> 01:55:42.530
me graph

01:55:51.140 --> 01:55:54.900
viz which control

01:55:59.220 --> 01:56:06.920
c drive to grime program files and control v okay

01:56:09.450 --> 01:56:11.050
grab which is

01:56:16.300 --> 01:56:18.100
bin environment

01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:23.640
variable let me add it of

01:56:27.160 --> 01:56:38.060
which program files grab which graph g-r-a-p-h viz okay okay

01:56:38.060 --> 01:56:50.940
okay good now i can try to go here close it close it okay

01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:37.120
so control x everything

01:57:54.040 --> 01:57:57.420
looks

01:57:57.420 --> 01:58:01.280
fine but still okay

01:58:40.520 --> 01:58:47.380
it seems uh it got corrupted so let me check it once again

01:58:47.380 --> 01:58:48.400
so

01:59:13.710 --> 01:59:14.670
if you have not logged in grab viz so just download it guys

01:59:14.670 --> 01:59:17.210
uh my grab viz oh

01:59:21.140 --> 01:59:24.420
i think we have crossed the time so just a minute guys just

01:59:24.420 --> 01:59:30.640
a minute i'm going to activate your entire timeline so let

01:59:30.640 --> 01:59:34.920
me change this too yeah

01:59:46.190 --> 01:59:49.490
so now i believe you will be able to see the like this one

01:59:49.490 --> 01:59:52.290
uh chat box previously

01:59:54.430 --> 01:59:57.370
it was scheduled till 4 30 so now i have just changed the

01:59:57.370 --> 01:59:58.670
timeline okay

02:00:33.550 --> 02:00:37.190
So I have just activated a chat guys so you can join the

02:00:37.190 --> 02:00:37.450
chat.

02:00:45.050 --> 02:00:52.580
I have just like a done a fresh installation so I'm just

02:00:52.580 --> 02:00:58.560
doing it program files and then my graph wedge delete the

02:00:58.560 --> 02:01:00.260
old one same

02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:24.320
issue same issue it's just a environment like a issue but

02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:28.400
it's irritating us a lot. The

02:04:00.020 --> 02:04:07.840
problem is like graph is unable to install so let

02:04:15.230 --> 02:04:19.770
me do one thing guys let me download the exe and I'll just

02:04:19.770 --> 02:04:20.530
ram

02:04:34.420 --> 02:04:36.700
file graph wedge yeah

02:04:48.600 --> 02:04:52.840
I have used installer as well just one minor issue which is

02:04:52.840 --> 02:04:54.300
like let

02:04:59.230 --> 02:05:07.050
me close vs code and then vs code open once again file open

02:05:07.050 --> 02:05:13.730
folder. And d drive code multi

02:05:22.400 --> 02:05:24.980
agent graph streamlet

02:06:18.770 --> 02:06:20.670
run okay

02:06:35.140 --> 02:06:38.000
hoping that this time it will work okay

02:06:42.800 --> 02:06:45.520
same issue let

02:06:47.050 --> 02:06:52.590
me test whether it's able to organize my graph

02:06:55.280 --> 02:07:01.160
wedge or not so gmail or environment.

02:07:08.100 --> 02:07:10.320
Maybe not. Maybe I'll have to restart my system I don't know

02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:15.620
because it is not able to understand my graph wedge.

02:07:18.760 --> 02:07:28.200
So download c drive program file graph wedge. Okay so

02:07:28.200 --> 02:07:35.020
uninstall file is available. Maybe I can go to bin. Try to

02:07:35.020 --> 02:07:36.720
change it. Inside

02:07:41.590 --> 02:07:42.410
a path.

02:07:48.130 --> 02:07:49.810
okay okay okay

02:09:17.490 --> 02:09:19.430
yeah

02:10:44.170 --> 02:10:49.590
so finally as you can see guys it worked and uh like i said

02:10:49.590 --> 02:10:52.550
so there was no issue anyone is there in a class or everyone

02:10:52.550 --> 02:10:57.980
has left okay so i i can see couple of people here okay so

02:10:57.980 --> 02:10:59.220
maybe

02:11:01.370 --> 02:11:07.290
being in a group first it's working so this is a kind of a

02:11:07.290 --> 02:11:11.170
issue guys where we spent the whole night uh and not because

02:11:11.170 --> 02:11:15.730
we are logically incorrect because of the dependencies and

02:11:15.730 --> 02:11:19.330
this this we always face like this kind of issue okay

02:11:19.330 --> 02:11:25.870
amazing amazing to see that you guys are here um so for us

02:11:25.870 --> 02:11:30.130
it's kind of a regular stuff so we always try to spend a lot

02:11:30.130 --> 02:11:33.570
of time uh just to fix a minor issue where there is no

02:11:33.570 --> 02:11:36.090
logical error but just a dependency error so this was that

02:11:36.090 --> 02:11:39.370
kind of error uh because it was not able to fix in the graph

02:11:39.370 --> 02:11:43.130
of which there was a conflict even after installing even

02:11:43.130 --> 02:11:46.410
after manually setting up this particular path to find my

02:11:46.410 --> 02:11:50.350
graph which it was giving me an issue it was not able to

02:11:50.350 --> 02:11:53.430
execute but yeah now i'm able to execute it now let's go

02:11:53.430 --> 02:11:56.410
ahead and try to check into the output so here if you will

02:11:56.410 --> 02:12:00.230
come so you will be able to see this output.svg if you are

02:12:00.230 --> 02:12:05.170
going to open it up this entire output file so you will be

02:12:05.170 --> 02:12:12.790
able to find out let me show you so this copy path yeah so

02:12:12.790 --> 02:12:16.650
this is basically a graph that we are able to build as you

02:12:16.650 --> 02:12:21.390
can see right now what was the query that we have so my

02:12:21.390 --> 02:12:24.690
query was very simple so when i was like giving a query

02:12:24.690 --> 02:12:30.110
right when i was like a remove everything remove this one

02:12:30.110 --> 02:12:35.210
this was the old run this was also the old run this was also

02:12:35.210 --> 02:12:36.730
old run yeah

02:12:39.130 --> 02:12:42.170
this is also my previous run previous

02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:49.780
remove it previous

02:12:55.190 --> 02:12:56.990
one this

02:12:59.780 --> 02:13:03.580
is the latest run right so here i'm just trying to like open

02:13:03.580 --> 02:13:07.440
up this entire like a things and i'm just trying to show you

02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:11.400
that what what it is what it is able to basically produce

02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:15.700
right so i have given a very simple query i said that that

02:13:15.700 --> 02:13:16.220
roadmap following the previous run this was also the old run

02:13:16.220 --> 02:13:17.080
this was also the old run this was also machine learning so

02:13:17.080 --> 02:13:19.600
it is it is able to build a roadmap for the machine learning

02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:23.160
and as we know that that we are using a three agents right

02:13:23.160 --> 02:13:27.060
we are using basically a three agent and in a detailed way

02:13:27.060 --> 02:13:31.460
as it's a ai as it's a llm so my roadmap your roadmap is not

02:13:31.460 --> 02:13:35.280
going to be same but yeah structure is more or less you can

02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:39.760
see that it's a same right so now if i'm going to ask that

02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:48.000
give me a roadmap for like a becoming IAS IAS in India right

02:13:48.580 --> 02:13:51.480
so roadmap for becoming IAS in India or maybe roadmap for

02:13:51.480 --> 02:13:54.760
cracking IIT JEE it will be able to give me see now roadmap

02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:58.820
I have received for becoming IAS so maybe I can go over here

02:13:58.820 --> 02:14:03.660
I can check once again so it is telling me that fundamentals

02:14:03.660 --> 02:14:07.120
you have to prepare and under the UPSC exam pattern

02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:11.340
eligibility you just try to check Iran because forcefully I

02:14:11.340 --> 02:14:14.340
have said check Iran for everything develop a strong reading

02:14:14.340 --> 02:14:17.940
habit then master NCID textbook basic current affairs and

02:14:17.940 --> 02:14:20.860
general knowledge preparation strategy so create a study

02:14:20.860 --> 02:14:25.340
plan timetable and then like primarily preparation so focus

02:14:25.340 --> 02:14:29.540
on GS paper and CSAT then solve a previous year paper right

02:14:29.540 --> 02:14:34.040
focus on is essay GS paper and optional specialized practice

02:14:34.040 --> 02:14:36.760
then practice to and improve daily update and revision

02:14:36.760 --> 02:14:40.340
regular revision self-assessment personality development and

02:14:40.340 --> 02:14:43.040
mock interview for a interview preparation then final

02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:45.280
revision complete syllabus mock test time management

02:14:45.280 --> 02:14:49.480
practice under the exam condition right and then like health

02:14:49.480 --> 02:14:52.200
and well-being obviously it is also giving you that maintain

02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:57.000
the balance so yeah now I can I can create like a anything

02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:01.360
and even I can try to make this entire generation better

02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:05.080
right because I have a code and I have a complete control

02:15:05.080 --> 02:15:09.400
over to the code so whatever I have written inside my like

02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:13.160
researcher I know about it whatever I have written for

02:15:13.160 --> 02:15:16.000
example agent right so whatever I have written inside the

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:19.220
synthesizer I'm aware about it right I'll just try to like

02:15:19.220 --> 02:15:23.800
ask to do more I'll just try to like ask a researcher to

02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:26.420
bring more data from Google from Wikipedia from everywhere

02:15:26.420 --> 02:15:30.500
maybe I can try to add 10 more sources over here so in this

02:15:30.500 --> 02:15:33.860
way I can create an agent I can attach an agent with the

02:15:33.860 --> 02:15:37.420
help of a graph like a lang graph router over lang graph

02:15:37.420 --> 02:15:40.860
that I have used right and then I will be able to fulfill

02:15:40.860 --> 02:15:47.050
the complete task isn't this project? amazing guys yeah is

02:15:47.050 --> 02:15:50.470
this project amazing what is your feeling like we are not

02:15:50.470 --> 02:15:53.370
able to build very big project it's a small one I would say

02:15:53.370 --> 02:15:58.250
but yeah useful one right it's a useful one for all of us

02:15:58.250 --> 02:15:59.070
and

02:16:02.850 --> 02:16:05.530
necessarily we have spent around like a 45 minute of time

02:16:05.530 --> 02:16:14.260
just for one single graph installation but I hope yes okay

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:18.540
so fine I'm just going to like wrap it up this particular

02:16:18.540 --> 02:16:22.500
like a one and I'm just going to share with all of you guys

02:16:22.500 --> 02:16:27.960
so that even today tomorrow or in future you will be able to

02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:31.780
execute it code let me delete

02:16:34.020 --> 02:16:35.620
this one multi

02:16:41.410 --> 02:16:46.190
agent graph so likewise we have just started so many project

02:16:46.190 --> 02:16:50.310
we have to create so like generally people I have seen

02:16:50.310 --> 02:16:54.130
people that they think LLM or something is like sorry this

02:16:54.130 --> 02:16:57.730
lang chain or these things are big things it's a complex one

02:16:57.730 --> 02:17:01.070
believe me it's not at all complex it's very much logically

02:17:01.070 --> 02:17:05.230
connected and even without using these libraries you can do

02:17:05.230 --> 02:17:09.530
it right that is also possible and like I said so maybe five

02:17:09.530 --> 02:17:13.950
of you or ten of you can like join hands together at least

02:17:13.950 --> 02:17:17.070
some of the library by yourself that will be fun believe me

02:17:17.070 --> 02:17:20.830
that will be fun and if you are going to take a step and if

02:17:20.830 --> 02:17:24.070
you are trying to like do some sort of improvement maybe

02:17:24.070 --> 02:17:30.810
I'll support you right depends on the result sir it's mainly

02:17:30.810 --> 02:17:33.750
for creating a roadmap or we can also add a complete content

02:17:33.750 --> 02:17:36.290
according to the industry you can add the complete content

02:17:36.290 --> 02:17:39.770
and this is called real life programming exactly yeah this

02:17:39.770 --> 02:17:42.650
is something called as real so this is how in reality things

02:17:42.650 --> 02:17:49.510
works in reality it's actually even worse than that so yeah

02:17:51.480 --> 02:17:55.020
okay so basically you can ask any question like see it's

02:17:55.020 --> 02:17:58.320
just an agent right so one is for searching agent so maybe I

02:17:58.320 --> 02:18:04.540
can try to search for maybe like a tell me what I should

02:18:04.540 --> 02:18:04.900
search

02:18:08.660 --> 02:18:12.240
he he okay so I

02:18:13.520 --> 02:18:18.780
can ask just any question over here and then everything it

02:18:18.780 --> 02:18:21.060
will try to give me in terms of graph because this is how I

02:18:21.060 --> 02:18:23.240
have like a configured it right so

02:18:26.150 --> 02:18:29.550
any roadmap which I am looking for so I should not go out

02:18:29.550 --> 02:18:32.490
and then ask maybe I can just go ahead and ask AI I can do

02:18:32.490 --> 02:18:37.130
it I can build my own so fine guys roadmap to crack neat

02:18:37.130 --> 02:18:43.070
every it's almost same so roadmap to crack so someone is

02:18:43.070 --> 02:18:47.830
preparing at your house for neat or how to become PM okay so

02:18:47.830 --> 02:18:54.070
PM as a product manager project manager or as a PM of

02:18:54.070 --> 02:18:54.450
country

02:18:57.110 --> 02:19:00.690
resume for JNI so this is going to give you roadmap right so

02:19:00.690 --> 02:19:03.830
this is this agents I have configured for a specific task

02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:08.510
now it's giving you like a roadmap for this one it's it's

02:19:08.590 --> 02:19:09.990
giving you a roadmap for like a

02:19:14.220 --> 02:19:18.460
neat sorry this is for Prime

02:19:41.620 --> 02:19:44.820
Minister okay fine let me ask where

02:19:47.320 --> 02:19:51.040
is my VS code up and running things so here is my VS code

02:19:51.510 --> 02:19:52.740
here is my local host

02:20:05.760 --> 02:20:15.050
how to become Prime Minister of India let's see so it should

02:20:15.050 --> 02:20:19.470
it should create like a okay so let's just go and check it

02:20:19.470 --> 02:20:21.990
has given me some response yeah

02:20:26.110 --> 02:20:30.230
it's a Prime Minister of India response copy path

02:20:30.230 --> 02:20:31.510
fundamentals

02:20:37.240 --> 02:20:40.520
of Indian politics understanding Indian constitution and

02:20:40.520 --> 02:20:43.460
political system okay so every time it is giving you

02:20:43.460 --> 02:20:45.380
recommendation as well because in a prompt I have given

02:20:45.380 --> 02:20:49.040
right so for everything follow your own do whatever in your

02:20:49.040 --> 02:20:52.160
life doesn't matter at all follow your own fundamentals of

02:20:52.160 --> 02:20:54.840
Indian politics political history of India governance skill

02:20:54.840 --> 02:20:58.560
communication skill leadership development electoral process

02:20:58.560 --> 02:21:02.560
social work and community engagement legal knowledge media

02:21:02.560 --> 02:21:06.800
and public relations policy specialization advanced campaign

02:21:06.800 --> 02:21:09.880
strategy networking and mentorship practical example

02:21:09.880 --> 02:21:14.400
personal branding continuous learning election campaign

02:21:14.400 --> 02:21:17.240
preparation post election governance leadership in action

02:21:17.840 --> 02:21:22.920
maintain public support so you can maybe calculate the

02:21:22.920 --> 02:21:26.640
number of weeks which is required so on an average this much

02:21:26.640 --> 02:21:29.320
time it is going to take weeks and months also it has given

02:21:29.320 --> 02:21:32.680
to you right so weeks and months it has given to you so

02:21:32.680 --> 02:21:37.000
maybe like this much of time you can invest then you can

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:42.360
maybe think a little bit Rane toh sir hum engineer hi theek

02:21:42.360 --> 02:21:43.360
hai exactly

02:21:45.780 --> 02:21:50.540
okay so how did you solve the grab which issue with the with

02:21:50.540 --> 02:21:53.680
what command actually with not a command so there is a this

02:21:53.680 --> 02:21:56.780
grab which let me ping you this one

02:22:01.260 --> 02:22:04.560
yeah so basically there is a grab which official download

02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:08.700
packages so i have i was using this package actually and i

02:22:08.700 --> 02:22:10.800
was setting up the path but yeah what i have done i have

02:22:10.800 --> 02:22:14.040
just deleted all the packages removed not deleted i just

02:22:14.040 --> 02:22:16.720
shifted it to the other folder because it was asking me to

02:22:16.720 --> 02:22:19.580
restart my system so this is the exe installer i have just

02:22:19.580 --> 02:22:22.540
installed it over here in a windows and then go to your

02:22:23.500 --> 02:22:29.300
environment variable so envi orn environment system

02:22:29.300 --> 02:22:32.880
environment variable and set the path over here so

02:22:32.880 --> 02:22:36.540
environment variable and then there is a path so just try to

02:22:36.540 --> 02:22:39.000
set the path over here that's it this is what i have done

02:22:40.930 --> 02:22:42.830
inside this yeah

02:22:44.940 --> 02:22:47.780
so as you can see inside my graph i have added grab which

02:22:47.780 --> 02:22:50.740
inside my path program file grab which this is the default

02:22:50.740 --> 02:22:52.840
directory where it will store where it will like install

02:22:52.840 --> 02:22:58.580
that's it even the previous step which i have used wins

02:22:58.580 --> 02:23:01.380
directly passing a path it was working i have already tested

02:23:01.380 --> 02:23:04.900
it but yeah sometime when we restart the system so because

02:23:04.900 --> 02:23:10.160
of some like a folder structure changes it got disturbed can

02:23:12.690 --> 02:23:16.450
we deploy this app absolutely you can deploy this app please

02:23:16.450 --> 02:23:20.070
go to some of my mcp or maybe some other project which i

02:23:20.070 --> 02:23:22.990
have discussed or even in your class i'll be discussing this

02:23:22.990 --> 02:23:26.210
see guys a fundamental things which i follow in terms of

02:23:26.210 --> 02:23:30.410
deployment is i will simply convert this entire project as a

02:23:30.410 --> 02:23:34.330
docker in one single image now once project is available as

02:23:34.330 --> 02:23:38.730
a docker i can dump that project anywhere aws gcp azure

02:23:38.730 --> 02:23:41.770
maybe into a render or any other cloud platform because if i

02:23:41.770 --> 02:23:41.970
want to deploy a project as a docker then i have to deploy a

02:23:41.970 --> 02:23:43.150
project as a docker because now that deployment will become

02:23:43.150 --> 02:23:47.150
very very easy if i have to like a attach with the databases

02:23:47.150 --> 02:23:51.170
i can simple like a host a database somewhere or maybe some

02:23:51.170 --> 02:23:54.090
server less databases i will be using and then just call the

02:23:55.030 --> 02:23:58.170
connectors over there so i'll show you deployment as well

02:23:58.170 --> 02:24:00.770
deployment is not at all a big deal believe me it's a very

02:24:00.770 --> 02:24:03.870
very easy just you should know that how to build the entire

02:24:03.870 --> 02:24:07.350
pipeline once then it will be easy otherwise like it looks

02:24:07.350 --> 02:24:09.310
tough obviously prompt

02:24:14.690 --> 02:24:19.490
writing model yeah but eventually you will learn it

02:24:19.490 --> 02:24:21.430
eventually you will learn it when you will start solving the

02:24:21.430 --> 02:24:24.310
real problem unless you don't see the real problems you will

02:24:24.310 --> 02:24:27.830
not be able to learn it can we deploy this app i'll show you

02:24:27.830 --> 02:24:30.370
that so deployment and everything i'll show you in a class

02:24:30.370 --> 02:24:32.390
itself so don't worry you don't have to like worry about

02:24:32.390 --> 02:24:38.350
anything okay fine guys so i'm done for today so hope all of

02:24:38.350 --> 02:24:43.230
you have enjoyed even i have enjoyed this class so see you

02:24:43.230 --> 02:24:48.930
again guys in my next class and yeah so we'll do a lot of

02:24:48.930 --> 02:24:53.030
things in langchain langraph langsmith crew ai and other

02:24:54.150 --> 02:24:57.690
agent provider with the same fundamental that we have

02:24:57.690 --> 02:25:01.670
learned with that thank you so much everyone and see you

02:25:01.670 --> 02:25:04.590
again in my next lecture which is going to happen on

02:25:04.590 --> 02:25:07.770
saturday thank you thanks everyone thank you doctor thank

02:25:07.770 --> 02:25:09.990
you kumar everyone thank you thanks
