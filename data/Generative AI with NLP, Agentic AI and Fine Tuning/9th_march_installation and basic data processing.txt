WEBVTT

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.360
please don't try to focus much on match because you will end

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.880
up losing a lot match anyhow you can like a watch a score

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.980
maybe on your mobile device or anywhere on your screen as

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.700
well but yeah try to focus on a study that will be better

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.960
that that is going to give you a more benefit fine okay so

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.060
let's get started guys let me share my screen and then i'm

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.260
going to start so

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.470
guys it must be 100 days i don't

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.550
make it 100 days having to habituate four learn a day quatro

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.050
farar four times in one day a day seven days in one day

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.050
eight times in the one day seven days all right i'll explain

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.750
anything you can you can think what a real better

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.450
match is and so in the next lesson i will introduce you that

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:57.170
what is really good as if you are a finisher okay so let's

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.550
get started guys let me share my screen and then i'm going

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.090
to start so guys agenda for my today's class is going to be

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.610
a setup so i believe those who are already aware about basic

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.310
of python so they are already aware about a pretty much

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.850
setup and everything but still i'm going to show you a setup

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.890
part first maybe i'll try to invest 10 to 15 minute over

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.590
there and then i'll try to start with the curriculum so

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.490
which is starting from a text processing so if you'll go

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.430
through a curriculum so your curriculum is going to start

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.850
from a text processing so which is very much required to

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.450
build any kind of a model or to do any kind of operation

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.990
because nlp or generative ai is all about processing a text

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.770
data textual kind of a information maybe a one-liner

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.350
information maybe a complete book so this is what we are

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.270
going to see or we are going to start from today from a very

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.270
very basic so even if you are not aware about the text

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.270
processing so you are going to start with a text processing

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.470
so if you are about anything that's again completely fine

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.970
for me because i'm going to teach you each and everything

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.850
from a basic yep uh so what is the what is the score who is

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.670
winning by the way so i think uh match has started from 230

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.230
right it's already been two hour so who is who is winning

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.370
like

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.950
what is what is your prediction i

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.320
haven't checked even a score so i'm not aware about it okay

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:31.260
132 per four who like uh new zealand okay okay fine so maybe

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.540
we can get a okay it's india okay india is batting or new

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.120
zealand is batting okay

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.650
only india india okay win wise i think people are saying

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.930
india is going to win okay that's great that's amazing for

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.250
us okay

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.700
so let's get started guys uh so let me i have already shared

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.800
my screen so let me open up google first of all so guys uh

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.160
setup wise so we can try to do a setup in a multiple

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.200
platform so we can try to use some of these platforms and we

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.840
can try to use some of the online editor where we can write

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.440
a code initially but again like i told you so initially you

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.800
will be able to write a code by using a jupiter notebook but

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.440
very soon we are going to move into a modular coding because

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.420
we have to build end-to-end application or end-to-end

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.920
application whenever we have to build so obviously we need a

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.700
full scale setup a full scale id in my own system so that i

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.520
can build it i can test it and finally i will be able to

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.600
deploy it on some of the cloud so let me show you a setup

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.100
with respect to some of the online editor which is available

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.740
along with that so i'm going to show you a quick setup even

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.620
for a vs code and jupiter notebook in your local machine so

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.340
here the very first setup that you have to go through is a

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.860
google collab so basically there is a platform provided by a

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.160
google called as collab platform and this platform is an

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.500
amazing platform for anyone who is very much new for a

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.780
python right now if you are new to the platform not just for

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.420
machine learning those who are new with the python so they

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.720
may try to use this particular platform without any kind of

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.940
a setup you will be able to use this collab platform

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.260
directly and you will be able to write a code you will be

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.880
able to install a new dependencies or libraries and

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.380
eventually you will be able to build all the pocs or mbps so

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.040
here if you are going to search on google collab so you just

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.220
have to do a google login and then you will be able to see

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.200
this kind of a page now here you can go through the platform

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.280
and you will be able to see the code and then you can go to

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.480
a file and then you can try to click on a new notebook in a

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.280
drive or maybe open a notebook or maybe upload a notebook

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.520
from your local system and then you can try to open up so

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.740
here i'm going to click on new notebook in drive and it is

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.860
going to create a complete brand new notebook for me so

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.820
where i can start doing a coding or even if required so we

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.840
can try to install some of the libraries so as you can see

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.080
so it has opened up a notebook and extension name of any

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.180
notebook is going to be ipynb so ipython jupyter notebook

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.560
this is the full form of this one so here maybe we can try

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.580
to change a name so maybe i can write like a test over here

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.000
and this is a renaming of the notebook which i have done i

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.440
can close this release note part and here so i can try to

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.720
test this notebook maybe i can write one plus one and then

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.200
i'll try to execute execution wise i can do shift and enter

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.880
that's a one way other way is i can try to click icon and

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.420
even by this i will be able to run my cell for the very

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.480
first time then you will try to run this particular cell it

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.340
will show you connecting means it is trying to allocate a

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.740
resources as you can see that it has allocated a resources

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.740
to me so disk wise it is giving me like a 107 gb or disk out

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.820
of that 48 gb is already used so it's my local disk and ram

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.360
wise this is important ram wise so ram wise so it has

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.620
allocated me 12.67 gb approximately 14 gb of a ram to me out

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.680
of that it's been used so this much is used as simple as

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.760
that so all this compute resources are available inside your

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.460
google collab it's freely available to all of us i can write

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.320
any kind of a code over here without even investing a single

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.040
minute on an installation as simple as that and yes so there

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.920
are like many things that you will be able to find out in

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.420
terms of mounting a directory in terms of calling some sort

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.360
of function in terms of setting a environment over here

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.100
inside a jupyter node inside this jupyter notebook provided

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:46.180
by a google collab as simple as that right so i hope most of

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.960
us or almost all of us are aware about a google collab right

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.440
everyone yeah so video is blurred so please try to change

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.440
your network that will work because

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:11.240
from my side so it's we are streaming in a 4k so it all

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.360
depends upon your network connectivity guys and i don't

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.460
think that everyone is going to face the same issue good

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.660
afternoon i have missed anything no not at all you have not

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.340
missed anything deeper don't worry about it yeah so let's

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.400
get started so hope all of you are able to launch a google

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.160
collab and all of you are able to write at least one plus

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.140
one over here if you are able to write one plus one and if

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.280
you are able to get this answer it simply means that this

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.080
environment is up and running for you and you are not

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.460
supposed to worry about anything it's completely fine right

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:40.700
so things are completely fine so i will see you in the next

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.700
video bye bye working for you now so this is a temporary

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.360
setup i would say right it's a temporary setup if your local

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.040
machine setup is not ready then in that case it's a

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.960
temporary setup you can go ahead with this it's completely

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.360
fine or maybe if your system is having a very low resources

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.500
maybe like your system is having 8 gb of ram or maybe like a

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.920
4 gb of ram in that case you can try to go ahead with a

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:09.040
google collab now so second approach to set up a environment

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:14.020
is maybe again another online compiler online platform so i

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.200
can go inside a google i can try to search for jupiter

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.760
notebook and there are many provider you will be able to

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.340
find out over here so who is giving you a jupiter notebook

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:29.380
so out of that one of the famous one is a jupiter.org and

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:33.920
even you can go over here inside a jupiter.org and you will

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.740
be able to launch basically a jupiter notebook from a

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:43.420
jupiter.org that is also possible so this is a second

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:47.320
environment where you can go and you can try to execute your

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:52.000
code as simple as that so one is a collab one of the

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.900
powerful one one of the best one i would say in a market and

00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:00.480
then second one is a jupiter.org not the best one as

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.960
compared to a google collab but still you will be able to

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.080
execute our things over here so that's the first one and

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:04.080
then the second one is a jupiter.org not the best one as

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.300
compared to a google collab but still you will be able to

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.040
execute your code as simple as that so one here apart from

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.400
that so maybe you can try to use a databricks platform so

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.400
databricks provide you a community version so you can try to

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.100
use a databricks platform and even on a databricks platform

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.940
you can try to create an account this will take a couple of

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.500
minute of time for you so you can try to create a free

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:27.420
account on a databricks and then you can try to use it for

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.580
executing a python code for executing a r code for executing

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:36.800
a sql for executing even a pi spark code so it supports even

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:43.600
java right so even java you will be able to find out okay so

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.520
any question how do you find this document which document by

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:52.410
the way okay fine got it so inside a group someone is

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:56.410
pinging okay so the another platform is basically a

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:59.290
databricks platform now here inside a databricks platform

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:02.290
you will be able to see a workflow kind of a structure you

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.950
will be able to see a data upload kind of a structure so

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:08.810
again databricks platform is actually designed to process a

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:12.370
big data with the help of spark and it is going to provide

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:16.710
you even a connectivity uh with a lot of things from outside

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:20.450
the world plus even inside azure there is something called

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:23.930
as azure databricks you can try to use that so databricks is

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:27.470
a separate platform and then there is a service called as

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:32.350
azure databricks which is available inside of it azure and

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:34.870
even you can try to execute your python code over it there

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:40.010
even inside aws there is a service called as glue lambda so

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:43.170
over there you will be able to execute not just python but

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:47.470
you can execute any kind of a code with any languages or

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:50.650
with any kind of integration so platform wise there are

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:55.330
enough platform online platform available in a market where

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:59.450
without even doing a single installation just in a browser

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.690
itself you will be able to execute each and everything so

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:06.810
it's practically possible but but so we have to build a

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:11.110
complete full scale project we have to build our packages we

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:14.430
have to build a lot of modules over there we have to keep a

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:17.750
lot of like a dependent file over there a lot of environment

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.130
setup we have to do a lot of credentials we have to keep

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:23.130
going forward because we are going to talk about rag fine

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:25.690
tuning creating a lot of different different kind of an

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:29.750
agent by using a different kind of a platform so it's always

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.890
you I'm not saying that you will not be able to do all of

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:36.790
these things on these online platform yes it is possible but

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:41.430
it's better to have your own local setup so that you will be

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:44.430
able to practice and you will be able to build a full scale

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:48.450
project then you will be able to ship that entire project on

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.650
some cloud platform maybe with the help of some csvd

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.330
approach maybe directly and you will be able to

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:58.770
productionize it so let's talk about that now i'm going to

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:00.250
do that so the very first thing that you have to do is you

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:00.370
have to build a full scale project then you have to build a

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:00.370
review project inside a realtime that's also a key part and

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:03.330
the first thing which is required is a vs code vs code is

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.970
nothing but its ide integrated development environment so

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:09.630
like a vs code there are all other ids which is available so

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:13.310
like intelligent is available eclipse is available or even

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:17.370
Pycharm is available inside a market but my favorite one is

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:21.470
a vs code and again main, it's not just my favorite, it's a

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:25.090
favorite ID for almost all the developers. So who used to

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:28.910
write a code or who used to build a real time project. So we

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:33.950
are going to do a setup for a VS code COD. So just go to

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:37.510
Google, try to search for a VS code and you will be able to

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.290
see this particular option called as VS code.

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:40.150
Okay so I think there was a little bit of disturbance with

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:44.050
my internet for a couple of seconds but now it's fine, now

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:44.970
it's

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:51.230
fine. So I think I'm audible and visible to all of you guys.

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:54.510
So I don't know like what has happened but yeah for 30

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:58.450
seconds I believe there was some internet issue. So here I

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:01.010
was talking about a full scale platform, I was talking about

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:05.630
IDE so which we all are going to use as a developer to

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:08.610
develop a full scale project that is called as VS code.

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:12.570
Again it's very very easy to install. It's very very easy to

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:16.230
set up. And to do a configuration for any kind of a project

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.830
whether you are building a project with Scala, maybe Java,

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:23.730
maybe C-SARP, C++ or maybe with a Python. So VS code is

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:28.130
going to give you a support for each and everything. Now so

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:30.890
here if you are going to go to Google and if you are going

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:33.950
to search for a VS code you will be able to get a very first

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:36.090
link. Now let's suppose if I'm using a Windows machine,

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:38.910
let's suppose I'm using a Mac machine, I'm using a Linux

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:42.890
machine. So for each and every machine. So VS code is given.

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:45.910
It's giving you an installable file. So here I can just go

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:49.930
over here inside a VS code and then I can try to download

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:53.510
for a Windows. If you are using a Linux machine, you can

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:56.030
download for a Linux machine. If you are using a Mac

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:58.510
machine, so you can try to download for the Mac machine.

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:01.810
It's not at all difficult. It's a small file. You will be

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:05.670
able to download it with no time. So let me ping you this

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:08.150
link guys inside your chat box.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:17.420
Yeah. So this is the VS code link. I think all of you are

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:20.740
able to access this link and if I'll talk about a collab, so

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:25.000
this is a collab link for all of you and a Jupiter org. So

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.320
this is a Jupiter org link and if you have to do something

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.460
on a data building, so this is a data bricks link. But yeah,

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.380
let's talk about a VS code. So first of all guys, you have

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.260
to download a VS code and you have to just click, click,

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.620
click and then you will be able to install as you can see.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.860
So in no time. So it has started downloading. It's

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:49.560
approximately 100 Mbps. So it is going to differ for a Mac

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:53.680
or it is going to differ for a Linux machine, but yeah, just

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:57.560
a hundred MB of file. I'm able to download it. And once you

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.920
are able to download this file, so once you are able to

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:04.520
download this file, so just click and then you can start

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.940
installing it. Simple. I accept the agreement. Next, next,

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:12.200
next, next, next, your work will be done. You will end it

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.600
up. You will end up installing the complete VS code. Yeah.

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:20.500
Inside your system. Now VS code is just ID. It will not be

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.380
having a compiler. It will not be having like a, anything

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:28.080
which is going to support or which is going to execute a

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.280
code for you. For example, if I'm going to write a code in

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.800
Python, so obviously you have to install Python after

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.680
installing a VS code. If I have to work in Java. So

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:42.000
obviously I have to install Java after installing a VS code

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.800
and it goes in the same direction. You have to build

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:49.480
everything in whatever you have to build your project making

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:53.020
sense to all of us. Yes.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:02.720
Yep. Everyone. Yeah. So how many of you have already

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.400
installed a VS code guys? How many of you have done that?

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.160
I'm assuming that those who have gone through a basic of

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.320
Python or even our lecture or even my lecture or maybe

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.340
Bappy's lecture or maybe a Prince lecture. So you must be

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:18.880
having a VS code installed in your system. Yeah. Anyone guys

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.640
who is, who's not having a VS code with a Python setup.

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:28.200
Yeah. So maybe I can help you out with that already using VS

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.580
code. Yeah. But it's my responsibility to talk about this in

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.380
my class, in my very first class. So I'm just talking about

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:40.300
it. So I'm assuming that most of you are almost every one of

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:44.080
you must be having a VS code installed with a up and running

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:48.060
Python and a Jupiter notebook. If you are coming from any of

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.460
my batches, whether it's a big data or maybe a data science

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:54.200
batch, maybe a Python batch or maybe MLOps batches. Or even

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.060
a previous batch. Maybe a previous gen AI batches. So I

00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.840
believe that this is installed inside your system. So

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.200
working on VS code and PyCharm for a development. Yeah.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.060
Amazing. Amazing. Yeah. So you can use VS code. You can use

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:08.960
PyCharm. I don't have any kind of issue because both are

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:13.100
like IDEs, both are going to help you out to write any kind

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.140
of a code or to develop any kind of a big or a small

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:20.680
project. Okay. So, okay. Almost everyone has pinged. So let

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.800
me complete the step. Just, just for a person who is going

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.580
to join. This batch without any kind of installation. So VS

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:31.620
code installation is the first part. Now, once you are going

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.700
to install a VS code inside your local machine, then what

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:38.940
you have to do, so then you have to install a Python. So

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.920
from where you will be able to install a Python again, go to

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:45.680
Google and try to search for Python download, search for

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.720
Python download. So this is going to give you a very first

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.940
link with the official python.org. So download Python and

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:56.200
here you can come. And then you can try to download a Python

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.400
for windows, Linux, or Mac machine as simple as that, just

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.740
like a VS code. So you can try to download a latest version

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.360
of the Python. That's completely fine. So download Python

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.900
and in no time, again, you will be able to see that it's a

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.820
very small file, 27.3 MB of file for me, for my windows

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:15.240
machine may differ for a Linux machine may differ for a Mac

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.380
machine, but yeah, I'm able to download this particular file

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:22.380
in no time as simple as that. Yeah. So I will download it.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:25.520
So once you are going to download it, so you will just have

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.660
to click, click, click install, and it is going to give you

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:32.500
an option, add to the path environment file. So you just

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:35.660
have to select that option and automatically Python will be

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:39.440
installed and its path will be configured for all of you.

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.720
Now maybe you can try to open up a command prompt and then

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.160
inside a command prompt, you can try to check. So what is a

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.760
Python version that you have? So for example, for me, we are

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:51.760
S I O N Python version. So my Python version. So my Python

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:56.540
version is basically, uh, 3.12, right? So 3.12, this is a

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:59.860
Python version, which I have installed inside my system. The

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:03.160
latest one is basically 3.13, I believe, but yeah, that's

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.580
completely fine. There won't be much differences, which I

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.820
will be able to find out between Python 3.13 or 3.12. So I'm

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:13.140
using 3.12. If you have, if you are doing installation now,

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:18.060
so maybe you can install Python 3.13, even it is possible to

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.860
install a older version. So let's suppose if I would like to

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:23.920
install maybe 3.12. Maybe 3.6, maybe 3.7 for some of the

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:27.160
project, right? I will be able to do it because those

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.660
binaries will be available. So all of those previous

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:32.640
binaries, as you can see, will be available on a Python

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.800
website itself. So even you can install a older version. For

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.720
example, if you have joined some of the projects, so where,

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.600
uh, someone has started that project, maybe two years back,

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.920
maybe three years back. So obviously you have to set up your

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.940
environment accordingly, right? So as per the project

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:50.300
requirements, so yes, Python or not just Python, I would say

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:54.220
even Java, C++, everyone provides you a worsening and you

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.740
can try to configure the exact same version which has been

00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:03.100
used inside your ongoing project. Yep. Fine guys, everyone.

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:14.190
Yeah. Okay. Python version is not recognized as an internal

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:19.950
or external command Python. So Archit, your command is P Y T

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:23.190
H O N. So Python should be a small, then there should be a

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:26.430
space and then hyphen hyphen version. Okay. So your command

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:29.350
is wrong. That's the reason. So it is giving you this. It

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:33.430
should be Python, all a small space, hyphen hyphen version.

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:38.350
You will be able to get a correct one. Simple. So Archit,

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:43.410
your command is incorrect. Okay. Now moving ahead. So once

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:46.510
we are able to install a VS code and once we are able to

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:49.270
install a Python, so maybe I can try to search for a VS

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:55.370
code. It is going to launch a brand new VS code for me. And

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:58.890
here I can go into the file. So you will be able to get a

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:02.150
welcome screen guys. If you are logging or if you are trying

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:05.230
to open up your VS code for the very first time, you will be

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:07.810
able to get a welcome screen. Just cut that, close that

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:10.710
welcome screen, or it is going to give you a popup, a trust

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:13.490
or no trust kind of a two option it is going to give you. So

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:16.230
trust this software and then proceed ahead, close the

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:19.010
welcome screen. So you will be able to see a complete blank

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:22.030
screen over here. Just like me after closing those welcome

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:25.730
screen and those are test popup. So this is something that

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:29.030
you will be able to see now. So what we can do is, so maybe

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:32.150
we can go to file and we can try to create a one new folder

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:35.950
so that we can try to keep our files, whatever

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:38.590
experimentation, whatever code that we are going to write.

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:41.230
So we can try to keep each and everything inside that

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:45.050
particular folder in a structured manner. So here I'm going

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:48.330
to open up a folder in any directory, in any location,

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:51.450
that's completely fine. Right? So I'm going to create a

00:22:51.450 --> 00:23:05.750
folder. Gen AI. Gen AI and with Ascentec AI, RAG and NLP,

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:09.430
okay. So this is the folder I'm going to create and I'm

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:12.590
going to save this folder. So now my VS code is giving me

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:15.150
again this welcome screen. I will cut this welcome screen.

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:19.130
Now this is the folder where I'm going to create our files,

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:24.150
where I will be writing a code inside this directory. And at

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:26.650
the end of the class, at the end of the class, I'm going to

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:31.250
share a zip file of this directory inside your resource

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:35.350
section or even inside your chat box so that all of you will

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:38.850
be able to access those resources after unzipping it. So I'm

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:40.950
going to share a zip. You can download it, you can keep it

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:44.190
inside your system or wherever you want, and then you will

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:48.350
be able to execute it. But it's always advisable to write a

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:51.410
code along with me inside your live classes. Always

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:55.090
advisable. Right? So please make sure that you are writing a

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:58.870
code in a live class along with me. I'll give you enough

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:02.010
amount of time to write a code. I'll go slow in the

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:06.450
beginning and then I'll try to pick a speed. So here I'm

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:10.110
able to create a folder. So just click on file, open folder,

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:13.710
create a folder, simple, create a folder. And then once you

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:16.270
are able to create a folder, Python, I have already

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:19.110
installed. So what you have to do is, so maybe you can try

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:22.710
to click on this icon. This icon is actually for extension.

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:25.590
Or there is a shortcut, control shift and X. There is a

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:28.410
shortcut for it. So you can try to click on this extension,

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:33.350
extension. And here, so you have to search for a Jupyter, J

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:38.810
-U-P-Y-T-E-R, Jupyter, Jupyter. So you will be able to get a

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:43.030
Jupyter notebook option from Microsoft. Now what you can do

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:46.450
is you can try to just click on install. As of now, I'm able

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:49.110
to see an option called as uninstall because I have already

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.850
installed it. Right?

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:54.730
So you can see that as extension icon from this extension

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:58.450
icon, you will be able to download and install hundreds of

00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:01.630
thousands of not thousand, I would say in a lack. So a

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:04.570
hundred thousands of extension for a different, different

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:07.370
purposes, you all will be able to install inside the same

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:07.930
environment.

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:16.830
Fine everyone. So are you able to find out a Jupyter

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:21.610
extension? So just go to this icon, search for Jupyter, J-U

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:26.050
-P-Y-T-E-R, Jupyter. Yeah. So Jupyter. Now, so you will be

00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:28.490
able to see an install option. Click. Okay. And within a

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:31.690
minute of time, it will be able to install a Jupyter

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:36.090
notebook inside your Vs code, so this installation will be

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:39.450
done insideweis code. There is another approach. There is

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:42.250
something called anaconda installation. But again, I'll not

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:44.930
recommend anaconda installation because if your system is

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:48.970
having a low configuration, it will give you issue. So, uh,

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:53.850
it will, it will like a hang your system frequently. So I'll

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:58.210
never advice anyone to install anaconda or anaconda. I would

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:00.830
say and a Kona distribution because it's kind of a heavy

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:03.550
package and it's kind of a heavy installation for your

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:07.330
machine and with a very low RAM maybe 4gb or maybe with the

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:11.250
8gb of RAM it may give you an issue and frequently you will

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:13.530
have to restart your system and you will not feel

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:17.170
comfortable while coding otherwise everything is same

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:19.810
interface wise it's not going to be different it is going to

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:21.890
give you a Jupiter notebook and you can write a code so

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:25.430
interface wise execution wise everything is exactly same the

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:28.910
only thing is ease of use so ease of use wise you will not

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:31.530
be able to do that so sahid is saying how would python

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:33.950
extension so if you have done the installation and if your

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:36.450
python path is set then you don't have to do the python

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:39.210
install extension otherwise you can go ahead with the python

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:43.390
extension or else it's not required right if your python

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:46.350
installation is already done it will be able to invoke so

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:50.170
here okay so Jupiter notebook installation is done I'll go

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:53.590
to my directory I'll try to create a very first file over

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:56.830
here so I'm going to give a name. So, this is an option the

00:26:56.830 --> 00:27:00.070
very first option is for file creation the second option is

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:02.870
for a folder creation so folder inside a folder if I have to

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:06.030
create so I can use this one and file if I have to create I

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:08.650
can use this one so what kind of a file we can try to create

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:14.070
so today is 9th by the way so 9th Feb and I'm going to talk

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:18.990
about a data processing so data processing dot this is the

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:24.410
file name right then dot i p y n b now this is the extension

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:28.510
if you are. Not giving an extension in a proper way you will

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:31.290
not be able to create a jupiter notebook first part second

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:35.230
part is you will not be able to execute the code so file

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:38.890
name dot i p y n b file name could be anything whatever you

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:41.590
want you can just try to give it give it as a file name

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:45.790
there is no issue at all so file name dot i p y n b i python

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:49.210
jupiter notebook that's it so here I'm going to hit enter

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:53.530
and once I'm going to hit enter this are if I'm going to

00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:56.670
open up this file. So this is the interface i will be able

00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:59.930
to see now here there is an option for a code there is an

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:02.450
option for a markdown markdown is nothing but commenting

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:06.450
write ups and beautification all those things so here I can

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:09.570
try to click on code but before that this is the jupiter

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:13.870
notebook kind of a editor I would say right code editor so

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:16.930
there is something called as select a kernel so you can try

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:19.910
to click on select kernel and then you can try to select

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:23.010
your existing python environment. It is going to show you if

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:25.850
python is installed properly. So Python environment, I'm

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:28.210
going to select any of the Python environment. So in my

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:31.290
system I have not just only one environment, so I have a

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:34.070
multiple environment. Going forward I'm going to even teach

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:37.530
you during a project that how you can try to create a

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:40.230
different environment which is going to be a project

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:44.770
specific, not a generic one. Not a global one. But a project

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:47.070
specific environment because that is very much important

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:50.350
while doing a project. So that is also I'm going to teach

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:53.930
you. It's just three steps. So step number one, creation,

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:57.390
installation and then selection of that environment. So it's

00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:59.970
not that difficult but yeah, going forward in a class I'm

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:02.070
going to teach you. So when I'll go through a project site.

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:05.790
Now here Python environment is already done, already

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:09.490
selected. I can click on this plus icon code. So it is going

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:14.730
to give you a cell. Now this cell is equivalent to a cell

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:18.570
that we have seen inside a Google collab. So whatever you

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:21.790
can do here, same thing you will be able to do. Even inside

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:25.210
your VS code. As simple as that, you all will be able to

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:30.150
write the code and here I can write one plus one execute and

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:33.230
it is able to give me the result. So execution wise again,

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:35.990
shift enter or maybe what you can do is you can try to click

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:39.690
on this execution cell triangle. So even in this way it will

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:42.770
be able to execute itself. So whatever suits you. So

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:46.350
generally I use a shortcut, shift enter or control enter. So

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:48.810
with the help of shift enter or control enter, it will be

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:51.710
able to execute it. Making sense guys, everyone.

00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:01.290
So I have anaconda and VS code both in my system. Maybe this

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:05.770
is why system ends with a blue screen sometime. So VS code

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:09.410
is a very light weighted idea. I would say even it's lighter

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:13.950
than PyCharm. So even PyCharm may give you some sort of

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:17.290
issues when you are doing some sort of a heavy processing.

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:20.970
But in general, again, I'm not saying that VS code will not

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:23.190
give you an issue. Obviously it's a software. It's a piece

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:26.330
of software. And it's running inside your system. So there

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:31.130
is a chance that it may give you the issue. But yeah, like

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:34.550
number of times wise or percentage wise, it will be less as

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:36.790
compared to any other ID. It's a very light weighted one.

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:43.750
Simple. Okay. Fine guys. So can you please ping me guys in a

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:47.270
chat if all of you are able to do a setup or if you are

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:50.930
facing an issue so that I can move ahead. I don't see an

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:53.230
option for a Python to select when I select the kernel.

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:58.010
Sanjeev is saying. Oh, okay. RCS is saying I'm getting an

00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:01.010
error. So if you can specify me the error that will be

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:05.310
better, that will help me out a lot. Running cell with

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:11.590
Python 3.13 requires the IP YNB kernel package set up

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:15.890
completed. There are a couple of people like RCS Sanjeev I

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:21.030
can see only RCS Sanjeev who is facing an issue. Rest of us

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:26.450
are able to do it. Siam is saying it's easy and doable.

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:29.410
Okay. Only two people is facing an issue. I can see in a

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:30.710
chat install

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:36.740
Python, but getting an option, getting an option or not

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:38.900
getting an option. Person with the number eight, nine,

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.360
three, eight.

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:49.840
Why all the tech names are animal? No, not all the tech

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:53.060
names are animal Java. Java is Java has been named after

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:58.760
coffee. So I don't know. Like we all love Java. We love

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:02.300
animals. So maybe because of that, they have given a name,

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:06.880
but yeah, it's, it's not like a generic one. So set

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:14.070
up done. Safa is saying running cell required the IP YNB

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:17.910
kernel package. Okay. So Python environment, IP YNB kernel,

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:22.630
force, okay, fine, fine, no issue. But why does my kernel

00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:26.870
says Python while yours says conda. So because I have a

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:32.550
conda and Python both in my system. So that's the reason. So

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:35.850
mine says Python conda both. And I have likewise, I have

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:38.370
hundreds of other environment as well because when I teach

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:40.710
inside my class, right? So with a different, different

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:42.910
classes, different, different environment, I used to create

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:45.690
a different, different project I used to run. So in my

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:51.650
system, it's like a lot of environment I have created. We

00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:53.830
will start NLP today. That's the reason we are doing a set

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:58.030
of Deepak. So almost done. So from my side, set up is done.

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:04.560
Yeah. So those who are facing issue with the IP YNB kernel,

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:07.520
just do pip install IP YNB kernel. Now where you can do pip

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:11.140
install IP YNB kernel, simple over here. So just do control

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:15.120
and tilt. So once you are going to press control tilt,

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:18.400
right, control tilt, if once you are going to a plus, even

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.320
you can open up a terminal from here, new terminal, you can

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:24.320
try to open up. So you can go to this click and then

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:27.240
terminal, you can try to open up a new terminal. Shortcut

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:31.660
for this one is control and tilt. Right. To open, to close

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:34.520
this kernel. And from here you will be able to select a git

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:40.100
bash command prompt or WSL for Linux kind of a execution

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:43.720
inside a windows machine or power cell. So all of these

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:47.460
options are already given to you inside a VS code itself,

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:51.120
right? So here, if you are facing any issue with the IP YNB

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:56.400
kernel, simple pip install IP YNB kernel. Controls plus tilt

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.480
or

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:03.060
there is another shortcut control plus J. Both. Both is

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:07.200
going to work. Control tilt, control J. Or if you are not

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:10.380
able to remember the shortcut, then it's fine. Go to this

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:13.820
three dot and then terminal, new terminal. Either way it's

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:16.540
completely fine. It is going to do the same thing. But yeah,

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:19.980
so very soon you all will get used to the shortcuts.

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.760
Let's list the topic which will be covered today. I have

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:32.100
already listed it down Siam in a like a syllabus. So I think

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:34.040
it's going to be the unnecessary discussion. Try to focus

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.540
inside the class. Yeah.

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:45.440
So let's get started. Okay. So fine guys, let's get started.

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:49.440
So here what

00:34:53.920 --> 00:35:00.120
we can do is so we can start doing a coding now. So what we

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.560
are going to discuss in my today's class guys. So in my

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:06.080
today's class, I'll be talking about a text processing. So

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:09.100
if you will go through your syllabus, right, the syllabus

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:12.760
that we have published. So inside this syllabus. In a very

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:16.380
first section induction, we have done a study itself now

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:20.860
here. So inside a syllabus, just try to focus on this part.

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:24.860
The very first one, text processing and word embedding this

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:27.900
one. So basic terminology and text processing impotence,

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:30.700
text cleaning, text tokenization, removing a stop word,

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:33.860
limitation and staming, normalizing the text sentiment,

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:37.520
parts of a speech and NER name it organization. So we will

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:41.520
try to cover these topics in my today's class, by the way.

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.320
That's the reason. So we have published a syllabus so that

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:46.240
in my live classes, so one by one, one by one. So we can try

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:50.600
to go through the topics. And again, it's a live class. It's

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:53.340
not a YouTube video for 10 minutes or 15 minutes. So

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:55.580
obviously in my two hour of classes, I will ended up

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:59.600
covering not just one topic, but a multiple topic from your

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.780
syllabus. I believe we all understand this particular part

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:08.760
now. So here first one. So text processing wise. We are

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:12.480
going to use a library called as NER. Natural Language

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:16.100
Toolkit. Short form of that library is called as NLTK. Now

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:19.660
so NLTK is not the only library in a market. In a market. So

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:22.820
there is an alternative of a library called as Spacey called

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:25.940
as a Stanford NLP. So likewise, there are so many different,

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:28.920
different kinds of libraries which is available, which will

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:32.060
help you out to do a text processing. Now the question is

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:35.620
that, that why we are even talking about a text processing

00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:38.160
and what we are going to do with it and how we are going to

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.880
use it going forward. So at the end of the day. We have to

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:44.520
learn, maybe let's suppose fine tuning. We have to build a

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.700
model like a chat GPT kind of a model or maybe board kind of

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:50.960
a model we have to train, or maybe we have to learn RNN,

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:54.620
LSTM, transformer, encoder, decoder, all sort of

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:57.420
architecture. And eventually we have to build a product or

00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:03.340
we have to build a project right now. So in every project or

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:06.440
whatever model that you are going to train at the end of the

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:10.960
day, your input is going to be text. Now. It's not like. You

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.660
can get text from some of the books or maybe from a

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:15.840
Wikipedia, some of the open source data set, and then you

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:18.740
will be able to pass those data model will be able to

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:22.080
understand. No, not at all. It's not a chat GPT, right? So

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:25.060
if you have to build such kind of a system, so obviously you

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:28.900
have to process a complete text. You have to break it down

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:32.660
into a small, small tokens, or you can say into a character,

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:36.880
into a words, you have to remove the stop words or maybe a

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:39.080
punctuation or maybe a repetitive word.

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:53.080
So you have to do a lot of pre-processing on a data and then

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:56.720
we have to convert those data into its numerical

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:59.280
representation, which is called as embedding. That's a

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.180
reason. So after test processing the next chapter, if you

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:05.640
will be able to see, so we have given you a embedding. So

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:09.560
whether it's a one hot encoding or bag of word or TF IDF or

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:12.060
word to vector, or whether, all of these things are going to

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:16.180
give you a capability to convert your textual information

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:20.780
into a numerical information. So in a different, different

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:24.300
way, obviously. So once we'll try to discuss that topic, so

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.540
I'll try to explain you theoretically, practically, as well

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:30.300
as mathematically, wherever it is required. So these text

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:35.420
processing is very much required to move ahead with any kind

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:39.980
of a system or model that we wanted to build, or we are

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:44.140
going to build. And that's the reason. So as a NLP guy or as

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:49.940
a generative AI guys, your entire day or your entire innings

00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:53.640
is going to start from a processing of a data. And

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:56.180
eventually it's a text processing that you will end up doing

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:58.860
today. What we are going to do is, so we are going to do a

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:01.840
text processing and with the help of a library called as

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:05.040
NLTK, natural language toolkit, that's a full form of the

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:08.420
library. Now it's one of the advanced, one of the vast, one

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:11.500
of the powerful library that is given to you. And, uh,

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:14.940
seamlessly, you all will be able to write a code. It's not

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:19.560
at all difficult, obviously, uh, it will get complex, more

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:24.740
complex. So once we will get into, uh, like, uh, solving a

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:28.000
real time problem and that we'll see once time will come,

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:31.360
but yeah. So in today's class, I don't think that you all

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.960
are going to feel any kind of a complexity. You all will be

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.440
able to understand everything and you all will be able to

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:41.860
execute it. So here you have to import first of all. NLTK,

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:45.700
NLTK, you have to import now here when I'm trying to do

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:49.300
import NLTK, right? It is giving me, there is no module

00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:53.000
called as NLTK as simple as that, right? So because I have

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.260
just installed maybe a VS code and, uh, inside that I have

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:59.520
installed a Jupiter notebook, but a Python is also

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:03.980
installed. But yeah, inside Python, uh, there are not just

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:06.880
one or two package base Python is different base Python is

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.980
fine. That is already installed. So my system can understand

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:13.280
a Python code. But there are hundreds of thousands of

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:16.900
libraries, which is available in a market and all this

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.640
installation will not be done at the time of installation of

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:23.840
Python. So we have to install it extensive or we have to

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:26.300
install it when we are going to use it or when we are going

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.260
to build something. So here, as you can see that, that it is

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:33.840
giving me something like a no model called NLTK. Now for

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:37.660
Python package, right for Python packages, if you will go to

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:41.840
Google, you will be able to see that there is a big

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:46.880
repository, which is called as PIP, P I P, PIP, PIP, Python,

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:52.260
if I'm going to search. So it is going to give you a pypy

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:57.280
.org link, pypy.org link. And here you will be able, it's a

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.940
repository. It's a repository where you will be able to find

00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:03.180
out every kind of packages. So whatever Python package, and

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:07.040
even you can try to release your own Python packages. That

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:11.140
is also possible. That is also possible. So like from my

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:12.840
previous organization, so we have already released a lot of

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.760
packages. So if you are going to search by the organization

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:16.760
name, you will be able to see that there are a lot of

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:19.640
packages, which has been released even from our side. So

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:23.480
here, this is basically a repository. So let's suppose if

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:26.080
I'm going to create some package to solve some problem,

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:29.000
maybe I can try to publish it. A Pythonic package by the

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.900
way, right? A Pythonic package. So maybe I can try to

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:35.540
release those packages and anyone and everyone will be able

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:39.360
to use it just by doing a pip install. A package name. So

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:43.900
here it is showing me no module name NLTK. So how I will be

00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:47.760
able to resolve this issue? So simple. I can try to do the

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:51.440
installation. So pip install pip is nothing but a repository

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:55.380
name. This one, this one is actually pip, right? From Pypy

00:41:55.380 --> 00:42:00.380
and install and then library name I can try to give, and I

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:03.740
will be able to install it. Let's suppose it is giving me an

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:07.260
error called as NLTK. Okay, fine. So maybe I can try to go

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:10.000
and search. So I will come over here, NLTK. So it is going

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.680
to give me that yes, there is a NLTK 920 projects are

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:19.480
available with NLTK. So maybe I can try to use the official

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:21.720
one. So again, there are so many packages which is

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.480
available, so you don't have to use all the packages,

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:27.600
official ones. So pip install NLTK and I'll come over here

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:31.560
and I'll try to install inside my Jupyter notebook itself.

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:37.660
So pip install NLTK. Now in this way, this library NLTK will

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:40.660
be installed. It will be available to me. So requirement

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:43.760
already satisfied, installing collected regex, this, this,

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:47.880
this, maybe you need to restart. So let me re-import this

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:53.200
one. And this time again, when I've executed this, all the

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:56.500
errors are gone. There is no error. Now it is not telling me

00:42:56.500 --> 00:43:00.220
that no model called as NLTK. Now so going forward, we are

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:02.500
not going to install just one or two libraries. We are going

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:05.840
to install a hundreds of libraries in each and every class,

00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:08.760
every class, right? Every class. So we'll try to discuss

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:11.820
some topics and we'll try, we'll have to install a new

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:14.780
library because all these libraries are not installed in my

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:18.220
Python or anywhere. Doesn't matter whether you are going to

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:20.700
use your local or you're going to use maybe a Google collab

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:24.740
everywhere. You have to install these libraries as in when

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:29.360
you are going to need it. So here pip install NLTK and your

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:32.120
work will be done. So I'm pinging you this code inside your

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:36.700
chat guys. So this is going to install everything inside

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:38.420
your base environment. Simple.

00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:44.550
Yeah. So you can do pip install. You can do even exclamation

00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:47.310
marks this one, and then pip install, it is going to work.

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:50.890
So there are multiple ways. A simple way is right pip

00:43:50.890 --> 00:43:54.590
install without writing anything before and after and done.

00:43:57.710 --> 00:44:02.890
So people are saying no module name pip. So please check

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:06.390
your Python and then you can try to install pip first.

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:13.920
Fine. Everyone. Yeah. So again, those who would like to

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.720
change the kernel. So there is an option. So this is my

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:18.060
selected one. This is my selected kernel. So I can try to go

00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:20.680
and select other kernels as well. That option is also given

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:25.870
to you. Let's suppose I have multiple kernels and if pip is

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:28.510
not working directly, so maybe you can try to use this with

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:35.380
the exclamation. So this one, either of this will work. This

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:36.140
should work.

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:45.600
Fine guys, for all of us. Yep. Everyone.

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:52.520
So let me know guys, once you are able to do a setup.

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:07.040
Yeah. And with Euron. So obviously I'm giving you an answer.

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:09.720
Yeah. For your questions, but yeah. So even there is a

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:13.320
system that we have integrated called as Euron. So for your

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:16.540
query, even Euron will keep on giving you the answer in a

00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:19.340
real time. So without even waiting for my answer, you can

00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:22.040
try to accept an answer and it is even going to give you a

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:25.460
code suggestion, code correction, lot of things, right? Lot

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:27.780
of things so that you don't have to wait for me to answer

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:30.360
your questions. Obviously I'm going to answer the question.

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:33.440
I'm not saying that in a live class, I'm not going to answer

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:36.900
the question, but yeah, there is a option. You will be able

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:41.140
to get even from a Euron. You can try to write your complete

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:44.240
like a error that you are facing and paste it inside the

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:47.940
chat. Euron system is going to give you the answer or you

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:50.100
can try to use even Euron assist because with Euron assist,

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:53.480
we have integrated the latest one, even a deep seek the

00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:55.460
advanced one, deep seek R1 we have integrated.

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:01.840
Okay. So obviously we all are learning tech, so we are

00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:07.280
supposed to use tech. Yep. Okay. Now it's done. So NLTK is

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:11.500
installed. I will be able to use NLTK. Now why we are going

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:15.180
to use NLTK. So here again, I'll go to Google, I'll try to

00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:21.840
search for NLTK, NLTK and there is something called as nltk

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:25.780
.org. Now this is the official website, official website of

00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:29.240
a NLTK, natural language toolkit. Now once you are going to

00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:32.180
come over here, right? Once you are going to come over here,

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:36.240
so they have already given you a lot of examples, right? A

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:39.760
lot of examples, a lot of use cases, but in bits and pieces

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:42.280
as simple as that in a bits and pieces, they have given you

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:45.080
examples and even you can try to search something with the

00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:48.840
Google with NLTK examples and it is, it is going to give you

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:51.840
like a things. So if you will go through our API references,

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:55.600
so there are like a, not just like a hundreds of function I

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:58.160
would say, but 10 thousands of functions are available

00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:02.020
inside NLTK. It's like I said, it's a very, very powerful

00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:06.080
one and you will be able to do almost every kind of a text

00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:10.560
processing with the help of NLTK. Alternative of NLTK is a

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:13.920
Spacey or a Stanford NLP. Likewise, there are a couple of

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:16.680
more alternative, which is available inside the market. But

00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:19.800
again, I will, I will prefer to use NLTK over everything

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:24.100
else because it's updated once a powerful one. It's an open

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:27.440
sourced one. So people are contributing on a regular basis

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:30.760
and this library is getting more and more powerful since

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:34.820
last like eight to 10 years, I would say, right? Eight to 10

00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:37.600
years. So it's a powerful one and a lot of like

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.520
functionalities are available. Obviously I'm not going to

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:43.620
talk about all the functions, right? As you can see, there

00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:46.260
are 10 thousands of functions which is available inside a

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:50.540
NLTK. So now one by one, let's start looking into some of

00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:55.260
the data processing and let's try to learn this NLTK as we

00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:59.200
have already imported and we have already installed and we

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:03.620
have already done the import now here. So NLTK provide you

00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:07.160
some of the inbuilt data. Set, right? Some of the inbuilt

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:09.920
data set inside a library itself, some of the inbuilt

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:14.540
textual based data set and how to download all of those data

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:17.020
set, which is available because as of now we have just

00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:19.860
installed NLTK and we are just trying to import the NLTK

00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:24.580
APIs means functions. That's it. So here I can write NLTK,

00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:31.440
NLTK dot dot download, right? And I can mention over here

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:36.160
all. So once I'm going to call that download all. It is

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:40.840
going to download the data set from NLTK as you can see. So

00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:44.360
it is trying to download a different, different corpus. So

00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:47.420
there is something called as ABC corpus, average perception

00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:53.000
trigger corpus, and there is a bio creative PPI corpus, book

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.240
grammars corpus. So there are so much of data, so much of

00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:02.200
data it is trying to download. So just execute this code

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:04.360
guys, everyone quickly. Okay.

00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:22.240
Fine. So there are so much of data, which is available by

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:26.300
default inside NLTK. I can try to name one of the data and I

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:28.800
can download it, but here I have written that download all

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:32.140
the data. So it will be able to download all the data set

00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:38.260
for all of you. Okay. Now so once you will be able to

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:43.680
download a data, so maybe I can try to use some of the data

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:46.160
set I can, I can maybe try to check that. Okay, fine. So

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:49.240
what is there inside this particular data set? But yeah. So

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:51.080
all is going to download all the data set, which is not

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:54.000
required, pretty much it's not required. So maybe what I can

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.340
do is I can try to close this process, dominate this

00:49:57.340 --> 00:50:02.080
process, and then I can try to show you a download with only

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:05.520
one data set. So writing in NLTK download all, there is

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:08.220
something called as book data. There is something called as

00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:11.180
book data. So I'll simply write, write, download only book

00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:15.000
for me. If I'm writing all, means all the data I'm writing

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.020
over here that just try to download the books. So there is a

00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:23.080
collection of the books, which is available inside the NLTK

00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:26.360
data, and I will be able to download it.

00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:34.740
Done guys, everyone downloaded. So it's downloading for me

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:35.120
as of now.

00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:48.940
Okay. So downloading done. And you can see that it has

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:52.880
downloaded a lot of data for me. Maybe I would like to check

00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:57.300
that what in all data is available inside this like a

00:50:57.300 --> 00:51:02.820
particular book data that I'm able to download. Okay. So

00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:08.360
maybe what I can do is, so I can try to say that from NLTK

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:15.460
dot book, right book import all, import all means static. So

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:17.820
this is something means that whatever books it is able to

00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:22.380
download from NLTK. So I'm just trying to import all of this

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:26.480
books over here, right? All of these books over here, I'm

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:29.700
trying to download means there is a data inside it, right?

00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:32.140
So I'm just trying to import all of these books over here.

00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:35.640
And as you can see that introductory example of NLTK books,

00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:38.300
loading text one, this, this, this, and sentence and as

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:42.540
nine, type the name of the text or sentence to view it. So

00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:46.680
here type text or sentence to list the material. So text

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:49.520
one, this one is a book. So all this book's name it has

00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:54.460
given to me. And maybe I will be able to just type text or

00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:57.800
maybe just type a sentence and I will be able to see a

00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:58.440
couple of data.

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:05.360
So text one,

00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:10.050
text two, text three, all those things which is coming from

00:52:10.050 --> 00:52:15.270
the available book text, I will be able to get it. Maybe I

00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:19.910
can try to like a print some of the data. Maybe I can try to

00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:25.550
print a text one only. So I will be able to print a text one

00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:27.770
only text two. If I have to print, I will be able to print

00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:30.570
text two means I'm saying that, that I will be able to

00:52:30.570 --> 00:52:33.830
access the data as simple as that. So I'm able to access the

00:52:33.830 --> 00:52:37.470
data out of this one. So there are a lot of data which is

00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:41.590
available. Sometime I will be using a data set from a NLTK.

00:52:42.210 --> 00:52:45.290
Sometime what I will do is, so I have my own data set or

00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:48.210
maybe I'll try to acquire a data set from a Wikipedia or

00:52:48.210 --> 00:52:53.390
from maybe a hugging phase or maybe from a Kaggle and I will

00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:56.690
be using a data set. So now coming to the next part guys,

00:52:56.810 --> 00:53:00.370
data wise, right? Coming to the next part. So we are trying

00:53:00.370 --> 00:53:03.990
to, we will try to build the model. We will try to learn a

00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:08.370
library, but to do each and everything I need a data. Now

00:53:08.370 --> 00:53:13.550
what is the best data source for me? So as per me, the best

00:53:13.550 --> 00:53:16.310
data source, you can go to Google and try to search for

00:53:16.310 --> 00:53:21.090
hugging phase. So hugging phase is one of the best place

00:53:21.090 --> 00:53:24.530
where you will be able to get a data set. Every kind of data

00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:26.930
set. I'm not just saying NLP kind of a data set, but every

00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:29.750
kind of a data set. So just go to a hugging phase. I'm

00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:33.810
pinging you a link for hugging phase over here and then

00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:37.450
there is a tab called as data set tab. As you can see my

00:53:37.450 --> 00:53:40.710
mouse cursor, right? So data set tab, you can go over here

00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:45.690
and then you can try to filter out a data. So hugging phase

00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:49.570
is providing you a 3D data, audio data, geospatial data,

00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:54.730
image data, tabular data, text data, right, text data, time

00:53:54.730 --> 00:53:58.070
series data, video data. So there are a lot of data set,

00:53:58.130 --> 00:54:01.050
which is already available. Inside a hugging phase, you can

00:54:01.050 --> 00:54:05.050
try to use it. Majority of the time we will be using a text

00:54:05.050 --> 00:54:09.210
data. So you can try to apply a filter and then there are 2

00:54:09.210 --> 00:54:15.690
,17,267 till date. And again, they keep on adding the new,

00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:19.510
new data set. So this is the kind of a data set, which is

00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:25.190
available inside hugging phase itself, 2,17,000 and some of

00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:27.550
this data set is a kind of a data set, which has been used.

00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:29.290
So this is the kind of a data set, which is available inside

00:54:29.290 --> 00:54:29.590
hugging phase itself, 2,17,000. So you can try to train it,

00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:34.270
or to build a real time model. Even you can try to format it

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:37.690
over here. Right? So in which format you are looking for

00:54:37.690 --> 00:54:40.990
data in a textural format, into a parky format, into a CSV

00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:43.890
format, into a JSON format, into a baby data set format,

00:54:44.070 --> 00:54:47.410
everything you will be able to filter out. Plus, if you are

00:54:47.410 --> 00:54:50.390
looking for a big data, right means huge amount of data,

00:54:50.610 --> 00:54:53.970
maybe a 1 billion record or 1 trillion record kind of a

00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:57.970
data, you have that filter. So even if I'm looking for a 1

00:54:57.970 --> 00:55:01.950
billion record. record, just imagine how big that record is

00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:05.170
going to be right, so even if I am looking for a 1 billion

00:55:05.170 --> 00:55:12.980
record okay size, so I will be able to get it, so here I

00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:19.920
can click on any of this data and here is a data set, some

00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:22.200
of the data set is going to be the structured one, some of

00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:24.880
the data set is going to be the unstructured one, I can try

00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:28.360
to download and I can try to make use of this data set, so

00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:33.160
download wise see the size 4.2 GB right, so 4.2 GB number of

00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:39.460
records, so here there are 11 lakh means 1 million 14000, 1

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:42.400
million right yeah it's a 1 million, 1 million kind of a

00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:45.880
records that we have, so I can try to download this data

00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:48.720
set, I can try to make use of it, that's completely fine

00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:52.540
right, that's completely fine, so data set wise there are

00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:55.980
abundance of data set available into a market, the kind of a

00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:58.740
data set, the industry wise right, let's suppose if I am

00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:01.420
looking for a industry wise data set. Data set, just name

00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:05.120
any industry, any means literally any industry on this

00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:08.760
planet, you will be able to acquire a data set, it's

00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:12.720
available, even in free mode, if I have to go into paid

00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:16.540
mode, there is a platform like a rapid API, so where you

00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:20.060
will pay, they give you like some free limit, free tokens,

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:24.620
but yeah, so even you can try to like make a payment and

00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:28.440
then you will be able to acquire authentic data, real time

00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:31.400
data, all those things is available in this entire world,

00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:35.380
because if you are talking about generative AI or not just

00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:38.460
generative AI I would say, any domain of AI, whether it's a

00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:41.280
machine learning or deep learning or computer vision or NLP

00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:44.860
or generative, without data what you will do, right, let's

00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:46.560
suppose if you are able to learn the model, but how you will

00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:49.100
build it, unless and until you are not having a huge volume

00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:53.060
of the data, billions and trillions of the record, so this

00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:56.560
is one of the best place I would say to get a data, so as

00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:58.860
and when and every kind of a data with every domain and that

00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:02.860
too a huge one. And for building a real time system, that's

00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:07.420
the beauty of it, so you will be able to get a data set from

00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:13.360
here, now another place is obviously Kaggle, so from Kaggle

00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:17.100
you will be able to acquire a data set, again every kind of

00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:19.120
a data set you will be able to acquire, so there is a data

00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:22.680
set tab inside a Kaggle, so let me ping you this Kaggle link

00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:27.140
as well, here, so even here, so you will be able to just

00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:30.620
filter, search, type, maybe I can try to search select NLP

00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:35.600
and yeah, so it is going to give you again a tons of data

00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:37.540
set, whatever kind of a data set that you are looking for

00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:40.940
and you can try to apply the filters based on maybe a size,

00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:44.640
type, all these filters they have given to you for LLM fine

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:49.220
tuning, right, for like a model training, for RIG,

00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:51.740
everything you will be able to see the data, you will be

00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:55.120
able to get the data, as simple as that. Now the another

00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:58.680
platform from where you can acquire a data set is a UCI

00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:02.860
repository, so UCI repository is again a huge like a

00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:06.320
repository, so where you can get a data, so Huggingface,

00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:10.620
Kaggle and UCI repository, now even over here you can try to

00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:14.380
filter out a data for machine learning, deep learning,

00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:17.440
computer vision, generative AI, model building, retraining

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:20.820
or training, whatever, whatever, right, whatever, so you

00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:23.900
will be able to get a huge volume of a data even over here,

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:28.240
so starting from small till huge, so UCI, Huggingface and a

00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:32.080
Kaggle, Kaggle is going to my favorite and again yeah, so

00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:36.840
the fourth one is a Google data set, so Google data set, so

00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:42.360
they give you a complete search console just like a Google

00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:44.980
just for the data set, so there is search console just for

00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:47.820
the data set as you can see, right, so Google has given you

00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:52.340
this console just for doing a data set search, so even you

00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:57.100
can try to use this Google console for getting a data set.

00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:57.920
So

00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:06.320
Kaggle I have already pinged. Huggingface I have already

00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:11.900
pinged, UCI let me ping you inside the chat, so that it will

00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:15.940
be available even inside the resources, Akshit is saying,

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.240
sir, yesterday I have visited the certificate, yeah, you

00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:20.200
will be able to generate the certificate, I think while

00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:23.200
giving induction yesterday itself, so I have clearly

00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:29.180
specified that we have given a criteria of 50% like a quiz

00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:32.600
completion. Now so let's suppose I am taking a live classes,

00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:35.580
so obviously I am not uploading a quiz, in that case you can

00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:39.200
download a certificate on your own, I am like anytime you

00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:40.840
can download certificate even now you can download the

00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:43.720
certificate and we are aware about it and purposely we have

00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:46.560
given that, otherwise we would have like a put up a

00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:50.520
condition for this completion or that completion, so

00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:55.470
that's the answer Akshit, we are already aware about it and

00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:56.510
I have already discussed yesterday.

01:00:08.790 --> 01:00:11.270
So certificate whenever you are going to generate it is

01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:14.230
going to change, so it will always be a latest one, so the

01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:16.690
date, the day you are going to generate, so it is like going

01:00:16.690 --> 01:00:21.560
to give a certificate for that day. I think hope this is

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.560
your complete question, right Akshit, yeah,

01:00:26.830 --> 01:00:31.230
okay, so data set wise I think we are done, installation

01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:35.350
wise we are done and NLTK library installation wise we are

01:00:35.350 --> 01:00:38.350
done, so three things we are able to complete today so far,

01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:42.570
so one is a setup part, we have a multiple places where we

01:00:42.570 --> 01:00:46.930
can go and we can execute the code. Obviously we need a NLTK

01:00:46.930 --> 01:00:51.690
library installation to see data pre-processing and then if

01:00:51.690 --> 01:00:55.330
I have to acquire a data I can try to get a data from NLTK

01:00:55.330 --> 01:00:58.410
default library, so these are, there are like a lot of data

01:00:58.410 --> 01:01:01.530
set which is available inside NLTK, apart from this there is

01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:03.910
a UCI, there is a Hugging Face, there is a Google data set,

01:01:04.030 --> 01:01:07.870
there is a Kaggle which is like completely freely available

01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:12.310
to all of us, so I will be able to acquire data. Apart from

01:01:12.310 --> 01:01:14.950
that there are lot of paid platform, paid platform wise

01:01:14.950 --> 01:01:19.030
there are hundreds of paid platform for different use cases.

01:01:19.830 --> 01:01:23.430
One of my favorite is rapid. So whenever I don't get

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:26.790
anything in a paid mode, so I just look into the rapid one,

01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:29.990
I go and I just try to pay for the APIs, I get the data.

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:45.180
Fine guys, shall we move ahead, are we clear? I think we are

01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:49.440
not feeling bored by the way, yes everyone, will

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:08.260
this links available after the class, after the class this

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:11.600
link will not be available, so after the class in one hour

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:14.460
of time, so let's suppose if I am completing this class now,

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:17.720
so in next one hour recorded will be available. So same

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:19.740
thing you can see for yesterday's class, yesterday I have

01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:23.460
taken the class right and now if you are going to click on

01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:25.860
my yesterday's class, you will be able to see a complete

01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:29.720
different interface where you can watch the recordings. So

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:32.420
recordings will be available anyhow, so that today, tomorrow

01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:35.300
or even after a month if you are going to come on our

01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:39.180
platform, you will be able to go through the classes. But

01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:41.940
yeah, this active like a chat link will not be available,

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:44.560
this will be available only during our live classes, that's

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:48.680
it. But yeah, resources will be available. Resources and

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:50.920
video. Everything will be available except this chat link.

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:53.880
Okay, Deepak is saying class is very interesting, okay thank

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:56.980
you Deepak. Can you share the link of the paid platform for

01:02:56.980 --> 01:03:00.280
the data? Go with the rapid API, believe me, you will get

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.840
everything, so they are building rapid API since a very very

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:08.180
long time, so even if I am looking for like any things which

01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:11.240
is very much specific towards a domain, go with the rapid

01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:11.480
API.

01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:22.040
They will give you some free credit, but yeah, after that

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:22.640
they are going to charge.

01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:28.270
How long classes will be available? Classes will be

01:03:28.270 --> 01:03:32.210
available on our platform for an infinite time, but that

01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:34.570
depends upon your subscription. So if your subscription is

01:03:34.570 --> 01:03:36.870
for one year, so obviously after one year you have to go for

01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:39.250
the renewal, otherwise you will not be able to access it.

01:03:39.370 --> 01:03:41.870
But yeah, our classes that we are taking will be available

01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:45.290
even after a year, after two year, so as simple as that.

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:54.280
Sir make two hour time frame, it's only one hour. I am not

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:58.060
closing a class by the way, I am just asking people that are

01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:02.940
you able to do each and everything so far or not. Yeah. Your

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:06.180
class timing is technically two hour and some time you will

01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:10.240
see when I am going to discuss like a project, it will even

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:14.060
go for three hour or four hour. So because a project

01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:17.360
obviously like takes time, a lot of time it takes, end to

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:22.590
end project. Where is the link of the class? Bhushan you

01:04:22.590 --> 01:04:25.530
have already inside the class, there is no link we used to

01:04:25.530 --> 01:04:28.830
give. There is no zoom, there is no external link. So this

01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:32.710
is a class happens inside a dashboard. You can access a

01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:36.690
classes even from your mobile device. So we have a Android

01:04:36.690 --> 01:04:39.610
app which is available so you can download, you can join

01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:43.130
from a mobile, you can join from a web, any anywhere like

01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:47.610
wherever you are comfortable. How do we start the kernel? So

01:04:47.610 --> 01:04:49.590
simple go over their side, I think you have asked this

01:04:49.590 --> 01:04:51.430
question so many times, you can just click on the current

01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:53.510
kernel and then you can try to select the new one.

01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:59.780
Or kernel wise, so restart option, restart button is already

01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:05.960
given to you here, bold and clear. Like, okay, so now we are

01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:09.400
able to see how we can acquire data. We are able to do a

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:12.740
basic setup over here. Now let's start doing a small, small

01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:16.020
operations, just a small operation. So here what I can do

01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:21.560
is, so I can try to save that from NLTK, try to import

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:25.420
something called as tokenize. Why I'm going to use it? I'll

01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:29.820
show you. So import word tokenizer and then there is

01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:34.520
something called as sentence tokenizer.

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.880
So there is something called as word tokenizer. And there is

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:38.440
something called as sentence tokenizer. So there is

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:40.160
something called as sentence tokenizer. So this is the

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:45.180
import you have to do from NLTK. So just try to do the

01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:48.480
import. Now how we are going to use it by the way. So for

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:52.000
example, let's suppose there is a text txt variable I'm

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:57.400
going to create. I'm saying that my name is Sudhanshu Kumar.

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:09.540
I used to take class for data science. Big data and data

01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:11.020
analytics,

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:17.780
fine. Now this is one of the sentence which I have created.

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:20.300
This is one of the sentence I have created, a simple one,

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:24.500
right? Plain English sentence I have created now. So and

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:27.620
again, so we have, let's suppose like a discrimination marks

01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:31.960
over here, right? We have somewhere this comma in this

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:34.860
particular place. We have a space, a lot of spaces over

01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:38.500
here. So this is basically a data that I have created, or

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.420
this is a very simple, a small sentence. That I have

01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:45.260
created. Now here, if I'm going to use a word tokenizer and

01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:49.320
if I'm going to pass my text over here, txt, if I'm going to

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:50.520
pass my text over here,

01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:58.980
word tokenizer and text. What happened? What is the issue?

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:06.440
Parameter language, the model name is Phuket Corpus. Oh,

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:11.240
sorry. So I'm directly calling this one. But I have to

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:17.420
install a Phuket Corpus. Phuket, first of all, this is what

01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:21.380
it is trying to say. So directly it will not be able to. So

01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:24.960
text language, preserve line false. This is what word

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:26.680
tokenizer output

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:45.980
is truncated, param language is a Phuket Corpus. Okay. So it

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:48.580
is giving me an issue with

01:07:54.690 --> 01:07:56.970
respect to a Phuket Corpus.

01:08:00.290 --> 01:08:04.690
Oh, okay. So what I will do is. I'll try to download NLTK.

01:08:04.850 --> 01:08:07.850
So if it is giving me an issue, this was the unexpected

01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:12.830
issue, by the way, download, and then I can try to write P-U

01:08:12.830 --> 01:08:16.030
-K-E-T Phuket. So this is the error, I believe, which I'm

01:08:16.030 --> 01:08:17.530
receiving error

01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:47.140
loading a Phuket package. Not able to, oh,

01:08:53.860 --> 01:09:00.060
it should not happen. P-U-K-E-T spelling, there is no

01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:00.620
spelling mistake.

01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:10.320
I think it's giving me an issue because I have closed this

01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:12.380
download already. All options. So when I was downloading,

01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:18.010
all right. So I would have downloaded, I haven't, I haven't

01:09:18.010 --> 01:09:24.050
stopped this download all because it is having a Phuket

01:09:24.050 --> 01:09:28.970
package. So let me download all guys. Let me download all of

01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:33.210
these things. Yeah. And parallelly you can download all

01:09:33.210 --> 01:09:35.450
those things. Then I'm going to show you that how word

01:09:35.450 --> 01:09:40.450
tokenizer is going to work. So download all guys, everyone.

01:09:56.620 --> 01:10:02.300
Phuket. P-U. Spell. Spelling mistake. I don't think so.

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:06.480
Maybe it's a spelling mistake, which I have made. Maybe I

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:14.740
can go to google and search for NLTK Phuket. Yeah. It's P-U

01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:15.560
-N-K-E-T.

01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:33.080
The NLTK we are downloading is only specific to the IPv5.

01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:36.080
Yeah, correct. Only specific to this session. So if you're

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:39.940
going to open up a new JupyterNodo file, all will be gone.

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:43.220
So to do that. We can try to create a specific. Specific

01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:45.360
environment in that environment, we can try to launch, but

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:48.200
yeah. So whatever installation that you are doing now, it's

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:52.340
just for today, tomorrow, if you're going to open it up

01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:57.050
again, you will have to do the installation with a different

01:10:57.050 --> 01:10:57.570
Jupyter notebook.

01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:18.740
Fine. Now it's working as you can see. So here, basically

01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:21.740
Phuket is nothing, but it's a kind of a libraries, which is

01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:24.960
helping me out to tokenize this entire word, because there

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:28.600
are these words available as a token inside that library. So

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:33.140
here you can see that. That. If I have called word tokenize,

01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:36.100
and I have passed this entire sentence, this is my sentence,

01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:42.180
right? So it is trying to break down my entire data into one

01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:46.340
single word automatically. So my name is Siddhanshu Kumar,

01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:50.920
then comma, then I, then use, then two, then K for this. So

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:54.400
everything, everything, it is able to tokenize everything.

01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:58.140
It is able to convert it into one single, single token. Now,

01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:02.180
when we talk about a token. So token could be a word token

01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:06.000
could be a single character token could be a space token

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.800
could be any kind of a special case character token could be

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:13.920
anything. It depends upon me. So what is the meaning of a

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:17.420
token for me or like whatever project which I'm trying to

01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:20.860
build? So what is the meaning of a token for that? It's just

01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:23.900
about my understanding. So here, as per my understanding, so

01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:27.540
yeah, we are able to tokenize it now. So what? Oh, we are

01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:28.840
able to tokenize. We are able to tokenize this entire

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:32.520
sentence into a small, small word. Now there is something

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:35.460
called as sentence tokenizer that we have done as an import.

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:38.960
So let's try to call a sentence tokenizer as well. So after

01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:43.000
this word tokenizer, I can try to call a sentence tokenizer

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.920
and then I can try to pass a text. And as it suggests, it is

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:51.240
going to break down entire things into a different,

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:54.900
different sentence as simple as that. So it is trying to

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:59.060
take this entire data as a sentence. Okay. So this again,

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:01.620
it's elimination marks as one sentence. And this again,

01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:06.640
explanation marks as a one single, single sentence. Now this

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:11.440
is something which system is trying to do by default. Let's

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:15.400
suppose if I wanted to treat this as one sentence means

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:19.900
wherever there is a comma split it. Now this as one sentence

01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:23.580
means again, there is a comma split it. And then this as a

01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:26.340
sentence, so wherever there is a discrimination marks or a

01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:32.540
comma or full-stop, or maybe comma. I can do that as well.

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:36.280
I'm not saying that this is the only way of like creating a

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:39.420
tokens of the sentences. No, not at all. Like I said,

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:42.640
tokens, whether it's a sentence token, whether it's a word

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:45.980
token that we are trying to create, it all depends upon me

01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:49.840
and my use cases, the way I would like to represent my data.

01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:52.960
I will be able to represent the data. There are some inbuilt

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:55.580
functional libraries, which is going to do its work, its

01:13:55.580 --> 01:14:00.920
job. But yeah. Now, so what we can do is, so maybe we can,

01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:07.460
we can try to do some more things on top of it. So there is

01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:11.860
something called as from NLTK again, in terms of text

01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:16.940
cleaning and preprocessing. So NLTK dot corpus, C-O-R,

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:27.000
corpus, import, stop words. So people have already created a

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.820
library. A dictionary of a stop words. And sometime we used

01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:35.180
to include those stop words to make my model understands the

01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:38.060
grammar or relationship between it. Sometime we try to

01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:42.860
remove the stop words. So there is a library or there is a

01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:46.520
complete dictionary which has been created called as stop

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:52.540
words. And I can try to call NLTK, NLTK dot download, and I

01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:55.720
can try to download all the stop words, which I will be

01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:58.460
using. Going forward. So it's already downloaded. I have

01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:01.000
already done the download all. So it has already downloaded.

01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:05.260
Now what are the stop words which is available by default?

01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:08.640
So NLTK library, which and all words NLTK libraries are

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:12.520
considering as a stop words. So if I would like to like get

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:18.840
all the stop words. So what I can do is a stop words dot, I

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:25.040
can say w-r-d-s words, and then in which language? English.

01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:34.340
Let's suppose. E-N-G-L-I-S-H. E-N-G-L-I-S-H. Yeah. So these

01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:38.920
are the word guys, which is available inside this particular

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:43.620
package, this particular download and which system or NLTK

01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:47.840
library considers as a stop word. A about, above, after,

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:52.980
again, against, and lot of data you will be able to find out

01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:58.680
starting from A till X, Y, Z. Simple. Now, how many words

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:02.080
are there? So maybe I can try to check a length of it, that

01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:04.820
how many words are there as a stop words, which is by

01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:10.280
default, right? So in total 198 stop words are there. If I

01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:14.380
would like to like maybe extract 198 is not a big number. So

01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:18.200
all the unique stop words, I will be able to extract all the

01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:21.080
unique stop words out of this one. So if there is no

01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:24.440
reputation, so set of it, I will be able to print. Okay. And

01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:27.140
I will be able to get it. Now let's suppose these are the

01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:30.920
stop words, right? These are the stop words. Now I have my

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:37.020
text over here, text over here. I would like to remove all

01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:40.860
the stop words from my sentence. I wanted, I wanted to clean

01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:44.040
my sentence and I would like to stop or remove all the stop

01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:47.580
words. The stop words, which is a part of NLTK stop words

01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:51.080
library, right? I would like to remove all the stop words

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:54.320
from here. So how I will be able to remove it? Again, by

01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:58.260
writing a very simple Python code, I will be able to remove

01:16:58.260 --> 01:17:01.680
it. So first of all, I will have to normalize this entire

01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:05.040
data. Normalization means maybe I can try to convert all the

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:08.040
uppercase into a lowercase. That's called as normalization

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:11.060
because Python is a case-sensitive language. So obviously

01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:14.780
upper word and the lower word, uh, uppercase, uppercase and

01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:17.800
lowercase will be considered as a different one. So here,

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:21.400
what I can do is maybe I can try to call text dot lower.

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:25.660
Okay. And I can convert everything into a lowercase.

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:28.320
Although all the data set was available in lowercase, but

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:32.900
still just for like a safety. So we can try to convert all

01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:35.960
the data into a lowercase. Now what is, what is my target?

01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:42.660
My target is to remove all the stop words means whatever is

01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:47.020
available inside the NLTK library as a stop words, remove it

01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:49.880
from my sentence, remove it from my sentence. If is, is a

01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:52.660
part of a stop words, remove it. My is a part of stop words.

01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:57.280
Remove it. So how I will be able to remove it? Like I said,

01:17:57.380 --> 01:18:05.340
just by writing a very simple plain code, maybe I can, I can

01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:09.660
try to write a for loop over here and I will be able to

01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:12.260
remove it that, okay. So every time it will try to extract

01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:14.860
one data, it will try to check inside the stop words that,

01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:17.880
okay, if it is there, do it, or if it is not there, don't do

01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:22.920
it. Fine. So here, maybe I can try to store these things

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:28.020
into a. Okay. Variable called a stop underscore WRDS. We

01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:31.380
have to eliminate these stop words from our sentences.

01:18:34.090 --> 01:18:43.990
So here for I in, I can write text dot lower. So after

01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:47.830
converting this entire data set in text, so for I in text

01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:53.130
lower, what we have to do is so try to give me basically I

01:18:53.130 --> 01:18:58.090
try to give me basically I. Condition is that if I

01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:11.140
is available in a lower case and not in stop words, the

01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:17.380
variable that we have created over here, stop words. This is

01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:20.080
a simple list comprehension, which I'm writing. So it is

01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:22.640
going to give me the list of all the words. It

01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:30.480
became marked down somehow.

01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:48.820
Okay. So here. For. For I in text dot lower. So one by one,

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:51.800
one by one, one by one character by character. So it is

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:55.020
trying to go through each and everything. And then it is

01:19:55.020 --> 01:20:00.940
trying to extract the data, which looks wrong to me a little

01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:05.980
bit because I have to extract a word out of it, right? I

01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:09.520
have to extract a word out of it. So here, what we can do

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:13.300
is, so instead of passing a text, so I can try to pass this

01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:17.480
entire. Tokenized text, right? So I had basically a

01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:20.680
tokenized text after a word tokenization. So let me copy

01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:24.680
this part because for loop is going to break down my entire

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:27.660
things into a one, one character. And that's the reason. So

01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:31.280
it is able to filter it out. What we can do is so we can try

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:35.780
to tokenize. So here I can try to call word

01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:45.880
tokenize text. So text dot lower word

01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:52.620
tokenize. So I'm passing as a list. And then I will be able

01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:57.080
to get the data simple now. So here you will be able to see

01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:03.450
that, that inside a text, right? Inside a text, we had, my

01:21:03.450 --> 01:21:07.710
name is Dhan Shukumar. I used to now here names, Dhan

01:21:07.710 --> 01:21:13.930
Shukumar, I is gone. My is gone. Take class in, or all those

01:21:13.930 --> 01:21:17.230
things are gone. Data science, big data. So here I've just

01:21:17.230 --> 01:21:20.930
written a code, a piece of a code, which is trying to remove

01:21:20.930 --> 01:21:24.590
a string. Stop words from my data. So technically it's a

01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:27.730
Pythonic code that I have written. Now if you are not able

01:21:27.730 --> 01:21:30.930
to understand this line of a Python code, I'll write it down

01:21:30.930 --> 01:21:33.810
just by using, without using a list comprehension. So anyone

01:21:33.810 --> 01:21:37.330
who is not able to understand this piece of the code, just a

01:21:37.330 --> 01:21:39.410
list list comprehension. I have written over here a

01:21:39.410 --> 01:21:39.670
shortcut.

01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:50.800
Yeah. So anyone guys who is not able to understand, let me

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.920
write it down enough with the help of follow up if you want.

01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:10.800
Yes. Or it's fine. So let me move ahead. Got it? Not doing

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:14.160
anything. So just, I'm taking a word tokenize this one. So

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:16.640
this is basically a list, right? So I'm just trying to go

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:19.320
through a list one by one by one by one. I'm just trying to

01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:22.180
check that. Okay. If it is a lower and not in a stop words,

01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:28.280
then give me an I. That's it. Yeah. That's it. So again,

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.340
this is the list comprehension. You can try to write a

01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:32.400
follow up as well if you want. That's completely fine. You

01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:36.620
can write if condition, why we are writing outside if we

01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:38.820
have already converted them into the lower case. Yeah. Don't

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:43.660
do it. Remove it. It's fine. Remove it. So anyhow, we have,

01:22:43.660 --> 01:22:45.900
we are, we have already converted. So even if you're not

01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:47.700
going to write it down, that's completely fine. It's going

01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:51.100
to be the same answer. Nothing is going to change. Yeah.

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:54.780
Don't have to even, if you have written inside, then you

01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:56.980
don't have to even go and check. So maybe you can just try

01:22:56.980 --> 01:22:59.500
to write like a not in stop words and it is going to work

01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:03.540
for you. Your wish. Yeah. So again, you can just do it. So

01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:07.300
here we are able to remove the stop words and it's nothing

01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:11.020
actually. So we are just trying to list down the stop words.

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:14.000
Okay. Stop words, which is already available inside a NLTK

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.820
library. Now for example, let's suppose there is nothing

01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:22.000
which is available as a stop words inside NLTK library. I

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:26.440
can try to create my own list, right? So I can try to create

01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:29.920
my own list with any kind of a data, which I would like to

01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:32.840
consider as a stop words because stop words are nothing but

01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:37.660
a words which appears frequently and which appears

01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:41.160
frequently. But it is not going to contribute much. Okay.

01:23:41.180 --> 01:23:46.320
Much in terms of framing the complete sentence. This is

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:50.460
called as stop words. Technically that is a meaning of a

01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:53.660
stop words, right? The word which is not contributing much.

01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:58.000
So maybe I can try to remove from the sentences inside a

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.100
NLTK library. They have already given you a list, but again,

01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:06.520
it's not like I will be using the same list. Maybe I can try

01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:09.340
to prepare my own list and then I will be trying, I will try

01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:15.400
to, uh, remove the data out of it. Yep. Okay. Now there is

01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:20.080
something called as steaming basically. So let's suppose I

01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:23.880
have a text. So basically I have a text data over here and

01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:28.220
this is the complete sentence I have. Now there is something

01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:31.040
called as steaming. Now what is the steaming inside an NLP?

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:35.520
So steaming is nothing but converting our data or converting

01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:39.020
a word into its root word. That is something called as

01:24:39.020 --> 01:24:42.300
steaming. How? How we will be able to do a steaming? So

01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:45.700
there are multiple libraries to do a steaming. So one of the

01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:49.260
popular one is a Potter stemmer inside an NLTK. So let's try

01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:52.760
to use it and let's try to convert a data into its base

01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:56.860
format. So here what I can do is I can try to import F R O M

01:24:56.860 --> 01:25:02.980
from N L T K dot S T E M stem import

01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:12.130
basically Potter stemmer. So P capital P O Potter stemmer.

01:25:12.130 --> 01:25:15.190
Now what this steaming or stemmering is going to do? So it

01:25:15.190 --> 01:25:16.850
is going to, like I said, so it is going to basically

01:25:16.850 --> 01:25:21.270
convert your data into its base version of it. Again, it's a

01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:25.590
hard coded one, whatever you are able to see, not whatever I

01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:27.310
would say, but yeah, majority of the things that you are

01:25:27.310 --> 01:25:30.290
able to see inside an NLTK library. So technically it's a

01:25:30.290 --> 01:25:33.310
hard coded one. So people have already created a dictionary

01:25:33.310 --> 01:25:35.830
kind of a structure where they have already given a data,

01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:39.450
they have given the word and based on that NLTK library is

01:25:39.450 --> 01:25:42.150
going to do some sort of a comparison. Okay. So I'm going to

01:25:42.150 --> 01:25:45.390
give you the answer. Now here there is a steaming, right? So

01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:47.810
what is the meaning of a steaming by the way, like I said,

01:25:47.930 --> 01:25:50.510
so meaning of a steaming is very simple, converting any kind

01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:58.040
of a word into its base version. So here NLTK stem import

01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:01.620
Potter stemmer. Maybe I can try to create an object of a

01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:05.100
Potter stemmer over here. I can try to write it down as a

01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:11.500
stem, right? Stem. And then what I can do is. So here I can

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:19.440
try to call. Stem dot S T E M. So this is a method. Let's

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:22.620
suppose I'm just to remove the confusion. So is stem

01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:27.240
stemmering, let's suppose this is the variable name. So a

01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:30.920
stemmering variable name dot method name called as stem. And

01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:35.260
then I can try to pass my data over here. What kind of a

01:26:35.260 --> 01:26:39.160
data I can try to pass. So I can try to pass maybe a list of

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:42.440
the word list of the word I can try to pass. Okay. So I can

01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:46.280
try to pass this entire data after converting this data into

01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:51.020
a list of the word. So maybe I can use a word tokenizer. I

01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:54.220
can try to pass a data text. Now I know that, that this is

01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:57.700
going to give me the list list of the word token. I can try

01:26:57.700 --> 01:27:03.080
to pass this one inside the steaming. Now let's see the list

01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:07.560
object has no attribute lower. Where is the lower Potter

01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:23.950
stemmer parameters, the lowercase. If two lowercase is two

01:27:23.950 --> 01:27:26.950
lowercase. The word always lowercase text

01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:38.580
is basically text. Okay. So I'm just trying to do a stemming

01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:42.640
over here and I'm trying to pass this one.

01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:51.340
Okay. Let me write down this function in this way. So for I

01:27:51.340 --> 01:28:01.620
in basically a word tokenizer and then inside that I can try

01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:05.040
to pass a text. Now this is going to give me the list and

01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:09.160
then iteration. So this one. Okay. And then maybe I can try

01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:14.460
to print over here. So for every I that I'm able to get, so

01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:22.600
a stem ring dot a stem and then pass I yeah. So basically I

01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:25.000
have not done anything. So I've taken the list. This is the

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.620
list of the data. So I'm just trying to write a for loop. So

01:28:27.620 --> 01:28:30.600
it will try to bring one by one, one by one, all the data

01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:34.640
from this text simple. And then I'm trying to call a stem

01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:40.520
ring dot stem. Okay. Now just do the comparison. So here my

01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:45.140
data set was, my name is Siddhanshu Kumar. My name is

01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:49.580
Siddhanshu Kumar, then comma, then I, then use to take. So

01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:55.520
use to take class for data S C I N C, S C I N C E. So as you

01:28:55.520 --> 01:29:01.220
can see, it has removed E automatically. Now big data and

01:29:01.220 --> 01:29:07.440
data, not analytics. So analyst kind of a thing. So it is

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:11.560
trying to remove some of the data automatically. For

01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:15.020
example, if I'm going to take a very simple text, I'm going

01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:24.460
to override it. So I am teaching in my class classes, let's

01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:28.140
suppose instead of class, I'm going to take classes. So here

01:29:28.140 --> 01:29:32.500
you will be able to find out that it has done a stem ring

01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:37.240
over here. So I am teaching, right? I N G. It has removed. I

01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:41.860
am teach, not I N G. So basically teach is a base word for

01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:45.160
teaching. This is what a stemming is going to do. So

01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:48.820
stemming always try to convert your data set into its base

01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:52.400
version into its base word. Now I have written in my

01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:57.140
classes, it has converted this data into a class. So just

01:29:57.140 --> 01:29:59.980
our base word conversion. This is a transformation which I'm

01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:04.700
trying to do so where my NLTK library is trying to convert

01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:07.060
my data into its base word. So I'm going to do a base

01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:11.320
version and that is something called as a stem ring. One of

01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:14.620
the stemmer is basically a Potter's timer, but yes, Potter's

01:30:14.620 --> 01:30:17.280
timer is not the only a steamer that you will be able to

01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:20.880
find out apart from that. So there is a different, different

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:24.300
kind of a steamer. You all will be able to see, but yeah, so

01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:27.280
by doing this stammering, I'm not doing anything like a

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:30.980
different over here except converting my entire data set

01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:34.200
into its base format. So hope this is making sense to all of

01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:39.400
us. Right guys. Stammering. So stop word removal is one of

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:42.680
the part to cleaning the data, converting into a lower case,

01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:45.660
doing a stammering on top of the data set so that I will be

01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:49.340
able to convert my data set into a lower cases. What a

01:30:49.340 --> 01:30:52.040
tokenizer sentence tokenizer is something that we have seen.

01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:52.540
Yeah.

01:31:11.170 --> 01:31:11.810
Fine. Everyone.

01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:30.700
Okay. So stammering is fine. Now what we can do is so we can

01:31:30.700 --> 01:31:33.720
try to talk about maybe a lemmatization a little bit. So

01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:36.260
both stemming and lemmatization. So basically they try to,

01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:39.200
these are two terms. So stemming and lemmatization. So both

01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:43.380
try to convert your data into a base version. This is what

01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:45.700
it does, right? This is what it does at the end of the day.

01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:48.700
So here, what we can do is so maybe we can try to download

01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:55.420
one of the libraries. So from NLTK, NLTK, NLTK dot stem.

01:31:55.660 --> 01:31:58.800
Last time I have downloaded up, I have imported the Potter

01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:03.260
stammer. So this time I'm going to import basically import W

01:32:04.860 --> 01:32:09.480
R D word net lemmatizer. Now. This is going to work just

01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:12.540
like a Potter, but the thing is that in NLTK library,

01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:15.540
everything is hard coded, not everything. Most of the things

01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:17.480
are hard coded. So for everything they have created a

01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:19.380
corpus, they have created a dictionary or they have created

01:32:19.380 --> 01:32:22.300
a data set. It will always try to do a comparison with that

01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:25.060
data set. For example, so how it is able to convert my

01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:27.920
teaching into teach teaching into teach. So someone has

01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:32.100
already created a data inside for NLTK library and they have

01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:36.280
mentioned against a teaching. There is a teach or teaches

01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:38.980
there is a teach. So what it is trying to do, so it will try

01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:41.660
to do the comparison and it will try to give me the

01:32:41.660 --> 01:32:45.180
alternative values, whatever values, which is available

01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:48.560
inside a library. So this is how, so it's not doing anything

01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:51.000
out of the learning. No, not at all. It is not learning

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:54.460
anything. There is a hard coded library and out of that

01:32:54.460 --> 01:32:56.860
hardcore library, it is trying to do the conversion as

01:32:56.860 --> 01:33:02.760
simple as that. Fine. Yes. So it's basically whatever we are

01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:05.340
talking about as of now, it's a hard coded one. Someone has

01:33:05.340 --> 01:33:08.260
already created it. And then based on that, we are doing a

01:33:08.260 --> 01:33:10.640
comparison. Even you can try to create your own list. That's

01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:13.260
completely fine. Do the comparison. Print the list. It is

01:33:13.260 --> 01:33:15.580
going to work for you. Maybe you are trying to write some

01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:17.560
sort of an alien word, which is not a part of dictionary or

01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:21.480
which is not a part of any corpus or any existing library.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.740
Not an issue. Create a list. Do the conversion. After doing

01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:25.120
the mapping.

01:33:27.970 --> 01:33:30.930
If we are removing a stop words, how the model will learn

01:33:30.930 --> 01:33:33.350
them when we'll come to the model, you will get to know,

01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:38.030
right? That we never remove all the data. So we try to keep

01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:40.590
some of the data. There is something called as master. There

01:33:40.590 --> 01:33:41.770
is some asking that we try to give. There is something

01:33:41.770 --> 01:33:47.770
called as a, like a, even, even we try to keep your

01:33:47.770 --> 01:33:50.370
punctuation marks so that it will be able to learn the

01:33:50.370 --> 01:33:54.010
grammar, but yeah, we have not reached till that point.

01:33:57.250 --> 01:34:00.750
So a stammering again. So whatever we are able to access or

01:34:00.750 --> 01:34:03.110
whatever we are able to do with respect to a stammering, we

01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:05.950
will be able to do it with respect to this word limit

01:34:05.950 --> 01:34:07.910
lemmatizer as well as stammering why there are multiple

01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:11.050
libraries. Again lemmatizer wise, it's not the one, there

01:34:11.050 --> 01:34:13.090
are multiple libraries which I can use, but all the

01:34:13.090 --> 01:34:16.970
libraries are technically a hard coded library. Someone has

01:34:16.970 --> 01:34:22.190
created the Hughes data, kept it inside, and then when we

01:34:22.190 --> 01:34:25.250
are calling it, it is not doing anything apart from

01:34:25.250 --> 01:34:28.010
comparison. That's it. So that's, that's a reality of this

01:34:28.010 --> 01:34:33.190
NLTK now. So if I'm trying to implement a word net, so I

01:34:33.190 --> 01:34:35.650
have to download a word net. I have already downloaded

01:34:35.650 --> 01:34:39.410
everything by calling all, but again, let me show you that.

01:34:39.530 --> 01:34:44.650
So NLTK dot download. Okay. Word net lemmatizer so that it

01:34:44.650 --> 01:34:47.470
will be able to download all the data which people have

01:34:47.470 --> 01:34:50.270
created for the lemmatization. Like I said, teaching, teach

01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:54.130
classes, class. So someone has created it. It is just trying

01:34:54.130 --> 01:34:57.730
to refer to it. So NLTK word net lemmatizer, and then I'm

01:34:57.730 --> 01:35:05.190
going to download W O R D, W O R D N E T word net. No, no,

01:35:05.230 --> 01:35:12.820
no. Download. I have to download. Right. D O W N. Download.

01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:16.120
It's already downloaded. Simple. So I have already

01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:20.220
downloaded all simply means that this is available. Now

01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:25.400
let's suppose I have a text over here, not test text over

01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:30.020
here. So I have text. I'm teaching in my class, same text,

01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:33.660
which I have taken our right. And maybe I'm going to convert

01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:38.840
this text into a word tokens, text

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:47.240
token in the variable. I'm going to store. So fine. This is

01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:50.240
how my text token looks like a list, basically a list, this

01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:52.900
list. Now I'm going to use this particular list over here.

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:57.500
So we have a, we can, we can try to call it with respect to

01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:05.680
a word lemmatizer. This one. So I can try to call for, for I

01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:10.360
in basically this text token. So I'm just trying to call

01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:13.340
this text token data one by one I'm teaching in my classes.

01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:17.560
So and then what I can do is. So I can try to. So basically

01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:25.760
pass this entire data print, print what? So print basically

01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:27.160
word

01:36:29.820 --> 01:36:38.910
that lemmatizer inside that pass my data simple. So it will

01:36:38.910 --> 01:36:42.490
try to lemmatize it. And then eventually it is going to give

01:36:42.490 --> 01:36:46.810
me my data. So what net lemmatizer dot lemme ties. So L E

01:36:46.810 --> 01:36:53.510
lemma T I Z E. So lemmatize. Okay. I'm going to call I. So

01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:58.370
lemmatize missing one personal argument words. So here is a

01:36:58.370 --> 01:37:01.890
word I'm trying to pass. Word net lemmatizer.

01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:10.880
Okay. It's correct. L E double M A L E double M A T I Z E T

01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:17.710
I Z E. And then one by one, one by one, I'm trying to pass

01:37:17.710 --> 01:37:26.790
the data over here. So yes, looks fine to me. Maybe there is

01:37:26.790 --> 01:37:28.670
a parameter. So what is equals to I.

01:37:46.910 --> 01:37:52.290
Okay. So as a function, I have to call, I just missed that

01:37:52.290 --> 01:37:56.650
part. So what lemmatizer dot lemmatize. Yeah. Simple, right?

01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:59.190
So what lemmatizer as a function I'm trying to call,

01:37:59.250 --> 01:38:01.450
otherwise I can create an object and then I can try to call

01:38:01.450 --> 01:38:05.190
it both is fine. So what lemmatizer and then lemmatize I'm

01:38:05.190 --> 01:38:08.090
trying to pass I one by one same data I'm trying to pass.

01:38:08.190 --> 01:38:13.370
And then I am. It has not converted my teaching. Last time

01:38:13.370 --> 01:38:17.830
when I have used this water steamer, it has converted my

01:38:17.830 --> 01:38:22.010
teaching into teach, but this time it has not converted my

01:38:22.010 --> 01:38:25.810
teaching into teach. It is keeping as it is. And it has

01:38:25.810 --> 01:38:29.250
converted classes into class. Obviously, like I said, it

01:38:29.250 --> 01:38:32.290
just go do the mapping. And then based on that, it is going

01:38:32.290 --> 01:38:36.630
to give me the outcome. This is how this analytical library,

01:38:36.750 --> 01:38:39.630
most of the part from the analytical library is going to

01:38:39.630 --> 01:38:41.830
work. There are some network or there are some neural

01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:42.470
network. Which is going to give me the outcome. Which

01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:46.410
somewhere like inside analytic if people have used, but

01:38:46.410 --> 01:38:49.590
yeah, in most of the cases, this is the case where it will

01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:51.810
try to do a comparison and then eventually it is going to

01:38:51.810 --> 01:38:54.290
give you the or maybe based on the just a distance

01:38:54.290 --> 01:38:57.510
calculation. So it is going to give you the data. So here we

01:38:57.510 --> 01:39:01.070
have seen a steaming. We have seen lemmatization. Maybe I

01:39:01.070 --> 01:39:03.390
can try to use some different library for the lemmatization

01:39:03.390 --> 01:39:08.010
and it is going to even remove ING. That is possible. That

01:39:08.010 --> 01:39:13.790
is also possible. Okay. So. Hope. So this is fine. So word

01:39:13.790 --> 01:39:15.690
lemmatizer and a potter steamer.

01:39:40.380 --> 01:39:46.130
Yes, everyone. So here I have called one thing called as

01:39:46.130 --> 01:39:51.090
stop words, right? So stop words in English. I can even try

01:39:51.090 --> 01:39:54.090
this out with our different different language. So even we

01:39:54.090 --> 01:39:57.850
can try to maybe print, we'll have to check its library that

01:39:57.850 --> 01:40:00.550
what an all language it supports. So maybe I can try to

01:40:00.550 --> 01:40:02.630
write just for experimentation Hindi.

01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:09.120
It supports, I think, 13, 14 languages. I don't know.

01:40:13.180 --> 01:40:18.620
Maybe I'll have to download the call or I don't know like

01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:22.160
English is fine. So but

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:28.420
yeah, there are libraries. So where you will be able to find

01:40:28.420 --> 01:40:30.700
out stop words and all the other alternative for other

01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:33.080
languages as well. So there is a library which people have

01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:35.680
already created and you will be able to find out even those

01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:40.680
things. Okay. Now moving ahead guys. So lemmatization we are

01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:46.980
able to do tokenization. We are able to. Stop words we are

01:40:46.980 --> 01:40:49.940
able to handle Russian

01:40:57.810 --> 01:41:01.710
worked. Yeah I think it's about 13, 14 languages last time

01:41:01.710 --> 01:41:04.770
and I have checked. So it was supporting 13, 14 languages

01:41:04.770 --> 01:41:10.890
are R-U-S-S-I in Russian. Yeah like I said, right? So it

01:41:10.890 --> 01:41:14.070
supports like a multiple languages. You can, you can try

01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:18.390
this out with other like a language as well. Maybe you can

01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:21.410
check the official like a library. Official documentation

01:41:21.410 --> 01:41:24.810
and over there you will be able to find out that here it is

01:41:24.810 --> 01:41:25.850
supporting the multiple things.

01:41:29.930 --> 01:41:33.430
Now so let's try to understand couple of more different

01:41:33.430 --> 01:41:36.410
different kind of a stemmer. So we have seen a Potter

01:41:36.410 --> 01:41:39.550
stemmer. There is something called as Lens Carter stemmer.

01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:43.450
So again, it's not doing anything different. Just trying to

01:41:43.450 --> 01:41:47.650
trim down some of the words ING or ES this kind of things.

01:41:48.090 --> 01:41:51.130
But yeah, there is a different package which has been given

01:41:51.130 --> 01:41:56.670
to us inside our NLDK. So NLDK dot S-T-E-M stem and then

01:41:56.670 --> 01:41:59.030
basically import Lens

01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:03.120
Carter stemmer. So even you can try to use a Lens Carter

01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:06.400
stemmer and then you can try to pass your data. So Lens

01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:13.760
Carter stemmer maybe Lens as a Lens you can try to store and

01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:21.160
then L-A-N-C Lens dot maybe you can try to call a stem and

01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:23.700
then you can try to pass your data. For example. For

01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:33.460
example, if I'm going to pass R-U-N-N-I-N-G S-T-E-M yeah, so

01:42:33.460 --> 01:42:36.220
running to run it is able to convert I can try to call it

01:42:36.220 --> 01:42:38.740
into a for loop and I can try to pass the entire sentence.

01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:42.200
But yeah, so if I'm going to call running so it is going to

01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:46.100
convert into a run if I'm going to can call maybe teaching

01:42:46.100 --> 01:42:52.610
it is going to convert into a now someone is asking that

01:42:52.610 --> 01:42:55.850
what is the difference between limitization and staining so

01:42:55.850 --> 01:42:59.570
not much I would say. Because both of this technique has

01:42:59.570 --> 01:43:03.950
been used to like a convert your data set into a base word

01:43:03.950 --> 01:43:08.090
and but yeah, so basically if I'll talk about the staining

01:43:08.090 --> 01:43:13.370
so it may try to remove a word before and maybe after and

01:43:13.370 --> 01:43:19.450
again like I said so basically it's more like a mapping over

01:43:19.450 --> 01:43:21.730
there and based on the mapping so it will be able to give

01:43:21.730 --> 01:43:26.330
you the final data. Now if I'll talk about a limitization.

01:43:26.330 --> 01:43:28.550
So, it try to consider the context so based on the

01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:30.630
contextual information it will try to do some sort of a

01:43:30.630 --> 01:43:34.990
conversion. Spearless French okay French is available fine

01:43:34.990 --> 01:43:36.050
sir

01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:44.380
can you please share a theory concept book that can help to

01:43:44.380 --> 01:43:46.580
understand few basic concept and help during the interview.

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:50.240
No there is no book relevant in a today's world I would say

01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:52.800
because things have changed a lot you can see a lot of books

01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:57.580
I have I'm keeping even my background but nowadays it's of

01:43:57.580 --> 01:44:04.980
no use because like I said things have changed. And yeah, so

01:44:04.980 --> 01:44:08.520
we are just trying to relearn and unlearn everything

01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:12.480
nowadays. So I believe you will have to wait for a books

01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:15.240
when someone will come in a market and then they will start

01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:19.900
writing a brand new new books based on the latest concept.

01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:23.320
But yeah books books are good sub couple of books are good I

01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:26.300
would say in terms of learning the base concept and for a

01:44:26.300 --> 01:44:29.560
machine learning the only one favorite book that I have is.

01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:33.680
This one maybe I can show you I think I have it here it's

01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:39.500
okay so yeah this is the only book that you can try to use

01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:43.620
so maybe you can use this book that's fine and so on machine

01:44:43.620 --> 01:44:47.160
learning with cycle and keras intensive flow but instead of

01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:51.020
going through this entire book sometime you will feel like

01:44:51.020 --> 01:44:56.100
if someone has explained me a concept in little bit more

01:44:56.100 --> 01:45:01.660
detail. So. Okay. So and plus in a more practical way so

01:45:01.660 --> 01:45:05.380
that's a problem that you may face with even with this book

01:45:05.380 --> 01:45:07.900
but yeah it's one of the best in a market so far.

01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:20.040
So lens carter, stemmer likewise so there is something

01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:22.320
called a snowball stemmer so there are three very famous

01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:25.260
stemmer that you will be able to find out so potter stemmer

01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:27.400
lens carter and snowball stemmer you can try to use any of

01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:31.560
these that's completely fine it is going to like a trim down

01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:33.300
your data your word.

01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:40.600
Now

01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:47.730
moving to the next part.

01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:30.660
Again no need to go through the entire APIs like I said so

01:46:30.660 --> 01:46:32.820
there are so many things which is available and if you'll

01:46:32.820 --> 01:46:36.440
start going through each and every APIs it will be like it

01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:39.020
will give you a lot of difficulties in terms of doing a

01:46:39.020 --> 01:46:44.020
implementation in terms of anything. So you don't you just

01:46:44.020 --> 01:46:47.360
have to like decide that how much you have to learn and then

01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:51.040
how much you have to leave. Because if you will just go

01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:55.120
through one single library maybe it will take an entire year

01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:59.100
of time. You will not be able to remember so it's of no need

01:46:59.100 --> 01:47:02.300
it's of no use. So that's the reason why I keep on

01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:05.260
suggesting people keep on recommending people that try to

01:47:05.260 --> 01:47:10.860
always focus on a basic and then immediately once you are

01:47:10.860 --> 01:47:14.300
able to build something jump so once you are able to like

01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:16.980
learn a little bit jump into a building and finally like a

01:47:16.980 --> 01:47:19.500
developing a product okay.

01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:28.120
Now I'll talk about basically a POS parts of speech

01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:31.420
basically so POS tagging so let's try to talk about the

01:47:31.420 --> 01:47:34.600
parts of speech because even this has been used when we try

01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:37.960
to convert a data for a model training so that my model will

01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:41.020
be able to understand a relationship between a parts of

01:47:41.020 --> 01:47:49.180
speech. So here I can try to import from NLTK dot tag and

01:47:49.180 --> 01:47:55.440
then IMPORT import POS so POS tags. So this is the library

01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:59.360
which is going to give you that tagging for any kind of a

01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:03.200
parts of speech available inside a sentence means for any

01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:05.940
any sentences if there is a word so obviously it will be a

01:48:05.940 --> 01:48:09.440
part of some of the parts of speech maybe noun pronoun verb

01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:13.380
adjective adverb that we generally try to use in English or

01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:16.320
even in any language right we always try to understand the

01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:20.640
grammar first and we try to phrase a sentences or we try to

01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:23.480
write something so in a similar manner so even with respect

01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:26.800
to NLTK you will be able to segregate or you will be able to

01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:31.180
map all the words with respect to its parts of speech. As

01:48:31.180 --> 01:48:36.180
simple as that. So here I have done the import of POS

01:48:36.180 --> 01:48:42.100
basically like a tag. Now what I can do is so maybe I can

01:48:42.100 --> 01:48:47.660
try to call a POS tag POS tag over here and then I can try

01:48:47.660 --> 01:48:54.860
to pass maybe Apple token expected list of the string got a

01:48:54.860 --> 01:48:58.620
string okay I'll just try to pass as a list over here yeah

01:49:02.420 --> 01:49:05.940
so Apple so as I have passed Apple over here so it is giving

01:49:05.940 --> 01:49:09.940
me basically NN basically it's a noun. Now if you will go

01:49:09.940 --> 01:49:13.380
and check so there are a multiple like a parts of a speech a

01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:15.220
different different kind of a parts of a speech you will be

01:49:15.220 --> 01:49:17.960
able to find out there is something called as data minor

01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:20.120
there is something called as adjective there is something

01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:22.780
called as noun and it is nothing but noun there is something

01:49:22.780 --> 01:49:25.400
called as verb third person singular present there is

01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:27.520
something called as preposition there is something called as

01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:31.460
punctuation right. So for example if I'm going to pass Apple

01:49:31.460 --> 01:49:36.320
if I'm going to pass maybe my name Sudhanshu over here if

01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:43.740
I'm going to pass maybe running if I'm going to pass maybe

01:49:43.740 --> 01:49:47.700
some exclamation marks over here so here Apple is noun

01:49:47.700 --> 01:49:51.380
Nanshu is noun running is VVG right and this is nothing but

01:49:51.380 --> 01:49:55.860
my punctuation so running is nothing but a verb verb third

01:49:55.860 --> 01:49:59.500
person. So it is giving me a parts of a speech a respective

01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:02.200
parts of a speech for each and everything so this is

01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:06.180
something called as POS tagging. POS tagging or this kind of

01:50:06.180 --> 01:50:09.920
a sentence conversion generally we try to use while training

01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:12.480
a model so that my model will be able to understand a

01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:16.160
relationship between all of this verb adverb adjective and

01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:19.260
it will be able to form a relationship by understanding

01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:22.420
actual meaning or actual grammars because at the end of the

01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:25.560
day model is nothing but it's a mathematical calculation

01:50:25.990 --> 01:50:28.840
right it never understands something like a human being it

01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:32.780
understands in a very very different way. So yeah it this

01:50:32.780 --> 01:50:36.720
kind of a data is going to help my model. To understand in a

01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:39.520
better way and we always try to do this kind of

01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:43.320
implementation while preparing a data set making sense guys

01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:44.480
oh

01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:54.640
sorry my bad so I was showing you a book and then I haven't

01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:58.680
switched my screen sorry okay so this is the only thing

01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:01.520
which I Sahid

01:51:13.260 --> 01:51:16.020
is saying that it looks like we are watching the recording

01:51:16.020 --> 01:51:17.940
video is it Sahid people

01:51:24.410 --> 01:51:25.350
are people. So.

01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:33.800
Okay. So yeah I was I was showing you the books right so

01:51:33.800 --> 01:51:35.900
someone has asked me for the best book and I was showing you

01:51:35.900 --> 01:51:38.820
the book and then I forgot to share my screen so switch my

01:51:38.820 --> 01:51:42.320
screen basically yeah. So here basically like what I was

01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:45.280
trying to teach you is that there is something called as POS

01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:47.760
tagging right there is something called as POS tagging and

01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:51.600
to understand a POS tagging nothing but noun pronoun verb

01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:54.880
adjective adverb punctuation so there is a dictionary

01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:57.780
someone has already created and you just have to pass your

01:51:57.780 --> 01:52:00.160
data over here right and it is going to give you a

01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:03.040
respective one. For example, Apple is noun so it is giving

01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:06.040
me NN so down show is basically what nouns it is giving me

01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:09.220
NN running is what it's basically a word so it is giving me

01:52:09.220 --> 01:52:12.200
VVG so this external mass is what it's basically a

01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:16.380
punctuation so it is giving me a dot so in this way we try

01:52:16.380 --> 01:52:20.000
to tag we try to break down our entire sentences into a

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.900
different different words and then eventually we try to tag

01:52:22.900 --> 01:52:26.720
it with a parts of speech and this again this kind of

01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:31.560
information is very much required for a model. So whenever

01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:33.920
we try to train the model society

01:52:37.320 --> 01:52:41.200
is saying yes it looks like to me I don't know so yeah it's

01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:44.300
your personal feeling in that case I'll just leave it up to

01:52:44.300 --> 01:52:45.560
you fine

01:52:53.880 --> 01:52:58.680
guys yep yeah sir

01:53:01.270 --> 01:53:05.810
is it stream streaming on YouTube and why so yeah basically

01:53:05.810 --> 01:53:08.530
what we do is so we try to like we have created this system

01:53:08.530 --> 01:53:11.070
in such a way that it is streams on a YouTube server during

01:53:11.070 --> 01:53:15.290
a live classes and then after that there will be a live

01:53:15.290 --> 01:53:17.430
classes. There will be a recorded video which goes inside

01:53:17.430 --> 01:53:23.510
our DRM system a protected system so that no one will be

01:53:23.510 --> 01:53:26.330
able to even share and even if you are going to share your

01:53:26.330 --> 01:53:31.030
screen so it will look blank the complete black screen fine

01:53:31.030 --> 01:53:36.070
guys yeah okay sir aaj ki liye kaafi hai Santanu is saying

01:53:36.070 --> 01:53:39.390
Archit is saying can you please share a technical concept

01:53:39.390 --> 01:53:42.690
books on NLP there is there is no such books I would say

01:53:42.690 --> 01:53:45.330
there is no such books Archit and I never recommend anyone

01:53:45.330 --> 01:53:49.350
to follow the books the best way to follow is let's suppose

01:53:49.350 --> 01:53:53.730
I have created a syllabus right let's suppose I am going

01:53:53.730 --> 01:54:01.510
here on your own and we have a syllabus GENE RATIV

01:54:01.510 --> 01:54:08.120
generative AI now if you have to do a exploration so just

01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:12.400
try to go through a topic one by one one by one one by one

01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:15.520
because all the information will not be available in any

01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:18.900
books. Believe me in any books information will be available

01:54:18.900 --> 01:54:22.660
in bits and pieces one by one that what is a text

01:54:22.660 --> 01:54:25.960
organization how we can do it what is the use cases of it

01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:28.960
and how I will be able to write a code now end of this topic

01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:32.020
remove the stop words now what is the meaning of stop words

01:54:32.020 --> 01:54:35.480
and if I can do something with respect to a python code end

01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:39.680
of this limitation streaming so if you are going in this way

01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:43.300
one by one one by one topic by topic believe me once you

01:54:43.300 --> 01:54:46.220
will move from here to here. You will be able to connect

01:54:46.220 --> 01:54:49.500
each and everything plus you will be able to learn in no

01:54:49.500 --> 01:54:55.680
time. Books wise like I said no books is going to cover the

01:54:55.680 --> 01:55:01.460
entire syllabus. No books means literally no books and again

01:55:01.460 --> 01:55:05.300
so things have changed a lot because of that so we have

01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:08.140
modified we have restructured the syllabus and this is

01:55:08.140 --> 01:55:12.220
something that we keep on doing it. If you are going to

01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:14.540
follow the books. So maybe someone has written a book. A

01:55:14.540 --> 01:55:17.460
year back or maybe a five year back now those books are not

01:55:17.460 --> 01:55:19.580
relevant those informations are not relevant in today's

01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:22.380
world you will not be able to build anything and by reading

01:55:22.380 --> 01:55:28.100
a books I don't think that as a techie yeah till our college

01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:32.540
I think reading a books is fine even I used to read a lot of

01:55:32.540 --> 01:55:35.140
books nowadays I don't read a technical books I read a

01:55:35.140 --> 01:55:39.620
philosophy and technical wise I try to build things. This is

01:55:39.620 --> 01:55:42.880
how I like keep myself updated by building things not just

01:55:42.880 --> 01:55:45.380
by like learning or going through some documentation or some

01:55:45.380 --> 01:55:50.400
books. So as a techie I always suggest you that try to build

01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:54.200
even a small one try to write a code that's the best way of

01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:56.860
learning not just by reading it you don't have to go for the

01:55:56.860 --> 01:56:00.380
exam right you have to go for a job interview in a job

01:56:00.380 --> 01:56:02.460
interview people are not going to test your knowledge people

01:56:02.460 --> 01:56:04.560
are going to test your experience and there is a difference

01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:08.220
between knowledge and experience. So experience you will

01:56:08.220 --> 01:56:11.080
never be able to get even after reading hundreds of books

01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:14.080
even a philosophical book. Even a motivational books or even

01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:17.940
a technical books experience you will be able to get just by

01:56:17.940 --> 01:56:21.520
doing it and hope you understand that part yeah and this is

01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:24.900
like a normal question for me because in every classes so

01:56:24.900 --> 01:56:27.960
people ask me in a beginning just in the beginning a couple

01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:31.260
of weeks people will ask what is the best book what is not

01:56:31.260 --> 01:56:37.380
and I never recommend one because I know that that you will

01:56:37.380 --> 01:56:39.620
end up wasting your money maybe you will go you will try to

01:56:39.620 --> 01:56:42.480
buy it. Then you will end up wasting a couple of hours.

01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:45.080
Hours over there and I know eventually you will not be able

01:56:45.080 --> 01:56:49.540
to get any things out of it so it's better go through topic

01:56:49.540 --> 01:56:54.360
by topic write a code after that combine each and everything

01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:59.520
build a small project end of the story a best way of

01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:00.720
learning so

01:57:06.380 --> 01:57:08.480
I'm not going to share any books by the way I'm going to

01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:12.380
share a code which I'm going to write inside my like a class

01:57:12.380 --> 01:57:15.780
I'm going to share a projects basically and whatever let's

01:57:15.780 --> 01:57:18.920
suppose if I'm teaching you architecture right. So because I

01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:22.700
think in by next week by next week itself by next week

01:57:22.700 --> 01:57:25.080
Sunday so I'm going to start with the architecture so where

01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:27.640
I will be talking about because next week I'm going to

01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:32.000
finish this particular part with lot of examples over here

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.440
so there is a small calculation over here again I have to

01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:37.260
show you the network now this is all about the architecture

01:57:37.260 --> 01:57:39.900
so at that point of a time obviously I'll be share my

01:57:39.900 --> 01:57:42.420
handwritten documents that's it so whatever will be

01:57:42.420 --> 01:57:44.600
discussed in the class only that will be shared apart from

01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:47.520
that not going to share anything because that's not

01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:48.140
required. So that's it.

01:57:53.220 --> 01:57:56.360
I think interviews are based on use cases and projects

01:57:56.360 --> 01:58:00.220
building projects and exactly yeah that's a true way of

01:58:00.220 --> 01:58:02.000
learning you are not in the school you are not in college

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.840
you don't have to go and give a semester exam or maybe your

01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:08.920
yearly exam or maybe your monthly exam right. So please try

01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:13.520
to come out of that scenario or that way of learning if you

01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:16.840
are going to change that like the way of learning I think it

01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:20.940
will be very much helpful and you will be able to get into

01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:24.160
industry as soon as possible. You will keep on just reading

01:58:24.160 --> 01:58:26.820
it and we all know that we all have gone through a lot of

01:58:26.820 --> 01:58:30.820
books lot of study lot of exams in last like 2530 year. And

01:58:30.820 --> 01:58:32.840
we all know what kind of a benefit that we are able to get

01:58:32.840 --> 01:58:34.220
all almost nothing.

01:58:37.060 --> 01:58:40.420
Fine guys. Okay so I'm done for today. Now let me share this

01:58:40.420 --> 01:58:43.020
notebook and this is what I am going to do on a regular

01:58:43.020 --> 01:58:45.640
basis not regular daily basis I would say. So whenever I'll

01:58:45.640 --> 01:58:50.180
take a class. So after the class this notebook will be

01:58:50.180 --> 01:58:53.880
available inside your chat as well as inside your resources.

01:58:54.540 --> 01:58:55.340
So you need to be respecting when you are talking about

01:58:55.340 --> 01:58:56.640
writing things I say one thing after the your batch is this

01:58:56.640 --> 01:59:01.040
one this is the okay ninth right yeah this is something

01:59:01.040 --> 01:59:06.160
which i have created so here zip file let me convert it into

01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:10.400
yeah zip file now i'm sending it to you okay

01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:18.740
so zip file is already available guys and even in later

01:59:18.740 --> 01:59:21.700
stage when you will come and join a class maybe if you are

01:59:21.700 --> 01:59:23.980
going to watch a recorded one you will be able to find out

01:59:23.980 --> 01:59:29.920
the zip inside a resource section so this is a material for

01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:32.260
today so whatever i have executed it's already available

01:59:32.260 --> 01:59:37.370
inside your system fine guys everyone are we able to learn

01:59:37.370 --> 01:59:39.590
something just a basic i don't think that today i have

01:59:39.590 --> 01:59:42.550
discussed much but yeah just a basic we have discussed how

01:59:42.550 --> 01:59:45.490
to acquire a data where to acquire data how to do a basic

01:59:45.490 --> 01:59:48.650
setup and then what is the meaning of lemmatization what is

01:59:48.650 --> 01:59:50.870
the meaning of parts of a speech what is the meaning of

01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:56.690
basically a stop words and basically what is nltk library we

02:00:01.750 --> 02:00:04.050
can conclude the session time so please share the notebook

02:00:04.050 --> 02:00:06.070
notebook is already shared it's already there i have already

02:00:06.070 --> 02:00:10.730
shared inside the zip file yeah you can download it now fine

02:00:10.730 --> 02:00:12.610
guys so with that thank you so much everyone see you again

02:00:12.610 --> 02:00:14.850
in my next lecture we are already connected over a whatsapp

02:00:14.850 --> 02:00:18.110
so till then thank you so much take care everyone have a

02:00:18.110 --> 02:00:18.690
great day night ahead
