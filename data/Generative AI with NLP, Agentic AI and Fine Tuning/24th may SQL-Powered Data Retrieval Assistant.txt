WEBVTT

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.360
In this today's class, guys, so we are going to talk about a

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.140
system. So where you will be able to interact with any SQL

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.980
system out there, maybe in a local or maybe which is

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.240
available on any cloud platform, any like a hosted platform

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.120
or maybe any managed platform. And with the help of just a

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.040
simple query, you will be able to query your database, any

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.980
kind of a query. So maybe if you have to like go ahead with

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.980
a very, very complex query, you will be able to do that. And

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.380
that is a kind of a system that we are going to start. Any

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.060
new courses are we starting? Yeah. So for generative AI, so

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.760
we are already starting so many courses. Let me share my

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.040
screen and let me show it to you. So we are starting

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.160
something from a generative AI. We are starting something

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.720
from a RAG and so many like other courses we have already

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.640
started machine learning, deep learning, computer vision,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.980
stats. NLP, almost all this like courses we have already

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.580
started in a hybrid mode. So you can go and check that out

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:08.340
as well. Okay. So let me share my screen. Um, I believe it's

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.380
already shared. Hmm.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.910
So I'm going to open up my VS code and

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.900
the project which I have prepared guys, uh, for my today's

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.000
discussion. So S-T-R-E-A-M-L-I-T is streamlint and then run

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.020
and main.py file. So let me check if all the dependencies

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.440
are there. All the dependencies are resolved. Yeah. So let

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.140
me show you first of all, a demo that what we are going to

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.020
achieve with the help of this today's project. So let's

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.980
suppose there is a SQL system in which I have a multiple

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.100
tables inside those tables. I have a couple of data data

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.180
set, which is available now. So we are going to build this

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.800
entire system. So where I can come and then I can try to

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.060
query, I can say that, so me all the tables, tables, right?

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.140
And this system is going to run. And if everything works

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.240
fine, it is going to show me that table, which is available

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:15.320
inside my, uh, system. So, uh, select from where type table.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.270
Okay. Show me order

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.080
table. So maybe I have missed something.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.880
Okay. So, yeah, as you can see that I'm going to run a lot

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.200
of like a complex query as well. So this is just a very,

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.760
very simple query. So as you can see that I'm just writing a

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.460
command over here, I'm just trying to write like a, I'm

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.860
doing a chat with my elements and then it is able to

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.540
populate this a particular table and it is able to show me a

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.580
data set, which is available inside my table. Even I will be

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.540
able to write a very, very complex queries and based on that

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.420
system itself is going to build the query for me. And it is

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.580
going to bring all kinds of a data set, whichever I'm

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.820
looking for inside the system. And this is going to be a

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.760
project that we are going to see in my today's class. So

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.220
shall we start guys? Are we ready? Yeah. So a lot of complex

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.460
queries also we are going to run.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.260
Okay. So now, uh, let's get started. Let's try to see that

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.240
how we can try to build this kind of a project and how we

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.580
can try to automate the entire query part so that you don't

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.680
have to even learn a SQL. And this is the kind of a feeling,

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.560
believe me, all of you are going to get once I'm going to

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.520
show you. This particular project that why do we even go and

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.400
why do we even learn a SQL and a complex queries that we

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.900
have been writing since a very, very long time, right across

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.080
the industry with the help of LLM itself, I can just try to,

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.060
uh, interact with my database and then it is going to

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.360
populate all sort of a data set for B. Yeah. So how many

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.800
days it takes to complete this batch, I think two to three

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.720
weeks more because tomorrow. So we are going to talk about a

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.540
lot of project back to back, back to back and then next

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.860
week. So I'll be talking about, uh, agentic AI. So where I

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.620
will be showing you a lot of demo with respect to a Lang

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.560
chain with respect to a Lama indexes with respect to a Lang

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.840
graph and crew AI basically. So where we can go and we can

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.800
try to create a variety of the agent and then next to next

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.880
week. So we are going to see a model fine tuning based on

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.400
the different, different kind of a parameter and as per the

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.820
syllabus, so tentatively, it is going to take another three

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.300
week of time, or max, two max, maybe a four week of time.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.160
This entire batch is going to take wear. I will be

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.040
discussing all the project because now, the project section

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.840
is lot in inside your project. If you'll go and see the

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.040
syllabus. So we have mentioned a lot of small and big

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.640
project. And that was the whole idea behind creating this

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.540
batch. So that's you will be able to learn, to build a

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.780
variety of applications maybe with respect to some of the

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.020
framework, Lang chain Lama index Lang graph, or maybe a crew

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.800
AI, you will be able to learn how to build like agents with

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.540
the head. help of the LLM's UDLM's obviously I'm going to

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.960
use inside that we already have a multiple models plus how

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.520
we will be able to do a fine tuning of an existing model,

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.260
maybe a model from an open AI, maybe model which is

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.540
available on a hugging face repository. So all sorts of

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.720
things. So attentively three to four week you can say it is

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.400
it is going to take.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.870
Yeah. So Siam is saying thanks for accepting the request.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.370
Yeah, someone has actually asked me and not someone so

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.190
someone in a group I have seen that people were asking that

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.170
can we try to build a kind of a system so where we can just

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.750
try to write maybe something in English language and then it

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.530
will be able to help me out in terms of querying our

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.230
databases, whatever databases is available and whatever data

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:17.210
is available. Yeah. So like this is something that we are

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.430
going to do. Okay, so let's get started guys. I'm going to

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.210
terminate this project and I'll try to like start building

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.670
this project. I have already built this project in my local.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.690
Local system because obviously like before coming to the

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.970
class, we try to do a lot of like a preparation in terms of

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:39.170
a material. So I have already built it step by step. I'm

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:40.790
going to talk about it here.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.600
Okay, so terminated now. So what we are trying to achieve

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.220
with the help of this project, let me talk about that first

00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:00.400
with the help of my scribbling. So here we are going to

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.440
build a UI interface first of all. So we are going to build

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.980
a UI interface or you can say we are going to see a client

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.460
client or you can say we are going to build a UI interface.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.980
Now this UI interface I'm going to build with the help of a

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.780
streamlint streamlint nothing new. So we have been using the

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.420
streamlint since a very long time. Now with the help of this

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:27.040
UI, what I'm going to do is so I'm going to pass a query

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.220
query

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.540
to my LLMs. Large language model and here so I will be using

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:40.000
basically URI AI yeah, so I'll be using URI AI and I'm going

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.380
to pass a query just like English language just like an

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.500
English language. I'm going to pass a query now what this

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.680
LLM is going to do so this LLM is going to understand my

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.900
query which I have written just in an English language, a

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:58.480
plain English language. Let's suppose I'm a guy who don't

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.460
even understand a sequel. But still. I have a data available

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:06.120
inside my sequel databases or maybe you can try to extend it

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.860
for any kind of other databases any kind of even a no sequel

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.760
databases and that is completely fine you all will be able

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.520
to extend it and believe me after this project you will be

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.660
able to get that concept get that philosophy. So here with

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.940
the help of UI I'm going to write a query with the help of

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.860
English language that's like a show me a data show me a

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:29.400
highest purchasing order show me what was our revenue last

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.560
week. Or maybe a last month all sort of a queries I will be

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.240
able to write just in an English language and like I said

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:39.360
guys I look like just imagine that I'm a person who don't

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.540
even know a sequel right who is not capable enough to write

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:48.120
a sequel query at all and but still I have my data and maybe

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.340
I'm a manager so I have to generate a lot of different

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.260
different kind of a report I have to do a lot of

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:57.220
investigation I have to check the performance and all of

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.140
those performance. All of those. All of those like a

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:03.140
purchase order or all of things which is available inside my

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.020
table into a different different table again not in just one

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.660
single table but maybe into a different different table and

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.560
all those tables are connected with each other. So I have to

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.800
do a query so that I will be able to get my desired output

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:20.640
as a manager. So here once this query will go to by LLM

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.420
which is my URI and where I will be using a GPT model I can

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.400
even try to use a Gemini model a Mistral model maybe a deep

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.200
seek model. Any kind of a LLM I'm going to use. Now this LLM

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:36.260
is going to build a sequel query for me sequel query for me.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:40.300
Now before building a sequel query for me it will try to

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:44.080
fetch a meta information meta information means what so it

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.900
will try to fetch a meta information about a table because

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:53.220
unless and until my LLMs are not aware about a column name

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:57.480
my LLMs are not aware about a table names. It will not be

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.840
able to do anything right it will not be able to do

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.000
anything. So first of all it is going to fetch a meta

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.980
information meta information means a table name a column

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:10.080
name or the entire schema it is going to fetch based on that

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.040
it is going to build a sequel query. So based on the schema

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.020
and based on the language English language query that you

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:20.020
have given it is going to build a sequel query now this is

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:27.780
going to send a sequel query to my sequel database. And then

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:33.280
finally I will be able to see my output output in an UI. So

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:38.140
this is a flow that we are going to follow now. So sequel

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.620
databases wise I have built this query and I have even

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:45.020
experimented as I was doing a recording for my newly

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.300
launched sequel batches. So I have done this testing with my

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:52.320
local DB as well as I have done a testing with a database

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.880
which is available on some cloud platform. Because there are

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.420
many databases. There are many service provider nowadays,

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:02.580
where you will be able to see a managed liquor DB. So I have

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.580
I have done this experimentation with both local as well as

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:09.000
like something which is already hosted on some of the cloud

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.800
environment, maybe into a managed way or maybe into a

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.120
dedicated way and it is going to work simple it is it is

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.900
going to work for any kind of a situation. So this is

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.160
something which we are going to show. So is this flow clear

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.480
guys, the flow that I have written over here, can

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.640
you please cover it and as well I think on our YouTube

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.900
channel. So we have. We have launched a multiple project and

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.640
even inside your dashboard. So we have launched a multiple

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:40.140
project with innate and believe me in it and is not at all

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.380
difficult. It's just a connector that they have given to

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:47.160
you. So drag and drop connect and then bingo. Yeah. So this

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.140
is how innate in works. It's one of the simplest way to

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:53.100
create an agent. But again, you will find some sort of

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.920
limitations with respect to our latest like a enhancement

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.160
that we are able to see in a generative industry. Okay. So

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.600
let's try to build this entire flow. Guys in a step by step

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.540
a step by step a step by step manner. Now the very first

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:09.900
thing right the very first thing that we need over here is a

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.580
database unless and until we don't have a databases, we

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.520
won't be able to do anything. Anything is literally we won't

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.580
be able to do anything. Now database option wise like I said

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:23.400
that I can go ahead with my local database that's completely

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.320
fine. It is going to work or else I can try to go ahead with

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.600
some of the managed database as well. Or maybe if you have a

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:34.640
database hosted on your AWS Azure or GCP platform, you can

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:38.280
also go ahead with that now. So let me show you some of the

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:42.900
sequel like database provider so that you will be able to

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:47.400
get some sort of idea. So here I'll just go to Google and

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:52.400
try to search for PLA and a T planet is scale. So planet is

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.680
scale is one of the provider who is providing you a sequel

00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:00.860
based databases, a self hosted one. Now, apart from that,

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:06.660
there is something called as neon any in E O N neon neon

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.060
database. So they are also providing you basically a neon

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.740
tech. They are also providing you a post this kind of a

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:16.300
databases apart from that. So there is something called as a

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:21.720
super space is you PA super base. So super base is also

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.660
providing you basically a database a sequel like a

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:28.200
databases. There is a render. I believe I have used a render

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.800
even before. So not for database, but for my hosting

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.020
purposes. So where I was deploying some of the application.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.360
So render is one of the platforms of where you can go and

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.980
you can try to commence your databases. There is another

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:44.560
platform called as railway, R A I L W A Y railway. Even you

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:49.580
can try to not engine railway. So railway DB. So railway DB.

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.880
So even you can try to go over here and then you will be

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:56.640
able to commence your data basis or you can just go ahead

00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.640
with us. Azure, AWS or GCP. And over there you will be able

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.260
to commence any kind of a databases that you want that

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.280
that's completely fine. So by launching instances or maybe

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.600
by launching some of the managed services that they used to

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.080
provide. Yeah. Managed services that they used to provide.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:17.500
So okay now so I don't need all of these database by the

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.320
way, I just need only one. Yeah, only one. So where I can

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.160
go, I can try to create a table, I can try to keep all of my

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.120
data and then I will be able to complete this entire flow.

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:32.000
Okay. So I can create my UI. I can try to interact with my

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.220
URI LLMs. I can just connect with my SQL databases and I can

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:40.820
try to query it in an English language. Okay. So here, which

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.860
database I'm going to use, I can use anything like a, it

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:47.040
just one step process. You can just go sign up, log in and

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.580
then work is done. So in my today's class, right in my

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:54.260
today's class, I'm going to use a neon. I can use anything.

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:57.140
Like I said, I can use anything. But yeah, I, if you want, I

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.920
can show you even a liquor. This. I can show you a few

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.620
things at the end of the lecture, that simple login, create

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:04.840
a databases and then work will be done. So here I'm going to

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.800
click on login and once it is going, once I will be going

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.900
for login. So it is going for like a, let's go for a Google

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.980
login by the way. So continue.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:22.600
Okay. So project name, maybe I can try to give as a test, a

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:27.540
Postgres version, AWS Azure, create a project. So just this

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:31.880
much, and you will be able to land into a neon interface.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:36.100
Now, this is the interface that we all need. So are you able

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:39.800
to reach over here, guys, inside a neon, this particular

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.220
interface, I have pinned you the link by the way, so just

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:47.540
try to go through a neon.tech. Now from neon tech, I've just

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.620
pinged you a link for the console, but yeah, so you can try

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.280
to go through a neon tech. I think that will be better.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:01.260
Fine. So just go to a neon tech and then from there, just do

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.800
a sign in. It's completely free. You don't have to go ahead

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.880
and like, you know, add your credit card. That's the reason.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:07.720
So I'm using this one.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:18.130
Fine guys, everyone. So are we able to log in, confirm me

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.290
guys in your chat box. If you are able to log into this

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:21.990
database, yeah.

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:33.950
So anything you can choose, yeah. So Azure, you can choose

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:36.730
AWS, you can choose whatever you want because it's anyhow,

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.390
it's a managed one. So it is not going to ask you for your

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:43.390
Azure AWS credential. So they have their own AWS and Azure

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:47.150
like a setup. So it is going to create a DB on everything.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:50.990
Over there. So don't, don't worry about it. You don't need

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.790
Azure AWS account.

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:07.330
Okay. Everyone done. So ping me guys. Once you are done with

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:10.490
this login inside a neon.

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:25.160
Yeah. Sachin is saying done. Okay. So what about other guys?

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.640
Devanjani is saying Sanjeev, what is the project section?

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.040
Just name anything. Maybe just give a test or something.

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:37.730
That's fine. Yes. Okay. What about other guys?

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.920
Quick, quick. We have

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:48.910
to see the outcome of this amazing project.

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:08.930
I'm waiting for all of you guys. I can see there are so many

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:12.690
people, but yeah, they are not like a responding properly. I

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:12.870
believe.

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:23.370
Okay. So once this one is done, right? So this is to create

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:27.710
a DB, right? Exactly. Yes. I can go ahead and I can try to

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:30.910
create a DB in my local MySQL workbench as well. As you can

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:33.050
see, I have already done that while I was doing this

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:36.630
experimentation. While I was like building this project and

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:40.010
I was even able to kind of with my local, but at the end of

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:43.670
the day, I have to deploy this project. So I need everything

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:47.630
to be on cloud. Yeah. I just need everything on the cloud so

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:49.950
that I will be able to go ahead with the deployment in the

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:52.870
easiest possible way without doing any kind of a local to

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:58.080
global migration. Okay. So once this is done, you will be

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:02.840
able to find out something called as SQL editor. So on your

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.900
left-hand side, bottom. So you will be able to find out

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:09.240
something called as SQL editor over here, guys. So just try

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.920
to click on the SQL editor by the way, and then you will be

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:16.880
able to see this kind of interface. So where you can run

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.880
your like a SQL query. Yeah. So remove everything, whatever

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.600
is available, just remove it. So whatever is available by

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.000
default, remove each and everything. No need to do anything.

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:34.020
Yeah. Okay. Now. So they have just given you a command, uh,

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:36.280
like a create table. If not, it's just a command. It's just

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.780
playing with neon. So we don't want that. We will be

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:43.280
creating our own table as per my own need. Okay. So if this

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.960
is done, right, let's go ahead and let's try to create some

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:52.020
sort of a table for, uh, e-commerce industry. Yeah. So let's

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.920
go ahead and try to create a customer table, a product

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.880
table, a order table, and maybe order item table. So here,

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.840
what I'm going to do is, so I'm going to create my customer

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.980
table. So now this is the customer table that I'm going to

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:09.760
create. As you can see. So, uh, create table C R E A T. I

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.460
have missed create.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.740
So create table and then table name. I believe we all know

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:23.720
how to create a basic simple table, right? So create table

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.340
and then like a table name.

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:32.750
And then these are the column customer ID, name, email,

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:36.590
phone number, city. So these are basically a schema that I'm

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:39.670
trying to give. Good evening. Yes. Good evening. I think you

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:43.850
are late. Uh, so, okay. Now select and run it. Now,

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:50.250
once you are going to run this one, if it is going to show

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:53.290
you that a statement executed successfully, then we are

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:56.890
done. We are good by the way. So now we are able to create a

00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:00.170
customer table over here. You can even go inside this table

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:03.670
section and then you can try to browse your table, the table

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:06.550
that you have created over here. So as of now I have created

00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:09.190
the customer table. So yeah, I'm able to like a browse this

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:12.050
customer table from this table section. Customer table is

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:15.710
visible to me. Now again, go back to a SQL editor. Okay. So

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:19.250
this is one of the table that we have created. I have to

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:23.890
create multiple tables by the way. So I'm going to create a

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:28.370
next table called as product table over here. So product ID,

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:31.430
product name, categories, and price. So let's go ahead and

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:35.270
try to create a product table. So run the command over here

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:38.270
and let me ping you the product table schema. So this is the

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:42.290
table creation things. So product table will be created

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:46.790
automatically in no time. And then I have to create

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:50.050
basically a order table. So order table will be connected to

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:54.110
the customer table with the customer ID. So here I'm going

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:55.350
to create a order table.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:02.700
So order table is done. Now once order table is done, let's

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:07.120
go ahead and try to create a order item table over here. So

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:10.340
run and then create a order item table. So these are the

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:14.000
four table which is connected with each other, right? So I

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.120
have just created this four table. Okay. It is as simple as

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:20.740
that. Maybe I'm not a person who understands all of these

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:23.480
commands, that's completely fine, right? That is the reason

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.540
for, we are going to use our LLMs, right? So table and

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:28.880
everything has been created. Let's suppose your team has

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:32.060
already created a table, and there is a data that is

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:35.460
powering into this particular table on a regular basis. So

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.460
that's completely fine. So I can, I can just like go ahead

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:40.500
and query the table. That's a whole idea. That's a whole

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.080
objective. That's the reason. So we are building this

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:45.660
application. So here is a four table query, guys, all

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:48.020
together. So that's the idea. So customer table, product

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.980
table, order table, and then order item table.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.640
So is it done guys? Is it done? For everyone? Are we able to

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.380
get four tables inside my Neon?

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:14.340
Okay. Easy, right? Very easy. Okay. So once we are able to

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:18.360
create a table, I need data into a table, right? I need data

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.520
into a table. Now they have given you an option in Neon and

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:24.140
even other vendors. So that doesn't matter which vendor or

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:27.160
who we are going to use, but yeah, they are going to give

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:30.220
you an option to add a record. So maybe add a record by

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:33.960
using the UI, maybe add the record in a bulk mode. I'm not

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.340
going to use that. So basically I'm going to run my query

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:39.940
and based on the query, I'm going to insert the record. So

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:44.300
let's try to insert some of the record inside my customer

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.780
table, because this is not my objective, right? I'm just

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.860
trying to prepare my data. That's it. My objective is not to

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:52.320
create a table, not to insert a data. Let's suppose there is

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:55.700
a data which is already available. My objective is to query

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:59.960
that table. By using LLMs, right, because I am not a person

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:03.000
who know how to write a query that that's my problem. And

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.860
there is a bomb of data which is lying inside my table. So

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:10.540
we are trying to solve that problem. So here, just try to

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:13.680
insert some of the record inside your customer table. So

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:16.280
this will insert the record inside a customer table. Then

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:19.880
let's go ahead and try to insert some of the record into our

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:25.020
product table, right inside the product table. So here.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.960
Insert into table, table name, and then I'm going to insert

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:31.440
it. And those who would like to learn a SQL, you guys can

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.320
join my SQL class. So I'm already like, I started, I have

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:39.500
uploading like a lot of SQL videos in your SQL masters

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:42.500
class. So you can join that. So where I'm talking about each

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.820
and everything by doing things in a step by step manner.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:51.140
Then insert into a order item table. So yeah, insert into a

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:55.000
order item table. And then insert into a order item table.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.080
And then insert into a order table.

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:06.240
So data insertion is done in all of these four tables. So I

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.860
have just created four table. And then now I'm able to

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:12.740
insert a data into a four table. Just confirm me guys, once

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:16.120
you are able to create and insert a record inside your

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:16.400
table.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:29.360
So you can execute this entire query even at once. That is

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:29.960
also possible.

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:34.930
Okay. So I'm missing done. What about others?

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:48.020
Now I can run a query. Select a star from CUSTOMER.com.

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:50.800
There is customers just for the cross verification that

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.660
whether I have a data or not. So yeah, I have some data

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:57.860
inside my customer table. I can see that now order table. So

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:01.780
select a star from, I can write maybe just for the

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:09.280
verification ORDERS, orders table. So run and yeah, there is

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.160
some data which is available inside my order table. Now I

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:17.280
can try to even like query my order item table, order item

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:21.120
table. I can try to query and I can try to check just for

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.300
the cross verification that whether I have some data or not.

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:27.220
So yeah, I have some data inside my order item and I can try

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:30.980
to cross check my product table as well. So PRODUCT,

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:36.280
products table and yes, inside my product. So I have some

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:40.060
data. So in all of my table, I have some small, small amount

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:45.040
of data. Okay. So my data preparation is done. I have a SQL

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:50.300
system. So where I have some sort of data. First insert

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:53.240
order table data, yes Sumit. So you have to insert first of

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.540
all, like order table, then only ordered items because both

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:59.140
the tables are connected by order ID or

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:07.340
else you can try to execute everything in one go. So I have

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:10.640
already given you a query for creation and insertion. So you

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.880
can try to like, like execute everything in one go.

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:29.530
If you have to start from a fresh, so in that case you can

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:32.850
try to drop all the table, right? Drop all the tables. This

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:35.050
is the drop command. So you can drop all the table. And then

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:39.670
execute the previous one. If you like got stuck somewhere in

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:44.610
between, okay, so this is done, right? This is done by data

00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:48.050
preparation is done. Now what I'm supposed to do, so I'm

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:50.770
supposed to follow this entire procedure, right? This entire

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:53.870
procedure I'm supposed to follow in a step-by-step manner so

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:57.490
that I will be able to, you know, perform or I will be able

00:27:57.490 --> 00:28:01.350
to build this entire application. Okay. So to do that, let's

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:04.690
try to open up a VS code, right? Let's try to open up a VS

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:08.730
code. And now let's try to build an application. So here go

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:13.590
to file, open folder and the D drive and inside by code, I'm

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:21.770
going to create a folder called as SQL LLM, SQL LLM gen AI

00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:26.190
class. Okay. So SQL LLM gen AI. So this is the folder which

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:29.450
I have created. And inside that I will be writing all the

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:32.910
code in a step-by-step manner. So first of all, guys, you

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:35.830
have to do a couple of things. So you have to basically

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:40.850
create a .environment file, .env file, where you are going

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:43.710
to keep your credentials, your environment credentials, you

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:46.610
are going to keep it over here. So how you are going to keep

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:48.970
it over here and what kind of a credential you have to keep.

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:52.050
So first of all, URI API key you have to keep. And then

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:55.950
second one is a database URI you have to keep so that you

00:28:55.950 --> 00:29:00.270
will be able to connect with the data basis. Now URI API key

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:04.030
from where I will be able to get my URI API key. Okay. So I

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:08.350
can go to Euron, I can go to Euron, and then I can go to

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:12.330
URI. I can go to API and then authentication. And from here

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:17.330
we can try to copy the API token as simple as that. So these

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:19.690
are the two things guys, you have to create, these are the

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:22.150
two variable you have to create inside .environment. So one

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:30.460
is a URI API key, which is required to hit my LLMs. Yeah. So

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:34.840
just copy the key and keep it inside my URI API key. As

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.780
simple as that URI API key variable. And then there is a

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:40.780
second thing which is required called as database URI. Now

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:45.320
see your Streamlint app is going to run maybe now as of now

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:48.240
into a local and then going forward. So you are going to

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:52.300
host your entire Streamlint app on a Streamlint platform or

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.700
maybe on some other cloud platform possible, right? So you

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:57.700
are going to host each and everything on some other cloud

00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:03.960
platform now. So you have to connect with this new data.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:07.540
That you have created just now. Let me close all the other

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:12.240
window, by the way, it's not required now. So yeah, so I

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:15.400
have to connect with this neon unless and until I will not

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:19.080
be able to connect with this neon. How I will be able to

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:22.180
reach out to this data basis, how I will be able to reach

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:24.980
out to this table and data which is available inside this

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:28.700
particular table, practically impossible. So here you will

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.960
be able to find out one option called as dashboard option, a

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.260
very first option itself, right? Very first option is

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:36.880
basically a dashboard option. So you can try to click on

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:39.640
this dashboard, right? You can try to click on the dashboard

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:43.340
and then over here, you will be able to find out a very

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:46.540
first option called as connect or you can even try to go

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:49.700
ahead and just just parallel to your project dashboard, you

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:52.740
will be able to find out an icon called as connect icon. So

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:56.340
click on this connect icon, by the way, yeah, so click on

00:30:56.340 --> 00:31:01.500
this correct icon. And then you will be able to see some of

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.880
the URL over here. Okay. So maybe you can try to copy this

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:09.780
snippet, this URL. Now this URL is required. This URL is

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:13.140
required to connect to you from anywhere, anywhere means

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:15.520
literally anywhere, maybe from a cloud, maybe from a local,

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:20.840
anywhere to this one, to this neon.tech console that I'm

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:23.980
talking about. And inside that the kind of a data basis that

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:26.600
we have, the kind of a database and the kind of a table that

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:31.080
we have. So this URI is required. This URI you will be able

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:34.380
to find out under this connect tab. So copy this one and

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:39.440
then paste the same thing inside this database URI only this

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:42.480
much is required by default, they are giving you this one.

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:45.840
Yeah. So by default, they are giving you this one. So where

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.920
your ID and password is already mentioned, your database is

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.400
already mentioned. So you are not supposed to worry about

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:55.660
anything. Just copy the this particular URI and your work is

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:58.520
going to be done. And my environment file creation will be

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:02.840
done. Don't copy someone's else URI. Otherwise, you will not

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:03.960
be able to find it. You will not be able to interact with

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:08.160
yours in that case. Making sense guys? Are we able to follow

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:12.960
along with this step? Are we able to create a URI API key

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:17.340
and a database URI both? Yes, everyone.

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:30.100
Yeah. So this database URI to connect with your neon, as

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:33.780
simple as that. So doctor is saying yes. What about others

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:37.480
guys? I think guys are slow. Siam, yes. Pawan, yes.

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:42.080
Abdullah, yes. Okay. Wadaraj, Wadi, Raj. Okay. Fine.

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:50.340
Okay. So this is done. And I believe we all are able to

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:53.180
understand that why we are using it. So URI API key so that

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:56.980
I will be able to use any of the LLMs. So we have nine LLMs,

00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:00.060
right? Nine models, uh, access available to all of us as a

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:04.000
part of your own and URI and a database URI to connect with

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.560
my neon databases. Now let's suppose if I'm going to use a

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.840
render, so obviously I'll be using that. You are render URL.

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.500
If I'm going to use railway, I will be using a railway URL.

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:15.920
If I have some databases over a database. Uh, AWS, Azure or

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.540
GCP. So your admin is going to give you even URI for that so

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:21.780
that you will be able to hit your databases. Let's suppose

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:25.620
if I'm going to use me a local host, right? Local host. So

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:31.080
even from here, from a local host, so I will be able to log

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:35.340
in into the port number 33 0 6 and uh, my route and my admin

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:37.460
password. And with the help of that, I will be able to

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:40.920
connect with a local. So it doesn't matter at all. So with

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.560
any system I will be able to connect. Now this is going to

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:46.120
help me out. With respect to connect it to a neon. That's

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:49.940
it. So now close it. Once this is done, close it. Now there

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:53.300
is a next file that we are going to create. And that next

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:58.880
file is going to be, uh, I can go ahead and I can try to

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:03.340
create maybe a configuration file. Uh, I can even avoid that

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:06.840
part, but yeah, that's fine. So here let's go ahead and

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:11.960
let's try to create a config C O N F I G dot PI file config

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.000
dot PI file. Now what we are going to do? We are going to

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.960
keep it here. So nothing, we are going to basically like,

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:21.300
uh, call our, uh, URI and we are going to basically call our

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:28.200
DB. That's it. So here I can write import, import operating

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:33.360
system. And then inside that from dot dev

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:42.120
import load dot environment. So I'm going to read the

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:48.420
environment. Load. Dot. Dev. Updates. So it's like a, uh, a,

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:50.820
a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:51.080
a, a, a, a, a, a, So in the, in the, in the name of the API,

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:56.220
the URI API key is equals to operating system dot get, get,

00:34:56.220 --> 00:35:00.760
get, get, get, get, get, get Envy. So get Envy. And then

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:06.840
it's a same name URI API key. I'll copy here. So it is going

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:09.940
to access URI API key by the way, from my dot environment

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:20.480
file, and then URI API, URI API. Uh. So URI API URL, so what

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:26.180
is my URI API URL by the way? So I can go to my URI and what

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:32.020
is my API URL by the way, end point. So my end point is

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:36.080
going to be this one. So this chat completion, I can try to

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:40.200
copy it here. I think we have been using it like almost

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.680
everywhere. So it's the same thing. We are not talking about

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:43.800
something different over here.

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:56.270
So this is my URI end point for my chat completion. So URI

00:35:56.270 --> 00:36:01.750
URL, model name I can try to pass. So MODEL model underscore

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:05.530
name as we know that URI provides multiple models. So it's

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:08.970
my choice which model I am going to use. Now how to access

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:11.930
that particular part? So to access that part, you can go

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:16.130
ahead with model, available models. And now you can choose

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:18.990
any model that you want. So let's suppose I am going ahead

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:22.770
with GPT 4.1 nano. I can copy this particular ID. If I am

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:25.470
going through a mini, I can copy this ID. If I am going

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:28.510
through a flash, I can copy this ID. So it depends. Whatever

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:31.670
model I want, I can try to use all of these model with the

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:36.410
single end point. So GPT 4.1 nano model name is this one. So

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:40.290
this is the model I am going to use. DATABASE, basically

00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:44.930
DATABASE underscore URI. URI. So DATABASE URI is already

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:47.750
available inside my .env, I'll just have to read it. So

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:52.450
operating system dot get environment and then read it from

00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:58.510
the .env file. So here a DATABASE URI, I'll try to read it

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:03.210
inside my configuration file. It's not required to create a

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:05.370
configuration file. I'm just creating it so that we can

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:08.170
achieve a modularity. That's it. Otherwise it's not even

00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:10.910
required. I can write it down inside a main.py file itself.

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:15.190
So my config.py file is ready. So now here is a code for

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:16.370
config.py file.

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:24.010
Done guys. Are we okay with a config.py file everyone?

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:27.130
Environment file then config file.

00:37:54.850 --> 00:38:03.930
Hmm. Okay. Now, so configuration file is ready. Close it

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:06.810
now. So if configuration file is ready, so now configuration

00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:10.050
file wise we were just trying to read something from a .env

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:12.090
file. That's it. This is something that we were trying to

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:16.850
do. Now. Our main code will go inside a file called as

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:23.210
utils, utils.py. So this is the place where our main code

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:28.650
will enter. Our main code is going to go now here. So we are

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:32.870
going to import a couple of things. So first of all, we are

00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:39.290
going to import, import a request, import request. Now

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:44.070
second thing is so here. I have to do a import of SQL.

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:49.250
Alchemy. A L C H E M Y. I'll tell you why we are importing a

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:55.670
SQL alchemy, SQL, L C H E M Y SQL alchemy, and then try to

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:58.710
import couple of things. So try to import a text, try to

00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:06.970
import a meta data. Yeah. So meta data, M capital M E T A D

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:12.310
H T A meta data. So from a SQL alchemy. So we have to import

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:15.530
this one. Yeah. And then just try to call your configuration

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:19.990
file that you have already created. So from config, just try

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:26.030
to import what? So URI API key, URI URL, and then like a

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:30.010
model name, you can try to copy over here. So these are the

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:33.210
things that guys that you have to copy. So I'm copying this

00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:40.000
entire things from my config file, by the way. So is it done

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.540
inside my utils?

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:56.160
Okay. So inside my utils, what I'm supposed to create. So

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:59.880
I'm supposed to create three functions. The very first

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:04.740
function, which is going to create a meta information, a

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:07.420
complete meta data. Now, what does the meaning of this meta

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:11.700
information? So we have already created a table, right? So

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:16.580
we have a table over here, close and then SQL editor. And we

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:19.320
have already created a table over here, right? Table over

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:22.920
here. Now, every table is having some sort of a columns. So

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:25.440
every table is having a table name, and then every table is

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:29.220
having a column name and its data type. Column name is data

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:32.500
type, column name is data type plus. So whether we have a

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:36.720
primary key or foreign key or any other constraint. So all

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:39.740
of these things is mentioned inside my table meta

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:46.500
information, right? So before asking my LLM to write a

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:50.800
query. My LLM would like to write a query. To understand the

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:55.660
meta information or detail about a table schema, that what

00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:58.840
was a table name? What was a column name? What was a data

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:02.040
type? Which one is a primary key? Which one is a foreign

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:05.040
key? So whether your table is counted in one to one, one to

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:09.140
many, many to one or in a many to many way as a like a model

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:13.960
wise. So all of these information will be required for my

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.940
LLMs unless and until my LLMs is not having those

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:20.760
information. It will. It will not be able to write a proper

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:24.800
query and that is the reason. So I have to write a function.

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:27.860
So a very simple, a straightforward function I have to

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:31.880
write. So which will try to hit my databases and it will be

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:35.700
able to generate all the meta information means information

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:39.360
about the schema or the table that we have already created.

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:44.820
Yeah. So Siam is saying DDL obviously. Yeah. So, and it's

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:48.560
obviously a relationship in between. So we have to write

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:52.380
that particular. Function. And this is where I'm going to

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:56.640
use a SQL alchemy. So SQL alchemy is a library. So which is

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:59.840
a generalized one, uh, where, uh, whether you are connected

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:03.320
with the my SQL or MS SQL, or maybe with respect to any

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:06.740
other databases, a SQL based databases, PostgreSQL, it is

00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:09.020
going to help me out in terms of like, you know, going

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:12.200
through those, uh, like a tables and extracting a meta

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.920
information out of those, uh, tables. And this is where I'm

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:20.860
going to use, uh, this one. Okay. So here is a function

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:27.440
comes into a picture, get DB schema. Now here we are not

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:31.240
doing much as you can see. So get DB schema. We are just

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:34.740
going to pass a engine. So wherever we are going to call it.

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:38.020
So we are just going to pass an engine engine means the URL,

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:41.800
right? The URL we are going to pass, and then it is going to

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:46.080
call a metadata from a SQL alchemy metadata object and meta

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.620
dot reflect bind the engine. It means. Yeah. So whatever

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:52.380
databases that you are going to use, the URI that you are

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:54.820
going to pass URI, we have already mentioned over here,

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:57.940
right? The URI that you are going to pass as an engine, that

00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:00.520
is a meaning of an engine basically over here, right? So

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.980
whether it's a, my SQL engine, MS SQL engine, or maybe a

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:08.760
PostgreSQL engine, or maybe a DB to engine oracle engine. So

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:11.460
whatever engine that you want, so you can try to pass those

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:16.920
engines and then it is going to call meta dot tables, dot

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:21.320
values. Okay. So meta table values, it is going to extract

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:25.560
it and it is going to create a schema as you can see, right?

00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:28.420
It is going to create a schema and it is going to keep all

00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:31.300
this schema inside this particular variable. So ultimately

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:35.140
it is going to return the schema, the schema of the table.

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.680
So for whatever engine that you are going to pass, it is

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:42.040
going to return that particular part. So this get the DB

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:45.560
schema is done and why we are doing it. I believe we all are

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:50.340
aware about it. Okay. Because my LLM needs a structure of

00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:53.200
the table, my LLM needs the information about that

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:57.140
particular table. Okay. Now, once this part is done, right?

00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:00.440
Once this part is done, once I'm aware about the table

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:04.700
schema or the table structure, then what is next, right?

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:07.760
What is next that I'm supposed to do? I'm supposed to

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:11.900
perform. So the next operation that I'm going to perform is

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:16.280
build a query. Yeah. Build a query. So let's suppose someone

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:19.560
is going to pass some sort of a text, some sort of a prompt,

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:22.060
right? Text means a prompt. Let's suppose you are going to

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.660
pass a prompt that show me a data from this particular

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:27.700
table. So which day I was able to do a more number of sales,

00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:30.940
or maybe like I can try to ask a question that, uh, which

00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:34.480
was the item, which is a top selling item, right? So just go

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:37.620
and search into my data. So this are the prompt, this kind

00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:40.500
of a prompt that you are going to give. And once you are

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:44.060
going to give a prompt now that prompt should pass through.

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:47.040
Along with my meta information. So that's prompt should pass

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:51.180
through my model, LLM models basically, right? So here I'm

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:56.820
supposed to call my URI LLM, right? URI LLM. Now for URI LLM

00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:59.880
code is very standard, right? Code is pretty much standard,

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.140
uh, that we have already created. So you will be able to get

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:07.220
this piece of a code even from like, uh, this one, uh, from,

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:11.740
uh, your own portal. Now let me, uh, call you that. So we

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:14.580
are trying to pass a URI API key. As you can see. And then

00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:17.280
we are trying to pass a model name. So model name, URI API

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:19.740
key, everything is coming from my configuration. I have just

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:22.680
configured it temperature. You can increase or decrease if

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:25.000
you are going to decrease it. So it will try to reduce the

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.100
randomness. If you're going to increase it, it is going to

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:30.060
be more creative. Maximum number of token. You can try to

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:33.400
limit, and then it is going to give you the response. Yeah,

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:35.140
it is going to give you the response. So this is the

00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:37.720
separate things that I have created. So I'm going to pass

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:40.540
the prompt and then it is going to act accordingly. So once

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:44.840
I'm going to pass the prompt. Okay. So this is this. So this

00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:48.300
is basically a URI. And then the third one is, third

00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:51.240
function, isolated function that I need is basically a

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:56.200
execute SQL. So once you will be having a query, right?

00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:59.080
Let's suppose LLM, URI is going to give a query by

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:05.220
understanding your input, your prompt and by taking care of

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:08.600
a schema, which is already available. I just have to do

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:10.960
what? I have to execute the query because at the end of the

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:15.120
day, uh, on other side, if I'll talk about the SQL, if I'll

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:19.300
talk about the SQL system, uh, yeah, so this SQL system

00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:23.960
understands its own format, right? Which is a SQL format. So

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:26.740
at the end of the day, you can just try to pass a SQL. It is

00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:29.220
going to return you the data. Nothing much, right? Nothing

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:32.400
much. The old task will be done or whole things will be done

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:35.480
by my LLM at the end of the day. So here, once I will be

00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:38.300
able to build the query engine is already ready with me. I

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:42.180
have my URL, right? So connect and connection.execute. Just

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:44.740
the way you execute. Any kind of a query from a programming

00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:47.280
language. So I'm just trying to call connection.execute,

00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:50.320
pass the query, and then it is going to fetch the result is

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:53.560
going to give you the result simple. So these are the three

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:56.780
functions are separate, separate independent function. I

00:46:56.780 --> 00:47:01.300
have to keep it inside my utils.py file, which I'm going to

00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:05.360
use it eventually. Is it making sense guys? Yeah. All three

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:10.240
functions. So one for getting a meta information, one for

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:13.280
basically like a based on the prompt, it is going to like a

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:16.440
create my query, and then we are going to pass a query and

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:22.000
it is going to give me the final output. Yes, everyone. Now

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.440
all these things are not connected as of now, obviously this

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:27.100
is just a independent function that we have created, but

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:28.620
yeah, it's, it's not connected so far.

00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:39.050
Okay. Fine. Everyone.

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:51.260
Okay. So if this is done, close it now. Close everything.

00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:57.000
Yeah. Close everything. Now try to create a main file. main

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.780
.py. Right. So where I'm going to keep my streamlint basic

00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:06.520
application with the basic UI interface, where someone can

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:10.140
come and prompt it from something. And then like whatever

00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:12.540
result I will be able to get, I should showcase those

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:15.600
results into a beautiful tabular format. This is something

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:20.260
that we are going to do it inside a streamlint basically. So

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:24.340
here, first of all, I have to do a import, import of what?

00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:28.440
So first of all, import of a streamlint. A SQL alchemy,

00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:32.500
create engine configuration, database URL, and from utils,

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:35.600
DB schema, call URI, these three functions that we have

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:39.240
created just now. So these are the import that we have to do

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:43.680
from a streamlint into a main.py file. So just create main

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:48.220
.py file and then try to do a import. Now once you are able

00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:52.940
to do a import, once you are able to do a import, then maybe

00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:57.880
I can try to create a very simple layout. Okay. So I can

00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:59.060
create a very simple layout inside my streamlint. So PID

00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:04.460
configuration, title, and then give like a input area. So

00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:09.240
where user can try to ask their question. So control S. And

00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:14.020
then now, so I think this we have been doing since a very,

00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:16.660
very long time with respect to streamlint app. So I don't

00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:20.020
think that it's required the explanation. Now here what I

00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:23.780
can do is that I can try to come here, I can try to call a

00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:27.160
streamlint just for the testing purpose. S-T-R-E-M-L-I-T

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:35.650
streamlint run and run what? So main.py file. Now I'm able

00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:39.770
to see this particular error saying that that .dev is not

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:45.070
found. Yeah. So .dev environment is not found. Okay. Let's

00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:48.810
do one thing. Let's create a requirement.txt and let's keep

00:49:48.810 --> 00:49:52.370
all the requirement in one single place. R-E-Q-U-I-R-E-M-N-T

00:49:52.370 --> 00:49:56.270
-S requirements.txt. Let's keep all the requirement in one

00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:58.770
single place. Okay. So these are the things that we are

00:49:58.770 --> 00:50:01.690
going to use. Let me bring you this part as well.

00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:09.550
So these are the things, again, make sure that your

00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:12.890
requirement.txt file name should be like a requirements R-E

00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:19.930
-Q-U-I-R-E-M-N-T-S requirements and terminate my run, clean

00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:27.550
it and then install the requirement.txt file. So pip install

00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:33.390
hyphen R requirements.txt. Install everything. Okay. So I

00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:37.770
have installed each and everything. That's great. Now let's

00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:42.330
try to run it once again, CLS, clean it and still it run

00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:43.390
main.py file.

00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:56.820
Still it is telling me that model not found .dev. I have

00:50:56.820 --> 00:51:01.880
done the installation, but still there is a issue with this.

00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:06.460
Okay. Not an issue. I can try to.

00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:16.650
Okay. Fine guys, let's do it in a cleaner way. So just do

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:20.550
CLS and let's go ahead and create a new environment then. So

00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:22.430
with the help of conda, I can create a new environment or

00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:25.610
even with the help of like a simple Python command, I can

00:51:25.610 --> 00:51:27.690
try to create the new environment. So I'm going to write up

00:51:27.690 --> 00:51:33.230
over here dot environment, not dot dev. Okay. Sorry. This

00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:39.570
was the mistake I was making. Config. Oh, sorry, sorry,

00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:45.230
sorry. That was the issue. Dot env. Yeah, I was just going

00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:51.610
along with the flow. Otherwise, anyhow, sooner or later, no

00:51:54.360 --> 00:52:02.360
module name utils, U-T-I-L-S, spelling mistake. I can make

00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:09.380
changes here itself. So now this one is also correct. Now

00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:13.880
SQL power data retrieval assistant. And here. So it is going

00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:17.760
to allow me to ask any question. So ask your question in any

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:21.160
language. So this was a very simple UI that I have created.

00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:24.600
So where I will be able to pass my prompt, I will be able to

00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:29.100
pass my query. Simple. Okay. Fine. So till this point,

00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:33.000
things are working perfectly fine. I have not done any kind

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.400
of a connectivity so far. So everything is like isolated and

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:39.880
everything is like independent of each other. So now I will

00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:43.520
start doing a connectivity with each and everything. Yeah.

00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:48.640
So here, once you are going to pass any kind of a query,

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:52.220
actual task is going to start from here, right? As per the

00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:55.380
design that I have given to you. So the actual task is going

00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:58.620
to start from where your streamlined UI client, you are

00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:02.100
going to pass any kind of a query in an English language, by

00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:06.100
the way, now it is supposed to hit LLMs. LLM is supposed to

00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:09.260
get a meta information, a search into a SQL DB after

00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:12.700
building our queries, and then give you the output. So now

00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:17.000
the real stuff is going to start once you are going to pass,

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:22.780
right? Once you are going to pass the query in your English

00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:25.320
language, or once you are going to prompt it. So here your

00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:28.980
prompt will come here, your prompt will come, right? And

00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:34.440
then we are going to write a code, a very simple code,

00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:39.600
right? Once I will be able to get a prompt. So this is the

00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:41.840
whole code guys. Let me ping you.

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:50.660
Okay. So this is the whole code. So once I'm able to get a

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:54.920
query, right? Once I'm able to get a query from a UI, then

00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:57.760
I'm trying to check. So if there is a query means if it is

00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:01.860
true, this is what it means, right? So if this is true, do

00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:06.080
one thing, create an engine. So how engine will be created?

00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:08.980
Like I told you, so you don't have to do anything to create

00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:11.440
an engine, right? So create engine is a function which is

00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:14.100
available inside the SQL alchemy now. So you don't have to

00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:16.160
do anything to create the engine. So basically you have to

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:20.200
just pass a database UI. It doesn't matter which database

00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:22.540
you are using. So maybe you are using something in local,

00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:25.200
maybe you are using a MySQL, maybe you are using a MS SQL,

00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:27.600
maybe you are using a Oracle, maybe you are using a DB2,

00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:30.900
maybe you are using a Postgres. All of these are basically

00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:34.940
our variants of a SQL DB itself means a different, different

00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:37.880
engine or different, different companies have created as per

00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:39.880
their own need and they're selling it, right? They're

00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:42.480
selling that services since a very, very long time, since

00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:45.980
like many decades, I would say, right? Not a long time, many

00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:50.600
decades. So maybe 30, 40 years. Some companies. So, but

00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:53.100
yeah, underneath it's, it's the same thing. So SQL alchemy

00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:56.620
is going to help you out to just like a, you know, call one

00:54:56.620 --> 00:54:59.520
single create engine, pass your URI, it will be able to

00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:02.260
understand the rest of the things that what kind of a DB you

00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:05.600
are dealing with. So this URI is going to create an engine.

00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:08.000
Now this is going to help me out to connect basically

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.560
because I'm passing URI. So my system knows that where that

00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:16.680
database is, by the way, then once I'm going to like, you

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:21.040
know, uh. Get the engine. So I'm calling get DB schema. And

00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:23.480
if you remember this get DB schema, we have written inside

00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:27.660
utils file, right? So just, it will take the URI and then it

00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:30.680
will try to fetch what a meta information, the schema about

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:34.280
the table. It is going to fetch. Okay. Fine. So first of

00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:37.240
all, we are trying to connect. This line is going to

00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:40.420
connect. The second line is going to fetch the schema

00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:45.120
because we need a schema at the end of the day. Now, once I

00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:49.060
will be able to get a schema. Okay. Once I will be able to

00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:56.340
get a schema. So I have to pass the schema and a prompt to

00:55:56.340 --> 00:56:02.100
whom? So I have to pass my schema and a prompt to my LLM

00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:07.380
basically, right? So I have to pass my schema and like a

00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:12.240
query, a prompt to my LLMs so that, uh, basically like, uh,

00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:16.880
you know, my LLMs will be able to create a query. SQL query

00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:22.480
accordingly. Agree everyone this flow, I believe this is

00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:25.420
what I have discussed, right? So once you are able to get a

00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:28.600
query, so basically we have to get a meta information and

00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:31.020
then we have to pass this entire, both the combined

00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:33.980
information, uh, meta information means a schema information

00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:39.100
and your prompt, right? Combine it and pass it to my URI AI.

00:56:41.310 --> 00:56:45.250
Yes, everyone. So here, uh, I have just like a, for this

00:56:45.250 --> 00:56:47.550
particular project. So I have created a prompt template. Dot

00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:51.250
TXT file, by the way, let me create a prompt template dot

00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:54.390
TXT file. I'm just trying to keep my prompt separately. It's

00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:58.570
not mandatory, uh, to keep your prompt separately. So inside

00:56:58.570 --> 00:57:02.150
this prompt, uh, inside this prompt, I'm just trying to say

00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:07.210
that you are an intelligent, just try to create a prompt dot

00:57:07.210 --> 00:57:10.210
TXT. So you are intelligent SQL assistance, translate the

00:57:10.210 --> 00:57:13.170
following natural language query into a SQL query. This is

00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:16.170
what I have written. And then I'm providing a schema. And

00:57:16.170 --> 00:57:17.970
then I'm providing a question. This is a question that you

00:57:17.970 --> 00:57:21.370
will be able to get from the user both, right? So schema

00:57:21.370 --> 00:57:24.870
meta information and a question. So this is going to build

00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:28.270
one single prompt for me. I'm just trying to convert

00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:30.990
everything into one single prompt. So this is what I have

00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:34.570
written like a prompt template dot TXT. Yeah, this is what I

00:57:34.570 --> 00:57:37.070
have written. So I'm just trying to read my prompt template

00:57:37.070 --> 00:57:40.090
dot TXT as you can see, right? So F dot read file dot read

00:57:40.090 --> 00:57:44.070
template and template dot format. So I'm trying to combine

00:57:44.070 --> 00:57:46.990
this schema and then like, I'm trying to pass basically like

00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:49.090
a, inside the template format. So I'm trying to provide the

00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:52.210
schema, a schema that I'm able to get from here, get DB

00:57:52.210 --> 00:57:54.930
schema and then question, question, which I'm able to get

00:57:54.930 --> 00:57:58.630
from the user input, user input. And this is going to my

00:57:58.630 --> 00:58:01.610
whole prompt because my URI is going to take what only a

00:58:01.610 --> 00:58:04.670
prompt, right? So I have just created the prompt prompt,

00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:07.030
which is holding a schema as well as which is holding the

00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:09.490
question, question that I'm getting from the user and a

00:58:09.490 --> 00:58:12.770
schema that I'm getting from the database. Simple. So this

00:58:12.770 --> 00:58:16.050
is going to my prompt, right? Now. Once. Once I will be able

00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:20.330
to get this prompt, I'm going to call my URI LLM. And now

00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:25.030
this URI LLM is going to return me what a SQL query. Yeah. A

00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:28.570
SQL query URI is going to return. Now once I will be able to

00:58:28.570 --> 00:58:31.770
get a SQL query, I'm showing you that SQL query in your UI.

00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:35.390
This is what I have written systemly.code show the query. So

00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:38.850
whatever SQL query that we have received. So so that query

00:58:38.850 --> 00:58:42.590
to you as well, right? And then same SQL query I'm passing

00:58:42.590 --> 00:58:46.710
to my SQL execute SQL. Uh, which function, which is already

00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:50.510
available inside my execute SQL here, utils file. Yeah. So

00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:52.870
it is taking engine. Engine means URL, by the way, database

00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:55.870
URL, and then query I'm trying to fire. So query, uh, which

00:58:55.870 --> 00:58:59.490
I have received from my LLMs. Yeah. And then it is going to

00:58:59.490 --> 00:59:02.210
give you the result and the columns it is trying to give

00:59:02.210 --> 00:59:05.310
you. I'm just trying to show you all of those information in

00:59:05.310 --> 00:59:09.610
a proper tabular data frame format. That's it. Yeah. Proper

00:59:09.610 --> 00:59:12.250
table, a data fit format. I'm trying to show you each and

00:59:12.250 --> 00:59:16.170
everything. Okay. So now this project looks like that it's,

00:59:16.170 --> 00:59:19.490
it's working well, right? Uh, like everything looks fine so

00:59:19.490 --> 00:59:21.930
far, if there will be an error, we'll try to fix it

00:59:21.930 --> 00:59:24.650
obviously. But yeah, so I believe we all are able to

00:59:24.650 --> 00:59:28.130
understand this entire, uh, operation that, that we have

00:59:28.130 --> 00:59:34.070
done. Now let's go ahead and try to execute my main.py file

00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:38.830
once again. So streamlit run main.py file now execute it.

00:59:39.310 --> 00:59:44.030
Now this is the UI interface, which I'm able to get. Yeah. I

00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:50.630
will try to ask a question that show me, show me order

00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:51.650
tables.

01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:04.230
So it's, it's running. Yeah. And then it has created a

01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:07.450
query, basically select a start from orders. And now this

01:00:07.450 --> 01:00:10.890
query will go inside my DB and this was the data which I

01:00:10.890 --> 01:00:14.150
have inserted into my orders table. Uh, it is, it is trying

01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:17.370
to like, uh, uh, show it to me. I can try to like, uh, even

01:00:17.370 --> 01:00:22.050
fetch that show me customer. Or maybe you can run it. Maybe

01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:24.110
you can write in some different language as well. The way

01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:26.770
you write your own English, maybe you can try to like, uh,

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:28.350
uh, I did in that way.

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:35.260
Okay. So customer table, it is trying to show me now I can

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:40.760
just ask a question that, uh, who was a customer who have

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:53.720
purchased highest value item and what was the, and, and what

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:56.000
was the, what was the, uh, what was the, what is the value

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.440
of it? See, I've just like, I'm giving a plain English

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:02.760
language. I don't even like, uh, properly, uh, uh, giving,

01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:05.920
uh, something, you know, a properly grammatical order, but

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:10.320
still it is working really very hard to build a query for

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:13.400
me. My LLM is working literally very hard. Uh, it is trying

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:17.160
to understand the schema. It is trying to understand me by

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:19.720
the way. And then based on that, it is trying to like, uh,

01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:20.500
do something for me.

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:26.320
So I'm just asking the question. Who was the customer who

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:28.560
had purchased the highest value item? and what was the value

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:33.800
of it and guys see the kind of query it has generated is it

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:40.270
not complex is it not a nested query or it's like a query

01:01:40.270 --> 01:01:45.330
under a query or sub query that we that it has produced now

01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:48.210
just tell me one and i'm able to get it right so see what

01:01:48.210 --> 01:01:50.270
was my question who was the customer who have purchased the

01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:53.250
highest value item so alias johnson was the customer right

01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:56.790
and i have just asked that uh purchase highest value item

01:01:56.790 --> 01:01:59.030
and what was the value of that item so value of the highest

01:01:59.030 --> 01:02:02.730
value item was basically this 1200 yeah so this was the

01:02:02.730 --> 01:02:05.070
customer name this was the customer id and this was the

01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:09.130
highest value item now just tell me one thing if i would

01:02:09.130 --> 01:02:12.510
have asked you the same question how much time you would

01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:15.430
have taken to write down this query yeah

01:02:18.730 --> 01:02:19.730
so

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:32.160
is this is not amazing guys so do we need to know even a

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:33.660
sequel now yeah

01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:43.650
do we need to know a sequel now minimum 50 20 minutes a 15

01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:46.510
-20 minute format for export because export will go and try

01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:48.830
to understand the schema first right if i'll go and ask you

01:02:48.830 --> 01:02:51.330
a question directly in an interview i'll tell you that okay

01:02:51.330 --> 01:02:55.030
let's take this four table and then write this query i think

01:02:55.030 --> 01:02:58.410
even export is going to take like a 15 20 minute is the

01:02:58.410 --> 01:03:02.230
minimum right because even expert as a human you have to

01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:04.670
understand those schemas right when

01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:09.000
you're saying sorry i joined after a long time what to the

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.040
result same query be consistent 100 every time will the

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:14.520
result of the same query will consist of 100 every time

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:17.900
exactly ranjit so almost it is going to be consistent and we

01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:22.000
can try to make it even more robust we can try to even make

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.820
it there is a way there is a way there is a memory that we

01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:26.700
can try to build there is a catching that we can try to

01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:30.260
build over there it is going to be consistent all the time

01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:31.200
yeah

01:03:34.690 --> 01:03:37.610
now just tell me guys what i should ask see i have four

01:03:37.610 --> 01:03:40.730
table right i think you all also have four tables okay so

01:03:40.730 --> 01:03:47.530
maybe i'm going to ask that uh give me a revenue r-e-v-n-u-e

01:03:47.530 --> 01:03:48.890
revenue

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:52.500
report

01:03:55.390 --> 01:03:56.490
yeah okay so let me tell you that the data that is being

01:03:56.490 --> 01:03:56.510
traded over here for

01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:05.350
this year i think year was not mentioned okay no there was

01:04:05.350 --> 01:04:11.130
okay here was mentioned okay so for this year right so for

01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:15.350
this year uh 2025 it is trying to like uh ask and as you can

01:04:15.350 --> 01:04:19.690
see my data so there was a data order item which was still

01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:24.550
2024 so i can so query executors would no data return so

01:04:24.550 --> 01:04:27.450
there is nothing uh which is for this year so for

01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:34.550
If you look into your data, so we don't have actually data

01:04:34.550 --> 01:04:38.590
for 2025. So basically we have a record for 2024. If you'll

01:04:38.590 --> 01:04:42.190
check your order table, order table data insertion, right?

01:04:42.930 --> 01:04:46.630
So now, now I'm asking for like a 2024 and now I have a

01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:50.390
result, right? So total revenue was 2750 and year was 2024

01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:56.470
because for 2024, I had a data inside of my table. Yeah. And

01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:59.030
it is, it is able to like filter the data for me.

01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:06.820
Does this work for the single database or we can do a

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:10.420
multiple database in a single chat bot. You can do in a

01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:14.440
finite number of a database configuration in a single chat

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:15.260
bot itself.

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:22.300
Yeah. Means you can just connect just with this application

01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:25.360
and connect your whole organizations. There is a way for

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:25.560
that.

01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:32.360
If user is using mobile and ask the same question. Okay. So

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:35.660
yeah. So basically speech to text, right? So speech to text.

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:39.480
There are like a lot of, uh, even. Like a. Uh, library,

01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:42.140
which is already available. So just try to go ahead and try

01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:44.840
to like, uh, use some speech to text library. It will be

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:47.040
able to, and again, there is an API, which is available from

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:49.640
a Google nowadays. But yeah, if you don't want to like a pay

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:52.940
for the API, that's completely fine. Just go ahead with the

01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:56.340
speech to text local after like doing the installation

01:05:56.340 --> 01:05:57.540
survey,

01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:13.030
integrate a visualization and a virtualization and a

01:06:13.030 --> 01:06:15.570
virtualization and the graphy. Yeah.

01:06:18.590 --> 01:06:21.770
So is it, is it not amazing guys, is it not amazing that,

01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:24.870
that we are able to see that, that how powerful the LLM is

01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:28.730
and, uh, people like us who have been writing a sequel kind

01:06:28.730 --> 01:06:32.930
of a query since our ages, right? Since our beginning of the

01:06:32.930 --> 01:06:36.550
IT infrastructure, because obviously without database, no IT

01:06:36.550 --> 01:06:39.910
infrastructure, you can even plan. You can not even plan for

01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:43.710
it about the planning. You can't even go and imagine any IT

01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:46.510
infrastructure without a databases, whether it's a SQL DB,

01:06:46.610 --> 01:06:49.870
whether it's a no SQL databases or maybe some other kind of

01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:53.210
a database, but without DB, there is nothing. Okay. Right.

01:06:53.370 --> 01:06:55.950
None of the application that you are able to see today, you

01:06:55.950 --> 01:06:59.810
will be able to use it. But yeah. So those are like kind of

01:06:59.810 --> 01:07:03.010
a query that we have been writing. Now my LLM is able to

01:07:03.010 --> 01:07:06.510
write it down in a better way, in a fastest way. Can we add,

01:07:06.590 --> 01:07:09.550
you can add anything, believe me, you can add anything. The

01:07:09.550 --> 01:07:13.490
only thing is that I'm able to, the main part is this one,

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:17.130
this one, even my LLM can generate a query. After that, if I

01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:20.310
have to build up your dashboard without even using a power

01:07:20.310 --> 01:07:23.550
BI table, a dashboard, which will be able to populate. It's

01:07:23.550 --> 01:07:26.950
data on a particular interval, maybe in every one hour, two

01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:29.970
hour, every fraction of second, or maybe every day I can do

01:07:29.970 --> 01:07:32.770
that as well. If I have to give a voice command because

01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:35.890
voice command means what, and limit you are trying to say

01:07:35.890 --> 01:07:38.630
this one, right? Speech to text. So this, this is basically

01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:42.830
a text, so I can use any speech to text library, right? And

01:07:42.830 --> 01:07:45.670
then I will be able to do that. If I have to do any kind of

01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:52.070
reporting again, not a big deal. Yeah. This project will

01:07:52.070 --> 01:07:54.950
definitely help. So. So this is just a core, which I'm

01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:58.830
teaching you now be around the score. Now you can go ahead

01:07:58.830 --> 01:08:03.690
and build anything that you want, right? Don't even need a

01:08:03.690 --> 01:08:06.790
part. Don't even have to learn a power BI, right? Because

01:08:06.790 --> 01:08:09.970
again, when we try to do something in a power BI or maybe a

01:08:09.970 --> 01:08:13.150
table or maybe in any other dashboarding tool, what we are

01:08:13.150 --> 01:08:17.290
trying to do behind the scene, there is a data model that we

01:08:17.290 --> 01:08:19.890
have built in a power BI or table or any kind of a

01:08:19.890 --> 01:08:22.710
visualization or dashboarding tool. So what we try to do

01:08:22.710 --> 01:08:25.950
behind the scene, we just try to build a data model. Now

01:08:25.950 --> 01:08:28.110
what is the data model? It's nothing but a connection

01:08:28.110 --> 01:08:33.530
between the tables, right? And then we try to like a build a

01:08:33.530 --> 01:08:35.790
dashboard by using a different, different kind of a plots

01:08:35.790 --> 01:08:40.030
and graphs and everything, right? And ultimately like you

01:08:40.030 --> 01:08:42.670
are hitting the data model and data model is trying to query

01:08:42.670 --> 01:08:46.350
some of the other databases or data sources with which it is

01:08:46.350 --> 01:08:51.990
connected. Now the score part is solved. Okay. I can, I can

01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.830
just build it here itself.

01:08:55.650 --> 01:08:59.070
Yeah. And again, if I'll talk about this domain, Sanjeev is

01:08:59.070 --> 01:09:01.090
saying it's amazing use case and infinite across the

01:09:01.090 --> 01:09:04.850
different, not a different sector, all sectors, just name

01:09:04.850 --> 01:09:08.550
any sector wherever you are using IT infrastructure, right?

01:09:08.610 --> 01:09:09.930
All sectors, simple.

01:09:14.710 --> 01:09:18.110
They may be use a whisper LLM API for a speech to text. I

01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:22.810
don't have to go ahead and use like a, you know, a whisper,

01:09:23.110 --> 01:09:27.390
maybe I can, if you have asked. So in a class itself, maybe

01:09:27.390 --> 01:09:34.830
I can try to show you something. Let me do that to take

01:09:34.830 --> 01:09:37.210
input through speech.

01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:50.640
Okay. So someone is asking me, I'll show you a step by step

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:54.100
guys. So I'll like, because of the power of AI, I can do

01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:56.420
something even in like a live class itself.

01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:13.540
Okay. So main.py file, let me terminate the app. Maybe I can

01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:19.320
do some experimentation. Okay. So someone is asking me that,

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:21.460
can we try to give a voice command? Let me build something

01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:26.440
for you because of AI, I just need an imagination because

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:30.640
code anyhow AI can write it. Right. So let me show you

01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:36.280
something. This one start to speak. Okay. So then stream

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:41.600
lint and then run my app dot, this is how fast it is to

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:44.520
build a application. So no model name is speech

01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:54.200
organization. Okay. So a speech organization, SR, now pip

01:10:54.200 --> 01:11:03.100
install, sorry, CLS, pip install speech

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:11.220
organization. Okay. Good. Not found. Not an issue. I'll fix

01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:11.440
it.

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:37.460
This is the correct library. Hmm. Okay. So now a speech

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:40.160
organization. Right. So. Okay.

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:55.820
So now start listening. So yeah, all the second type on my

01:11:55.820 --> 01:12:00.500
question. Uh, so could you could not find a PyAudio check

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:03.480
installation? Okay. Let me fix that as well.

01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:24.540
If when, so just doing this guys, uh, as per your request.

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:30.800
So just hold it tight with me for some time. time I'm going

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:34.360
to show you a speech and then after that I'll even show you

01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:37.460
in a live class I have not built that material by the way so

01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:40.720
I'm building it right now with the help of AI so I'll just

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:42.020
show you like audio

01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:50.790
input and I'll try to show you even this one graph basically

01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:56.070
means dashboarding a small dashboarding install PI audio

01:12:56.070 --> 01:13:02.710
what is the issue append argument okay

01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:17.380
so build it from a wheel then and

01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:26.020
what is my python python p-y-t-h-o-n so don't feel bored

01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:31.820
just see like how we used to work maybe you can see that PI

01:13:35.530 --> 01:13:37.570
audio wheel and

01:13:46.050 --> 01:13:53.300
this one okay so this one is my 3.12 yeah

01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:59.020
it's indeed and interesting things to do something in a live

01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:04.380
I mean like do the live coding in a live okay

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:13.440
let me change my entire environment so let me it's not going

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:19.520
to work in 3.12 so let me change it to 3.10 so conda create

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:27.260
hyphen n python p-y-t-h-o-n python is equals to 3.12 3.10 do

01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:31.760
yes okay I have

01:14:34.130 --> 01:14:42.530
hyphen n and then sequel LLM okay

01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:56.760
so now a couple of feature I'll try to add guys and again if

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:59.600
you will demand for more features so I can sit and I can

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:03.320
keep on adding it for you as of now I'm adding an audio

01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:09.220
feature so sequel LLM p-y-t-h-o-n that's fine and then it

01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:15.240
install ta-ll hyphen r requirements dot txt not

01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:30.960
bored at all okay install

01:15:47.530 --> 01:15:49.850
audio library just

01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:55.560
to build a wheel for this PI audio because PI audio is a

01:16:55.560 --> 01:17:00.560
local installation right so it is a C++ based library so we

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:05.160
have to build that multi

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:07.520
language about local

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:31.220
installation the first thing we have to do is to install a

01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:33.020
local library if you installation is giving me issue so

01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:35.960
maybe I can go ahead with a Google API or maybe like a

01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:36.960
whisper but

01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:54.000
let me try hello

01:18:37.870 --> 01:18:45.590
hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello okay

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:51.660
cause space couple

01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:55.740
of more minute guys it will be working hey

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:15.940
uh show me all the table which is available inside my

01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:17.480
database okay

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:34.780
so this is something guys again we are able to build hope

01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:38.580
you are able to see it so I have just like a I'm using a

01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:41.240
speech right I can use a mobile device I can use like a

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:45.740
something and again so start listening right so let me let

01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:49.600
me say something okay show me all the data from our customer

01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:50.880
table show

01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:59.320
me all the data from customer table show

01:20:06.770 --> 01:20:09.030
me all the data from order table see

01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:22.600
I'm able to see the data right not just that just tell me

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:25.520
now the language Hindi you want Spanish you want French you

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.660
want German you want Chinese Arabic Tamil you want English

01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:29.740
you want English Tamil Telugu Marathi what you want so let's

01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:34.260
suppose I understand Hindi language right okay uh so uh data

01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:36.900
show me from the order table so

01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:52.040
understanding Hindi as well and now you can try to ask in

01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:53.900
your language doesn't matter which language you understand

01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:56.840
so it supports 80 languages I have listed on couple of those

01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:59.740
right so Spanish French German Chinese Arabic Bengali

01:20:59.740 --> 01:21:03.140
Japanese Tamil Telugu whatever you want right so you don't

01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:05.720
have to even now go and type anything basically you can just

01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:10.240
go and ask in your language right okay so all this in order

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:17.120
will just take all you've done through here right I

01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:35.760
just told you that this whole thing is happening

01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:48.890
okay figures one topics I have to

01:21:57.110 --> 01:22:00.630
use a better speech to text one, but yeah, it will, it will

01:22:00.630 --> 01:22:05.190
work. Acha last year ka revenue dikha do, last

01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:14.680
year ka revenue dikhao, revenue,

01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:25.760
I'm able to get it right last year revenue, see order this,

01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:29.720
this, this, this, this. So yeah, this is the actual use of

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:32.380
AI, right? So we don't have to even touch our system. I can

01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:36.200
just wake up in the morning, talk to my mobile, and then my

01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:39.580
thing is done. And as of now, see, I'm using a local

01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:41.940
package, by the way, I'm not using for my speech, I'm not

01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:44.300
using any API's right so far, I'm just using a local

01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:47.140
package. And it is it is working very good. This local

01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:51.060
package is a very old one. Now if I'll just use maybe a

01:22:51.060 --> 01:22:54.840
Sravana AI, or maybe I'm going to use a whisper AI, right?

01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:57.520
Or maybe even if I'm going to use a speech to text from a

01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:02.020
Google API wise, if I'm going to use it, believe me. Even if

01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:05.140
I don't have a proper accent in a particular language, it

01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:08.580
will be able to understand and I will be able to get 100%

01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:11.780
sure sort best to best like an accurate result.

01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:18.440
Yeah, does company needs a developer anymore, obviously to

01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:21.220
develop who will develop these things by the way, see people

01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:24.040
who are saying that he is going to take your job, it is not

01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:26.820
going to take your job. But yeah, if you think that, that

01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:29.720
the things that you have been doing in last like a 1020

01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:33.100
year, you will do the same thing with the same comfort. And

01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:36.660
you will follow the same learning curve, right? Like we

01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:40.480
learn like a data structure algorithm, then we try to learn

01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:42.940
the syntaxes. And then we write a couple of line of code,

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:46.360
then we go and so that is not going to work, you have to

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:50.000
label up yourself with the help of AI and you should like,

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:53.460
see, you should be more creative. Now, you should be more

01:23:53.460 --> 01:23:57.140
like imaginative now, that what is the things that I will be

01:23:57.140 --> 01:24:01.380
able to do? Simple, right? Not telling me guys, what what

01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:03.100
are you looking for? Are you looking for a dashboard? Shall

01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:05.500
I plot a dashboard? Like it is it is going to give you a

01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:13.700
graph and everything. So see people

01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:17.820
out there so I have I used to follow a lot of like a YouTube

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:21.560
channel. So I see YouTubers are saying like our influencers

01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:24.360
saying that go and learn in this way that I'm like that kind

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:28.300
of a learning is not required. Just just after looking into

01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:30.420
this project, do you think that I need to learn a sequel?

01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:36.920
Right? But yeah. I don't. I don't have to get into our my I

01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:39.500
don't have to go and make up my hands dirty with respect to

01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:42.820
a complete sequel complex query, but I should know sequel.

01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:45.040
It doesn't mean that I should not know sequel. I'm not

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:48.060
saying that that you should not know sequel. No, you are

01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:51.340
supposed to know sequel. You should execute each and every

01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:54.340
query in our very first place. You should know all kind of a

01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:57.720
Python command see, I'm able to fix the bugs and immediately

01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:00.840
right in life classes. So now how that is possible. And even

01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:03.100
like I'm asking you that, okay, fine, tell me what you are

01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:05.620
looking for, I will be able to build it and immediately and

01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:08.420
obviously I'm getting a bug right when I'm using AI to

01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:10.660
generate this code. Obviously, I'm getting a bug but

01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:13.240
immediately I'm able to resolve it I immediately I'm able to

01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:16.760
inspect that okay, so what what is the problem and how I can

01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:19.660
fix it. So all of these things will come from where

01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:22.900
obviously from an application building from like doing a

01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:27.240
real time experimentation, right? And that is going to be

01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:32.540
your real value that is going to be your real USP, right? So

01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:36.000
you. You are supposed to learn on that label now and believe

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.240
me, it's not that difficult.

01:25:41.170 --> 01:25:44.110
Can we create a customized dashboard for healthcare why we

01:25:44.110 --> 01:25:46.790
need a tableau and power BI yeah, I don't need like any BI

01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:50.790
tool by the way, right? See I can't show you my dashboard by

01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:53.910
the way, because it's a real time, you're on dashboard that

01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:57.310
I'm holding, right? But we are not using any dashboarding

01:25:57.310 --> 01:26:02.250
tool, I'm like, why we should go and pay for those like

01:26:02.250 --> 01:26:04.230
expensive services.

01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:09.430
So, basically, I have to like, again, like a lot of

01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:11.850
startups, right? I know a lot of big companies, yeah, they

01:26:11.850 --> 01:26:14.730
have a huge budget, they have a client and all. So

01:26:14.730 --> 01:26:17.090
obviously, they try to go ahead and use the tool and that's

01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:19.090
the reason companies have created a tool, they are selling

01:26:19.090 --> 01:26:22.270
it and they're generating huge revenue. But many startups

01:26:22.270 --> 01:26:24.250
even till a mid scale, I have seen that they're not using

01:26:24.250 --> 01:26:26.390
such things. But yeah, they have a better system in place,

01:26:26.450 --> 01:26:28.990
even we have a better system in place, I can, I can't see

01:26:28.990 --> 01:26:31.690
like my dashboard, by the way, the dashboard real time

01:26:31.690 --> 01:26:35.010
dashboard that we use for like a lot of things. Because we

01:26:35.010 --> 01:26:35.910
have a lot of services. Like we have a lot of services. We

01:26:35.910 --> 01:26:38.130
have like a resume services, we have job services, we have a

01:26:38.130 --> 01:26:41.130
URI services, we have a lot of courses that we are selling

01:26:41.130 --> 01:26:44.090
again to a different different mode, live classes, we are

01:26:44.090 --> 01:26:45.930
conducting different different modes. So we have our own

01:26:45.930 --> 01:26:48.670
dashboard, we are aware about our own data, right? But no,

01:26:48.750 --> 01:26:50.610
we are not using any dashboarding tool. It's fine. We have

01:26:50.610 --> 01:26:54.210
built our own custom one, why I'll go and pay to like

01:26:54.210 --> 01:26:55.510
someone just for the dashboarding.

01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:03.500
Yeah. So again, if you are that kind of a developer, so who

01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:07.400
can save a cost of the company, save a time for the company.

01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:11.820
Bring some like innovation into the existing product, I

01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:16.180
believe you will never be outdated. And obviously company

01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:20.300
will would love to give you an appreciation hike and company

01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:22.660
would love to retain you or maybe would love to hire you.

01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:25.400
And if you're not that kind of a developer, at least in an

01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:29.380
age of AI, if you think that I know something, and just

01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:31.960
because of that someone is going to hire me, believe me,

01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:36.160
situation has changed a lot in last two and a half year. I'm

01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:38.140
not talking about before that, right? I'm not talking about

01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:40.600
before that, before that situation was very different, but

01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:42.620
yeah, in last two and a half year, things have literally

01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:45.400
changed. Market have literally changed the way company

01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:47.800
doesn't matter whether it's a product based company or MNC

01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:51.140
or startup used to think it has changed completely. So you

01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:56.710
have to level up on that label, kindly share the app of this

01:27:56.710 --> 01:27:59.210
code. Okay, fine. Let me, let me share this one and you have

01:27:59.210 --> 01:28:01.750
to do a couple of installation as well along with this. So

01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:03.470
please do the installation. I'm pinging you that.

01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:11.500
So you have to do installation of this one. Okay. I'll give

01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:15.020
you an error otherwise. And along with this, you have to do

01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:17.900
this PI audio stream leader is already available into the

01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:22.780
requirement.txt and use Python one dot, sorry, Python 3.10,

01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:28.020
3.10 version because 3.12 is going to give you a issue with

01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:35.660
this audio converter that I'm using. Okay. This is how easy

01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:44.040
it is, right? So let me send the complete code. To all of

01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:48.320
you. So now I know that, that, uh, my students is going to

01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:51.300
ask me anything in my class and it will not take much time

01:28:51.300 --> 01:28:53.220
for me. I can, I can show them, I can deliver it

01:28:53.220 --> 01:28:57.500
immediately. So that is the USP that you have to bring in

01:28:57.500 --> 01:29:01.980
yourself, right? Nowadays I'm doing even a bit open coding a

01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:05.440
lot. I'm like building an extension. I'm building SDKs and

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:10.140
yeah, I'm enjoying it because of that. So even yesterday I

01:29:10.140 --> 01:29:12.260
was not able to sleep till morning, six, seven o'clock.

01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:17.920
Okay. Although I had a class from morning 1130.

01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:29.580
Copy path, command or pipe file SQL LLM.

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:36.240
Yeah. Okay. Compress to, okay.

01:29:39.940 --> 01:29:42.380
You need a dashboard. Let, just, just a minute. I'll, I'll

01:29:42.380 --> 01:29:43.920
do it now itself. Just a minute.

01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:55.360
Next class, build SDK. Okay. So SDK, even now I can show

01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:58.900
you, I can, I can build SDK. I can push it inside the PiPi

01:29:58.900 --> 01:30:02.760
repository and I can show it to you. Uh,

01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:15.060
building SDK is like five minutes of job max to max SQL LLM

01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:15.960
gen AI. Okay.

01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:28.660
Hmm. Okay. Dashboarding, right? Okay. Let me, let me show

01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:31.860
you some like, uh, some graph over here for now, the inside

01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:35.180
the same dashboard. How do we connect? How do we connect

01:30:35.180 --> 01:30:37.980
from a mobile voice to this app? Input voice and output is

01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:41.320
also a voice. So input, I'm able to give it as a voice

01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:43.900
output. Also I can, I can give it as a voice, same library.

01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:45.960
I'm going to use it right in whatever language you are

01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:48.120
looking for the output. I will be able to get the output,

01:30:48.260 --> 01:30:50.580
right? So speech to text and test your speech. Eventually I

01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:52.860
will be able to convert and

01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:00.200
even in a mobile, like, uh, I can do it. So at least, uh,

01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:04.200
now if you're going to ask me, so I can just try to open up

01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:07.840
this particular app, uh, with the help of like a NG doc. And

01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:14.040
then I can try to like, uh, show you so NG.

01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:20.760
So if you want me to like, uh, show you that, uh,

01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:29.520
uh, in a mobile as of now, so I can, uh, even show you just

01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:33.060
by making my own system as a global one, uh,

01:31:37.330 --> 01:31:38.990
sorry, just

01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:15.340
a minute guys. I'll show you a couple of more things as you

01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:18.060
have asked me in a chat. So.

01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:44.110
Hmm. So one thing is like, uh, let's suppose if I have to

01:32:44.110 --> 01:32:47.110
make this app available while running into my local system,

01:32:47.310 --> 01:32:50.350
uh, make it global so I can make it global with the help of

01:32:50.350 --> 01:32:53.270
NG doc. Let me show you that how it will again take 30

01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:57.430
seconds of time for me. And I can even like a chat with this

01:32:57.430 --> 01:33:01.650
one in my mobile now itself. Uh, if it is global, obviously

01:33:01.650 --> 01:33:07.790
I can do it in my mobile. So NG rock, where is my unzipped

01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:12.530
folder? This is not a part of the syllabus. By the way, so

01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:15.920
NG

01:33:21.770 --> 01:33:32.060
rock, then NG rock, okay, fine. So NG rock, I can now show

01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:40.220
you, uh, by making my app global. So my app is running. Let

01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:44.800
me close a lot of things I have opened up. Hmm. So

01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:50.660
Streamlint run app. It's running on my 8 5 0 1. Okay. 8 5 0

01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:55.740
1. Port number. Okay. 8 5 0 1. Port number. It's running.

01:33:56.220 --> 01:33:56.780
Fine.

01:34:00.590 --> 01:34:10.350
Okay. Uh, N G R O K S T T P. Make it global. So 8 5 0 1 port

01:34:10.350 --> 01:34:15.930
number, whatever is running on 8 5 0 1. Make it global. Hmm.

01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:22.450
Okay. So now my app became global. Uh. You guys can also

01:34:22.450 --> 01:34:23.030
test it.

01:34:30.780 --> 01:34:35.180
Yeah. So now, uh, now I can show you. So basically my entire

01:34:35.180 --> 01:34:39.860
app is running globally on this URL. As you can see, this is

01:34:39.860 --> 01:34:45.920
my HTTPS URL and a voice command I can give to my app.

01:34:51.890 --> 01:34:53.410
Let me close everything,

01:34:57.770 --> 01:35:00.510
close, close.

01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:18.940
It's up and running on this port number. Okay. And this port

01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:22.500
number has been exposed. Now what I can do it guys, like,

01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:28.360
uh, I can try to open up the URL and, uh, from my mobile

01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:34.940
device, I can try to send a query. So let me show my mobile

01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:41.050
to all of you. Yeah. So I don't know whether it's like

01:35:41.050 --> 01:35:49.490
visible or not. Uh, it is not able to focus, but yeah, SQL

01:35:49.490 --> 01:35:52.170
power data retrieval assistance and see, I'm not going to

01:35:52.170 --> 01:35:56.650
like a click on my screen, but yeah, so even from my mobile,

01:35:56.890 --> 01:36:01.090
I can say that. Okay. So give me the table from, uh, order

01:36:01.090 --> 01:36:01.390
table.

01:36:15.450 --> 01:36:21.370
Hmm. And now let me show you. So basically it is able to

01:36:21.370 --> 01:36:24.890
give me a record. I don't know how I can show it to you

01:36:24.890 --> 01:36:27.030
because my, okay,

01:36:30.130 --> 01:36:34.870
do one thing. I'm pinging you this URL in your, uh, chat box

01:36:34.870 --> 01:36:39.530
itself. And, uh, you can test it by yourself. I think that

01:36:39.530 --> 01:36:43.050
will be like a better, please

01:36:51.530 --> 01:36:53.670
reduce the brightness. It will display our kind. Can't do

01:36:53.670 --> 01:36:58.070
it. Basically that, that camera set up is fixed. So can't do

01:36:58.070 --> 01:37:01.750
that. Maybe I can switch off some of my lights, but yeah, I

01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:04.250
have already pinned you guys this URL so you can test it. So

01:37:04.250 --> 01:37:05.570
this is running in my local system.

01:37:18.050 --> 01:37:22.930
No, still not visible. So maybe you can chat with my system

01:37:22.930 --> 01:37:25.510
and then you can check it. I have already pinned you the

01:37:25.510 --> 01:37:30.830
URL. So as long as I'm not like, uh. Doing anything. Yeah.

01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:39.840
So are you, are you able to test it guys? Just click on

01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:42.600
start listening and then ask a question in your language,

01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:44.700
whatever language that you understand. Hindi, Spanish,

01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:47.680
French, German, Chinese, Arabic, Bengali, Japanese, Tamil,

01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:50.300
Telugu, Marathi. All these languages are mentioned over

01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:50.560
there.

01:37:54.100 --> 01:37:57.220
Yeah. So you can now like, uh, go and check.

01:38:02.170 --> 01:38:04.450
Okay. Jitendra is saying working. It will work. It will

01:38:04.450 --> 01:38:06.390
work. There's no reason that it is not going to work. So

01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:08.670
what I have. Okay. Let me tell you how you are able to

01:38:08.670 --> 01:38:12.390
access my app. So actually I have not deployed this one. So

01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:15.450
it's still running in my system. My system is basically a

01:38:15.450 --> 01:38:19.310
server. Uh, the only thing that I'm doing is, so there is a

01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:21.970
service called as ng rock with the help of ng rock. So

01:38:21.970 --> 01:38:24.830
whatever is running in my system, some of you might have got

01:38:24.830 --> 01:38:28.450
the error with some of the call. I can see that in my

01:38:28.450 --> 01:38:32.350
system. Uh, so basically like, uh, you are just trying to

01:38:32.350 --> 01:38:37.290
call one of the instance, and this is how even real time

01:38:37.290 --> 01:38:38.230
internet works. Right?

01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:46.460
Yeah. It will work. So I have just made my local system as a

01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:48.100
global one. So my local system.

01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:57.470
Yeah. So basically my local system is behaving like a server

01:38:57.470 --> 01:38:58.590
now that

01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:06.640
your voice is coming on my UI. Okay. So maybe you can mute

01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:08.120
me in that case.

01:39:11.310 --> 01:39:13.770
Okay. So again,

01:39:20.530 --> 01:39:22.890
now, uh, if, if you're looking for a personalized dashboard,

01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:26.090
right. Uh, you can even like, I can even integrate a

01:39:26.090 --> 01:39:29.070
dashboard into this one and then you will be able to like,

01:39:29.150 --> 01:39:35.120
uh, get a graph. Could you document the steps? See this is

01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:40.220
the problem, right? This is the problem. So, uh, if you, if

01:39:40.220 --> 01:39:44.120
you want me to talk something, which is not a part of

01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:47.220
syllabus, if you want some, uh, for me to build something,

01:39:47.540 --> 01:39:50.660
which is not a part of syllabus, I need a little bit of

01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:52.820
flexibility. If you're going to ask me that, okay, teach

01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:56.020
everything, then explain every line of, I have seen like

01:39:56.020 --> 01:39:58.940
many people, you know, sometime when I take classes and when

01:39:58.940 --> 01:40:01.980
I explained the project. And if I don't explain like a line

01:40:01.980 --> 01:40:03.760
by line, each and everything, then they say that, okay, you

01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:05.760
are not a good teacher. You are, you're not teaching me like

01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:09.060
in a proper way. I'm like, do we need, do you need that kind

01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:14.220
of a handholding now? And if you are going to do that kind

01:40:14.220 --> 01:40:17.040
of a handholding, then max to max, you will end up building

01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:21.780
a kale kind of project. Not more, not beyond that. Right? So

01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:24.100
I'll tell you the step I've even showed you the steps. See,

01:40:24.180 --> 01:40:26.480
nothing is like an invisible, which I'm doing everything.

01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:29.660
I'm doing it in front of all of you. Right? If you want to

01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:32.340
do it bigger than obviously you have that, you should keep

01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:37.560
that kind of a mindset. Right? That, okay. It's fine. I'll

01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:39.980
try to put up a little bit of effort, the

01:40:45.140 --> 01:40:47.900
developer AI bot, which will do this when you join the

01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:51.020
meeting, join to and will document on your behalf. Yeah,

01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:55.060
that is also, we can build easily. We can build it. So if

01:40:55.060 --> 01:40:57.340
you want me to build a such kind of application, just give

01:40:57.340 --> 01:40:59.440
me a flexibility. Don't ask for documentation or something.

01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:02.980
I'll build it. I'll show it to you. I can show you any kind

01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:05.760
of application now. So, and most of the application, uh,

01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:08.680
like all of these applications I have built maybe in my like

01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:12.060
last seven to eight year of tenure. So I know how things

01:41:12.060 --> 01:41:16.320
works, so I'll, I'll show it to you. And then maybe you can

01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:20.020
mention it in your resume. So when, when for both of us, uh,

01:41:35.420 --> 01:41:39.740
okay, so this is fine. Now I'm dominating this one, guys,

01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:42.920
I'm terminating this app. So now you will not be able to

01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:48.220
access this app. Yeah. Five zero two bad gateway. I can see

01:41:48.220 --> 01:41:54.240
a lot of things. So terminated my ng rock. Okay. So now let

01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:56.620
me talk about the ng rock, what I have done. So how I have

01:41:56.620 --> 01:42:00.860
made my like a things public. So there is a system called as

01:42:00.860 --> 01:42:03.580
ng rock, right? So you can go to Google, try to search for

01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:07.660
ng rock and come over here and let me ping you this link as

01:42:07.660 --> 01:42:12.140
well. It's a very simple step guys. So you can just try to

01:42:12.140 --> 01:42:15.660
go ahead with the get started for free. And then here you

01:42:15.660 --> 01:42:18.300
will be able to find out a ng rock downloadable file

01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:21.040
downloads, right? So if you're using windows, then go ahead

01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:23.240
with the windows. If you're using some other system, then go

01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:25.860
ahead with some other system. It provides you for all the

01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:28.800
systems. So Mac, Linux, as you can see, it is providing you

01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:31.360
agent for everything right now, once you are able to

01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:33.900
download it. So I have downloaded it and I'm keeping it

01:42:33.900 --> 01:42:38.140
inside my folder. So double click over there and now it will

01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:41.620
be able to pop up the ng ng rock command prompt CMD.

01:42:41.700 --> 01:42:44.020
Basically you don't have to do anything basically. So what

01:42:44.020 --> 01:42:46.160
you have to do is you just have to write a simple command.

01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:49.480
They have even given you the example over here. Okay. So you

01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:52.880
just have to type the command ng rock. So this is the

01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:56.500
command and then HTTP means whatever is running in your

01:42:56.500 --> 01:43:00.800
local HTTP means local HTTP S means global internet, right?

01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:04.580
So HTTP, and then you have to write the port number. So all

01:43:04.580 --> 01:43:08.200
the application that you are trying to test, uh, doesn't

01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:10.620
matter whether it's a streaming application or maybe a flask

01:43:10.620 --> 01:43:13.640
application, maybe a fast API or anything, right? Anything.

01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:17.380
So that must be running on some of the port numbers. So you

01:43:17.380 --> 01:43:19.920
just have to give that port number. What it will do is it

01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:23.140
will try to bind that port number to the outside, to the

01:43:23.140 --> 01:43:26.400
internet. That's it. So that whatever traffic will come,

01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:29.180
right? So first of all, traffic will come to ng rock. Then

01:43:29.180 --> 01:43:32.380
ng rock knows that, that if traffic is coming on this URL,

01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:37.100
so this URL is binded to which system, right? So it will

01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:39.620
route that traffic to my system basically, and this is how

01:43:39.620 --> 01:43:42.920
you will be able to access something which is running in my

01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:46.560
local system globally. Same point of a time. So this is how

01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:49.720
that was like, uh, uh, working. This is how the URL I have

01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:52.100
shared with all of you was actually working. So this is what

01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:57.360
ng rock does and command design steps are very simple. So ng

01:43:57.360 --> 01:43:59.700
rock HTTP and then whatever port number, it doesn't matter

01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:02.220
which port number, just you have to write the port number

01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:04.600
and that port number will be public.

01:44:11.630 --> 01:44:14.290
I think the app is working for one general time, otherwise

01:44:14.290 --> 01:44:17.130
talking your voice input here. So basically it will work

01:44:17.130 --> 01:44:19.450
because I have to create the session inside the app. So

01:44:19.450 --> 01:44:21.370
basically I have to create the session inside the app, or

01:44:21.370 --> 01:44:23.570
maybe I have to distribute it. I have to host it in a

01:44:23.570 --> 01:44:26.530
distributed manner. So because there is only one way. There

01:44:26.530 --> 01:44:30.070
is only one instance of app I have like a spin over here. So

01:44:30.070 --> 01:44:31.230
yes, all

01:44:37.470 --> 01:44:39.690
the content, do you give a constant support for company

01:44:39.690 --> 01:44:42.810
you're on a no, we don't give it. We have like a, our plate

01:44:42.810 --> 01:44:44.950
is completely full. Like we have a lot of product that we

01:44:44.950 --> 01:44:49.990
are building internally and plus like, uh, I do teaching a

01:44:49.990 --> 01:44:51.970
lot of teaching. So sir,

01:44:55.460 --> 01:44:58.580
can we keep such local system as server for a longer time?

01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:00.860
Yeah. As long as your system will be up and running, your

01:45:00.860 --> 01:45:03.860
laptop will be up and running. It will work. But if you

01:45:03.860 --> 01:45:06.620
don't want that in that case, do one thing. So there is a

01:45:06.620 --> 01:45:09.540
render.com. I have even, uh, like, uh, a sole multiple

01:45:09.540 --> 01:45:12.620
projects. So just go and deploy it on a render.com. Render

01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:15.360
.com is not even going to charge you single rupees, right?

01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:18.420
So use such kind of a services so that you don't have to

01:45:18.420 --> 01:45:21.120
keep your laptop up and running. There are a lot of like a

01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:22.040
free cloud provider.

01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:30.460
So tell us which library we should use for a visualization

01:45:30.460 --> 01:45:35.340
for a visualization. I will say that, uh, try to use maybe a

01:45:35.340 --> 01:45:38.120
matplotlib, seaborn, cufflinks or plotly. Plotly will be

01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:44.340
more interactive. I would say. Let me show you. Uh, like a

01:45:44.340 --> 01:45:46.160
couple of small, small dashboarding.

01:46:33.210 --> 01:46:35.390
Okay. So let me show you some visualization in the same

01:46:35.390 --> 01:46:37.070
code, a small visualization by the way.

01:46:40.500 --> 01:46:43.860
So I will be using a library called as plotly. Plotly is a

01:46:43.860 --> 01:46:46.700
interactive library. So I'm just doing an installation of a

01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:50.040
plotly. So even you can do installation guys, pip install

01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:53.340
plotly for the interactive visualization.

01:47:24.810 --> 01:47:25.230
CLS.

01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:03.520
Okay. So I can speak or maybe I can try to like, uh, ask

01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:05.900
question in my own way. So both is going to work.

01:48:11.460 --> 01:48:14.160
Yeah. So as of now, it is able to like, I have simply said

01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:17.100
that, that so many of the total revenue by a month. So it is

01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:20.600
able to like, uh, show me the total revenue by a month, as

01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:23.960
you can see, and then it is able to create a histogram. Let

01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:26.540
me ask some different questions. So accordingly, it will try

01:48:26.540 --> 01:48:29.160
to plot the graph. If I want all the graph at one places

01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:31.880
that is also possible, like a Power BI dashboarding. If you

01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:38.520
want properly, that is also possible. Uh, show me, uh, R

01:48:41.820 --> 01:48:47.870
I B U T A T N distribution of. And as your data will be big,

01:48:47.950 --> 01:48:51.690
your graph will be more beautiful. So I've just asked a

01:48:51.690 --> 01:48:54.470
question. Show me a distribution of order amount again.

01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:02.700
Just a histogram. Okay. Query is fine.

01:49:05.700 --> 01:49:14.780
Uh, give me, give me top 10 products by, I don't have even a

01:49:14.780 --> 01:49:16.440
top 10 products, but yeah, I still, I'm asking.

01:49:25.540 --> 01:49:28.080
Hmm. So now it is giving me a scatter plot as you can see.

01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:32.360
Right. Scatter plot. So visualize, uh, based on like this

01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:39.660
particular data. So like speech query result, and then

01:49:39.660 --> 01:49:41.900
parallelly a visualization. So if I'm looking for like a

01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:45.220
default visualization, if I'm looking for some separate

01:49:45.220 --> 01:49:47.900
visualization with respect to a relationship, I can even do

01:49:47.900 --> 01:49:48.960
that. Yeah.

01:49:55.140 --> 01:49:58.080
So this is just again, another modification guys. So where

01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:01.940
you will be able to see even a visualization. So fine guys.

01:50:02.060 --> 01:50:04.920
So with that, I'm done with, uh, today's project. Uh,

01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:08.120
tomorrow, again, we have a practical, uh, so I'll show you

01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:11.440
back to back multiple project, not just one. And then, uh,

01:50:11.580 --> 01:50:15.440
you can ask me a question, uh, to add something and I'll be

01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:18.820
happy to add it. So with that, uh, let me share my latest

01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:23.200
piece of the code and then I'm going to wind up the class.

01:50:27.500 --> 01:50:30.720
So SQL, LLM, gen AI, bestest

01:50:40.870 --> 01:50:43.750
class ever. Thank you so much. Sanjeev.

01:50:46.780 --> 01:50:52.060
LLM might get confused on show incorrect. Uh, uh, or so

01:50:52.060 --> 01:50:57.800
incorrect result. Uh, there is a chance that LLM might get

01:50:57.800 --> 01:51:01.480
confused the way you are asking a question. See if you are

01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:05.240
going to ask a wrong question, obviously LLM is going to

01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:09.240
produce a query. See at the end of the day, uh, LLM is what

01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:11.520
it just, uh, interface, right? It's just an interface

01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:14.220
between human and a machine. That's it. Nothing more than

01:51:14.220 --> 01:51:18.720
that. LLM is not having, uh, black, uh, too much of

01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:19.500
creativity. But it's just an interface, right? It should be

01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:23.040
beyond your thought. So obviously you should be very clear

01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:25.760
that what you are looking for, and you should be very clear

01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:30.460
in terms of conveying those things, right? So the way like

01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:33.180
a, you gather a requirement from a client, so you ask a

01:51:33.180 --> 01:51:35.500
proper question and then client gives you a proper answer.

01:51:35.660 --> 01:51:38.600
If there is a breakage in between, obviously you will not be

01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:41.180
able to build a best product. You will not be able to get a

01:51:41.180 --> 01:51:44.040
best result. Same things has been applied even over here,

01:51:44.140 --> 01:51:48.760
ask LLM is smart enough to give you a bestest or best

01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:52.460
result. But it also depends upon you that how you are asking

01:51:52.460 --> 01:51:54.780
question. If you'll ask the wrong question, obviously LLM is

01:51:54.780 --> 01:51:56.640
going to give you the wrong answer and there is no doubt

01:51:56.640 --> 01:52:00.600
about it, right? So you should know in a very first place

01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:05.240
that what you want. So fine guys with that. Thank you so

01:52:05.240 --> 01:52:07.520
much. Hope all of you have enjoyed this class. I have

01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:10.440
already shared a complete code file tomorrow. Again, I'll

01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:13.840
show you a practical, uh, this, your class now onwards is

01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:17.280
all about practical implementation back to back. So you will

01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:22.100
see a lot of applications. Okay. Then I will request you to

01:52:22.100 --> 01:52:26.100
build something around it. For example, uh, if, if I'll talk

01:52:26.100 --> 01:52:28.900
about my today's example, right? So I have basically

01:52:28.900 --> 01:52:33.000
integrated, uh, offline, uh, package for converting a speech

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:36.480
to text. Maybe you can try to consume an API from a Google,

01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:39.080
maybe from a whisper API. You can try to consume it and make

01:52:39.080 --> 01:52:42.800
it more robust, right? Make it more robust. Maybe you can

01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:46.160
try to give more power in terms of number of languages that

01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:48.520
it can understand. I have integrated for 80 languages. Maybe

01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:50.920
you can integrate for all of the languages, right? There is

01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:54.580
a API, which is available out there. Uh, then someone was

01:52:54.580 --> 01:52:56.920
asking for a power BI dashboard, power BI kind of a

01:52:56.920 --> 01:53:00.040
dashboard. Okay. Do one thing. So build it in such a way

01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:03.000
that it will be able to create a dashboard, which should be

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:06.240
personalized to me. And let's suppose your application is

01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:10.000
with someone by someone else. So their dashboard should be

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:13.160
personalized to their requirements. So personalization into

01:53:13.160 --> 01:53:17.380
a dashboarding into a data visualization, right now, again,

01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:22.140
you can try to like, uh, maybe, uh, like, uh, fix some of

01:53:22.140 --> 01:53:25.880
the query, which will run automatically in a couple of hours

01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:28.340
or a couple of minutes, or maybe in a couple of days. Right.

01:53:28.660 --> 01:53:31.920
And automatically it should populate the dashboard. So

01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:34.940
again, that is one another label, right? This is what we

01:53:34.940 --> 01:53:38.600
even do inside the industry. So we try to sit duly each and

01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:41.440
everything we try to configure each and everything in such a

01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:44.900
way that that system will run the query automatically in a

01:53:44.900 --> 01:53:47.080
particular time period, right? And then. Then try to

01:53:47.080 --> 01:53:49.700
populate the dashboard and my manager or my stakeholder, my

01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:53.740
business unit will be able to see that do it here, right?

01:53:54.100 --> 01:53:56.620
Just a couple of line of a code. You will be able to do a

01:53:56.620 --> 01:53:58.960
scheduling. Scheduling is very much easy with respect to a

01:53:58.960 --> 01:54:01.760
Python, right? Or maybe you can even, if you are using a

01:54:01.760 --> 01:54:04.240
windows or maybe any other machine, just write a cron job

01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:06.960
over there with the help of cron job, it will be able to

01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:09.940
like a schedule it automatically. It will run the job. So

01:54:09.940 --> 01:54:12.600
whenever you are going to schedule and then face the data,

01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:15.960
build the dashboard and bingo, right? A complete full scale

01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:18.740
product. This is what, what the real people does, even

01:54:18.740 --> 01:54:21.100
inside the industry, it's not like they're doing something

01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:27.100
very different, right? So this should be the next step for

01:54:27.100 --> 01:54:31.140
all of you. So again, with the help of AI, we have given you

01:54:31.140 --> 01:54:33.300
URI for the same reason, right? So that you can go play with

01:54:33.300 --> 01:54:36.620
the URI, try to ask a question, try to build something, try

01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:39.380
to resolve your doubt so that you don't have to go outside

01:54:39.380 --> 01:54:41.760
and pay for it. We have given you the API access for the

01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:44.740
same reason so that you can make use of it in a positive

01:54:44.740 --> 01:54:48.760
manner. So go ahead. Use it. Try to add one, one, a single,

01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:51.300
single things, and then mention the same thing inside your

01:54:51.300 --> 01:54:54.800
resume. And when you will do it, and then when you are going

01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:57.420
to add it, believe me, you will be very much comfortable

01:54:57.420 --> 01:55:00.340
when you are going to explain your project in front of

01:55:00.340 --> 01:55:03.800
interviewer, right? Interviewer, you will be able to even

01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:06.460
add five more things, which maybe you have not done, but you

01:55:06.460 --> 01:55:13.540
know how to do it. Yeah. So just try to do that. Next step.

01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:17.160
Use your creativity. Use your imagination. If you're not

01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:19.100
able to get a creativity, if you're not able to get an

01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:22.920
imagination, then send the same situation or scenario to a

01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:25.780
URI, ask that, okay, fine. So tell me what in all, I think

01:55:25.780 --> 01:55:28.240
I, what kind of a feature I can try to build on top of it.

01:55:28.300 --> 01:55:31.400
At least, at least this much you can do. Right. Go and ask

01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:33.980
URI by giving this entire situation that, okay, I'm able to

01:55:33.980 --> 01:55:35.900
build an application. So which is able to take a speech

01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:38.780
input in this way, and then it is able to like take a

01:55:38.780 --> 01:55:40.800
queries. It is able to give me an answer. These are the five

01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:44.200
tables that I have. I'm able to plot a graph now. Now what

01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:47.100
all feature you are going to suggest that I should build

01:55:47.100 --> 01:55:51.400
inside this application to make it even like a, like a, a

01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:57.000
more real URI is going to give you a response. It is going

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.920
to give you a 10 to 15 feature and then start building those

01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:05.420
feature making sense guys, how we should study. So I think

01:56:05.420 --> 01:56:10.820
now this is how we all are supposed to study, right? The way

01:56:10.820 --> 01:56:13.480
we were studying since a very, very long time. Believe me.

01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:17.700
Okay. If you are still following that particular way, you

01:56:17.700 --> 01:56:21.600
are not moving anywhere, right? You're not literally moving

01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:24.660
anywhere and industry is not going to give you a value.

01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:28.480
Things have literally changed a lot. People are yet to

01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:33.140
accept it, right? Maybe people are like not able to realize

01:56:33.140 --> 01:56:36.940
many of us are not able to realize, but sooner you will

01:56:36.940 --> 01:56:40.320
realize better. It will be, and you will be in a better and

01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:45.160
peaceful position very soon. So maybe this conversational

01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:47.920
would be good enhancement. Conversational would be. Yeah. So

01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:50.580
I have already like a given that, right? So one, one end,

01:56:50.700 --> 01:56:53.980
you can try to build another end. So fine guys with that.

01:56:54.020 --> 01:56:55.720
Thank you so much. See you again in my tomorrow's class.

01:56:55.980 --> 01:56:58.840
Tomorrow again, I will be showing you the project, um, with

01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:01.580
the LLMs and, uh, whatever is that in your syllabus. I'll

01:57:01.580 --> 01:57:04.420
just follow through your syllabus and I'll try to show the

01:57:04.420 --> 01:57:07.140
project till then take care everyone. Thank you so much.

01:57:07.420 --> 01:57:07.920
Well done.
