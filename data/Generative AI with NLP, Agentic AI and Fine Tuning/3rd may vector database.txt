WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.420
So in my last class, basically we were able to convert each

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.440
and everything into embeddings. And then after converting

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.480
things into embeddings, we were able to store it into a

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.580
chroma db. And then we were able to even perform a search

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.040
operation, right? So we have seen that, that whatever search

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.300
that we are trying to do, so it will always try to bring a

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.480
data based on the similarity, right? Based on the

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.860
similarity, based on the cosine similarity or any other

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.560
similarity, it will be able to basically like bring the

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.380
data. Now in my today's class, I will be talking about a

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.720
pinecone, baviot and fascia again. So all of these three

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.540
databases are going to do the exact same thing. Nothing much

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.040
difference, but yeah. So in, in terms of their architecture,

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.900
in terms of the way they try to store the data. So there is

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.540
some differences you will be able to find out, let me switch

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.260
on my other light.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.260
Okay. So in terms of like the way this database stores our

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.660
data, you will be able to find out a certain like a

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.320
differences. But at the end of the day, all of these

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.840
databases are basically embedding databases. So where you

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.420
try to store our data in a vector format and then as and

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.580
when it is required, so you will be able to pull the data.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.360
You will be able to search the data. Now why we are talking

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.480
about these four databases. The reason is that, that going

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.980
forward, right? Most probably from our next class onward

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.640
itself. Right? We are going to discuss a land chain. We are

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.200
going to discuss land graph. We are going to build a RIG

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.300
based application, a retrieval, augmented generated based

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.480
application as per your syllabus, right? Now everywhere,

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.500
these kinds of our database is required. So I'm not just

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.080
going to like give you the introduction, but you will be

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.020
able to see going forward that we are heavily using all of

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.180
these databases, right? And again, so whatever we are going

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.260
to learn in this databases, obviously we have seen it's very

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.320
much related to the things that we have already discussed.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.380
In my previous class. So let's try to understand the first

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.180
of all pine cone, then move to a biviate and then move to a,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.680
again, we have to change this name. So it's basically

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.160
Facebook AI SS. It's not IS. So it's a semantic search

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.440
basically. So these are the three databases that we are

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.820
going to discuss and it's a very simple, believe me, it's,

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.540
it's very simple. So convert things into a, like a convert

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.680
any database, any entry into the embeddings, store it,

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.140
search it, delete it. So insert, update, delete, search all

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.800
of these operations. That is very, very useful. Very common

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.680
in any other databases. So we are going to perform the exact

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.420
same thing, even with respect to these two, three databases.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.740
So for pine cone, there is a managed service, which is

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.520
already available for biviate. There is again a managed

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.800
service provider, which is already available for FAI SS. So

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.300
basically you have to do a local installation. Maybe you can

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.860
dockerize it and then you can put it on a cloud that is

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.800
possible. And same, you can go with the chroma DV. So chroma

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.160
DV. So they have listed the pricing and everything, but

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.220
there is a waiting list. So we can't, we can't. Like we can

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.660
log in, we can apply, but yeah, you will be in a waiting

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.420
list. They're not going to give you a free access. So here,

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.520
let's talk about a pine cone first of all. So what I can do

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.220
is I can try to open up maybe a fresh new ID,

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.080
pine cone. Now here, so pine cone, the vector database to

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.700
build the knowledge graph. Now here, just try to copy, I'm

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.620
going to copy ping this particular link. So this is the link

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.580
for the pine cone, basically the vector database for a scale

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.040
in production. And yeah, so you will be able to do the

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.320
storing. You will be able to do a searching. You will be

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.320
able to do all the other operations, which in general you

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.880
are going to do with any other databases. So what we are

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.380
going to do is, so we are going to connect with a pine cone,

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.520
which is available over a cloud platform from our local

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.820
system. So basically from our VS code, so we are going to

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.180
connect with this one and then we will try to convert our

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.860
data. Okay. By using a URI API, because at the end of the

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.100
day, this is just a database, right? This is just a

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.120
database. So we will try to use a URI API so that I will be

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.680
able to convert it into a embedding. So I believe we all

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.300
remember that how we can use a URI API, right? For embedding

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.900
purposes. So if I'll talk about URI and then API and then

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.240
code example. So I think we have already executed this code.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.680
This is going to give me basically embeddings. We have a

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.280
model called. Text embedding three small from OpenAI itself

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.240
that is already available on our Euron ecosystem, this

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.300
model, right? So which is going to give you five, one, five,

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.340
three, six dimension of the vector for every entry, whatever

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.260
entry that you are going to give it into this one. And we

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.110
have already used it last time, right guys, everyone. Any

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.530
plan for LLM ops? I think we have like a recently published

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.510
LLM ops on a YouTube, which is like a publicly available

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.970
just for free, even with the material. So maybe Mr. Tunja

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:08.810
can go ahead with that.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.150
Yeah. So LLM ops is already like available. So yeah, I

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.410
believe we all remember that how to use this text embedding,

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.490
how we can try to give an input as a text, and then we will

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.090
be able to get a output as an embedding. So we are just

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.030
going to like take one more step over here. We are going to

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.250
connect with the databases last time. So we have taken a

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.570
step. So we were able to run with the databases, but it was

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.470
into my local this time. So we'll try to come with a pine

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.790
cone and then we'll try to store it over there, which is a

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.170
very, very, very, very easy. Believe me. It's kind of a no

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:51.110
brainer game. It's literally no brainer. Right. Bokhtiyar

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.630
has left your own. So yeah, he has left it on. He's having

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.610
some, his own personal like aspiration. So he has left and

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.230
he has started something different. So yeah.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.590
Okay. So here we have a pine cone. Maybe we can try to log

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.970
in into a pine cone and I'll be using just a Google login

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.690
over here. So Google login, just log into a pine cone.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.670
We are happy to finally enter Sanjogam University. Yeah. All

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:30.290
tech I am going to finish for sure. So that's

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.190
my long-term dream because teaching is one thing, but

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.830
ultimately I'm a person who loved building a product. That's

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.110
the reason. So you must be able to see like UD and all those

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.710
other stuff and more and more I'll keep on building. So,

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:48.010
okay. So just select anything. This is just a fill up form,

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.390
nothing much. So maybe you can try to click on continue,

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.510
continue. And then let's get started. So just try to log in

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:59.010
into your pine cone guys, and they're going to show you your

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.630
API key. You can try to store it somewhere. Even if you

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.550
will, if, even if you forget to store it, not an issue, we

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.570
have an option. We will be able to generate it once again.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.170
So this is my API key. I'm going to store it somewhere.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.390
Maybe I can try to keep it here inside my note or something,

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:19.490
but yeah, even if you're not keeping it, not an issue at

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:24.390
all. So close it. Close it now, except in continue. Okay. So

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:28.030
this is basically a pine cone interface guys. Are you able

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.910
to see the pine cone interface, everyone, how

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.140
to find the best embedding model for our task as of now,

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.520
just try to use one, five, three, six model from like a open

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.870
AI. That's one of the best one. Yeah. That is that we have

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:44.690
already given to you.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:59.160
Okay. So guys, uh, are you able to see this interface? This

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.100
pine cone interface?

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:04.660
Yeah.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.540
Yes. Okay. So they weren't saying yes. What about other

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:22.780
guys?

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.060
So these are saying also, yes. Okay.

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:36.500
People are slow. It seems. Nice. So yeah, I know like today

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.580
is Saturday, but, um, we are into class, right? Today's a

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:41.420
weekends.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:47.540
Okay. Barty is saying yes. Okay. So we are able to see this

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.800
pine cone. So this is basically your pine cone database

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.860
interface that you will be able to find out. Let me give you

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:56.580
a brief introduction. There is nothing much to understand

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:01.080
here. Like I said, it's a no brainer job, right? Eventually

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.940
we are, what we will try to do. So we'll try to take a data.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:07.160
I will try to convert those data into its embedding, into

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.660
its vector space. We'll try to store it over here. And then

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.240
at the time of search, we'll try to search it. That's it.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.920
Right. Even when I will be using into the application, for

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.940
example, into my RAG. So I believe you all understand the

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.060
definition of RAG. If not, I'm again going to explain, but

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.700
yeah, very simple. It's very like a simple definition of

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:32.340
RAG. I'll give you. So, um, here, uh, basically, uh, pine

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.840
cone, if you'll come over here. So this is just a landing

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.740
page. Then there is a tab called as databases. You will be

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:41.700
able to find out now inside this pine cone. So your

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.880
databases is technically called as indexes. So here you will

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.620
be able to find out, uh, not so there is a database. And

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.120
then inside that there is an indexes. For example, generally

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:56.220
we try to create a tables, right? So if, if you are going to

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.540
like do a relationship. So in that way, indexes are

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:02.200
equivalent to a table. So you can say, so where you can try

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.420
to like, uh, first of all, install a pine cone, call this

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:09.940
APIs, pass your own key, and then you will be able to create

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:13.420
the indexes, whatever indexes that you want to a store,

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.660
whatever kind of data you want, you will be able to create

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:19.800
the indexes. I'll show you that part as well. So how to

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.160
create an indexes, everything I'm going to show you in a

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.840
step-by-step manner. But first of all, I'm giving you the

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.540
introduction of this entire interface. Okay. Backup is

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.700
technically like, if you have to take a backup of your

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.740
indexes for a long term, so you can try to do that. But

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.240
yeah, the, for that you have to pay money. Basically you

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.740
have to pay to the pine cones. We don't want to do that. So

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.580
we are going to use our free version of it. As of now, there

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.800
is something called assistance. So again, I don't want to

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.260
assistance. I have my own assistance called as URI. So I'll

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.900
be able to use that part, uh, here. So you will be able to

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.820
find out, uh, inferences. So what is the meaning of this

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:56.320
inferences? So simplify your stack with the model hosted by

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:00.720
pine cones. And all of these models are basically, uh, like,

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.420
uh, these models are basically going to help you out in

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:07.300
terms of generating the embeddings. So whenever you will try

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:11.640
to store the data, so you can try to use all of these

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.420
models. So pine cone is giving you a multiple models. So the

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.780
very first model they're giving you is Lama text bit

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:23.420
embedded. So like a maximum input is 2048 tokens. Then there

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.920
is something called a multilingual E5 large 507 token. Okay.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.840
Then pine cone is sparse English five, one, two token pine

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:35.780
cone, uh, like a re-rank then then beg. And they have given

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:39.400
you like a, some of this, uh, like a model introduction over

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.460
here. I'm not going to use any of these. I have my own

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:46.220
inside my URI. So I just have like a, my open AI embedding

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.800
models. I'll be using that. If you are not going to use, use

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.940
that one, then in that case, you can use these models,

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.720
right? You can use these models. And if you're using these

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.480
models, obviously they're going to charge you. Uh, so they

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.460
are going to give you some free limit, but yeah, after that,

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.700
obviously they are going to charge you to store any kind of

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.340
data, but yeah, pine cone is giving you an option even for

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:11.000
embedding models. Otherwise you can try to use even a models

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.220
from a hugging face, right? There are, there are multiple

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.660
options, which is available to you. And at least when we are

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.500
the part of your own, so even inside a urine, we have that

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.960
option, which is available. So I'll be using my urine model,

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.560
but again, there is no hard and fast that you should always

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.940
use that your own model, uh, the embedding model that, uh,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.620
we are giving you as an option. You can use any other, uh,

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.100
like a one, uh, based on your task that you're going to

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:39.140
complete. Okay. So here they have given you a complete code

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:42.640
base as well. Like I said, it's a no brainer job, right?

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.200
It's literally a no brainer job. Uh, you will be able to

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.140
find out. So here they are giving you entire like a code

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:52.140
base as well. Right. And then, uh, let's suppose if I forgot

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:55.500
to create, save the API, then I can create an API. So here,

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.500
there is again called as something called as managed. So you

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:02.320
will be able to like manage the entire, uh, like a team and

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.480
all those things. Uh, simple, right? So here, so this is

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.260
just an introduction. Now coming to this again, get started

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:13.660
part. There is a quick start guide I had to show you. So API

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:17.800
references, this, this, this, where is a quick start guide,

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:25.930
databases, indexes. Okay. Here. Uh, maybe, maybe I can.

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:29.510
Yeah. So here you will be able to find out a step by step

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:33.350
approach, uh, where like, uh, they have given you a code

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:36.650
base and more or less we'll be using almost a similar kind

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.730
of a code base for any kind of a task. So their

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:41.810
documentation is very good. I would say even I have gone

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:44.350
through their documentation personally, and, uh, it looks

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:48.930
very like a structured one in terms of, uh, like doing every

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:52.050
kind of operations that they have done. Even they have

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:55.610
released basically this, uh, Jupiter notebook to all of us

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:59.210
so that for the first time user, so maybe you can try to

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:01.470
learn how to do an insert operation. How, what is the

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:04.310
indexing operation? What is the name space over here?

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.990
Everything, everything you will be able to learn. But like I

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.590
said, there is nothing much to learn over here. It's simple.

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:11.910
Like there is a database. I'll be able to do the insert,

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:14.710
then update, then delete all those operations, which we

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:18.030
regularly do in any other databases. So I'll be able to do

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:21.450
the same thing. The only difference is that we are trying to

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:23.790
convert something into its embeddings, and then we are

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:26.550
trying to store it. And then at the time of search. Based on

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:29.110
the similarity that we have given. So it is going to perform

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:31.950
the search operation. That's our only differences. You all

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:37.170
are going to get it making sense guys, everyone.

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:40.690
Yeah.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:02.540
And as you can see, so a lot of, lot of notebook they have

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:06.040
given to you, right? With a lot of like a use cases, but,

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:09.680
uh, every use cases after today's class, I believe you all

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:13.880
will be able to understand in a very, very easy way. So it's

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:18.200
like that. Not a big deal to understand anything, uh, which,

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.640
uh, like is given just simple plain databases where I'm

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:25.960
going to store the data. That's it. Yeah. Okay.

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:34.250
So a lot of like a documentation. So maybe I can try to like

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:37.270
a ping you if you want these links, or maybe you can just go

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:40.330
over here into a quick start into the example notebook as

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.690
I'm showing you. Right. So you will be able to like, uh, see

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:46.010
each and everything, which I'm showing you same thing. So

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:49.970
everything is like technically public, or maybe I can try to

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:55.010
ping you this link. So all of this on formations are public.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:58.230
So I'm not saying anything like, uh, which is just close to

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:02.130
me. Okay. Now, so they have given you a quick start guide as

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:05.890
well. And as you can see, so absurd, generally, uh, they

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:09.470
call absurd to ins, uh, generally we try to say insert

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:13.270
actually in terms of like a pine cone, they say absurd. So

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:16.250
absurd is nothing new. It's actually insert. Operation that

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:19.130
they are trying to do. So here, how you will be able to

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:23.050
insert a data inside a pine cone, each and everything in a

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:26.530
detail where they are given to you, then query the data. So

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:29.370
how I'm going to query the information, query the data, how

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:32.410
I'm going to fetch a data, how I'm going to update a data,

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:35.630
how I'm going to delete a data, how I'm going to import the

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:40.350
data and a list, a record ID is target the indexes of based

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:42.950
on just an indexes, how I will be able to extract the data.

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:46.970
Everything they have given to you then, uh, like integrated

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:50.030
with the MCP server. So those who are not aware about the

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:52.950
MCP, so please go through some of my project, which I have

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:56.510
released recently, uh, in terms of MCPs, you will be able to

00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:00.330
understand. So MCP means giving an access of my, some closed

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:03.430
system to some of the AIs. That's it. That's something

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:07.010
called as MCP model context protocol, basically. So I've

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:09.690
shown multiple examples with end-to-end integration, uh,

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:12.710
basically, so maybe you can just try to go through that as

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:15.290
well. Uh, complete up and running example I have given to

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:18.590
you again, MCP is not a complex things. It's very easy

00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:22.870
things to implement and easy to learn. Okay. So this

00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:26.910
documentation is very, very like detailed. And again, in a

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:28.790
step-by-step manner, they have given you each and

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:32.130
everything. Plus they have given you a multiple examples as

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:35.970
well. Now what we are going to do. So once we are like, we

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:39.150
have logged in, let's do something over here. So let's try

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:42.410
to create at least our indexes. Uh, let's try to take some

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:45.330
data. And then let's try to store some data. Let's try to

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.650
perform some sort of a search operation. So that practically

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:52.230
we all will be able to explore it. Ready guys, everyone, are

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:57.870
we ready? Yeah. So you all are able to understand that pine

00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:01.590
cone is nothing much like we all can do it easily.

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:09.990
Yes. Everyone.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.460
So we start, uh, doing a little bit of practical over here.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:45.180
Hmm. Okay. So, uh, just do one thing. Open up your VS code.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:49.000
You can open up Colab VS code, whatever you want, and then

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.640
try to create one folder. And maybe I'll create one, uh,

00:18:53.700 --> 00:19:00.760
directory over here. So pine cone or a vector DV, I'll just

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:05.540
take to it in this way. So vector DV, okay.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:11.580
Vector DV. Okay. That folder is already available.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:15.940
Vector DV pine.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.980
Okay. So I have just created a folder guys, and, uh, inside

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.960
this folder, maybe I'll try to create a new file. Uh, so

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:33.460
today date is third. So third, uh, uh, vector dv

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:40.500
.ipynb, vector dv.ipynb, okay, fine code. So I'll start

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:44.460
doing a coding. Uh, so ultimately I have to store all of my

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.960
data where, so I have to store all of my data into this

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.200
database, which is like a global one, right? Which is

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.920
already, uh, hosted one self-managed one, basically. So I

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.980
have to, first of all, do what I have to install this client

00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:00.540
pine cone client so that I will be able to establish a

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:03.380
relationship between my local system and this particular

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:06.980
storage. And again, you can try to do a coding in node,

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.720
Python, Java, go and sell. So for all these things they have

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.020
given the SDK, but yeah, we are using Python. So I'll be

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.640
going out with a Python. So first of all, pip install

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:18.720
pinecone. So just try to do a pip install pinecone guys.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:22.180
Okay. Python environment. I can try to select some of the

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:25.900
environment. Yeah. So pip install pinecone, just do this

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:26.640
guys, everyone.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:39.280
And if you have any kind of a question, please ping me. So

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.040
anytime you want.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:54.040
So today's topic is not like tough at all. It's kind of just

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:54.520
execution.

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:04.890
Okay. So I believe installation is done. Okay. So you

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:08.790
suggestion like that UD API here to save the key in dot

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:08.930
initialization.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:19.390
So I can save it in a dot environment file the way I was

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:22.190
saving it in my last class, or maybe I can try to call it

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:29.150
here itself. Okay. Then the next step is what? So the next

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:33.030
step is basically this one. So initialize on use your API.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:37.050
So here we have to kind of with a pinecone, right? So here

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:40.710
from pinecone import pinecone serverless specs. And then you

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:43.910
have to remove this one. And then you have to replace it

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:46.770
with your own API key, where you will be able to get your

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:49.010
own API key. So if you have not stored in a beginning,

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:53.050
that's fine. Click on this API key and then create a new API

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:55.490
key. So maybe I'll try to create test and then create API

00:21:55.490 --> 00:22:00.030
key. So again, I'll try to copy it, close it, and then I can

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:03.990
try to keep it here. So this is my API key from a pinecone.

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:08.750
Okay, fine. Now execute this one. So maybe I can try to even

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:14.510
like a print. So PC. So here it is giving me an object from

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:17.270
the pinecone. It simply means that yes, everything is up and

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:19.750
running. It is able to accept and it will be able to connect

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:23.930
it as simple as that. Yeah. As simple as that. So here you

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:27.670
will be having a pinecone. So now we are able to connect to

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:30.830
a pinecone from my local system means I'm able to connect

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:34.850
from this, which is a global one to my local system, but the

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:37.130
things which I'm executing in my local, let me close my

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:38.130
other. Okay.

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:45.910
So this is basically a connection. This is basically a

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:48.430
connection between my Jupiter notebook, which is running in

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:52.610
my local system and this one, this entire system. Okay. So

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:56.150
once we are done with this one, right? Once we are done with

00:22:56.150 --> 00:23:00.230
this, then what we are supposed to do. So we can try to

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:04.050
create our indexes, right? We can try to create our indexes

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:07.510
because inside the indexes, we try to store the data.

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:10.830
Simple. So how we can try to create the indexes, even for

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:13.690
that, they have given you the entire code in this particular

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:17.570
place. Let's try to copy and paste this one. Now what is the

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:20.730
meaning of this index name means table name. I'll keep it as

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:23.330
a slanshu. So I'll, I would like to create the slanshu table

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:27.090
basically. Now PC, PC is what PC is a connection, right?

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:30.310
Pinecone connection PC. You can just change the name if you

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:33.650
want that that's completely fine. Just a variable name,

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:37.330
which is given over here. So nothing much now. So name is

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:40.890
equal to index name. Dimension is equal to two. Now shall I

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:45.600
change it guys or shall I keep it as it is? Shall I change

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.240
the dimension or shall I keep it as it is?

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.300
Yeah guys looking for advice.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.600
Yeah. So Mrityunjay is saying change it. Okay. Change it to

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:13.780
what?

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:20.700
Yes guys. Change it to what?

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:28.750
So people are saying change it, but change it to what 1536

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:32.010
change it as per the embedding model. Exactly. Sivanand. So

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:35.790
basically whatever embedding model that I'm using. So I have

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:38.970
to change it to that one. So here I'm going to use basically

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:42.910
URI as we all know, we have already used it. So as per URI,

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:45.850
so this embedding model I'm going to use and what is the

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:47.930
dimension of this one? So basically I mentioned this one is

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:51.350
1536. I'll be using 1536. If I'm going to use something

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:54.330
different in that case, I'll be using that as simple as

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:59.410
that. Yeah. So based on the model, not blindly. So my model

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:04.710
will be like 1536. So I'll just try to change it to 1536. So

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:07.450
here matrixes. You can try to change it to IP. You can try

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:11.090
to change it to cosine or maybe like a liquid and distances.

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:14.430
So there are multiple metrics as they have given to you and

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:16.370
I believe we all understand what is the meaning of the

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:20.870
matrixes, right? For similarity check. Then specs, a

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:24.110
specification for the server, serverless, it's on AWS cloud

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:27.550
US East. So I'm not taking care of this pinecone itself is

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:31.450
taking care of this. Execute it guys. So execute it. So once

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:35.590
you are going to execute it, you will be able to see that

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:37.850
inside pinecone. So execute it. In pinecone, it will create

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:41.130
a index name called Sudhanshu. So if it is going to execute

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:42.790
it successfully, it's

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:49.220
still executing 15, 16, 17, 13, okay.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:00.460
So just do it guys. Okay. So now it is telling me that name

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.300
of the index is this similarity check matrix is basically

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:06.120
cosine. Host is Sudhanshu. This, this, this, this, this

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:10.620
pinecone.io. So this is my global host specification, AWS US

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:15.060
East one, the status ready, status ready, true status ready.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.980
Vector type dense. Dimension for one, five, three, six

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:21.600
deletion protection disabled for deletion protection. So you

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.100
have to pay them otherwise they will not give you this

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:26.900
option and the tags is equal to null. No tag I have given to

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:30.220
this one. Okay. That's great. So we are able to create the

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:35.040
indexes. Now just come over here, refresh it, come over

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:38.220
here, refresh it. So you will be able to see your indexes.

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:40.640
Can I say that this was my table name, which I have created.

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:45.480
This is the indexes, which I have created, and you will be

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.600
able to see all the detail here.

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:54.310
Yeah. And if you have to connect with just this indexes,

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:57.950
right? So you will be able to like a connected. So PC dot

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:00.990
index. And then if you have to like store the data, you can

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:03.370
try to store the data. If you want, they have just given you

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:06.510
the sample, uh, with two dimension, only two dimension. Our

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:09.010
dimension is one, five, three, six. They have given you just

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:11.130
like a two dimension making

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:19.540
sense, guys, are you able to see this one? Obviously you

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:21.580
will not be able to see any record so far because we have

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:25.060
not inserted any kind of a record. We will do it in some

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:28.280
time. But, uh, yeah. Are you able to see this indexes?

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:39.410
How to know what model metrics is used for the embedding?

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:43.170
Basically this is not for like a based on the model. It's

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:46.270
basically based on the similarity check. Hope you

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:49.270
understand, uh, like what is the meaning of metrics is here.

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:53.490
This is what I have explained. What is serverless, uh,

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:57.250
capacity mode here? See serverless simple meaning is that

00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:01.170
there is a big system that they have taken and then they

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:04.770
have like a. Uh. A given an access to a multiple people.

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:08.670
This is called as serverless architecture, server dedicated

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:11.390
server architecture means there is one single machine which

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:14.970
is dedicated just for your task and serverless means there

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:17.870
is a big cluster. There is a big machine and then everyone

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:20.270
can use it as per the availability. That is something called

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:21.910
a serverless again.

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.640
So a read unit, write unit. As of now, I have not written,

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:31.420
I'm not trying to read anything. So nothing namespace is

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.860
equals to nothing configuration is equal to nothing. Okay.

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:36.580
So if you're able to see this, it simply means that, that

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:41.200
your indexes are created. Now you can try to store the data

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:44.540
because unless and until your indexes are not available, you

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:50.520
won't be able to store the data. Okay. So here let's go

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:56.100
ahead and then do one thing. Uh, let's try to store some of

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:58.920
the data, some of the information inside this one, and then

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:02.740
we will try to like, uh, save each and everything. So. So

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:06.160
here let's suppose, uh, before storing something. So let's

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.600
suppose if I have to list all the indexes, which is

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:12.760
available. So what I can do is pinecone.list list indexes.

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:16.100
So this is going to give you list of all the indexes.

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.820
Whatever indexes are available means whatever tables are

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.280
available. This is going to give you, this is again, one of

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:25.540
the inbuilt function. You will be able to find out one of

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:28.220
the inbuilt function. Let's suppose there is an index called

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:31.120
as the Hanshu, right? I have to delete that indexes. How I

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:35.700
can delete it. Okay. So again, object dot delete indexes. I

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.520
can try to call, I can try to give an index name, S U D H N

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:42.520
S S U, and then execute. It is going to delete my indexes

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.520
called as Sudhanshu, which I have created, like insert into

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.900
table, delete table, similar kind of operation. We are going

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:54.300
to do it. Please ping a previous code. Aman try to focus

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:57.460
inside the class, uh, the code which I'm using, it's already

00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:01.160
available even to you inside a pinecone. So if you're not

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.040
able to find that code, it simply means that you have not

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.220
even logged into a pinecone. That, that, that will be my

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:05.420
assumption.

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:14.650
Yeah. So now if I'm going to refresh it once again, I think

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:17.650
my Sudhanshu indexes will be, must have gone. Yeah. It's

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:20.790
gone. Right. I have just deleted. So if you have to list the

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:23.870
entire indexes, there is a function which is available. If I

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:26.470
have to delete the indexes, this is the function which is

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:28.890
available to me. So I will be able to list it. I will be

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:33.410
able to delete it. I will be able to do whatever like, uh, I

00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:37.990
want, uh, like at, as per my need, as per my requirement. So

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:42.850
one by one, one by one, uh, let's like, uh, try to, uh,

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:47.210
perform some of the operations and then let's see. So how we

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:52.190
can try to, uh, use it. So here I have created the indexes

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:55.750
and, uh, I have even deleted the indexes. Let's create our

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:56.710
indexes once again.

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:00.640
So

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.940
because of whatever indexes, which I have created, I have

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.540
just deleted that indexes.

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:13.150
Yeah.

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.400
So these are just, I mean, function guys, I'm trying to show

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:23.260
you nothing much. So again, I'm trying to create the

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:26.260
indexes. Okay. Index creation done. I can go here, I can

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:30.220
refresh it and I will be able to find out the indexes again.

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:34.480
So indexes is like, uh, again, back. Now I have to store our

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:38.100
data into this indexes. Fine. I will be able to store the

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:41.620
data into this indexes, but before that, right? So before

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:45.540
storing this data into the indexes, so I have to basically,

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:50.900
uh, like, uh, create a data. I have to convert my data into

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:53.940
its embeddings unless and until I'm not going to convert my

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:57.460
data into its embeddings, I will not be able to store it. So

00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:00.280
I believe we have done that process. Even my last, even in

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.760
my last class, we have converted the data into embeddings.

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:07.940
So let's do it. So here I'll try to go to code example and

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:12.460
embedding generation. I'll try to copy this code, right?

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:15.360
This code is already available inside the URI or embedding

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.500
generation. So this is the code. Let me ping you this code.

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:22.840
Okay. So this is the code, which is already available. So

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:26.480
where I'm trying to hit embedding endpoint. Now you have to

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:30.540
replace this one, this static with your own key. So I'll

00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:33.960
just go over here and I'll try to replace it with my own

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:39.140
key. I'll try to replace it with my own key simple so that I

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:42.720
will be able to access the API and then payload payload

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.080
wise. I can try to define whatever payload, which I'm

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:48.760
looking for means whatever text, which I would like to

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:51.600
collect. I convert into our embeddings. And in my previous

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.580
class, I have shown you like a four loop kind of approach.

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:57.300
So where I have a multiple text, and then I was able to

00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.920
convert those entire text into the embeddings, into the

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:02.940
respective embeddings. Just in last class, I have shown you

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:06.240
that one as well. So just like a loop, right? So I can try

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:08.780
to convert only one data and then I can try to convert my

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:12.120
like multiple data into its respective embeddings. So here,

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:16.420
here input is basically this one. Maybe I can try to change

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:24.590
it. I can say like. Okay. Name is, is Sudhanshu Kumar. I

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:33.870
used to teach all the technology. Okay, fine. So this is my

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:37.490
payload. This is my model as simple as that. So it is going

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:41.130
to convert this entire things into embeddings by using this

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:43.950
particular model that I have. So request dot post, like

00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:47.990
everything is like already given to me, right? So I will be

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:50.910
able to convert everything into the embeddings. And this is

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:53.330
going to just return the embedding. This function is going

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:56.430
to return the embeddings. So embeddings of whatever text

00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:59.430
that we have given. Okay. No model name NumPy, not an issue.

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:05.350
So pip install I N S T A double L N U M P Y. So the

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:08.430
environment which I'm using in that NumPy is not installed.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:13.580
Fine guys, everyone.

00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:18.060
Yeah.

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:27.030
Fine. So are we able to get this function and just replace

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:29.830
it with your key? Otherwise, when you are going to call this

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:32.110
function, it'll give you an issue. This is just a function,

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:34.150
right? This is just a function. So we are going to call it.

00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:37.790
So now what we can do is so we can try to call this

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:43.690
function. So E M E M B double D I N G S embeddings,

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:48.010
underscore data, right? And then generate embeddings. I'm

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:53.210
calling this function. So it is able to generate the

00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:56.090
embeddings. Basically it is able to generate the embeddings.

00:34:56.390 --> 00:34:59.090
So this is going to return me what it is going to return me

00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:01.950
embeddings. So basically. This embedding data, this

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:05.310
embedding data is nothing but this embeddings of length,

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:08.470
which equally one, five, three, six for a sentence, which

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:11.230
one for this particular sentence. My name is Anshu Kumar. I

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:14.470
used to teach technology. I can even try to parameterize it

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:17.450
if I want. So maybe I can try to just replace it with the

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:24.310
data data. And here I can try to give input as a data. So

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:26.970
here, when I'm going to call it, I can try to pass my own

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:30.670
data. So this is my own data for.

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:42.680
Okay. So what has happened? I think there is a formatted a

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.300
string I suppose to find

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:03.320
guys, are we able to do it?

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:15.800
Yes. Everyone.

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:28.430
Yeah. So it will be able to generate the embeddings simple.

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:32.390
So here, whatever text, which I'm going to pass. So for that

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:34.570
text, it is going to give me the embedding. This is what

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:37.190
this function is going to do. Now what I have supposed to do

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:40.090
is I'm supposed to store this information. I'm supposed to

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:44.590
store this data. Basically into my vector DB here. So inside

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:47.450
this indexes, I would like to store this entire information.

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:50.430
So how I'm going to store this entire information. Again,

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:53.030
there is a function called an absurd pine cone, absurd

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:56.070
function. So absurd is nothing but technically it's a insert

00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:59.710
operation that we are supposed to do. So here, what we can

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:02.470
do is so pine cone, this is the connection. And then I can

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:04.950
try to call absurd up.

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:15.580
Uh, yeah. So here we have basically, uh, index name.

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:27.250
So index dot absurd, I have to call. So yeah. Pine cone, dot

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:32.070
I N D X, first of all, call pine cone, dot index. And then

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:36.030
your index name is what your index name is on shoe. Let's

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:38.530
suppose this is the index name. So try to store it inside

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:43.650
our index. And with respect to this index, you can try to

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:48.970
call I N D X index. Dot. Absurd. Now you will be able to

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:51.870
find the function with respect to the index indexes absurd

00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:55.550
function. So here, this function I'm going to use. And with

00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:57.870
the help of this function, I will be basically storing

00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:02.390
information inside this particular index index Sudhanshu

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:06.970
means I will be storing my data over here. So my embedding

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:09.910
function, I'm able to call, as you can see, I'm able to

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:13.370
convert any kind of a text information into its respective

00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:16.070
embeddings. So I'm able to generate the respective

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:20.070
embeddings. Now I have to store this embeddings, uh, into

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:23.670
the indexes, which I have created inside a pine cone, inside

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:27.490
a pine cone, right again. So I can try to even take a help

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:31.250
from here. So absurd data. So what kind of, uh, like a

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:35.750
format, uh, which, uh, uh, it supports basically. So at the

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:39.650
time of, uh, insertion of the data, there are multiple ways

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:42.610
that they have given to you. Otherwise you can just try to

00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:46.530
follow my way. So here I'm going to absurd the data. So

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:49.990
while up sorting our data over here, so maybe I can try to

00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:54.090
give a ID, a kind of a primary key, basically. So I can try

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:57.010
to give item item

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:05.140
ID 0 0 1. Let's suppose I'm going to give, and then I'm

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:10.760
going to like, uh, call embedding data dot to list, convert

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:15.100
it into a compatible format and then, uh, try to maybe like,

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:20.360
uh, uh, give over here. Give me a lot of, uh, Meta

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.580
information if you want, if you don't want a Meta

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:28.410
information, then in that case, it's fine. Name. So the on

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:28.630
shoe,

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.020
info,

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:49.860
personal info, let's suppose. So in this way, whatever

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:52.260
embedding that I've created, I'm just trying to store it.

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:56.660
I'll be talking about like a bad size must be a positive in

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:57.000
teaser.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:21.300
Okay. So it is giving me this. One. for this because there

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:24.040
are some embeddings which is so

00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:42.010
here absurd the

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:55.380
function for absurd so as a list I can try to pass here list

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:59.320
then as a list

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:06.070
it's just a syntactical mistake guys let me correct it okay

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:14.190
so this is list this is list this one this one is fine and

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:29.420
repeat the type class string invalid vector value passed to

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:36.160
list looks fine to me why

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:50.200
it is giving me an issue because

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:55.450
everything looks fine yeah

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:10.060
so embedding data dot to list this is correct who's

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:37.530
like this so santos has suggested me something let me check

00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:42.170
x laurium if some this this this even

00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:53.780
this one should work I don't think it will not work and I

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:59.380
don't see any misinformation just let me let me like correct

00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:03.240
it if there is a mistake because I don't think that there is

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:07.840
a mistake here invalid vector value passed cannot be

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:10.720
interpreted class string there

00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:56.270
is a tuple issue so it's

00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:04.750
a minor mistake guys

00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:11.820
okay now it's done yeah the only mistake was basically it

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:15.140
was expecting inside the list this as a tuple that's it

00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:17.640
means like inside the list we can try to keep a multiple

00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:22.260
item this is only one item so means for one item id I am

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:24.180
trying to give basically a primary key I am trying to give

00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:26.360
embedding vector I am trying to give and this is just a meta

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:29.240
information trying to attach yeah this is just a meta

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.720
information which I am trying to attach along with this one

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:35.320
as simple as that so here upserted record count is equal to

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:39.300
one now if I'll go and check so it has upserted the record

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:44.740
where is my pine cone so my pine cone and yeah as you can

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:49.340
see that it has upserted this item id name is equal to the

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:51.260
answer this is the meta information it is trying to showcase

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:55.660
to me right and then if I'm going to click on fetch so you

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:58.280
must be able to see the embed things so this is what it is

00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:02.260
trying to do so item id values and then meta information

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:04.880
meta information is equals to name is equal to this is what

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:08.300
I'm trying to save and whatever you want you will be able to

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:11.800
save it you can try to even give a name space I'll talk

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:14.360
about name space in some time so it's a like a very simple

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:17.760
but amazing concept you will be able to find out and you can

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:20.560
come over here you can try to even edit the record you can

00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:23.300
try to give a name space you can try to give an id over here

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:27.080
you can try to add as many as like a meta value if you want

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:29.680
you can try to give as many as pass value as you want so

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:33.560
from if like this database itself you will be able to make a

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:37.040
changes but yeah it shows that that I'm able to store my

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:41.160
information so item id is equals to zero zero one uh meta

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:44.080
information also and then I'm able to store this particular

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:48.700
like a record over here is it making sense to all of us guys

00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:54.840
let me ping you this code yeah santosh

00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:11.230
has pinged me this code even this will work everything will

00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:14.430
work so what's on those is trying to do is so vector id id

00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:17.370
is equal to this value is equal to embedded to list it is

00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:20.490
trying to take and then metadata is equals to so meta wise

00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:24.450
you are trying to store the like I believe the text that you

00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:27.950
are trying to store and yeah so even this will this will

00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:36.320
work basically so maybe inside the same like a index I can

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:41.980
try to store even this one my embedding is basically not

00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:46.200
just embedding data so I'll be using that and then I'll try

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:49.420
to store even that information yeah so update count is

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:53.520
equals to two and then maybe uh ankit has also pinged me

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:57.340
something so let me check what ankit has done okay so ankit

00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:02.520
has done almost the same thing yeah so ankit has done the

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:06.840
same thing uh even this is going to work so let me name it

00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:09.860
as a zero zero two so that there should not be any kind of a

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:13.180
conflict email data is not defined embeddings data

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:19.600
embeddings data okay so here is a record which I am able to

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.880
insert now if I'll go and check so I must be having a

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:31.540
multiple records now yeah so inside one indexes so I have

00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:35.520
basically multiple record as you can see so we have a record

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:39.320
we have a record over here and then we have a record in this

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:43.480
particular place I can try to check one by one all of these

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:47.920
records so item info personal information ankit name this

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:52.180
one so he has given that meta information so as per your

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:55.040
information it is trying to store all of these information

00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:59.980
inside your databases making sense guys we are able to store

00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:00.620
some information

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:49.320
how to retrieve information we stored I'll be talking about

00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:50.940
it just wait yeah

00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:59.430
so basically we are able to create indexes we are able to

00:48:59.430 --> 00:49:04.670
store the data into a particular indexes that that's

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:10.170
completely fine right so now it's time to maybe like query

00:49:10.170 --> 00:49:12.930
the information right maybe it's time to query the

00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:16.790
information so here what we can do is so let's suppose if we

00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:21.150
have to fetch just based on the ids right the ids that we

00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:24.910
have given or by default system is going to give the ids so

00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:27.650
I can try to do one thing so I can try to write index dot

00:49:27.650 --> 00:49:31.650
fetch over here right fetch over here and And then over

00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:35.090
here, so I can try to pass basically inside this, I can try

00:49:35.090 --> 00:49:38.650
to pass basically IDs, right? I can try to pass over here

00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:42.030
IDs and then based on the IDs, it will be able to fetch the

00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:45.370
information. So for example, if I would like to fetch just

00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:48.690
this information, so I can just try to give the name of the

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:52.530
IDs. I can even list down the IDs and I will be able to

00:49:52.530 --> 00:49:54.930
fetch the information that what kind of information which

00:49:54.930 --> 00:49:58.650
has been stored inside the pine cone. This is just based on

00:49:58.650 --> 00:50:02.670
the like IDs, simple search or simple, like any kind of

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:04.930
operation that we try to perform with respect to any other

00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:09.730
databases. Now, if we have to do a search based on the

00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:14.130
similarity, then how I will be able to do a search based on

00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:17.910
the similarity. So yeah, it is able to fetch all this

00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:21.030
information, right? Fetch response. I'm able to get it. I'm

00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:24.650
able to get my vector values over here. Now, let's suppose I

00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:27.870
have to perform the search over here. So how I will be able

00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:31.490
to do a search, for example, so let's suppose I have a text

00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:35.150
information over here, right? I have a text information over

00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:40.170
here and the text says that, that my name is, my name is

00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:44.730
Sudhanshu, right? This is my text. Now I have to fetch

00:50:44.730 --> 00:50:48.710
information from my DB. So which is closer to this

00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:51.070
particular text. This is what we do in terms of vector

00:50:51.070 --> 00:50:53.730
search, right? That my name is Sudhanshu is one of the

00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:56.790
sentence. Now with this, with respect to this. This

00:50:56.790 --> 00:51:00.370
sentence, which sentence is closer inside my DB, right?

00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:04.190
Inside my pine cone. So how I will be able to do that. So to

00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:07.410
do that, first of all, I have to convert this input text.

00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:10.450
This is my input text, right? So I have to convert my input

00:51:10.450 --> 00:51:13.570
text basically in what? So I have to convert my input text

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:18.390
into embeddings because, and again, inside your like a pine

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:21.530
cone, it is trying to perform those operations, similarity

00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:25.050
check operation with respect to vector to vector. Yeah. So

00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:28.370
to convert this into a embedding. I'm going to use our same

00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:31.470
function, the function which I've used to for the storage.

00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:34.270
So text, now this is going to give me embeddings,

00:51:37.110 --> 00:51:40.410
embeddings to search,

00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:46.830
let's suppose, right? So this is going to give me embeddings

00:51:46.830 --> 00:51:49.370
for our searching purposes. So, okay, I, first of all, I'm

00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:52.170
converting this entire information into its embeddings. So

00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:55.890
embedding to search. And then what I can do is I can try to

00:51:55.890 --> 00:52:02.430
call my INDX index dot query over here now here. So query

00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:05.230
wise. I'm going to pass my vector. So based on the vector.

00:52:05.310 --> 00:52:07.610
So what's my vector embedding to search. This is my vector.

00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:12.270
So this is my vector and then how many result I'm looking

00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:15.370
for. So maybe I'm looking for a top case. So give me just

00:52:15.370 --> 00:52:18.410
top two result, which is matching to this one and then

00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:22.750
include metadata. There is a parameter I N C L U D E include

00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:25.610
underscore M E T A D A T A. So whenever you are showing me

00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:28.550
this record, show me it's metadata as well. So give me a

00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:31.410
true, otherwise you can skip this particular part. That's

00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:34.930
completely fine. Now, this is going to give you basically a

00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:39.950
result, R E S U L T result, R E S U L T result. And then you

00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:44.290
can try to maybe like, uh, put into this result or into this

00:52:44.290 --> 00:52:49.050
result. So this is our vector search making sense guys.

00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:52.810
Okay. There is some spelling mistake, unable to prepare the

00:52:52.810 --> 00:52:58.170
ND area for serialization. Okay, fine. So here I have made

00:52:58.170 --> 00:53:01.770
as very small mistake. Just do a two list.

00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:12.930
So this is basically a vector search, I believe same thing

00:53:12.930 --> 00:53:15.090
we have done even last time with respect to a chroma DB.

00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:27.140
Fine guys, how we can retrieve the information based on the

00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:29.760
vector. So based on the ID, I can try to retrieve based on

00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:32.360
the name space. I can try to retrieve based on the vector

00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:36.320
search. I will be able to retrieve it. It's very easy. So,

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:40.040
yeah, as you can see that first five values. So like, uh, I,

00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:44.440
two, three. Item number, item ID two. So it's a matching a

00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:47.860
more closer to this one. And item number one is matching

00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:51.440
more close to this one. So item number one score is

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:56.420
basically 62% and then 62.5566661. Both of them are like

00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:59.640
giving me similar kind of a score. So yeah, these are the

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:04.340
top two, which I'm able to get. These two informations is

00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:07.980
very much closer to the data that I'm trying to search for.

00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:14.710
Yeah. So this is basically. A vector based search, and this

00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:17.870
is the search, which I will be using at the time of a RIG.

00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:21.430
So whenever I'll try to like a builder RIG system, I'll try

00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:24.770
to attach this one along with my search query, and then I'll

00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:28.690
try to search inside my query, inside my LLMs. Making sense

00:54:28.690 --> 00:54:32.010
guys, anyone who is having a doubt, question queries, please

00:54:32.010 --> 00:54:32.530
let me know.

00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:38.510
Yeah. Anil your doubt is clear.

00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:47.410
All right. So we are able to insert it. We are able to

00:54:47.410 --> 00:54:47.970
delete it.

00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:06.030
Yeah. There is something called as like a. Namespace. So

00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:09.270
whenever we try to like a store the data, so we can try to

00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:13.310
maybe create a namespace inside the namespace. Uh, we can

00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:18.150
try to basically create a indexes. So for example, again, so

00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:22.050
this will help, uh, like, uh, out a system to cluster the

00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:24.650
information into, uh, different, different, like, uh,

00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:29.030
namespaces. So here, if you will come, they must have given

00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:32.610
you one picture. Let me find out that.

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:46.930
So what is. A namespace by the way. So. Yeah. So now this is

00:55:46.930 --> 00:55:49.570
the picture which has been given to you. So see guys, what

00:55:49.570 --> 00:55:52.950
happens is namespace helps you out to again, store a data

00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:56.330
into a optimized way and search our data into the optimized

00:55:56.330 --> 00:55:58.570
way. So this is the architecture of the namespace that you

00:55:58.570 --> 00:56:03.370
will be able to find out. So here inside like a index a.

00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:06.410
Right. So let's suppose I have created the index a, so I can

00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:10.070
try to divide this index a on all the information, which I'm

00:56:10.070 --> 00:56:14.170
trying to store into namespace. One, two, and three. means I

00:56:14.170 --> 00:56:17.150
can adjust like I'm giving ID ID is been attached to the

00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:20.690
record again on top of that so we can try to create another

00:56:20.690 --> 00:56:23.050
different different kind of a cluster or segment you can say

00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:26.150
and then inside a namespace I will be able to store this

00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:28.210
this this this this information this this this this

00:56:28.210 --> 00:56:32.830
information so maybe I can try to like do a absurd or maybe

00:56:32.830 --> 00:56:36.430
I can try to query one namespace at one point of a time so

00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:39.110
in this way things will be even more structure and things

00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:44.330
will be even more aligned now what does that mean by the way

00:56:44.330 --> 00:56:48.130
so it's nothing but let's suppose I have my PC so my PC is

00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:50.510
equal to let's suppose index my computer is all let's

00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:53.410
suppose I have a C drive right my C drive is equal to my

00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:57.030
index for example again this concept is very much like a

00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:59.210
popular with respect to any databases so let's suppose I

00:56:59.210 --> 00:57:03.090
have a C drive so my C drive is basically a index I'm going

00:57:03.090 --> 00:57:07.930
to consider this as a index okay this is like here yeah so

00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:11.490
this C drive is basically our index I have now inside a C

00:57:11.490 --> 00:57:15.670
drive I'm going to create a multiple directory right I'm

00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:18.570
going to create a multiple directory so directory number dir

00:57:18.570 --> 00:57:23.390
like one dir maybe a two then three and then four now inside

00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:26.730
this directory so I'm going to keep a file so excel file

00:57:26.730 --> 00:57:29.710
let's suppose excel sheet I'm trying to keep so a b and then

00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:35.430
c then d e f then e f g i j k and so on right so this is

00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:38.410
what a namespace works like so it just try to create the

00:57:38.410 --> 00:57:42.010
hierarchy right hierarchy so that my data segregation will

00:57:42.010 --> 00:57:44.850
be much better that's it this is where the namespace comes

00:57:44.850 --> 00:57:48.930
into a picture now so whenever you are trying to store the

00:57:48.930 --> 00:57:51.990
information so you can try to attach or you can try to give

00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:55.830
a namespace as a parameter so that all of that in that

00:57:55.830 --> 00:57:59.950
information will be stored in one of the namespace for

00:57:59.950 --> 00:58:04.030
example I'm going to show you just now right so let me show

00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:06.450
you a practical implementation of it I'll take one of the

00:58:06.450 --> 00:58:06.550
namespace in this case so let me show you a practical

00:58:06.550 --> 00:58:06.590
implementation of it

00:58:10.110 --> 00:58:11.350
I'll take one of the namespace so let's takes this data.

00:58:11.450 --> 00:58:15.170
Okay. I'll take this data itself. So let's suppose I'm

00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:18.530
trying to store this data, right? So this is one of the

00:58:18.530 --> 00:58:25.150
instance of this data control C now comma control V comma

00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:28.990
control V comma control V comma control V comma control V

00:58:28.990 --> 00:58:33.270
comma control V comma control V comma control V. Okay. So

00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:38.250
now how many records we have now? Let's see how many records

00:58:38.250 --> 00:58:38.990
we have now.

00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:48.940
Okay. So can I say that I have so many records over here and

00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:51.920
item ID I'm going to change. So item ID is equal to two

00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:54.280
everywhere. I'm storing the same data. For example, just

00:58:54.280 --> 00:59:03.500
assume for that four, then five, then six, then seven, then

00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:08.520
eight, then nine. Yeah. So total nine record I'm trying to

00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:12.280
store. Fine. Total nine record I am trying to store. Now as

00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:15.660
per this diagram, if you will go and check. So total nine

00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:18.520
records. As you can see, see records, right? So total nine

00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:21.100
records I'm trying to store. Index I have already defined.

00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:24.180
So whatever indexes, which I'm calling in that index, it is

00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:26.320
going to like, so downstream index, it is going to store

00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:30.480
each and everything. Now all the nine, like this record, I

00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:36.400
can tag to one name space, basically N A M E S P A C S P A C

00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:41.260
name space is equals to like S U D H. So the one name space.

00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:45.820
Fine. So now it is going to store this entire information.

00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:49.260
It is going to update this entire information into one of

00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:52.520
the name space. It is going to attach it. Now I'll go and

00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:55.680
I'll try to check. So whether it has attached it or not.

01:00:00.810 --> 01:00:03.530
Yeah. So as you can see now, one name space has been

01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:07.910
created. Okay. This is the default one by the way. No, I

01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:10.330
think it has not stored. What, what happened?

01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:25.410
Oh, it has converted into the C's file. Fine. Absorted count

01:00:25.410 --> 01:00:28.850
is equal to nine. Now if I'll go and check. So inside one

01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:32.250
name space, it must have a stored. So even if you are not

01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:35.170
going to create a name space, it will create a default name

01:00:35.170 --> 01:00:37.910
space. Now, as you can see, so aren't you? And then nine,

01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:41.410
then action, a delete, and then here. So you can try to

01:00:41.410 --> 01:00:44.370
browse all of these information and then you will be able to

01:00:44.370 --> 01:00:47.470
see it has even showing you the name space that, okay, fine.

01:00:47.590 --> 01:00:51.290
So this belongs to this one name space. So just like this,

01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:54.630
one name space, I have a stored nine number of records. Now,

01:00:54.730 --> 01:00:58.170
similarly, I can try to like, uh, take this record. I can

01:00:58.190 --> 01:01:02.750
take this one and then inside another bucket, I'm going to a

01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:06.210
store. So this will be a stored inside SUDH two. So this

01:01:06.210 --> 01:01:10.370
actually helps you out even to like a, instead of a store,

01:01:10.490 --> 01:01:13.150
instead of exploring the entire data. So maybe I can try to

01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:16.970
like do a search and I can try to optimize my search query.

01:01:17.050 --> 01:01:19.890
So where it is going to help me out by the way, guys. So it

01:01:19.890 --> 01:01:22.670
is going to help me out in terms of a search. For example,

01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:28.190
uh, maybe I have a millions of records, millions of records.

01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:30.690
And then I have a 10 name. I have a three name space, for

01:01:30.690 --> 01:01:33.570
example. So name space, number one, name space, number two,

01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:35.690
and name space, number three, and I have a millions of

01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:40.630
records now. So let's suppose like a, I have like a 3

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:43.730
million record here, 3 million record here, 3 million record

01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:47.650
here. Now, whenever I'm trying to fire a query on this

01:01:47.650 --> 01:01:52.050
indexes. So inside this index, total number of record is

01:01:52.050 --> 01:01:55.230
equals to 9 million, right? Total number of records is equal

01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:58.030
to 9 million. So this query is supposed to do a matching

01:01:58.190 --> 01:02:01.870
with 9 million, right? 9 million basically. But let's

01:02:01.870 --> 01:02:04.610
suppose if I'm trying to give a name space, I'm trying to

01:02:04.610 --> 01:02:06.830
give a bucketing name space. I'm saying that, that, okay,

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:10.310
no, don't search everywhere. Just try to search on this name

01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:12.890
space, this particular name space. So from 9 million,

01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:15.770
instead of doing a search on 9 million, I can try to do a

01:02:15.770 --> 01:02:18.630
search only on 3 million. So this is where name space is

01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:21.130
going to help you out. So this is just a, like a bucketing,

01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:24.370
I would say, right? So bucketing, I would say in this

01:02:24.370 --> 01:02:26.870
particular place, the bucketing concept that we used to

01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:32.090
like, uh, understand even in case of a SQL system, right? So

01:02:32.090 --> 01:02:36.670
hope all of you are able to understand like a name space. So

01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:40.410
name space is nothing but just a partition, uh, into the

01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:45.090
name space and all update, uh, query absurd queries and

01:02:45.090 --> 01:02:48.470
others data operation always target one name space. This has

01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:51.950
two main benefit. One is a multi tenancy and another one is

01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:54.510
a faster query. So this is the advantage that you will be

01:02:54.510 --> 01:02:56.730
able to get. And again, this concepts are nothing new. It's

01:02:56.730 --> 01:02:59.190
coming from the database. This is the data basis that we are

01:02:59.190 --> 01:03:02.250
using. Even the legacy one everywhere. So we try to like,

01:03:02.290 --> 01:03:06.830
uh, use the exact same. Is it making sense to all of us

01:03:06.830 --> 01:03:07.010
guys?

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:10.700
Yes.

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:15.000
Name space.

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:28.080
Name space is similar to schema. No, basically it's an index

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:30.620
is similar to schema. Name space is basically similar to a

01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:30.940
partition.

01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:41.480
Okay. Now moving ahead. And let's try to see something like

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:44.940
a different over here. So I believe this pine cone is clear.

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:47.520
Pine cone is clear to all of us. Now, let's move to the

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:50.880
name. Next database. And that database is basically a baby.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.400
So as per your syllabus, let's try to understand baby.

01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:57.040
Again, baby, it is a managed one. I can try to log in first

01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:00.420
and then I can try to show it to you. So baby, it is again,

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:03.480
not a big deal to handle. Uh, easily you will be able to

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:08.660
handle it, but, but the homework for today from this pine

01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:12.040
cone is try to go through all of this update, insert, fetch,

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:15.960
delete at least once executed in your system, the store, the

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:19.820
information, and then forget about it. Right. Because there

01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:23.480
is nothing inside a pine cone or on any of this DB that it

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:26.740
should go twice or thrice. It's like a very simple to

01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:29.820
implement. So nothing much, but at least once just go

01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:32.580
through it and then leave it because we are anyhow going to

01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:33.160
use this one.

01:04:42.590 --> 01:04:48.600
So database baby yet. So just try to log, just try to go to

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:52.180
a baby at guys and a similar kind of operation. We all will

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:56.480
be able to do even in case of a baby yet. So here allow,

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:56.900
all.

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:06.530
Now, so click on, try now. Now. So let's go ahead and this,

01:05:06.550 --> 01:05:11.510
try to create the account. So email ID is okay.

01:05:22.090 --> 01:05:25.150
First of all, let me do a sign up. I have an account with a

01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:31.850
different one. So email, I did this, then password sign

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:37.560
up email

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:40.920
verification.

01:05:55.090 --> 01:06:00.470
Okay. This is done. Right. This is done. Now what we can do.

01:06:00.550 --> 01:06:03.090
So again, we can try to go ahead with the, you're, similar

01:06:03.090 --> 01:06:07.310
kind of approach this is again another just a db that you

01:06:07.310 --> 01:06:12.410
will be able to find out and are you able to log in guys

01:06:12.410 --> 01:06:14.830
everyone so please say yes or no inside your chat

01:06:32.010 --> 01:06:35.110
yeah so are you able to log inside the like a waviot guys

01:06:35.110 --> 01:06:36.250
yeah

01:06:46.970 --> 01:06:48.150
amman is saying yes okay

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:45.400
now so they have given you the documentation over here maybe

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:49.400
i can try to click on read map more but before that so you

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:52.080
have to do what so you have to create a cluster so unless i

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:54.940
don't have a cluster so you will not be able to do anything

01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:58.300
and inside your cluster so everything will be like up and

01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:00.640
running so they are giving you a sandbox they are giving you

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:03.900
a serverless and they are giving you enterprise so for

01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:06.340
enterprise you have to contact the sale for serverless you

01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:09.700
have to like add a billing information but sandbox is

01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:12.020
basically for the practice you will be able to get some

01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:15.360
limited space over here again a limited shared space you

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:18.580
will be able to get and you can create a sandbox in this

01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:22.300
particular place with like a couple of clicks so just you

01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:24.740
click on this cluster create cluster and then otherwise you

01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:28.260
can come over here and then again you can start from here so

01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:31.500
create cluster and like i said serverless and for enterprise

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:34.020
so you have to pay the price for sandbox you don't have to

01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:37.680
pay the price so here click and then create it so here i can

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:41.460
try to give my cluster name so cluster name is basically a

01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:44.560
uran cluster i'm going to create so click on create guys

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:51.090
okay so it is trying to make my uran cluster up and running

01:08:51.090 --> 01:08:55.770
as of now it's like a commencing this entire cluster so just

01:08:55.770 --> 01:08:58.390
wait for a couple of minute and it will be done then

01:08:58.390 --> 01:09:03.250
obviously i will be able to hit my entire cluster pinecone

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:23.900
and baby-ate are doing the exact same job yes almost same

01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:27.940
job both we are trying to use even your like a chroma db

01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:29.980
that i have discussed my previous class that was doing the

01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:33.480
same job i was trying to store the embeddings even the fa

01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:37.340
iss facebook aic mouth that is going to do the same thing

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:40.540
but there is a bit of like a difference as you will be able

01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:40.540
to like a lot of these things that's just for management of

01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:40.540
my code for example let's work on this everybody i objected

01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:40.540
to get to this j認 appears that it is a code but it will pass

01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:40.540
it to the projectами that will pass skills but you have to

01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:40.540
start with stinks in this one but the basis is that you have

01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:42.660
to like a不會 be able to find out not just in terms of

01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:44.880
implementation obviously in terms of syntaxes it's different

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:48.160
but yeah even in terms of the way it stores the data and the

01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:51.420
philosophy down the line that they're trying to use it okay

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:14.760
so it is taking some time to like uh create my cluster

01:11:05.090 --> 01:11:08.910
okay manju mirtyunja is saying set three seven sixty eight

01:11:08.910 --> 01:11:12.270
dimension is chosen here it would be one five three six yeah

01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:14.630
i have chosen the default one okay

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:26.020
so now it seems that like uh my cluster is up and running

01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:26.680
and

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:39.630
then i could try to click on correct now here so they have

01:11:39.630 --> 01:11:45.550
given you basically a complete like a documentation even for

01:11:45.550 --> 01:11:49.510
this one so this is going to help you out in terms of

01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:52.670
connecting with the baby in a very first place so with the

01:11:52.670 --> 01:11:56.070
help of these things you will be able to connect it now

01:11:56.070 --> 01:12:00.930
let's let's like try to connect each and like everything so

01:12:00.930 --> 01:12:05.150
with the baby it so here i can just try to copy this example

01:12:05.150 --> 01:12:11.010
python example and then i can try to paste it i can remove

01:12:11.010 --> 01:12:14.590
it here so baby at url and api key is required right so here

01:12:14.590 --> 01:12:20.250
i can directly like give a baby at uh url and then i can try

01:12:20.250 --> 01:12:23.830
to give a baby at api key so what is the baby at url so baby

01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:26.570
at url you can get it from here from your connector string

01:12:26.570 --> 01:12:32.290
so this is my baby at url i'm going to give a baby at url by

01:12:32.290 --> 01:12:36.670
the way and my api key so i can try to get my api's key from

01:12:36.670 --> 01:12:43.530
here so api keys and then copy admin api keys and i can try

01:12:43.530 --> 01:12:47.390
to give my api keys in this particular place for a baby at

01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:50.870
as simple as that now in this way right in this way i will

01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:54.110
be able to connect with the baby but before that so i have

01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:56.290
to do installation without installation i will not be able

01:12:56.290 --> 01:12:59.710
to touch my baby so to install do the installation you have

01:12:59.710 --> 01:13:03.250
to give a pip install bivyad client so you have to install

01:13:03.250 --> 01:13:07.890
this part so once you are going to like a install this one

01:13:07.890 --> 01:13:12.270
then obviously you will be able to call these things so

01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:14.930
let's execute this particular part and it's giving me true

01:13:14.930 --> 01:13:18.690
it's true means this is ready i am able to connect to the

01:13:18.690 --> 01:13:21.590
bivyad cluster this is what it means fine

01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:26.680
guys making sense yeah

01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:37.360
everyone so

01:13:46.670 --> 01:13:47.850
are we are we able to do it guys

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:05.440
so are we able to cut it with the bivyad or

01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:32.310
Anjith asking me a question that is there any storage limit

01:14:32.310 --> 01:14:36.070
on these vector db's obviously if the pay per go so

01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:39.770
basically like depends how much you are using and as but

01:14:39.770 --> 01:14:42.950
that you will have to pay the price for the same thing

01:14:48.830 --> 01:14:54.520
so fine guys am i am audible to anyone guys not able to see

01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:57.040
anyone in a chat yeah

01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:13.090
so this is how I will be able to connect with the bivyad now

01:15:13.090 --> 01:15:16.650
once I am able to connect with the bivyad. I'll do the exact

01:15:16.650 --> 01:15:20.010
same thing. So I'll just try to like, you know, create the

01:15:20.010 --> 01:15:24.610
embeddings and I'll try to store the data inside those

01:15:24.610 --> 01:15:27.410
embeddings. Then I will be able to perform a search

01:15:27.410 --> 01:15:33.170
operation. How to install Baviot. This one. People install

01:15:33.170 --> 01:15:33.790
Baviot client.

01:15:37.050 --> 01:15:41.030
Yeah. So just do people install Baviot client and then you

01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:44.150
can just try to use your connect over here. So the connect

01:15:44.150 --> 01:15:47.730
cluster option which is given to you and remove this part

01:15:47.730 --> 01:15:50.610
directly copy and paste the Baviot URL. The URL is already

01:15:50.610 --> 01:15:54.310
given to you over here and your API key. So your API key is

01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:56.890
already given inside this one. So this is the admin API key.

01:15:56.970 --> 01:15:59.430
This is for just for the read only. So if you would like to

01:15:59.430 --> 01:16:02.330
share this API key with someone else. So now you will be

01:16:02.330 --> 01:16:06.610
able to like connect and then after connecting this one. So

01:16:06.610 --> 01:16:11.390
here you will be able to store now a data. So let's try to

01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:14.330
store some of the information. Let's try to store some of

01:16:14.330 --> 01:16:18.850
the data inside this Baviot. So to store the data, I'll be

01:16:18.850 --> 01:16:23.350
using first of all my generate embeddings. So this is the

01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:26.730
function I'm going to call which is a URI function and I'm

01:16:26.730 --> 01:16:31.350
going to store this is to test my Baviot

01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:42.590
database by Sudhanshu fine. So let's try to generate

01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:45.890
embeddings over here. So here. Like.

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:53.280
Embeddings. So whatever embeddings that I will be able to

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:56.600
generate out of this data for this particular data, I'll try

01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:01.000
to store those embeddings inside my Baviot. So here is a

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.040
client which is already available to me. So I can try to

01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:11.780
call CLI CLI ENT client client. So I can try to call

01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:16.240
basically like a data. So I can call like a data underscore

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:23.000
object dot create and then inside that I can try to give my

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.160
entire information. I can try to give my entire data set. So

01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:28.720
whatever data which I would like to store so I can try to

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:32.820
give it here and I will be able to store each and every kind

01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:36.100
of data. So here there is a parameter called as data object.

01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:41.860
There is a parameter called as data underscore OBJs OBJCT.

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:47.020
Data object. object now inside this parameter so i can try

01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:52.000
to set my information so my text is basically what so my

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:58.560
text is basically my like uh let's suppose i'm going to

01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:04.280
store it into some text data so

01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:24.130
this is my data right so basically i can try to write text

01:18:24.130 --> 01:18:28.950
is equals to my text data and let's suppose i am passing

01:18:28.950 --> 01:18:36.070
this text data into my embeddings fine so i have a text data

01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:40.010
over here and again so there is a parameter called as author

01:18:40.010 --> 01:18:45.010
a-u-t-h-o-r author so author is basically who so author is

01:18:45.010 --> 01:18:47.950
basically me let's suppose the meta information so s-u-d-h-n

01:18:47.950 --> 01:18:53.510
-s-h-u and then there is a another information called as

01:18:53.510 --> 01:19:01.670
class class underscore name class underscore name so class

01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:05.830
name let's suppose i'm trying to give as a meta document

01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:09.070
anything i can try to give and then i can try to like uh

01:19:09.070 --> 01:19:16.330
give a vector so vector the final things v-e-c-t-v-e-c-t-o-r

01:19:16.330 --> 01:19:21.130
vector so vector is nothing but the embeddings that we have

01:19:21.130 --> 01:19:24.470
generated so this is my embeddings so this is my embeddings

01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:28.250
dot to list as simple as that so same thing i was trying to

01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:32.210
store even inside my pine cone and same thing i'm trying to

01:19:32.210 --> 01:19:35.750
store even inside this one if everything goes well so in

01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:38.390
that case it will be able to store this particular

01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:41.950
information otherwise it will not be able to store the

01:19:41.950 --> 01:19:44.490
information so this is how i am going to store the

01:19:44.490 --> 01:19:46.950
information so beaver client object has no attribute called

01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:56.130
as data d-a-t-a-o-b-j-e-c-t data object okay so let me check

01:19:56.130 --> 01:20:02.870
i'll check its documentation they keep on changing this i'm

01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:08.110
going to follow the old material then so maybe i can try to

01:20:08.110 --> 01:20:11.310
follow along with their documentation install

01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:29.940
setup everything that we have done and they have they have

01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:32.860
created a beautiful like a again documentation as well guys

01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:36.180
so you don't have to like worry about anything but yeah so

01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:43.660
baviot define the collection so collection fine connect to

01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:47.680
baviot cloud baviot url api find collection action.create

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:51.980
name question vectorized next to vector let

01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:03.400
me change this one so data they have changed the api data

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:12.960
dot dot i n c r t insert text vector to list okay and they

01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:20.180
have changed even this one pro p r o p r t i e s properties

01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:21.820
let's

01:21:25.210 --> 01:21:29.850
see so data dot insert is not available okay

01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:38.770
so we have to call they have changed so client dot

01:21:38.770 --> 01:21:47.740
collection dot get and then here i can try to mention

01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:51.400
document collection

01:21:54.980 --> 01:22:02.140
so this will be collection object by the way so i can try to

01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:04.300
remove this part collection

01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:10.390
biviate failed object was not added okay

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:25.320
i just have to check the documentation guys because last

01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:28.140
time when i was doing this it was working so maybe it

01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:31.640
depends upon the version basically so i'm using a latest

01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:37.990
version so i just have to check maybe llms and name

01:22:45.450 --> 01:22:46.550
of the collection

01:22:57.850 --> 01:23:00.510
connection connection vivid failed detail object was not

01:23:00.510 --> 01:23:07.470
added and failed because of what collection connection not

01:23:07.470 --> 01:23:09.490
available client

01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:18.900
is fine collection

01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:24.280
dot create

01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:36.320
let me check if that is available collection dot create yeah

01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:38.720
so this was the only issue collection not create so

01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:40.680
basically it is going to create the collection for me and

01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:44.120
then inside that i'm trying to store the information so this

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:47.640
is how i'm just storing the information guys now let me go

01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:53.660
to my baviet and then try to check so this information is

01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:59.220
available or not in this place so maybe i can try to click

01:23:59.220 --> 01:24:04.320
on collections and it will bring me to the sandbox inside

01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:08.200
that there is a document name collection with the document

01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:11.860
which is available now i can try to click on properties okay

01:24:40.050 --> 01:24:45.770
so collection it is able to store and then where

01:24:54.090 --> 01:24:57.210
i can see my embeddings by the way explore

01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:00.860
so

01:25:15.130 --> 01:25:18.650
as you can see so here i am able to store the information

01:25:18.650 --> 01:25:22.570
right so i am able to store the information with this

01:25:22.570 --> 01:25:25.610
dimension and this is something that information that you

01:25:25.610 --> 01:25:28.650
are able to see so this is what baviet does guys so baviet

01:25:28.650 --> 01:25:31.010
is not doing anything different so whatever pine cone was

01:25:31.010 --> 01:25:34.570
able to do whatever chroma dv was able to do uh exact same

01:25:34.570 --> 01:25:38.150
thing even i am able to store in this particular place right

01:25:38.150 --> 01:25:41.030
so this was the text basically this is the test this is to

01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:43.830
test my baviet database by zanshu and then this is the

01:25:43.830 --> 01:25:47.470
dimension so default dimension size is equal to 1536 in

01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:51.070
which it is able to store the entire information is it

01:25:51.070 --> 01:25:54.570
making sense guys so this is basically your data this is

01:25:54.570 --> 01:25:58.150
your data now again if i am going to store it so maybe again

01:25:58.150 --> 01:26:02.950
if i am going to execute it uh so i i will be able to like

01:26:02.970 --> 01:26:07.720
uh do it again this is the duplicate one right collection

01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:11.720
may not have created properly and expected status collection

01:26:14.090 --> 01:26:16.410
document okay

01:26:20.890 --> 01:26:25.070
now not create now we have to call get otherwise it will

01:26:25.070 --> 01:26:29.790
give me an error so if you are doing for the first time just

01:26:29.790 --> 01:26:33.750
click on create if you are doing for the second time onwards

01:26:33.750 --> 01:26:36.350
with the same code because creation will happen only once

01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:39.430
collection creation will happen only once insertion you can

01:26:39.430 --> 01:26:45.750
do it as many times as possible get get get get get so now

01:26:45.750 --> 01:26:49.130
if i am going to come over here and if i am going to show

01:26:49.130 --> 01:26:52.650
you after refresh i will be able to find out not just one or

01:26:52.650 --> 01:26:57.640
two record but a multiple records making sense guys are we

01:26:57.640 --> 01:27:00.500
able to get the multiple records for the same data obviously

01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:04.240
i'm not i have not changed the data but yeah i'm able to get

01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:06.840
the multiple records so as you can see that we are able to

01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:12.080
successfully uh store our multiple records inside my baviet

01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:17.340
find everyone so we are able to connect and we are able to

01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:23.460
store the information let me ping you this code guys so like

01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:25.980
i said if you are using for the first time then use a create

01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:29.960
not get and then second time so you can try to use a get

01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:33.160
over here otherwise you can just don't execute this one

01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:38.220
again and again just execute insert query just do this one

01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:42.020
so we are able to perform the data insertion operation so

01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:44.500
anyone who is facing any kind of issue please let me know

01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:13.290
you change anything in the embedding how you changed

01:28:13.290 --> 01:28:19.230
anything in the embedding function which one where Temple

01:28:19.230 --> 01:28:20.330
where Akash I have changed

01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:29.880
embedding function i'm using the same so the same function

01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:33.620
which i was using in like uh at the time of pine con the

01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:36.500
embedding function which is available inside the uri so i'm

01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:39.280
using same embedding function i'm not using some anything

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:43.000
different so i was using this generate embeddings and this

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:46.200
generate embeddings is available here which I am trying to

01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:48.880
get from where, so which I am trying to get from URI, right.

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:52.660
So I am using the same exact same embedding function without

01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:53.540
any kind of a changes.

01:28:57.270 --> 01:29:00.290
So once I am able to insert the information, now it's time

01:29:00.290 --> 01:29:03.190
to perform some sort of a search operation. So let's try to

01:29:03.190 --> 01:29:06.050
perform some sort of a search operation. So insertion is

01:29:06.050 --> 01:29:09.250
done. So I am able to see that in a cloud, I am able to

01:29:09.250 --> 01:29:12.070
insert the data, right. Insert the data. Now let's try to

01:29:12.070 --> 01:29:14.370
perform the search operation because insertion and search

01:29:14.370 --> 01:29:17.130
operation, these are the two operation I will be using most

01:29:17.130 --> 01:29:20.270
of the times for any kind of a use cases. So here to perform

01:29:20.270 --> 01:29:25.070
a search operation, maybe I'm going to search, my text

01:29:25.070 --> 01:29:31.290
underscore search is basically Sudhanshu is mentor, right.

01:29:31.370 --> 01:29:34.750
This is the, like a string, which I'm trying to search and

01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:38.750
equivalent embeddings I'm trying to search basically. So for

01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:41.430
this one, first of all, I'll try to generate the embeddings

01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:45.890
because whatever we are going to like a search, so obviously

01:29:45.890 --> 01:29:49.030
I have to generate the embeddings EMB, D I N G S embeddings,

01:29:49.070 --> 01:29:54.790
underscore search, underscore data, right. So I'm able to

01:29:54.790 --> 01:29:57.530
convert into the embeddings. Now I have to search into a

01:29:57.530 --> 01:29:59.910
baby yet, right. I have to search into a baby yet. So I'm

01:29:59.910 --> 01:30:02.130
already connected with the baby yet. So I can write

01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:07.130
collection dot query dot near, near, near, near, near text

01:30:07.130 --> 01:30:12.130
or near vector. So here near image, near media, near object,

01:30:12.230 --> 01:30:15.050
near text, and near vector, all of these options. Baby, it

01:30:15.050 --> 01:30:17.830
is giving you, so you can even try to do a image search. You

01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:21.250
can try to do a media search, like a media, like a audio and

01:30:21.250 --> 01:30:23.810
then video. You can try to do object search. You can try to

01:30:23.810 --> 01:30:25.770
do text search. You can try to do a vector search. I'm

01:30:25.770 --> 01:30:28.490
trying to do a vector search basically. So this is my

01:30:28.490 --> 01:30:30.270
objective. So near,

01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:43.900
near vector, we see vector is what? So near vector is

01:30:43.900 --> 01:30:48.360
basically this one, this particular one. So this to list.

01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:54.020
So this is my near vector by the way. And this is what I

01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:57.500
will try to basically like a search execute and whatever

01:30:57.500 --> 01:31:00.860
will be the near to this one, near to this data. So the

01:31:00.860 --> 01:31:04.780
answer is a mentor. It is going to give me the vector. So

01:31:04.780 --> 01:31:08.120
first five value by default, it is giving me five values. So

01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:11.200
this, this, this, this, this, now maybe I can try to like a

01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:14.100
restricted. I can say that just try to give me a limit of

01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:18.420
one means just give me the first nearest value. So it is

01:31:18.420 --> 01:31:22.060
giving you the first nearest value, right? It is giving you

01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:24.380
the. First nearest value vector normalization is equal to

01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:28.020
this, this, this. So this is how it is going to perform the

01:31:28.020 --> 01:31:32.860
searching operation guys at the end of the day. Yeah. So

01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:35.720
this is giving you this particular result. Now out of this

01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:38.740
result, I would like to see that text. So the, what is the

01:31:38.740 --> 01:31:41.380
text that it is trying to match? So maybe I can try to store

01:31:41.380 --> 01:31:47.240
it as a R E S U L T result result and out of this result. So

01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:50.740
I would like to like a fetch a textual information at the

01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:53.880
end of the day, I would like to fetch a textual information.

01:31:54.100 --> 01:32:00.480
So how I will be able to fetch it. So result result dot, uh,

01:32:00.660 --> 01:32:06.740
result dot, I can say objective dot result

01:32:11.730 --> 01:32:14.610
dot objective is giving me this

01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:21.860
entire text, right? So that it was, it was able to find a

01:32:21.860 --> 01:32:25.800
closest text as equals to this one. So maybe I can try to

01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:31.440
call dot properties. Oh, I can call. A proper piece or

01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:33.740
simple, like this

01:32:46.630 --> 01:32:52.290
is the object and there is a list inside a list. So this

01:32:52.290 --> 01:32:56.130
information is available.

01:33:00.030 --> 01:33:03.130
Okay. So object, maybe

01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:21.900
I can try to iterate through it for I in this one, I dot I

01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:28.960
dot properties, and then just print me next.

01:33:36.130 --> 01:33:41.450
Yeah. So, uh, here I'm able to even print the data that this

01:33:41.450 --> 01:33:44.510
was, this was matching with this data, although all the data

01:33:44.510 --> 01:33:47.110
was same. So I, whatever data I have inserted, I have

01:33:47.110 --> 01:33:49.490
inserted a copy of same data, but yeah, I'm just trying to

01:33:49.490 --> 01:33:52.030
show you the search part, search operation, part of this

01:33:52.030 --> 01:33:54.690
one, that how it is trying to perform the search operation,

01:33:54.890 --> 01:33:57.470
then how you will be able to see the complete result. So

01:33:57.470 --> 01:34:00.450
this is the procedure. A simple query is collection, not

01:34:00.450 --> 01:34:03.950
query near vector, and then try to pass your embeddings. It

01:34:03.950 --> 01:34:06.070
will try to do a matching. And then eventually you will be

01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:09.590
able to get it. You get your result making sense, guys.

01:34:12.090 --> 01:34:15.950
Yeah, everyone. So how I'm going to do the search operation.

01:34:16.710 --> 01:34:20.230
So we are able to perform a basically like a insert

01:34:20.230 --> 01:34:24.490
operation inside a baby yet. And we are able to even perform

01:34:24.490 --> 01:34:28.070
the search operation on top of this one. And then out of

01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:30.110
this search operation, I can try to extract whatever

01:34:30.110 --> 01:34:33.410
information I want from this result object. This is my

01:34:33.410 --> 01:34:35.470
result object. So I can get everything. I can get my

01:34:35.470 --> 01:34:39.210
metadata, distance, everything right. So what like it is

01:34:39.210 --> 01:34:43.410
trying to do and properties and whatever information that I

01:34:43.410 --> 01:34:47.010
have stored, everything it is going to give you inside this

01:34:47.010 --> 01:34:51.350
object. So any question for me, guys, I believe a baby is

01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:56.330
fine. And in real time, we are able to like, uh, create a

01:34:56.330 --> 01:34:59.630
baby yet. And then we are able to store the information now.

01:35:02.950 --> 01:35:05.930
So I will be using mostly this kind of, uh, I will be using

01:35:05.930 --> 01:35:09.030
either a pine cone or baby yet going forward when I will be

01:35:09.030 --> 01:35:11.970
teaching you, uh, RIG, because I have to put. My things into

01:35:11.970 --> 01:35:16.850
a production, it will be less hectic for me, uh, in terms of

01:35:16.850 --> 01:35:19.270
like, uh, putting these things into a production. Otherwise,

01:35:19.370 --> 01:35:23.630
uh, in case of, uh, uh, and then like, uh, in case of a

01:35:23.630 --> 01:35:27.310
chroma DB, I have to dockerize it and then I have to put it

01:35:27.310 --> 01:35:30.310
on a cloud. Otherwise this, this is very much easy. Like I

01:35:30.310 --> 01:35:32.830
can just try to call the APIs and then with the help of APIs

01:35:32.830 --> 01:35:36.410
and client, I will be able to connect. And, uh, finally I

01:35:36.410 --> 01:35:40.650
will be able to perform all the operations. Yeah. So this is

01:35:40.650 --> 01:35:45.330
all. Yeah. About, uh, baby yet guys. So I think we all are

01:35:45.330 --> 01:35:48.710
able to understand now only one vector DB is remaining,

01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:52.730
which is like a F a F a ISS. I'll, I'll teach you that part

01:35:52.730 --> 01:35:55.090
as well. That will take another 10 minutes of time, but not

01:35:55.090 --> 01:35:57.690
today. Uh, let's connect tomorrow and I'll be teaching you

01:35:57.690 --> 01:36:01.210
that. Plus I'll be showing you a couple of application and

01:36:01.210 --> 01:36:04.890
couple of operations, uh, in my tomorrow's class. So with

01:36:04.890 --> 01:36:07.570
that, uh, thank you so much for today. And if you have any

01:36:07.570 --> 01:36:09.770
questions, so please go ahead with your question. I'll try

01:36:09.770 --> 01:36:11.810
to answer. Otherwise. Otherwise I'll rest the class for

01:36:11.810 --> 01:36:16.420
today. Yeah. So anyone who is having any questions, so

01:36:16.420 --> 01:36:17.960
please go ahead and

01:36:20.490 --> 01:36:24.450
let me, it's like a share this entire things

01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:29.550
with all of you.

01:36:51.690 --> 01:36:53.770
Okay, fine guys. So if you don't have any kind of a

01:36:53.770 --> 01:36:57.410
quotient, so we'll try to, uh, like a close the class for

01:36:57.410 --> 01:37:00.670
today, uh, tomorrow. So I'll be talking about first, uh,

01:37:00.690 --> 01:37:04.170
Facebook semantic search and once Facebook has amended, so

01:37:04.170 --> 01:37:07.030
it will be done. Then I'll be talking about, uh, like a

01:37:07.030 --> 01:37:10.570
further topic for the chapter, but yeah, mostly it's. Uh, it

01:37:10.570 --> 01:37:13.650
will be based on that application building part where I will

01:37:13.650 --> 01:37:14.770
be using all of these things.

01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:21.900
Uh, baby, it can store the text and embeddings. Can we do

01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:24.260
the same in a pine cone as well? Obviously we can do the

01:37:24.260 --> 01:37:26.100
same thing in a pine cone. I believe someone has already

01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:28.240
done that, right? In a meta information, we were trying to

01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:29.440
store those information.

01:37:31.710 --> 01:37:34.010
So yeah, obviously pine cone is giving you the same option.

01:37:34.130 --> 01:37:36.630
All the DV is going to give you the same option. Uh,

01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:43.280
you mentioned that there is a difference between baby at

01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:46.000
pine cone and a chroma DV. Can you mention the high level,

01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:50.200
which one is to select when, uh, let me talk. Farsi as well.

01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:52.940
I'll give you a difference. And then remind me, I'll give

01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:56.260
you a difference altogether between all this for, there is a

01:37:56.260 --> 01:37:58.840
very minor differences. You will be able to find out in

01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:02.740
terms of hosting, in terms of fastestness, in terms of the

01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:05.540
search technique they are using, because everyone is not

01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:09.000
using the same technique for searching purposes. So

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.660
tomorrow, all four, all four, I'll just try to prepare the

01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:13.760
table for you. And then I'll try to write down those

01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:17.580
differences and which one you should use in which scenario.

01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:23.120
Basically. So that I'll be talking about tomorrow when I'll

01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:25.960
end up talking about Facebook as semantic search as well. So

01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:26.920
one is still pending.

01:38:29.860 --> 01:38:32.560
Okay. So with that guys, thank you so much. See you again in

01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:35.760
my tomorrow's class, which is going to happen same time, 2

01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:40.080
30 PM IST until then take care. Everyone have a great

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:42.000
weekend ahead. Yeah. Thank you.
