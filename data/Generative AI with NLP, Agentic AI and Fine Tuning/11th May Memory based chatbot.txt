WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
So let's start talking about this project. So, like I said,

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.420
uh, uh, what we are going to discuss in this project. So

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.520
obviously we are going to, uh, basically talk about, uh,

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.000
memory chat bot. And, uh, I have already given you a demo.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.500
Let me give you a demo once again. So we are going to

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.780
experience a chat bot. So which is going to memorize each

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.000
and everything, all the conversation that I had, again, I'm

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.560
going to put up the limitation it is going to memorize. Even

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.140
from a session session means the ongoing conversation, and

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.840
it is going to memorize even from the previous context or

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.600
like the black context, which I'm going to give, or maybe

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.760
the previous chat that I already have each and everything it

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.740
is going to store store where, so it is going to store into.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.600
Vector database. I'm going to use a Facebook, a semantic

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.340
search vector database over here, and I'm basically using a

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.020
URI API for a real time conversation, and I'm going to use a

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.960
URI API for even, uh, embedding because I have to store

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.640
something into a vector DB. So for sure, I need a

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.100
embeddings, right? I have to convert that into embeddings.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.980
So I'm using like a GPT, a small case model and, uh, from a

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.340
URI itself. And then I'm going to store it, store each and

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.360
everything. So please download this folder, the folder,

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.780
which I have shared with all of you, right, not able to

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.340
download.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.690
Okay. Is it click on the resource, the corner section. Uh,

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.830
the source, and then you can just click over there. I'm able

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.450
to download by the way. Yeah, it's, it's working for me.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.190
I can download it basically.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.940
No ways. I think I'm able to download. Uh, it's not giving

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.020
me a problem. I can maybe show you that.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.880
Yeah. Go here, go chat, click on the source. Yeah. So let me

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.600
click on this one. This is the resource which I've shared.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.620
Right. See, it has started downloading four, five, three,

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.200
two, one done. Yeah. 1 0 8 MB. I'm able to download it.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.900
Click multiple times, not multiple times, just one times,

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.340
one click. It works always. It works. Yeah. Okay. Fine. It

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.240
is working guys. I've shown you that. Okay. So basically I'm

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.480
going to create a chat bot, right? I'm going to create a

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.740
chat bot. So which is going to memorize you. You can even

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.140
try to give a memory to this particular bot, right? You can

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.300
try to even give a memory to this particular bot so that

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.260
this bot will be able to understand you. You in a better and

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.960
better and a better way, basically you can go and ask any

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.000
kind of a question. So here let's start talking about a code

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.720
and before the code. So let me give you a little bit of like

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.220
a, you know, architectural overview that what this system is

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.460
doing, although there is not like a complex architecture

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:09.020
that we have over here, but yeah. So here we have created a

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.860
chat interface. So there. Is a chat interface,

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.260
right? And, uh, whenever you are going to send some chat,

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:29.520
send some chat. So this chat will go here, chat interface.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.220
Now chat interface is going to technically call, uh, RIG

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.880
based approach, uh, basically like, uh, and plus obviously

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.680
like RIG based approach when I'm trying to say it simply

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.470
means that, that first of all, it is going to store the

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.070
data. Or embeddings, then it is going to call RIG based

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.270
approach. It will try to understand you, uh, by the way,

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.750
and, uh, not exactly the RIG. So because I have just like a

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.130
commented, uh, I have just removed my, uh, Lanchen, uh, now

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.050
from there, I have made, made it optional. I'll show you

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.550
that in a code itself because of some purposes I was doing

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.970
some experiment. So RIG based approach, then it is going to

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.690
store the embeddings. It is going to store embeddings into a

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.810
Facebook AI semantic search database. Okay. And whenever you

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.030
are going to ask any kind of a question, so it remembers

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.750
you, uh, like I said, so RIG based approach I'm trying to

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.330
use, and then it is going to give you a response by

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.090
combining all of these things inside your chat window. So

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:40.090
here I'm going to use like a URI. So URI for like a chat and

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:46.160
URI for embeddings. So this is the simple approach that we

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.240
are going. To follow, uh, plus, uh, I'm trying to maintain a

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.880
contextual memory as well as I'm trying to maintain the long

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.720
-term memory. So first of all, let me show you my data. So

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.420
there is a user data you will be able to find out and inside

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.100
that. So there is something called as vector store. You all

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.560
will be able to find out now, all of these data is like

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.620
stored here and at any point of a time you can come and you

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.740
can try to check that. What is the conversation history? And

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.600
you will be able to find out all of these history in this

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.660
particular place now. So I'll, I'll just try to delete all

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.840
of these things. I'll just delete this, all of these things.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.600
And then I'm going to show you once from a fresh run. And

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.840
even I'll suggest you guys that, uh, try to delete

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.740
everything from this data, or maybe you can delete this data

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.880
folder itself. So inside a code, I have already mentioned

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.680
that, uh, try to create a data folder. If data folder is not

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.980
available, so maybe you can delete it, just delete it. Yeah.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.260
Just delete this entire folder. Now let's start talking

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.560
about the code. Now code is not that like it's big, but it's

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.420
not that tough. Yeah, not that tough. So first of all, try

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.100
to configure each and everything. Now here, what I'm trying

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.500
to use OS, JSON, the major component is basically a Facebook

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.660
as semantic search, which I'm going to use. And I'm going to

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.700
use basically a stream link for creation of the UI. I'm

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.640
going to use a request to request my URI model as simple as

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.280
that. Right. So here I'm trying to like, uh, create one

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.300
file, which is a dot environment file inside dot environment

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.360
file. So we are trying to keep URI API key, and then I'm

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.540
trying to basically keep a user identity, a default one. So

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.400
you can try to change your own user identity. It's mine,

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.920
which, which I have shared with all of you. So you can try

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.920
to change. You can try to make it as long as possible. It's

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:42.800
completely fine. And then come over here now. So list in a

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.780
step-by-step manner, this entire code is been written. This

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.820
entire things has been created so that you should not face

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.600
any kind of a problem going forward, right? Whenever you

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.400
will try to modify this one. So here there is a class I have

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.120
created called as setting class. Now what the setting class

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.020
is trying to do as its name suggests, it is going to set

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.580
each and everything. So it is going to load the API key as

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.040
simple as that. It is going to load basically, uh, embedding

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.820
models, right? It is going to like a loader embedding

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.060
models. It is going to load a chat models. So I'm using two

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.060
models, one, a chat model. And one is a embedding model as

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.000
simple as that. You can try to parameterize this one. I have

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.180
just done the hard coded, uh, one. So maximum token is equal

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.560
to 800. You can try to give 8,000 temperature is equal to 0

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.380
.7. You can try to keep it zero. I believe we all understand

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.540
what is the meaning of temperature and number of tokens.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.120
Simple right now, memory setting. So here memory setting

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.960
wise, I'm trying to keep it five, which means that that

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.400
number of our relevant memory to retrieve. So whenever we

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.360
are trying to like, uh, do a new chat, right? Whenever.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.340
Whenever we are trying to initiate a new chat. So how many

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:54.320
most relevant memory as per my, like a vector search, it

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.900
should retrieve and history limit. So maximum number of

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.240
conversation we are going to keep, it's a 20. This is the

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.660
only 20. You can try to keep 200 conversation. That's

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.180
completely fine. But yeah. Uh, so your DB size, or maybe you

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.100
can try to store all of it again. That is fine. But again,

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.060
when we try to create a real time application, we always

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.240
make sure that. That we are trying to set some of the

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.380
benchmark, keeping that in our mind. I have done this hard

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.120
coding, but you can try to change it. You can try to like a

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.300
change this 20 to 200. That's completely fine. Vector

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.620
dimension is going to be one, five, three, six. The reason

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.360
is very simple. So this text embedding three, a small model

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.340
returns me a dimension of one, five, three, six. We have

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:37.040
already learned that part a lot of times now index path. So

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:41.260
where it is going to a store this entire Farsi indexes. So

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.680
basically index path is going to be data now. So data

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.320
folder. If not available, it is going to create it as simple

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.840
as that. So create a directory. It doesn't exist. So even if

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.500
you are going to delete it and run it from the scratch, that

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.020
will be better. If you can delete this part and then run it

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.700
from the scratch, I think that will be much better. Uh, let

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.820
me refresh it. So now all the data is gone. There is no

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.260
chat, right? I have just deleted my data directory.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.800
Basically that was my DB, right? So that was my DB. So I

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.720
have deleted each and everything. So it just remembers only

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.620
one thing, user entity, which it is trying to fetch from

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.140
where. So, which it is trying to face. So I have deleted it

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.940
from dot ENV. So here I have mentioned. So only from there I

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.300
have deleted the data part, right? So data directory is

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:26.440
completely gone now. So this is the setting which I'm going

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.640
to do and application setting wise. So app name, I'm going

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.640
to set and the memory chat, uh, like a chat bot app name is

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.500
equal to memory chat bot. So this is something which I'm

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:39.660
trying to set. That's it. So this is a very simple class I

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:43.020
have done and this class is going to do all the basic

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:46.060
setting. Now. Anyone who is having any doubt with this

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.120
class, let me know.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.600
Can you reshare the project? I don't think that you need a

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.880
resharing. Just click on the source. The source will be

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.740
available even during the class, after the class, right?

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.900
Click on the resource. So like a right hand side, top right

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.740
click, click over there, fine

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.440
everyone, okay.

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:27.350
So once this is done, right? Once this part is done, uh,

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:30.850
once we are able to like do all the setting and again, this

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:33.130
project is like a very well documented. Okay. And, uh,

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:35.150
comment wise, like everywhere you will be able to find out

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:38.250
the comment. I have used the AI for that, obviously to like

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.390
a comment, uh, comment it out, uh, the entire project. Uh,

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:43.930
so that even in a later stage, if someone is following this

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:46.690
project, they should be able to like, uh, do each and

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:50.130
everything. Yeah. Now. So URI embedding class, there is a

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:52.070
class called as URI embedding class. Yeah.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.080
It's not opening direct lecture came after clicking it to

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.100
work Sandeep. It always works. I know it works.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:09.900
So URI embedding. So a wrapper for the URI. Uh, embedding

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:14.040
API. Now we all know embeddings, right? And again, so, uh,

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.040
if you will go to URI, so we have already given you a

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.740
embedding code. Embedding code is already available. Sample

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.380
code is already available inside the URI. So if you'll go to

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:26.640
API, if you'll go to like a code example, so here we have

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.900
already given you a embedding generation code. So I'm not

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.360
doing anything different over here. I'm just using the same

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.400
code, uh, which is mentioned over here in my own way. That's

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.120
it. So here I'm just trying to like classify it. So inside a

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.180
class, I'm trying to put up each and everything. So here is

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:45.180
a URL, right? So I'm going to get an API obviously from the

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:49.320
dot environment file and then embedding models, right?

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.780
Embedding models from the settings. So setting dot API key

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.720
setting is what setting is my class, right? So from setting

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.460
class, get the API key from setting class, get the embedding

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.860
models, and then this is the URL. So this is the URL and

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.520
then it is going to like a return each and everything as

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.120
simple as that. And then in terms of embedding the

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.540
documents, right? In terms of embedding the documents. So it

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.960
is going to like, uh, create the, it is, it is sending the,

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.400
uh, like a data or it is trying to like convert it into the

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.460
embeddings. And finally here, I will be able to get the

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:24.480
embeddings. So it's an exact same code, but yeah, with the

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.880
try and catch it, like try and except we are trying to

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.920
handle, but yeah, it's the exact same code. We are not doing

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.000
anything different over here, right? Nothing different.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:34.440
Right. So at the end of the day, I will be able to get my

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.440
embedding queries now. So embedding is fine. Now the third

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.660
class that I have written over here is basically a URI chat.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:46.940
So the one which will be responsible for calling my chat

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:50.680
completion model. So maybe I can try to give, uh, uh, like,

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.940
uh, uh, GPD based model, maybe Gemini based model. I can try

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.560
to give maybe a Mistral. I can try to give maybe a deep seek

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.020
R1 based model. I can try to give a Lama. I can try to give.

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:03.500
So here I know that how to call URI and the same thing we

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.280
are trying to do over here. So API key model temperature max

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.420
token. So these are the variables that we are trying to

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:12.140
create. And then API key from setting class model from

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.840
setting class temperature from setting class, maximum number

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.300
of token from setting class in setting class. We have

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.400
already to set all those things. So from setting class, we

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.440
are trying to call all of these variable code is written in

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.160
a bit standard way, but yeah, it's not, not very different

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:30.740
now. So again, uh, so we are trying to call URI client by

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.180
the way, from URI itself directly. So we are trying to call

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:37.000
URI client API and model we are trying to set. And then this

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.240
function is going to create a, uh, like a completion

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.760
basically. So generate completion from the model. It is

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.760
going to give you the final response as simple as that. So

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.580
it is going to take the prompt, whatever prompt or whatever

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.880
chat that you are going to send. So this is again, the class

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:59.300
just for, right. Just for generating basically a chat

00:13:59.300 --> 00:13:59.920
completion.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.900
Okay. Zoom out was the issue. Fine. Maybe you have zoomed in

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:14.940
a lot. Yeah. So here, so this, this, a piece of the code is

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.120
just helping me out in terms of connecting with the URI and

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:22.420
giving me a final responses as simple as that. So around

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:27.280
that code has been built now. And again, like all the

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.540
exceptions has been handled. Now vector store is so memory

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:34.900
vector store. Now what this is going to do? So here it is

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:39.900
going to a store all of those, uh, data into a FASI. So

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.380
basically Facebook AI. Semantic search DV. It is going to

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:47.140
store all of these like a chat bot memories again. So here

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:50.540
I'm trying to call URI embedding models, like URI embedding

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:53.980
models. I'm trying to click a creator index path, index path

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:57.280
of the FASI. So which I have already defined inside my,

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:03.960
like, uh, uh, setting file setting class. And then I'm

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.080
trying to like, uh, keep a vector dimension, a metadata

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:12.360
file, and then it is going to. Initialize the indexes for

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.040
initial initialize after initializing the indexes. So it is

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.820
going to store all of those information in up respective

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.580
directory. So this is something that it is going to perform.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:25.280
Uh, this code looks a little bit bulky because of this try

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.260
and except otherwise, if you will closely look into this

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:33.160
code, this is not that bulky now. So finally I'm creating

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.260
the new indexes and then like, uh, same thing we have done

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.180
yesterday, right? Same thing we have done over, uh,

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.140
studying. So. So we are not doing anything different over

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.720
here. Then we are trying to save it, saving each and

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:46.840
everything. Then there is a function called as add memory

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:50.880
function. So where it is trying to take a text and the

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:56.720
metadata and add memory to the vector storage. So again, we

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.940
are trying to use basically our embedding models itself. We

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:03.820
are trying to like, uh, query it and then after querying it.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:08.160
So we are trying to add into the FASI indexes. As we know

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.700
that. That we have to store a 20 last chat, plus we have to

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:16.480
store five from the like five, uh, top from, uh, at every

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.040
search we have to do. So this is something that it is going

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:23.680
to perform now. So there is a function for a search

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:28.600
operation. So one is a storage. One is a search. So whenever

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.520
you are going to chat, uh, whenever you are going to

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:35.080
initiate a new chat, it should be able to even search.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.140
Basically. Search based on what? A kth memory means last

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.280
five, right? Setting.memory.k. This is what I have set as a

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:47.220
five. So it is supposed to extract this like a kth data, uh,

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:52.460
means kth top matching data. It is supposed to bring based

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:55.800
on the embeddings and then it is supposed to, uh, blackout.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.460
So this is what embedding query is going to do. So embedding

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:01.400
query is going to like a query it, and then it is going to

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.000
bring the data after that. I'm trying to looking for

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.460
basically a k number of information. It means five latest or

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:14.040
not latest. I would say the five nearest five nearest search

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:19.200
as per my, uh, like, uh, next conversation as per the input,

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:23.020
which I have given to my chat bot as simple as that. So

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:26.040
based on the distance and the similarity we are trying to

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.240
define, uh, get all the memories. So it is going to like,

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.360
uh, give you all the memories and it is clearing the memory.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.920
Then this is one of the memory that we are trying to build.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.940
With the Facebook AI semantic search database. Now there is

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.720
something called as conversational memory. And what we are

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.120
trying to do over here is that, that we are trying to

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:49.940
restore the conversation history, basically, and it's in a

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:51.880
flat file we are trying to store. So we are trying to store

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:55.440
it just in a JSON, I would say like a file, nothing much

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.680
over here. And then there is a function called as load

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.900
history. And then there is something called as like a save,

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.620
there is something called as add user message, add assistant

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:08.420
message. Add assistant message. Add messages. And then there

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:11.260
is something called as get history. So just a small, small,

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.980
small, small, supportive function we have created so that

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.680
some function will try to help me out to get the history.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:20.240
Some function will try to help me out to save the history or

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.260
add the assistance messages. All of these things around

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:27.660
that, these functions are going to help me out. Now there is

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.420
something called as langchain. Also I have tried to

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.980
implement into this one so that I will be able to do, uh,

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:39.100
like, uh, this, uh, RAG implementation in a better and a

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:42.380
better and a better way, basically. So we all know, and we

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.860
have already seen that, that how langchain is going to work.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.900
So basically it needs, uh, two things are current query that

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:53.100
you are going to pass and the LLM support. So LLM support

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:57.180
anyhow, URI, LLM is going to give you, right, URI, LLM is

00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:00.060
going to give you and just try to like load this particular

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:03.800
LLMs. That's it. The rest is just exception handling. Right.

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:13.140
Now this is basically a complete chat. So the above one was

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.440
everything in a bits and pieces. Now this is basically a

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:20.420
class which is going to combine each and everything all

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:25.320
together that what is going to happen after what? So top

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.120
down approach we have seen. Now let's try to understand

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.740
little bit in a bottom up approach. What approach means?

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:33.420
Like, because this is the main class, this is the main

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.620
class, which is going to call everything means literally it

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.620
is going to call each and everything. So conversation,

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.580
memory, vector stories, chat model, user entity, each and

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.760
everything. So in a slice, the memory chat bot. So here we

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.340
are trying to call basically a conversation memory, which is

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:51.080
going to initialize the chat bot. Now come down, down, down.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:53.020
So yeah, yeah.

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:58.590
Then we are trying to initialize our memory vector stories.

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:01.750
Then we are trying to do the slides, basically a URI AI

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:06.030
chat, and then we are trying to initialize basically a user

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:10.130
identity. Now here. Yeah. Then we are trying to call

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:13.590
basically create a lang chain LLMs now here. So this is the

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:17.290
function one by one, which is going to process each and

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:20.410
everything main function you can say, right? Main function.

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:25.410
So add user message is the very first function that get

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:28.330
formatted history. Then perform the search, format the

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:32.250
memory, create the prompt, and then finally generate the

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:35.870
response. So main conclusion, you will be able to find out

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:38.910
inside this function that how this call is happening

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:44.450
altogether. So here add user message. So whenever you are

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:47.190
user is trying to send some messages, user is trying to give

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:49.770
some input, what we are trying to do. So we are trying to

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:54.950
add it into the conversation history. Now once that will be

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:58.890
done, right? Once that will be done, then we are trying to

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:03.350
do what? So we are trying to basically get all the history,

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:08.830
all the formatted history based on the input. Then once that

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:12.970
is done, so user has given some sort of an input. We are

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:16.350
able to pull some sort of a history out of it. And then we

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:19.830
are trying to perform some sort of a search so that I will

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:23.690
be able to get a relevant memory. So see in general, like

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:26.930
when we try to create a chat bot, so we try to do what? So

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:30.910
we try to send a direct. So whenever we try to create a chat

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:36.450
bot, so we try to send a direct to this input, input, to the

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:40.570
LLM, right? Now this is where this chat bot is different. So

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:44.510
we are not sending a direct query to a LLM first of all, we

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:47.990
are trying to get a user input. After getting a user input,

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:51.510
we are trying to extract some sort of a history. We are

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:55.810
going to even search that what is a top five memory key that

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:59.570
I have stored as a five. So what is a top five relevant

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:03.730
things which is available inside my memory, inside my

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:05.670
memory, which is a vector memory. So let's say it's a vector

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:09.410
store. So from the vector store class search method. So I'm

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:13.110
trying to call now once I'm able to get a relevant memory,

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:17.430
I'm trying to pass that relevant memory into a format memory

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:20.510
so that it is, it is going to like, you know, create a

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:24.350
beautiful prompt for me, right? Then I'm trying to pass this

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:28.250
user input. Like user input, the raw input that user has

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:30.970
given then the history which I'm able to get and the

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:34.190
memories I'm able to get. So all three things I'm trying to

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:37.790
pass. I'm saying this. that that combine all of these three

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:44.030
things and then try to build a final prompt for me. Then try

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:47.990
to build a final prompt for me. So it's not just a RAG

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:50.490
implementation because we have seen in my previous class,

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:54.450
which was a studies class that when we say RAG, right? So it

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:58.490
will always try to focus on the private data and then it is

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:02.410
going to use LLMs to format those information to give me all

00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:05.690
those information in a better way. Now, here I'm just like

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:08.130
using a little bit of different approach. So what is the

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:11.430
approach? The approach is that I'm trying to build a bigger

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:15.350
prompt over here where I'm not just dependent upon the

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:18.830
memory and history, but I'm trying to attach a complete user

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:22.950
input as well. Right? Not just like something that we are

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:25.670
trying to fetch from the memory. So we are trying to create

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:30.050
a complete prompt over here. Now this prompt will go into my

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:33.570
URI, generate chat completion, right? This is basically a

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:37.730
URI. So URI chat completion API. So this is going inside

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:42.870
basically my URI chat completion, where is my function?

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.760
Yeah. So generate chat completion. So this is, and this is

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:55.200
going to give me the final response. Now just look into this

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.120
function, starting from line number 478 and this is the

00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:02.460
conclusion of the entire project. This is the flow of the

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:05.180
entire project. So if anyone and everyone has to understand.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:09.720
The flow of the entire project, it's that, that's it, right?

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.280
So this is calling each and everything in a step-by-step,

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:16.540
step-by-step, step-by-step manner one after another. Okay.

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.680
So after that, so we are trying to call conversation memory,

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.520
add resistance messages, and then we are trying to add the

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.760
interaction to the memory. So basically we are trying to add

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:30.720
something into my DB once again, simple, right? Simple. Now.

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:34.920
So format memory, create a prompt. Then a user identity,

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.340
relevant memory, all these things I'm trying to fetch.

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:45.240
Now set user identity, get conversation history, clear

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.560
conversation, add to memory. So these are just a small,

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.920
small utility, which I have built, which you will be able to

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.880
see on the left-hand side, utilities basically.

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:58.800
Now so formatted date, this is again the utility. So here

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:02.000
I'm trying to showcase a date. If I'm going to say hi, so it

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.580
will show you date as well over here. So they are just a

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:07.320
small, small, these are just a format. Small, small

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.920
utilities, which I have created, nothing much, right? Now

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:13.100
come to the last part, basically.

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:19.780
So a streamlined UI, a simple UI I have created now the UI.

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:23.340
So where you will be able to see a memory chat bot as a

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:27.540
header, and you can see even your APIs, you can even call

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:31.480
test API connection, and it is just going to like do a

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:34.300
testing and API result. It is going to give you that. Okay.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.340
So everything is normal. Everything is up and running. Now

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:43.650
this. I have written over here. This one. Yeah. So this, I

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:46.970
have written basically over here. So this is going to return

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:49.270
you each and everything just for the API testing, just a

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:51.370
utility function. You can say which, which has been written

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:54.990
then user identity. So by default, if you are going to

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:57.530
mention something into a dot ENB file, it will try to bring

00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:00.510
from there. But from here itself, you can try to change your

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:04.290
entire user identity, right? The complete user identity, you

00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:07.510
can try to change, and then your system is going to hold it.

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:10.570
And system is going to respond. It as per the user identity

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:14.190
that you are going to set. So

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:31.480
okay. So it is saved now add custom memory. So if I would

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:36.800
like to add something like a, like a custom, I can, I can

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:41.400
try to add it over there. Right. And yeah, so everything

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:45.100
will be added inside a memory and accordingly. So it is

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:49.520
going to behave. So if I'm going to ask, tell me something

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:55.060
about, about. Okay. So the answer in detail.

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:05.260
Yeah. So certainly this answer is truly inspiring and yeah,

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.600
so it is, it is able to tell me something as you can see

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.520
over here, plus it is able to create some sort of a

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:14.660
suggestion, like some of the suggestions over here. So human

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:17.780
AI assistant, it's great to hear from you again, how can I

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:20.800
assist you with your teaching or any other question you

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.320
might have. So these are something that it is trying to

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.420
generate in terms of a suggestion. And this is the actual

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:29.900
chat, which I have done. Now. Maybe I can try to ask a

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:38.820
question that create a calculator app for me in Java script,

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:43.780
right? So yeah, this time. So it doesn't require a

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:48.860
basically, uh, like a proper RIG or a memory. So this time

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:53.120
it is supposed to go and hit, uh, basically, uh, you're on

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.600
a, sorry, URI AI URI. It is supposed to hit. So yeah, it is

00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.040
trying to hit URI. And then obviously it is, it is every

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.940
time it is telling me, so basically it is coming from there.

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:06.180
So it is coming from the memory. It is coming from the

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:08.520
memory. So it is trying to like, uh, help me out in terms of

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.840
everything. So yeah, this is the calculator app in a Java

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:18.140
script. It is able to give it to me. Now tell me about as

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:18.780
antique AI.

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:28.770
Okay. Give me a complete

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:42.750
roadmap for data. Science. In a step by step manner, why I'm

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.430
doing this. I'll I'll tell you why I'm doing this much.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:51.400
Okay. So complete data science roadmap, it is able to give

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.340
it to me. And if I'm going to ask, create a schedule or time

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:56.900
table or whatever, obviously the system will be able to do

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.940
it. Now, uh, uh,

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.340
tell me, tell

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:17.980
me about Sudan shoe based on the, or what is the, is,

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:27.940
uh, the memory that you are able to build so far,

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:38.590
based on the previous conversation I understand that you are

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:40.830
deeply involved in teaching, empowering learners, data

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:42.630
science related field and sharing regarding your question

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:46.210
about the memory I am able to build so far as in I don't

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:49.050
have ability to retain or remember the past conversation or

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:52.170
personal data beyond our current session unless integrated

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:54.070
with a specific memory feature. My response was generated

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:57.530
based on the context of our ongoing interaction and my

00:29:57.530 --> 00:30:00.430
training data however I do have access to the conversation

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:04.370
history within this session which helped me to provide a

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:07.050
consistent and relevant response if you are referring to the

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:10.730
kind of memory or knowledge I can utilize it can include the

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:13.770
detail you have shared about your journey your goal of

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:16.710
education and topic we have discussed like data science to

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:19.530
see all of these things are coming from there so obviously

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:23.010
like I have update about updated about myself I have added

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:26.610
some of the custom memory and then whatever discussion I

00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:29.830
have done with this bot. Even it is able to remember each

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.910
and everything right it is able to remember each and

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:36.910
everything so this is the beauty of this like a memory based

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:39.750
chat bot that you will be able to find out now if you will

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:43.230
go and check so you can directly check over here like a

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:47.030
conversation history right conversation history so this is

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:50.490
the conversation history it is available into a JSON file

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:54.690
plus this is how even other vendor right so whether it's

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:57.390
open AI or anyone so they are storing your data right. We

00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:00.050
say that they are storing your data yeah this is how they

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:04.250
are they are going to store the data yeah and then like this

00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:07.730
meta we are trying to so this is the conversation history a

00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:10.950
raw conversation history and this is something that we are

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:15.190
trying to store into a vector DB right a vector DB at last

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:19.790
20 conversation so if it is going to cross 20 it will not

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:23.430
store beyond that so only till 20 indexes a latest one it

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:28.770
will be able to install now tell me. Tell me how Sudhanshu

00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:36.530
how Sudhanshu was associated with iNeuron right so this

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:40.030
model is not accessing a real-time data because I am using a

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:44.790
GPT nano GPT nano can't like you know access the real-time

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:47.330
information but yeah it is able to access some of the

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:48.790
private information that I have.

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:55.670
Are we also going to deploy this chat bot along with a full

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:58.930
CIGD pipeline not this one a better version of this one we

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:02.630
are going to deploy. But not today like in upcoming classes

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:06.550
today I'll just objective is to discuss and show you a demo

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:12.510
that how we can build a bot so which can remember me for a

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:16.770
very very very very long time yeah so even now if I am going

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:19.910
to close the session so again this database is physically

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:23.790
available this entire indexes is physically available so if

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:26.430
this database is physically available even if I am going to

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:28.810
come tomorrow maybe after 10 days it is going to remember.

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:32.990
Right. And now to host this entire things I just have to you

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:37.470
know host a UI on some platform and then this DB on some

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:40.710
platform and establish the connection rest is anyhow like

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:44.890
live and online for example the API that we are using fine

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:51.160
guys so are you are you able to chat with your bot with by

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:54.480
giving your own memory or delete the data folder it will

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:59.140
create automatically and then try to chat I think that will

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:01.200
give you a better feeling.

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:17.280
So. So. So what is the size of the memory size I have not

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.440
defined over here so I have defined in terms of a

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.760
conversation so which you will be able to find it into a

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:25.340
setting class which is the very very first class. So here I

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:27.680
am defining that maximum number of conversation turns to

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.020
keep so I'm just trying to say that try to keep 20

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:32.760
conversation maybe I can say 200 conversation maybe I can

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:36.020
say 2000 conversation 20000 or maybe 2 lakh conversation so

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:41.080
it is going to store that much of conversation for now this

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:44.160
is what I'm doing you can try to limit it even in terms of

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.320
like a size. That's completely fine you just have to write

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:49.600
one small utility function right so it will keep on checking

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:53.620
the size of this like a vector database that I'm trying to

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:57.400
use and then it will keep on removing the previous one the

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.180
earliest one.

00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:04.330
So how many how many of you are able to chat guys yeah

00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:21.980
anyone who is who is able to chat

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:40.080
yes I can do okay no langchen actually I have written that

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:43.460
and I was like using it in between then in later stage. So I

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:45.880
have like deactivated that function. I've just done that.

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:50.080
I've just removed that function so because of like a some

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:53.300
issue with respect to the memory it was creating for me so I

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:56.860
have just just removed it that's the reason so I told you in

00:34:56.860 --> 00:35:00.660
between that that there is a langchen I'm using but in a

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:03.920
later stage I have just like removed it for me yeah.

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:44.730
So fine just like a let me know once you are able to do it

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:46.110
guys okay

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:43.540
so fine looks great. So just do what you want. Just do one

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:47.520
thing guys try to go through this entire project once again

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:54.780
class by class this time and try to backtrack like from the

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:59.440
main LLM or main chat class that we have so try to backtrack

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:05.170
from there each and everything one by one one by one right

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:11.470
try to digest a code as much as you can basically and if you

00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:14.330
have any kind of a concern or confusion so do let me know.

00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:17.930
In a next class or maybe in a chat itself you can let me

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:21.390
know right in a chat itself you can let me know. Like I said

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:24.050
I have written a langchen function I was using it but then I

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:27.570
have removed the function from here as it was giving me some

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:33.050
memory based like a issue basically so as you can see it is

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:36.890
try with the langchen if available may have more feature

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:38.990
this is what I have like done and I have just commented it

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:43.110
out but yeah so I'm not like using it actively this one this

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:45.570
particular part. Okay. This is how this code has been

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:48.630
designed so just try to go through the code once let me know

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:51.710
if you are facing any kind of a issue and then if you are

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:54.690
not able to understand some of the part maybe I'll try to

00:37:54.690 --> 00:38:00.070
explain you in my next class. Can anyone drop the command to

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:03.390
run the streamlint? I think to run the streamlint command is

00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:05.670
simple right so streamlint run and then file name

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:15.420
command is strem lit streamlint run and then let's suppose

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:17.900
this is the file so file name and it will run.

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:24.460
Okay. And if it is giving you some issue with respect to any

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:28.220
kind of library then go ahead and install it.

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:36.880
Fine guys so I think we are anyhow connected over a group

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:40.960
chat so do let me know if you are going to face any issue.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:47.400
Now in my upcoming classes so if you will go and check your

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:50.840
syllabus so we have a back to back back to back so many

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:56.660
project which is there in my upcoming classes so like this

00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:59.060
kind of a project. So many projects are already in pipeline

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:04.500
a label one label two label three segment. So here memory

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.720
enhanced chatbot this is something that we have discussed

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:09.160
with persistent and the dynamic memory so yeah we are able

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:12.640
to persist it and dynamic memory we are able to add it. Now

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:16.180
these are the project we are going to see one by one one by

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:19.000
one and believe me every project is going to be a kind of an

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.700
eye opener for all of you. Doesn't matter whether it's going

00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:26.660
to be the small or whether it's going to be a big and we'll

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:30.460
move on. Okay. Do we have a little certification course in

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:31.700
Iran not for now.

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:37.910
What is the Farsi was don't mention it in that case it will

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:39.990
like download the latest version.

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:14.060
Okay. So any question for me guys any question anything for

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:14.260
me.

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:21.840
Should we use FASI F A I S S into a most of the use cases or

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.880
there is any criteria beside the right vector DB. I'll not

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:29.520
say that you should use a Facebook a semantic search all the

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:32.480
time. So there are like a different different kind of a

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:35.940
databases. We are using if you are going to ask me what we

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:40.200
are using as of now in your own for like a job system. So we

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:43.680
are using basically a MongoDB inside a MongoDB. They gave

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:46.260
you a document based storage and search plus they give you

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:48.380
even a vector based storage and search. So we are using

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:51.840
actually MongoDB if you are going to ask me in like a real

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:55.820
time because we have more trust on that platform other

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:59.240
platform which is like a baby yet or maybe a pine cone. It's

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:02.460
a new one. I don't think that they have like a stable

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:04.580
technology. It's a new one. Maybe as of now, but yeah, they

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:07.240
are doing a promotion. They are building things day by day.

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:11.440
But still if you're asking me like I'll pay more but if

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:15.140
something is going into a production, I will prefer to use

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:16.840
the stable one plus

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:26.880
you can try to go and find out even a difference between all

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:31.160
of these like databases like and you will be able to get

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:34.940
some little bit of insights. Not much at the end of the day.

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:38.040
It's a vector DB that we are trying to use that's a vector

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.520
search that we are trying to initialize is

00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:53.620
there a hyper parameter tuning see have a parameter tuning

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:56.880
we try to do into a training part right not here. So when we

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:59.780
say we are trying to build a rag nowhere we are trying to do

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:03.860
a training the hyper parameter that you can try to perform

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:06.920
over here based on like parameters that you can try to

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:11.220
change based on the application that you are trying to build

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:16.220
is the length of the embedding the search that you are

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:19.740
doing. And then when you're trying to do a search, so what

00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:23.120
kind of a method it is trying to use in terms of a search.

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:25.260
So these are the three four parameter that you can try to

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:26.380
play with.

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:36.340
Okay, so fine guys with that, thank you so much. If you have

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:39.500
any kind of a question, so please ping me in a group. And

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:42.500
I'll be happy to answer over there to all of your questions.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.420
And please try to run this particular project, the project

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:48.280
which I have shared with all of you and let me know if

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:51.100
you're facing an issue with that guys, thank you so much in

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:52.960
next class. I'm going to talk about a new project,

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:56.020
basically, thank you so much, everyone.
