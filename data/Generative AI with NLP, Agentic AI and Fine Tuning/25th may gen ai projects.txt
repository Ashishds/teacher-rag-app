WEBVTT

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:08.310
okay so let's wait for two more minutes and then let's start

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:13.580
the class yeah so I believe you all have liked the project

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.660
that I have discussed yesterday and even today I am going to

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.960
talk about the project so hopefully all of you are going to

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.580
like it a lot even this particular project even today is

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.280
going to be very useful so today I am going to talk about

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:35.380
two good project and to a very very small project as per

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.440
your syllabus so I'm going to talk about something with

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.560
respect to our memory so like how we can try to like build a

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.620
memory how we can try to pass a memory to a system so that

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.080
based on the previous conversation and based on the memory

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.580
that it has built it will be able to give you a response and

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.320
reply so recently you must have seen that everyone is trying

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.880
to implement our memory part right so whether it's a chat

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.640
GPT or maybe someone else and even if you will go and chat

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.860
with yuri so it try to like give your answers with respect

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.380
to maybe your name and even it is able to memorize some of

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.720
the things from your past conversation so how this memory

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.580
system is going to work that is something that we are going

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.910
to build we can we are going to test it i made a simple

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.970
project with that yeah so then go and share with the entire

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.770
world maybe into your group you can try to share maybe over

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.150
a social media you can try to share maybe you can try to

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.290
share your github repository yeah come in selvan okay

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.930
shall we start now okay

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.920
couple of people are asking in a group that is class started

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.600
yeah it's already started okay

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.300
so let's let's start guys uh so let me share my screen i

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.500
believe my screen is visible to all of you and here it goes

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:37.730
where is my browser okay so you run and generative ai this

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:46.450
is your batch generative ai with nlp okay now so guys uh

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.210
what we are going to do today is uh that let me show you

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.890
first uh yeah so this memory enhanced chatbot we have

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.290
already discussed right so we are we are going through a

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.970
label one application as like like a small application

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.970
basically so memory enhanced chatbot we have already

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.830
discussed and then we have discussed this sql part so this

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.890
this particular part is done and we have even talked about a

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.870
basic rag system so where we have connected our uh like a

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.130
vector databases so we have we have even gone through this

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.730
particular part so in my today's class what we are going to

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.250
do is so we'll try to complete this entire section so to

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.890
complete this entire section this part is already discussed

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.970
let me change my pain color yeah so this particular part i

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.710
have already discussed sql powered we have already discussed

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.790
rag we have already discussed right now so we have to talk

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.950
about this one we have to talk about this one we have to

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.010
talk about this one and we have to talk about this one now

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.450
if i'm going to discuss all of these four in that case level

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.290
one application will be finished right and uh obviously we

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.170
all are able to learn something from our rag we all are able

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.550
to learn something from a vector db we all know now that how

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.730
we can communicate with the embedding models how we can try

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.210
to communicate with even a real-time search model we now

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:20.650
even know that how i will be able to communicate with any

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.170
other llms right so the way we are consuming a uri api key

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.450
in the similar manner i can just go out and i can try to

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.990
consume an api key from anywhere and yeah so pass all those

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.570
variables pass all those like required parameters it is it

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.730
is going to give me a response so this fourth thing i am

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:44.150
going to discuss out of this uh this one is very basic uh

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.550
it's like uh extracting some sort of information from the

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.430
unsearched data this one is also very basic you can just try

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.990
to pass any kind of a line to a model and model is smart

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.510
enough it will be able to like just the sentiment

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.890
automatically without using any kind of a sentiment based or

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.590
sentiment analyzer for models right don't have to use any

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.470
external model just go ahead with the lms so in a very first

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.570
place i'll be talking about this one so pdf knowledge

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.210
extraction bot question and sync from a pdf document and

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.890
here i'm going to show you a memory right which is not

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.370
mentioned in the syllabus but yeah so i'm going to show you

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.550
this application but inside this application so i have

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.310
attached so when i was building this application for you

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.710
like for this particular class so i have attached a memory

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.430
part into this one and you all are going to love it

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.790
basically because this is going to give you a lot of

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.590
advantage so memory will be added over here even rag will be

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.570
added over here and even vector database will be added over

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.270
here in this particular project so memory retrieval

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.610
augmented generation and a vector db obviously when i say

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.690
rag so obviously i have to use some sort of a vector

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.850
database so we are we are going to use it and then we are

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.850
going to build this application and then even inside this

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:07.250
one so we are going to use so this project is basically an

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.610
extension of this particular project so here with one

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.130
document we can go and chat and here with a multiple

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.390
document we can go and chat that's the only difference

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.050
between this project and this project so this project is

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.610
going to be the extension of the previous one so first I'll

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.530
be talking about this then I'll be talking about this and

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.550
then I'll be talking about this and then I will be talking

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.650
about this this too is not going to take much of time even

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.870
you guys can do it but yeah so as it's a part of syllabus so

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.010
it's my responsibility to talk about these things in a live

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.710
class itself so I'm going to discuss all of these things so

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.670
shall we start now guys I believe agenda is clear to all of

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:49.170
us yeah so we are we are going to finish this particular

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:53.010
portion in this class and then from next class so we are

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.610
going to start with a lang chain or lang series you can say

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.310
and then llama indexes all of those application that has

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.150
been mentioned over here right so where we are going to use

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.830
our existing knowledge but here I'm going to teach you that

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.950
how you can try to build a different different kind of

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:14.030
agents how you can try to connect one agent to another agent

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.370
and then eventually how you will be able to complete a

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.950
particular task so that is that is something that we are

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.850
going to start from next week onwards. And all of these

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.230
applications. Almost all of this application which I'm going

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.230
to build and which I'm going to show you so I'll make sure

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.830
that all of these applications should be agentic application

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.570
in a nature because like people are talking about this

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:41.010
agentic AI a lot right and it's not very difficult believe

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.770
me because we have a framework right we are going to use a

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.950
crew AI we are going to use a lang chain we are going to use

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.470
a llama indexes or maybe a lang graph we are going to use

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:53.030
and that too with the URI API for embedding and for a chat

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:57.410
completion or maybe for a real time search. So it's not very

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.530
difficult to like a build it but yes once you are going to

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.430
build a couple of agents by yourself then you will be able

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.690
to build any kind of agent whichever whichever comes in your

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:10.590
plate or in whatever project that you are going to build so

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:15.790
that will be the agenda and then we are going to talk about

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:19.450
a fine tuning of a model based on the different different

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:23.170
parameters right so as per the syllabus like I said so we

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.670
are going to move as per the syllabus. As simple as that so

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:30.290
let's get started with today's class let me close all of

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:37.600
this window and let's open up a visual studio code now here

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:42.900
file open folder and go to any folder and then here inside

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:49.860
my code directory gen AI application is a folder for today I

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:55.440
am going to create ok now. So

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.900
the very first application as I said that we are going to

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.400
build an application which is going to understand your

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:24.360
entire PDF basically you will be able to chat with your PDF

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.320
you can upload any kind of a document and then with PDF you

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.320
will be able to chat that is one of the part but along with

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.400
that so it is going to retain even a conversational memory

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.800
right it is going to retain a conversational memory. And

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.720
even from your conversation. So it is it is going to like

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.580
give you a responses so that is something that we are going

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:49.720
to build over here. So the very first part let me open up

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:56.560
this scribble ink. So yeah, the very first part that we have

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:01.060
to like build over here is that that there will be a client

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:06.260
or there will be a UI or entry point you can say UI now from

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:11.820
those UI you will be able to upload a PDF. You can upload

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.800
basically a PDF, you can extend it for any other kind of a

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.160
document as well maybe Excel sheet maybe for a Word document

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.880
because at the end of the day, we just have to read out data

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.540
out of this PDF and all those things, right. So this is

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:29.800
something that we are like going to do. Let me Yeah.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.180
So there will be a UI which is a client which is going to be

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:47.040
the entry point, then there will be like. like I'm going to

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:51.840
upload a PDF basically. So upload basically a PDF from here.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:57.660
Now I'm going to read this PDF data, whatever data is

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.600
available inside this PDF page by page, page by page, page

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.320
by page, and extract all the information out of this PDF.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:10.460
And then I'm going to create a chunk, basically chunk out of

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:14.260
the data, which I'm going to get it from a PDF. So in a

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.760
small, small chunk, I'm going to basically break all of this

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.600
data with some sort of a overlapping window so that, uh, you

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.860
know, so all this chunk will be related to each other. And

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.780
then once I will be able to do that, I'm going to convert

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:32.320
this entire chunk, whatever chunk, which I will be able to

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.700
build out of the data, which I'm going to read from the PDF

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:40.800
into an embeddings, embeddings into an embeddings with the

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.880
help of URI embedding, basically. So. We have a URI

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.040
embedding API, and we have a small case model available over

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.160
here. So we are going to use a URI embedding and we are

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.180
going to create a embedding of this chunk one by one, one by

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:58.520
one. And once my embedding will be available, so I'm going

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:04.340
to store it into a vector data base. So VDB, I'm going to

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:08.400
store it. Now, once this data will be stored inside of

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:13.320
vector DB, right, vector DB. So then what we are going to

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.860
do? I'm going to do is that whenever you are used again,

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:21.220
again, so there will be a UI interface, my user UI interface

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:25.320
where you can try to ask a question, same UI interface. I'm

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.000
going to use this one UI interface so you can ask a

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.500
question. Now, once you are going to ask a question, so

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:35.080
basically a question with respect to the PDF that you have

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:39.020
uploaded, simple, not a direct question to a model. So

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:42.920
basically the question, which you have like a, whatever PDF,

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.600
whatever data, which is available in the PDF. So we can try

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:50.440
and go ahead with the multiple PDF at a time. So here we can

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.220
try to ask a question. Now, once I'm going to ask a question

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:59.920
system is going to perform a RAG operation plus system is

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:04.380
going to build a conversational memory for me, which you

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.700
will be able to even see that conversational memory, that

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.600
what is getting inside a conversational memory, each and

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.040
everything I'm going to show you. So RAG plus memory. So

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.860
this is the implementation we are going to do. And finally,

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:21.040
I will be able to get my response out of this PDF response

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:25.980
out of this PDF, right? So this is the flow that we are

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:29.280
going to build and around this flow. So we are going to see

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:33.040
the code. So is it clear guys, anyone who is having any kind

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:37.000
of a question with respect to this flow? Yeah. Anyone,

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.180
anyone

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:47.850
guys who is having like, uh, any, any kind of a question?

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:50.930
Anyone? Who is having doubt now

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:58.950
again? So this project that I'm going to discuss, so

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:02.410
obviously you will be able to use this project in all the

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:05.150
LLM based project that you are going to build, or maybe all

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:09.850
the RAG based application by using the same context by

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:13.250
modifying according to your need and according to your

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:17.870
requirement. So now a code is not very difficult, uh, as we

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:21.530
all know that, uh, it's a LLM, which is doing the job. So we

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:24.270
just have to do the configuration most of the time. Right?

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:28.130
So here, uh, first of all, you have to create a requirement

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:34.710
dot TXT, R-E-Q-U-I-R-E-M-E-N-T-S dot, dot TXT file. So

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:37.150
requirement dot TXT file, you have to create, and then

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:40.150
couple of things you have to keep inside a requirement dot

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:43.790
TXT. So you have to keep a PDF plumber basically, so that it

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:47.170
can help me out in terms of reading out a PDF, right? So

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:49.990
this is just a library. Then I'm going to use a vector

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:53.630
database wise, a Facebook AI semantic search. Now you can go

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:56.870
ahead with. Any other vector DB, if you want, maybe a chroma

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:59.310
DB, maybe a pine cone. We have already done the discussion

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:02.290
and you just have to call the connectors. You will be able

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:05.490
to connect. And then instead of using this, uh, in-memory

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:08.510
Facebook AI, semantic search vector DB, you can try to use

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:11.710
any other one, right? A request just to request to my API

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:15.490
numpy again, simple operation is streamlined for building a

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:19.470
UI. So these are the libraries we are going to use it. So

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:22.470
keep all of this library inside your requirement dot TXT

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:25.810
file guys. Dr. Is asking question. What if we add a new

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:29.490
file? Will it repeat the whole process or just add chunks

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:32.370
and embeddings as of now, the project, which I'm going to

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:37.630
show you. So basically it is going to like, uh, give you a

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:41.570
response based on the current one single upload and the next

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:43.710
project, which I'm going to show you, right? The next one

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:48.430
over there, I'm showing you even a multiple file upload. So

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:51.970
this one will be working with only one files. Next one will

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:54.890
be working with the multiple files. And even I can, because

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:57.410
see, at the end of the day, I'm trying to hold something

00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:01.570
into a embedded as a embedding into my vector DB, right? So

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:05.630
as long as those data is available inside my vector DB, I'm

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:08.370
good, right? Doesn't matter whether it is going to work with

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:10.470
a current one or the next one, it will be able to work with

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:15.530
everything in that situation. So I'll, I'll, I have that

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.790
application as well. So, which I'm going to show you, that's

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:20.870
the reason. So we have a multiple file, uh, search system.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:25.130
Okay. Now, once this one. One is done, then try to create

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:28.270
one simple Python file where we are going to keep all the

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:33.590
code. So PDF underscore RG underscore bought a dot PI file.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:36.490
You can give any other name if you want, uh, that's

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:39.150
completely fine with me, but yeah, so just try to create one

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:43.810
Python file. And before that, so just run your requirement

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:50.710
.txt file. So pip install hyphen are requirements.txt file.

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:54.110
Now, whatever will be. Like, uh, available inside the

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:57.550
requirement.txt file in a single go, it will be able to

00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:00.230
install each and everything. So just run your requirement

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:05.370
.txt file so that things will be installed and then, and

00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:10.790
then try to basically import all of these libraries. So

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:15.110
plumber, Facebook, AI, semantic search, all of these things,

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:17.290
try to import, sorry,

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:23.260
if needed, we want to create this completely free. No URI.

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:27.520
No open AI. I mean, like you need a LLM APIs without LLM

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.140
APIs, how you will be able to create it. So in that is let's

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:34.080
suppose there is a situation where you don't want to use any

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.160
APIs, which is available out there. That's fine. There is an

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.180
alternative even for that one. So all the big models are

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:45.740
already available in a hugging face repository in a ulama

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:48.640
repository. So you can just go over there, download those

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.960
models. And instead of calling an API, call those models.

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.920
Right. But again, so if you are doing that in a local

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.420
system, or if you're doing that in a system, so where you

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:01.940
have a very less computation and very less memory, those

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:06.300
models are not going to support you. Right. I'm like, it

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.780
will not give you error. I'm not saying that it will not, it

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:10.640
will give you an error. No, it is not going to give you

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:15.220
error. Basically your application will take time. So there

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.040
is a cost event to it. Even if you are going ahead with the

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:22.680
free, there is option obviously. Right. So again, this deep

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.400
seek R1 model is already available. The entire llama series

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.900
is available to you. Mistral is available to you. So there

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.340
are so many models, which is already out there. You can

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:32.700
download a physical file and just go ahead and interact with

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:36.340
that. At the end of the day, I need a LLMs, right? This is

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:38.780
the only requirement, even through a URI, even through a

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:42.420
open AI. So I'm just trying to access what I'm just trying

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:45.680
to access LLMs, right? So maybe, you know, in a physical

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.140
system, you can try to access LLMs. I have already created a

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.320
video. So like how you can try to configure. Okay. Maybe you

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.420
can go and search. So how you will be able to configure

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.040
these open source model is, I think I have created that for

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.820
a deep seek. I don't remember, but yeah, I think this is

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:03.540
what I have done. And I was using basically open AI, open

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:08.020
web UI interface to chat with those models from a llama.

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.660
So hugging face also providing you with tons of models.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:18.000
Llama is also providing you almost all the LLM models. Go

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.280
ahead with that if you want. Okay. So. So these are the

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.360
import that we have to do now. Next thing is, so we need a

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:30.980
URI API key. We need a URI chat URL and we need a URI

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:35.520
embedding URL. Yeah. So, uh, now

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:44.740
let's try to create our variables for a URI API key and then

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:50.580
URI chat URL, URI chat URL, and then URI embedding URL. So

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.460
these are three variables I'm going to create where I'm

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:56.300
going to keep like, uh, embedding, URL. So I'm going to

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.600
create a chat URL API key and a chat URL. So what should be

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:07.540
the chat URL? Let me go to URI and, uh, from here, URI APIs.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:12.540
Uh, I can go to code example itself and from anywhere I can

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:16.140
just try to copy my chat URL.

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:21.560
So this is my chat URL, by the way, this is my chat URL,

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:26.160
chat completion, and then URL for embedding. Uh, embeddings

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:30.120
is this one. So from anywhere I can go and I can try to copy

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:38.180
my embeddings URL. So URL for embedding is this one pinging

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.180
you once again now.

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:55.170
So just try to copy your API key. So API key, I can try to

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:59.290
copy from authentication tab. So copy the API key and keep

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:04.590
it here. So my API key is done. Uh, embedding URL is done.

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:07.350
Chat URL is done. These three things is required. So

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:10.570
embedding to create a embedding. So, and, uh, chat URL to

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:17.620
hit my models and this one, okay, now let's do one thing. So

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.800
we have to create one variable and I'm going to print this

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.840
variable and I'm going to show you that. So here, C O N V R

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.960
S A T I O N conversation, underscore M E M O R Y

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.560
conversation memory. I'm going to create a variable as an

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.640
empty list, as you can see, so that I will keep on adding my

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:40.580
conversation. So on

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:42.100
that list, I'm going to call this variable. So I will write

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:46.180
the example of, so, got my article times ever so order, say

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.040
C O N V R S and I straight quote jeans value of one, then

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:47.100
method of, okay. file as and when I have used, and when I

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:47.280
have used, I'm going to insert cream V, but you So this is

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.760
what I have described it hiyou. And this one will give me

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:53.120
one, I can use file edit that. So here are my single putting

00:21:53.120 --> 00:22:02.400
method intuitively. So when I do this, as per what is

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.380
called code, right? path, it is trying to open up a PDF.

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.380
Everything is done by this PDF plumber, this library that we

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.460
have installed, right? So PDF plumber, so PDF plumber, just

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:14.560
try to open it up just like any other files and what it

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:18.060
does. So it will try to go page by page, page by page, page

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:21.380
by page, whatever number of the page that you have, and it

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:25.880
will be able to extract a raw data, simple raw data from a

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:29.660
PDF. It will be able to read. So this is what the system is

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:34.120
doing, and I don't think that this code is like in any way

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.160
difficult to understand. It's very, very easy to understand,

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.480
right? So here we are going through our pages and then one

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:43.380
by one we are trying to extract. So okay, first part, this

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:47.000
part, basically this part, read PDF, right? So once I will

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.660
be able to read a PDF, once I will be able to read the PDF,

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.940
then what is the next part that we have to do? So we have to

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:57.360
split it down into a small, small chunks. Because let's

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:01.460
suppose. I have like a 50,000 or 50 millions token inside my

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:04.860
PDF, I have a big, big PDFs, right? So I have to break it

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.900
down into a small, small, small, small chunk so that I will

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:12.560
be able to store those data into maybe like my vector DV. So

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:17.440
here to do that, to split this entire things into a chunk, I

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.680
can try to use this function. So a split text function, I'm

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:23.460
going to use this function I've already written. So split

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.220
text. Now what we are going to do. So this function is going

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.760
to take an input. So whatever this function will return,

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.420
right? Whatever this function will return means whatever

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:35.960
this PDF will return. So I'm going to pass this one into

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.620
this particular split text function. I'm trying to keep

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:42.780
chunk size is equal to 500 and overlap is equal to 100.

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:46.460
Simply means that, that let's suppose I'm trying to start

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:50.540
from a pointer zero. I'll go till 500. Then I will just call

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:54.880
that as a one chunk. Then the next chunk when I'll try to

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.800
create, I'll start from the 400th index. Then, then, then

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:02.660
again till 500, so 900 basically, then again, next chunk is

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:06.300
going to start from a 800. So 800 plus five 1300, and then

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:09.140
next chunk is going to start from 1200. So in this way, I'll

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:12.720
try to keep some of the relative information right between

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:15.440
one data and the other data. So this is what we are trying

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.960
to do. So here, this is just a list. You can, you can even

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.800
try to print it and then you will be able to see it and we

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.980
are going to print it. Basically, you will be able to see

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:26.580
that what is going inside the chunk, but yeah, as this this

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:29.520
function is just a simple Pythonic function. So what we are

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.580
trying to do, so while a start is lesser than length or

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.560
whatever text, whatever text that we have. So a start plus

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.400
chunk size, so a start plus chunk size. So let's suppose I'm

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.600
starting from zero chunk size is 500. So I'll try to extract

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:45.160
data till 500 and then I'll try to append it. Then again,

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.920
I'll keep on doing the same repetitive process. My start

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:54.080
will be what my start will be like a first 500 and then my

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:57.380
start will be become a 400. Basically. So that's the reason.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.580
So here it's written a start is equal to a start plus chunk

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:04.300
size minus overlap. Yeah. So start plus initially value of a

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:07.100
start is equal to zero. Then chunk size is 500. Then overlap

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.980
is a hundred total value of a start in the next iteration is

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:14.220
going to be 400, right? Then into our next iteration is

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:16.940
going to be 800. Then it is going to be 1200. So in this

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:20.520
way, we will keep on extracting the data. You can try to

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:23.040
manipulate this one. You can try to keep it maybe five lag,

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:26.780
5,000 depends on depends, right? So you can, you can try to

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:32.130
do the experimentation, but yeah, you are not using

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:35.430
Langchain for reading and checking. No, I am not using

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:38.350
Langchain because Langchain I'll be discussing in my next

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:41.350
class with respect to agent. So I'm just using a simple

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:43.390
Pythonic function. Langchain is also a Python library,

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:47.010
right? Someone has written something inside a Langchain with

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:50.090
the help of Python. Same thing, right? So here I'm using a

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:54.050
raw coding, not a prebuilt APIs.

00:25:56.060 --> 00:26:00.220
I'll be using that in the next class. So I am using a new

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:03.680
one. So this is done. Uh, so it is going to split my data

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:06.740
into a small, small, small, small chunks, by the way. Now

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:13.280
let me ping you this, uh, entire piece of code. Now next

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:17.180
part. So checking is done, right? Checking is done. Now what

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:21.500
is the next part? URI embeddings. So I have to pass this

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:25.940
entire chunk into a URI so that it will be able to generate

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:30.460
embedding for me. Okay. Because inside a URI, we have

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:34.960
embedding models, right? So inside a URI, there is models,

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:40.220
right? So inside URI, we have this text embeddings model,

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:45.760
right? From OpenAI itself with a dimension of 1536, a good

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:48.940
amount of dimension. So we have this particular one and

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:52.480
yeah, so we are going to use this one with the help of URI.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:58.140
So let me put a code for that one. This code is all already

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:02.080
available inside your URI. So this is nothing new. This is

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:04.100
not something which I have written. So this is already

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.740
available as a sample code inside URI as well. So here it is

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.420
going to take a data. So whatever data that you are going to

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.460
pass, in my case, I will be passing a chunk one by one, one

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:17.380
by one, one by one, and then it is going to like call the

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:20.960
URI API and then inside a payload, it is going to pass the

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.600
data, text embedding through a small model it is going to

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:27.020
use. And then. And then eventually it is going to give you a

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:31.360
response, right? So for the in a response.json, it is going

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:35.540
to give you a data and that is going to be the embedding. So

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:39.900
this is something that I will be able to get. Okay. So this

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:43.980
is for a URI embeddings. Now once embedding is done, right?

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:47.820
Once embedding is done, then what you have to do, so you

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:51.700
have to go to the next step, store those data into a vector

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:54.940
databases. We have already seen that, right? So how to store

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:58.120
our data into a vector DB, whether it's a pinecone, whether

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.480
it's a Facebook AI semantic search, whether it's a chroma

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:05.580
DB, we can, we can try to like a store this data anywhere,

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:09.260
right? Anywhere means literally anywhere. Even on a managed

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:11.980
platform, we can try to store the data. So here I'm trying

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:15.500
to use my, like a in-memory Facebook AI semantic search. So

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:21.100
here now what this will do is, so this is going to take a

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:24.800
chunks, whatever, like a data that you have built. Now it is

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.520
going to call URI embeddings. Now we know that URI

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.300
embeddings is going to return the embeddings and I'm trying

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:34.940
to just add. So index.add, add what? So add the embeddings,

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:38.020
as simple as that. So I'm calling this URI embeddings inside

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:40.840
this build vector store. It is going to return the

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.720
embeddings and then it is going to store it simple, right?

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:47.880
So here I'm using a Facebook AI semantic search index flat

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:55.160
L2. So this is for your URI embeddings. Sorry. Storing.

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:58.540
Storing data into a vector DV. So vector DV, we are able to

00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:02.640
store the data. Now once we are able to store a data inside

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:07.720
a vector database, right? So once we are able to like store

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:12.340
the data inside the vector databases, now let's suppose

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:16.080
someone is going to ask a question. Someone is going to ask

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:21.120
a question. So before generating an answer, right? If

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:24.160
someone is going to ask a question. So before generating an

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:29.160
answer. So we have to pass a question first, right? We have

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.420
to look into the chunk indexes. We have to look into its

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:36.240
embeddings and then top three embeddings we have to extract.

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:40.980
So here, whenever someone is going to ask a question. So

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.740
first of all, I'm trying to generate embeddings with the

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:46.500
help of URI embeddings for any question, any question that

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:49.460
you are going to ask after uploading a PDF. Let's suppose if

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:53.100
I start asking a question. So to those question, I'll, I'll

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:55.600
try to convert those questions. Into a numerical

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.600
representation. Technically it's called as embedding. So Q

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:03.480
embed basically, right? And then what we are going to do is,

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:06.760
so we are going to do a index dot search. Now from where

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:10.300
this index is going to come. My Facebook AI semantic search,

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:13.820
my vector database is going to give me the index parameter

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:17.340
or index object. So index dot search, and I'm going to

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:21.520
search those questions, which user have asked, right? So

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.360
which user have asked with respect to the PDF. Okay. From

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:30.440
the vector DB. So here, if user is going to ask a question,

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:34.360
so I'm going to do what the next step is. Next step is

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:37.680
basically RAG retrieval augmented generation. Now what is

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.140
the meaning of retrieval augmented generation? So whenever

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:43.760
someone is asking a question, so first of all, it will try

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:48.080
to search into a vector DB. This is something called as RAG,

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:50.580
right? This is something called as RAG. I think we all

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:53.700
understand what is the concept of philosophy behind the RAG.

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.280
We have already seen an example and practical operations as

00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:02.300
well in my previous classes. So here, it is going to search

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:06.000
those questions. It is going to do a matching with a vector

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.440
DB, which is available. And technically it is trying to

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:14.420
perform a retrieval augmented generation operation. Okay,

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:20.360
fine. So here, this is what it is trying to do. So index dot

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:23.700
search, search a question. Okay. And then try to fetch top

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.880
K. Maybe I can try to give value of K is equal to five or

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:31.500
three or maybe a 10. So those many top searches, it will try

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:34.500
to bring, right? It will try to bring, and it is going to

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:38.740
return you as a data and the nexus now. So here I'm just

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:41.700
trying to iterate through it and returning it as simple as

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.620
that. Yeah. So retrieve the context. Now in this way, this

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:48.820
function will help me out to retrieve a context based on my

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:52.220
question, the question, which I'm going to ask basically. So

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:52.860
here, I'm going to ask a question. So it will be able to

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:57.100
retrieve the context. Now once it will be able to retrieve a

00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:02.800
context, plus I have embeddings for my question, right? So

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.760
once it will be able to retrieve the context basically, and

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:10.780
I have a question, I will try to pass both, right? I will

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:14.220
try to pass my question plus the context that I have

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:20.100
retrieved from my vector DB to my LLMs basically. So that my

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:23.120
LLMs will be able to give me the answer. Right? So that my

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:25.920
LLM will be able to give me the answer. So now it's time to

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:31.900
pass this entire things. So now it's time to pass this

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:38.720
entire, like a quotient will go here, do RAG, retrieve a

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:45.800
context. Now I have context plus quotient, right? I have

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:49.780
context plus quotient over here. I will try to pass this

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:54.920
entire things to my LLMs. Basically, so that I will be able

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:58.940
to get a response LLMs, maybe like a 4-0 mini, I will try to

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:01.900
pass or any other 10 of the LLMs that we have available. So

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:04.380
to any of the LLMs, we are going to pass context plus

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:09.300
quotient. Now not only this, we will try to pass even a

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:12.940
memory over here, right? We'll try to pass even a memory.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:17.780
We'll try to add even a memory inside this one. So initially

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:21.060
memory is going to be zero. As you can see that I have

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:28.380
created. I have already created this memory, but this is

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:30.880
empty as of now, right? So initially memory is, so when you

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.720
are going to start your conversation for the very first

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:35.820
time, so there is nothing inside the memory, but eventually

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:39.120
I'll keep on building it. So whatever system is going to

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:42.180
give as a response and whatever user is going to ask as a

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:45.280
question or whatever things that I want, I can just try to

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:48.360
keep it inside the memory. I can even decide that how much

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:51.840
memory I should keep because memory is a costliest

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.020
operation. Okay. So when you are trying to store something

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:56.840
into a memory, it's a costliest operation. It's not like if

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:59.300
user has done a chatting, maybe a hundred days back, or

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:03.020
maybe user has ended up generating a tons or GBs of data, I

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:05.760
will keep it, I will hold it inside the memory. No. So

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:08.540
that's, that's a reason. So like, uh, in a production, in a

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:12.880
real time, it, uh, we have to handle a lot of things before

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:17.740
like, uh, allowing user to deal with the memories because,

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:22.140
uh, again, if I'm going to like, uh, uh, uh, create a memory

00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:24.660
on a cloud. So if I'm going to build a memory on a client

00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:27.060
side, so if someone is using my system, for example, a URI,

00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:29.780
if someone is going to use the problem, uh, people are going

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:32.380
to face is that, that after some chat, it will start

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:34.940
crashing and will show that your system is out of memory.

00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:38.520
Right? If, if I'm trying to like, uh, build a memory on a

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.680
client side, if I'm going to build a memory on a server

00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:43.700
side, again, it's a problem for a company. So in both the

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:46.540
cases, it's a problem. So we try to split it and we try to

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:49.520
design a memory system in a pretty much different way.

00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:52.720
Whenever we go for the production, but here. So as. Uh.

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:55.880
Like, uh, we are trying to build, uh, MVP kind of a project.

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:59.760
So we are not taking care of much, but yeah, in real time,

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:04.340
it's a real pain basically. And uh, we are also building it.

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:08.960
So we know the pain like, uh, because, uh, either user will

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:12.220
complain or we will end up paying a lot of money to a cloud

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:17.520
platform again. So now when everything is done, so we are

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:21.580
going to call us URI with that context. Now what LLM is

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:24.080
going to take as an input. So LLM is going to take

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:27.140
questions, question that user has asked, and then LLM is

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:29.640
going to take a context context, which I'm trying to

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:33.440
retrieve, retrieve from where a vector database. So it is

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:38.140
going to take that one simple as per this, right? So context

00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:38.800
plus question.

00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:00.600
Okay. So, uh, this one context plus question, and that will

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:05.540
go inside by, uh, LLMs basically. So here, uh, question plus

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:08.900
context plus memory, but as of now, uh, initially I don't

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:11.080
have any kind of. I have a memory. Eventually I'm trying to

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:17.080
extend it means we are trying to add those memories. Anyone

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:20.120
guys who can tell me, uh, what is our difference between

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:22.360
extend and append, can

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:36.590
we expect your own monthly subscription? Not now. So not

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:40.030
possible as of now, I anyhow, like, uh, go with the yearly

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:42.610
one. It's like a little bit more affordable.

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:48.580
Yup. So any, anyone who can tell me what is the difference

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:51.340
between it's the list list functionality, right? So anyone

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:53.220
who can tell me like, what is the difference between append

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:53.680
and extend?

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:11.830
It's a basic list concept guys.

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:21.520
Yeah. So let's suppose I have a list and, uh, in almost all

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:23.780
of my Python classes, I have already like, uh, discussed

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:26.920
about this append means what list dot append means. So let's

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:29.460
suppose if I'm going to like, uh, pass my name over here,

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:32.240
then if I'm going to show you list, so basically append will

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:35.240
try to append a data at the end, right? So whether it's a

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:37.500
iterative data, whether it's a non iterative data, so at the

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.600
end of the day, it is going to append it as it is. So even

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.340
if I'm going to pass a numbers, it is going to append it at

00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:45.960
the last. Now, uh, let's suppose if I'm going to call, this

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:48.580
is again a list function and I'm going to pass maybe a

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:51.920
numbers. Now it is giving me an error. Yup. It is giving me

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:54.900
an error. It says that, that I'm expecting a iterable

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:58.160
object. I'm expecting a iterable object integer is not a

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:00.860
iterable object. You can't iterate over to it. So extend is

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:03.660
not going to work with this kind of object. Now list dot

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:06.600
extend. If I'm going to call and if I'm going to pass my

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:10.280
name over here, now see how it is going to append it. So it

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:13.400
is going to split the data into a small, small chunk means

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:16.460
it is going to iterate over to the data first, extract the

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:19.240
data into a smaller label, and then it is going to append

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:22.340
the data as you can see, right? So this is where extend

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:25.620
works and this is where extend comes into a picture. So

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:27.700
chunk by chunk, chunk by chunk, chunk by chunk, it is trying

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:31.860
to append the data. Yeah. Now, so someone is saying extend

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:34.880
is extending the feature of the next label child function.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:35.640
No.

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:43.540
Yup. Uh. So I add the multiply item. I think guys, you

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:47.460
should go and rewatch my entire Python series. Even now the

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:49.420
Python series, which I'm uploading, right? So I have already

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:53.560
discussed about these functions. So I'm not, we should go

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:56.020
ahead with the entire lecture. Maybe you should like write

00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:59.380
more, more code extend. If I'm going to call, if I'm going

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:02.320
to add some list item over here. So again, what it will do,

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:05.780
it will try to extract a data first, and then it is going to

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:08.380
append it as you can see one by one, one by one. So

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:11.180
basically it's called as unraveling. So it will try to

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:14.880
unravel. The data first, and then, uh, like, uh, it will try

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:17.920
to add it. This is where extend comes into a picture. Yeah.

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:21.500
So here, uh, what we are trying to do, so we are also like,

00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:25.520
uh, trying to call the extent. So message.extend. So

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:28.400
initially message will be this inside a list, as you can

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:31.500
see, right inside the list, we have a message, right? And

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:35.340
then if memory, right? So if memory as of now, memory is

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:38.040
equal to none, but yeah, so I'm going to pass that parameter

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.400
conversation, memory parameter. When I'm going to call all

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.660
of these functions. So at that point of a time, if memory,

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:46.840
so if it is yes, means if I'm passing a conversational

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:49.940
memory, uh, list, basically, this is the main part guys,

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:53.040
right? So if I'm going to pass a conversational memory list

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:58.520
over here, so what it will do. So whatever conversational

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:00.500
memory, whatever I'm going to store inside the

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:04.200
conversational memory, it will keep on extending inside this

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:07.440
same message. One by one, one by one, one by one, chunk by

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:10.100
chunk, chunk by chunk. It will keep on extending it. I'll

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:13.560
even show you. So how does it look like, but yeah, it's a

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:15.740
very basic list operation that we are trying to do nothing

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:19.600
much then the message.append. So here we are doing a extend

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:22.500
operation message.append, append as it is. So append what?

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:27.500
So append basically a context and the question, yeah. So we

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:30.800
are also attaching a black, uh, we are, we are trying to

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:33.560
attach what, so we are trying to attach basically inside a

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:36.540
message, but inside the message. So whenever we are trying

00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:40.480
to like, uh, send a next message, send the next messages. So

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:43.300
we are trying to attach a context context, which I have

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:47.000
received from vector DB. And then we are trying to even

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.760
attach a question. So question will go, context will go and

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:54.140
anyhow message.extend memory. So if there is a memory, even

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:57.080
memory will go. So in total, there are three things which

00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:01.500
I'm sending to my NLMs making sense to all of us. So there

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:04.520
are in total three things I'm trying to send as a payload.

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:10.300
One is a context. One is a question from the user. Embedding

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:12.520
of the question obviously. And then another part is

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:14.960
basically a memory. So these are the three things which I'm

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:18.560
trying to send if memory is available in that situation. Now

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:22.140
so this will finally go as a message and I can try to like,

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:25.400
uh, play with this temperature. I can try to play with the

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:28.300
output tokens. So this is again from coming from the URI.

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:31.740
This is going to give you a response. Now whatever response

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:34.680
it is trying to give you, uh, we are just trying to like,

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:39.340
uh, uh, return that as a reply. Right. And then inside a

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:43.300
memory, we are trying to append a question as well as we are

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:48.100
trying to append a reply. Now this is also a part of the

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:51.580
memory, which you should know. So here, whenever we are

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:56.080
trying to build a system, so inside a memory, I'm trying to

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:59.940
keep a questions plus I'm trying to keep a reply so that

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:03.860
from next time onwards, right? Next time onwards, my system

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:07.800
is not supposed to hustle much. If user is going to ask. A

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:11.100
similar kind of a question, plus it will be able to

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:13.400
understand the context that, okay, so what was the question?

00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:17.420
What was the reply which was generated? And when it is

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:21.380
trying to like, uh, generate the next one, it knows that

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:25.220
where I have given or what kind of a reply I have given last

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:29.280
time. Is it making sense? So why we are appending this reply

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:32.620
into the memory. So we are appending your questions. We are

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:37.220
appending your reply as well inside a memory. As simple as

00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:42.880
that. Making sense guys, then only system will be able to

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:45.540
understand, right? That what question was asked and what was

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:48.260
the answer which was given by the way. And then if you're

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:50.960
going to ask a follow up question, it will be able to take

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:53.740
some sort of inspiration from the previous one and which is

00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:57.780
part of the memory. So this is the function which is going

00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:03.600
to work for me and which is going to help me out in

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:08.020
terms of building the memory. So I have just pinged you the

00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:11.060
code for this one. Okay. Now this, these are the only main

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:14.880
part. Now the only calling part is pending. So we have all

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:18.020
these functions. Simply means that, that all of these blocks

00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:22.820
we already have inside our code base. Now it's time to call

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:27.760
a Stimulant UI. Let me ping you this code as well, right? So

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:32.400
here Stimulant UI. So UI is going to give you one option for

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:36.440
PDF upload, simple and one after PDF upload. So it is like

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:40.220
going to allow you to ask a question. Now. Once you are

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:45.120
going to upload a PDF in a very first place, right? So it is

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:50.100
going to basically write all of these files. It is going to

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:53.820
write, it is going to write all of this file now. So then

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:57.060
when you are going to ask a question, right, when you are

00:43:57.060 --> 00:44:00.580
going to ask a question, then it is going to call all of

00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:04.020
these things one by one, one by one, one by one. Now how it

00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:06.240
is going to call, what it is going to call. Let's try to

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:08.660
understand that. So first of all, it is going to store the

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:11.840
PDF. First part. So let's suppose it has stored a PDF as a

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:15.840
temp.pdf. Okay. Now, once this has been stored into a temp

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:20.020
.pdf, I'm calling what I'm calling my PDF reader. Basically

00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:23.100
this one I'm calling the very first function, which we have

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:26.020
written. We are calling that now, once that call will be

00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:29.500
done. So it is going to extract all the raw data. Then I'm

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:32.380
trying to pass into a, for a chucking so that it will be

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:35.120
able to create the chucking chucks basically. Now this

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:37.720
chucks I'm trying to pass where inside my vector database.

00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:40.260
Now. So I'm going to call my embedding. I'm going to call my

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:42.660
embedding. Then it will show you that. Okay. Your PDF upload

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:45.680
is successful. So till this point, PDF upload will be done,

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:48.640
means PDF uploading, chucking, and then converting it into

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:56.770
the embeddings, converting into the embeddings. Now if user

00:44:56.770 --> 00:44:59.650
is going to ask a question, now PDF upload is done. My PDF

00:44:59.650 --> 00:45:03.050
is ready now. So once your question will be asked, so what

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:06.190
it will try to do is, so it will try to, first of all, take

00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:08.490
a user question. So whatever question that you are going to

00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:13.210
put up. It is going to. Take a chunk. It is going to take a

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:17.090
index and it is going to take the embeddings one by one, one

00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:20.530
by one, one by one. So Chuck, then Chuck for the PDF,

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:23.610
basically indexes and then embeddings and then user

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:26.710
questions. So which will be coming from here? It is going

00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:30.090
to, and based on that, it is going to retrieve the entire

00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:33.070
context. So technically I'm trying to perform RIG operation

00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:37.270
label one over here. Once it is going to give me the

00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:40.450
context, then what I'm going to do. So I'm going to call my

00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:43.310
ask URI with the context. So there I'm trying to pass user

00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:46.230
question, context and the conversational memory. Initially

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:49.330
that conversational memory is going to be zero. Now let me,

00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:52.610
let me run this what, and then let me show you this entire

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:59.190
application. So here, S T R E A M L I T streamlint run PDF

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:07.910
RIG bot.py file S T R E A M S T R E A M L I T. Let run. And

00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:13.590
then PDF RIG bot. Yeah. So now my application is up and

00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:16.450
running as you can see, and it is giving me an option to

00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:22.310
upload the PDF. So I'll just try to upload some PDF where I

00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:23.850
have some sort of information.

00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:32.790
Okay. So I'll try to upload one of these PDF. I have other

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:37.730
PDFs as well. My SQL installation guide I have. Okay. Python

00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:40.150
assignment modules. Okay, fine.

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:46.500
So I'm going to upload one of the PDF from my system. Now

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:51.780
PDF load loaded and indexed fine. Now I'll go and I'll check

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:57.780
my console. So here, if I'll show you temp.pdf. So this is a

00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:01.880
PDF name that the system has given. And this is what I have,

00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:04.580
I had given basically, right. I had given temp.pdf. So in

00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:10.120
that way it is trying to store it. Right. And then once it

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:12.980
is done, it is able to create a chunk. It is able to even

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:16.480
store it into the vector DB, Facebook as semantic search.

00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:21.200
Now, if I'm going to ask a question that give me a summary

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:24.500
of this document, yeah.

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:34.620
So this is the summary that this document provides a step-by

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:36.900
-step guide for installation of my SQL on windows. It

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:39.200
includes instruction to download appropriate this, this,

00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:41.400
this, this, this, and this was available, right? This was

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:48.260
available. How many pages? How many pages were there? In

00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:50.260
this document?

00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:04.350
So I don't think that it is going to hold up a number of

00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:06.770
page because we are now nowhere storing this information

00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:10.530
because we are trying to extract the raw information and

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:13.310
then we are trying to convert that into a chunk. So I don't

00:48:13.310 --> 00:48:16.030
think that it should be able to answer. The provided

00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:18.190
document appeared to be brief installation guide for my SQL

00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:20.890
consisting of two main part with the number system, this,

00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:22.910
this, this, part one, part two. So it is able to understand

00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:25.890
that what is the part which was there inside the data, but

00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:29.250
yeah. So pages, obviously it will not be able to, uh, like,

00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:36.950
uh, understand. Okay. So now I have to show you one thing.

00:48:38.330 --> 00:48:42.170
Now see, I'm trying to print over here. If you have

00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:45.350
observed, I'm trying to print our conversational memory. So

00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:48.610
initially my conversational memory will be nothing. And then

00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:52.170
here, this is something that it is trying to hold inside the

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:55.330
conversational memory in a first goal. Then into a second

00:48:55.330 --> 00:48:58.530
goal. This is something that it is trying to store now here.

00:48:58.610 --> 00:49:00.850
So what it is trying to store? Just go through it. So role

00:49:00.850 --> 00:49:03.590
user content gave me a summary of this document. So this is

00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:06.310
the user question, role assistance content, this document to

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:08.450
provide a step-by-step guide. This, this, this, this, this

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:11.830
run the installer, select this, this, this, this is the data

00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:14.790
which is coming. This is the data which is coming from the,

00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:21.090
uh, system basically, right? So as per our code successfully

00:49:21.090 --> 00:49:25.570
question and a reply, I'm able to add question and the reply

00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:30.030
now next time, right? So how many pages were there into this

00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:33.990
document? So here role assistance content, and this is the

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:37.790
entire content. It is able to store entire content. It is

00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:41.470
able to store now. So you must be able to see that every

00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:46.810
time it is trying to store just one last conversation and

00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:50.550
it's one last question and it's reply any idea guys, why

00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:56.350
every time it is trying to store one last one. Last

00:49:56.350 --> 00:49:56.770
question.

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:07.890
Okay. So which one you are asking me to share? Let me share

00:50:07.890 --> 00:50:10.710
this a complete one is starting from the conversational

00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:10.950
memory.

00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:18.710
Yeah. So any, my question is guys that, uh, it is, it is

00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:21.190
just trying to store maybe like a one single question. The

00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:24.810
last one, right. As of now, now, if I'm going to like upload

00:50:24.810 --> 00:50:28.930
or maybe like next PDF, where is my UI interface? Yeah.

00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:41.750
Let me check if I have some very, very long PDF or not.

00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:57.840
Okay. Loaded. How many? How many questions are there in this

00:50:57.840 --> 00:50:59.320
document?

00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:08.400
Okay. So document is having contained total 28 number of

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:12.420
questions. Fine. So I believe, uh, my document, Python loop

00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:16.820
assignment, question number. So if I'm going to cross check

00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:17.440
and

00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:27.370
loop assignment, uh, there are 30 questions. So it has no,

00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:29.670
there are 50, I believe I have uploaded this one, right?

00:51:29.710 --> 00:51:37.580
Python loop assignment. Hmm. Now there was a 50 question. It

00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:41.320
is giving me just 28. Hmm.

00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:46.850
Contained total 28.

00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:55.120
Yeah. So again, uh, one issue, one big issue. So the

00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:59.760
response, which I'm able to get from this one is, uh, not

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:03.340
that, uh, accurate. So maybe because of the chunk, I

00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:07.320
believe. So if I'm going to change my chunk size, I think it

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:09.780
will start giving me a better response. Uh, I think it will

00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:11.120
start giving me a better response. Okay. Okay. So, uh, give

00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:12.720
me, give

00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:21.630
me, uh,

00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:32.380
pattern printing question from this assignment.

00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:44.130
Okay. So 33 number question is a pattern printing. Then, uh,

00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:48.130
46 number question. These are the two question where I had a

00:52:48.130 --> 00:52:50.210
pattern printing 36

00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:58.080
number question, but yeah, I have, uh, into 30 plus 31 plus

00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:03.260
32 plus 33. Okay. Plus 43 plus 46. So I have so many

00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:06.000
questions with respect to a pattern printing, but, uh, it

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.160
is, it is not able to understand the way I'm trying to

00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:12.620
explain. So again, system failed now.

00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:17.000
So 33 and 46 only 33,

00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:30.460
31, 32, 33, 33 and then 46. Okay. But yeah. So, uh, give me

00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:35.520
all, give me all the patterns. Uh, pattern printing question

00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:37.520
from the assignment for

00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:45.060
the six and 33.

00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:58.820
So even here we have something like pattern, even 33, but

00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:05.340
still it is not giving me. So again, a field gave me

00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:09.200
somebody anyhow, somebody though is like not a big deal, uh,

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:11.900
to take out from this inform, uh, take out the data from

00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:16.660
this one. Let me upload some, some

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:29.480
results. You may have something, I

00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:40.100
don't think that, okay. I have some resume. Okay.

00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:46.240
I don't know who's resume is this one, but yeah, I'm, I'm,

00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:50.100
it's available in my system. So I'm just like, um, going to

00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:57.360
ask a question. Give me all the company name where, where

00:54:59.410 --> 00:55:02.530
this guy have worked.

00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:14.300
Okay. So net west group. This is the only one company. It is

00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:23.060
trying to give. Uh, how many year of experience this person

00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:26.120
have three

00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:33.340
year of experience as a data list. Okay. Then, then it's

00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:37.040
justified. Maybe I'll have to look into the resume and cross

00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:46.130
check, uh, extract, uh, get URL from this resume. If there

00:55:46.130 --> 00:55:48.030
is a GitHub URL, doesn't

00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:53.710
have any GitHub URL. Okay.

00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:58.300
Extract a LinkedIn ID.

00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:09.360
The LinkedIn ID is not as pretty as the LinkedIn ID

00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:14.790
mentioned that in the content information. Okay. Fine. So

00:56:14.790 --> 00:56:18.930
yeah, it's working fine for me. And now if I'll go and check

00:56:18.930 --> 00:56:23.090
my memory, so which is the main part. So it is trying to

00:56:23.090 --> 00:56:26.950
retain only one single memory. So every time it is trying to

00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:30.550
like update the memory and it is trying to, uh, like, uh,

00:56:30.550 --> 00:56:34.150
keep only one single conversation. Maybe what we can do is.

00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:38.410
So we can try to. Add everything into the memory one by one,

00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:41.770
one by one. So maybe we can try to say that, try to retain

00:56:41.770 --> 00:56:45.490
only like a last 10 conversation. Maybe try to retain only

00:56:45.490 --> 00:56:49.650
last, like a five conversation, or maybe like, uh, try to

00:56:49.650 --> 00:56:53.550
retain only a hundred conversation. So this is how we try to

00:56:53.550 --> 00:56:57.690
handle a memory in general. And then, uh, we even try to say

00:56:57.690 --> 00:57:01.330
that, try to store some of the information on a client side

00:57:01.330 --> 00:57:04.290
and then try to store some of the information on a server

00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:07.890
side. Okay. Basically. So this is how we try to deal with

00:57:07.890 --> 00:57:11.110
the memory. As of now, as you can see that I have created a

00:57:11.110 --> 00:57:14.950
global variable. So this variable is out, uh, basically. So

00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:19.850
every time it will like, uh, try to build a new memory out

00:57:19.850 --> 00:57:22.250
of this one, and then I'm just trying to print it, but yeah,

00:57:22.350 --> 00:57:25.590
I can, I can even make sure that, that I'm going to add

00:57:25.590 --> 00:57:29.790
basically, uh, like, uh, 10 of memory or 20 of memory or any

00:57:29.790 --> 00:57:32.590
number of memories that I want, but that is going to be a

00:57:32.590 --> 00:57:35.550
costly operation because I'm trying to keep it inside. Uh,

00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:39.390
like, uh, this particular, uh, list, which is going to

00:57:39.390 --> 00:57:41.950
occupy some of the space inside my main memory.

00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:50.030
So here, let me take some question. I was saying, can you

00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:55.490
upload again and check or maybe context issue, limited

00:57:55.490 --> 00:57:59.210
chunk. Yeah, actually it's a context issue. So the last

00:57:59.210 --> 00:58:02.430
issue that we were facing, right. If I'm going to increase a

00:58:02.430 --> 00:58:05.670
chunk over here because it's just a 500, so maybe I can say

00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:09.070
5,000. First of all, right. And then if I'm going to

00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:13.390
increase even a overlap, so the same system will start

00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:17.270
performing better basically. So where I was asking about,

00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:21.350
uh, like a number of quotient, right. So maybe I, I let me,

00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:24.670
let me change this one and then let me go and ask how many,

00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:28.610
uh, so chunk size is 5,000 overlap is thousand not control

00:58:28.610 --> 00:58:28.930
S.

00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:36.960
So here, let me restart once all that should work without

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:42.100
restart. But yeah. Just to be the safer side. So this was

00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:45.000
basically a, for this, it was failing, right? So this was

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:48.420
basically a Python loop assignment. I'm going to upload

00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:51.120
again, Python loop assignment and,

00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:07.810
uh, how many questions are there

00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:12.040
in this document?

00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:21.420
50 questions. Yeah. So see last time it was failing and this

00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:24.600
time it is able to recognize that there is a 50 quotient.

00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:27.000
And yes, there is actually a 50 quotient inside this

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:31.120
particular document. So this is something that we all should

00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:34.260
know as a techie that, okay, so how, how I can try to make a

00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:37.120
system better by the way. So I know that, that if I'm going

00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:39.200
to increase a chunk size, if I'm going to increase the

00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:43.160
overlap by default, this problem will be fixed. So I'm able

00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:46.320
to fix it. Even I can try to fix a memory problem over here.

00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:48.460
So I can try to save some of the memory on a client side,

00:59:48.540 --> 00:59:51.060
some on the server side. This is what even we are doing

00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:55.260
inside the URI apart from that. So, uh, instead of saving

00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:58.720
only one last conversation question. And reply. So maybe I

00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:03.180
can try to, uh, like, uh, save a multiple one in a

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:05.840
different, different way, right? Maybe some sort of a key

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:08.480
information only I'm going to store, not all the information

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.760
I'm going to store because maybe all these informations are

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:14.540
not pretty much useful for me. So there are a lot of

01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:17.180
different, different way where we try to design this entire

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:20.140
system as per the requirement. So they were saying, please

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:25.300
define how chunk size effect the, uh, result in a brief. See

01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:27.620
chunk size. When you are saying. When you are saying a 5

01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:31.980
,000, right? So you are trying to create one big, uh,

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:37.480
basically, uh, list on, then all together, you are trying to

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:40.720
convert this one into a one single embedding. So obviously

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:44.020
if Mike, so in that case, your context length itself is

01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:46.420
very, very big, right? And so obviously it is going to

01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:50.380
effect. It will be able to give you a pretty much good

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:53.800
matching. If your chunk size itself is, if your data size

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:57.920
itself is like a sufficient enough. If it is very small,

01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:00.880
then obviously it is, it is not going to fetch because all

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:03.740
this information will not be available inside my embeddings.

01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:10.040
So this is one of the project guys, I think we all are able

01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:13.640
to do it. I hope you are liking this particular project. Now

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:19.840
let's go ahead and let's try to, uh, like a look into next

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:22.920
project. So next project is what? So next project is again

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:26.860
somewhat related to this one, but the next project is

01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:33.640
basically going to. Uh, help me out in terms of, uh, passing

01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:37.000
a multiple document. And then with respect to multiple

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.360
document, I will be able to perform a search operation. So

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:43.360
the next project is going to be extension of this same

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:47.640
project, but, uh, yeah, so I'm going to like, uh, build it

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:51.100
in such a way that it will be able to do a multiple document

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:54.780
search at a time, not just one, but a multiple document

01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:58.140
search at a time it will be able to perform. Almost. Uh,

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:01.220
same thing we are going to use, uh, not to like a very

01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:03.820
different, but yeah, it is going to be a little bit

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:07.860
different project that we are going to build. So here I'm

01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:12.700
going to create one more file in the same directory, multi

01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:19.660
underscore document underscore a C A R C A R C H search dot

01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:22.120
PI file. So this is going to help me out in terms of

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:25.360
multiple document upload as well as multiple document search

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:30.800
at a time. So here. Like I said, this one is just an

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:34.480
extension of the previous project, nothing much. And let me

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:36.720
copy my URLs

01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:43.780
and API key, same URL, same API key. I'm going to use a

01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:46.800
couple of more library now.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.940
So extract

01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:14.380
text from the PDF, same kind of function, extract data from

01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:16.920
the PDF. So whatever PDF file that you are going to upload,

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:20.080
uh, basically it is going to extract the data out of this

01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:23.680
one. Now. Uh, same function we are going to use a chunk

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:27.080
size. So same function, nothing different. Obviously we

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:29.420
should increase the chunk size over here. We should increase

01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:32.240
the overlap over here, but exact same function, the function

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:36.620
that I have used even before. Same thing, right? And then

01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:40.680
similar kind of a same function for my URI embeddings, get

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:46.260
URI embeddings, same kind of function, then same function

01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:49.820
for building my vector DV. So build a FASI indexes, vector

01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:52.200
DV. So exact same function I'm using. Uh, it is going to be

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:53.200
the same function. I'm going to return index and embeddings.

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:59.900
That's it. And then search chunk, same function, get

01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:18.620
answer from the context URI API key.

01:04:24.270 --> 01:04:27.170
So little bit of modification has been done in this one, but

01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:30.230
yeah, so just calling my LLMs now.

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:42.680
So from a UI side, the only changes that I have done in this

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:46.400
project is except a multiple file true. So the previous one,

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:49.720
so by default, except the multiple file was false. But here,

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:52.480
so I have just enabled except multiple file is equal to

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:55.800
true. So now you will be able to upload a multiple files,

01:04:55.980 --> 01:05:00.860
not just one single file. And then once you are going to

01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:05.280
upload a file, so we have to go through each and every file

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:09.120
one by one, one by one, one by one, one by one. We have to

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:13.380
extract a data out of those, all the files that you have

01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:17.680
uploaded so that I will be able to answer from all the

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:20.640
files. The objective of this project is so multi-document

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:23.900
you can upload, and then you can try to interact with a

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:27.160
multiple document content at a time. So that's a, that's a

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:30.720
whole idea. So the here, this

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:40.740
is going to this simple Python is going to take all the

01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:44.540
files one by one, loop it through all the files, open up,

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:48.980
extract a data, and then add it. And one single data, it is

01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:52.860
going to return out of the entire file as a. Part of this

01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:55.760
for loop, as you can see, right? So one single data, even

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:58.360
though if I'm going to pass 10 files, but system is trying

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:03.140
to consider only one data. So technically after this point,

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:07.160
this project became this project. There is no difference,

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:09.960
right? Right guys, everyone. That's the reason I told you

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:11.940
it's a similar kind of a things that we are going to build.

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:17.140
Can I say that after this step, right? Forget about all the

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:19.340
other functions because all the other functions are exactly

01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:21.920
same. There is no difference at all. But can I say that?

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:27.160
That after this step, this project and the previous project

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:30.060
is actually same because at the end of the day, I'm trying

01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:33.920
to get only one text and with the help of one, like a single

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:37.040
big one, I'm trying to split it. I'm trying to chunk it. I'm

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:40.780
trying to like a story into the vector DB and the whole

01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:42.700
procedure is going to be same. There is, there is no

01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:45.000
difference in the procedure that you will be able to find

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.260
out. So this is what it is going to like a do, and then it

01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:53.800
is going to like, uh, uh, give you the, uh, response. So

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:55.380
here I

01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:01.880
have to show you a couple of more things, which, uh, I will

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:07.040
show you if query make a proper indentation. Okay. So let

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:09.460
me, let me give you a demo of this one, first of all. So

01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:13.760
this file name is a multi-document S T R E M L I T. Then you

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:18.680
can execute it in your system. Streamlit run hyphen R and,

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:24.380
uh, multi-document. Streamlit run not hyphen R. So let me

01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:29.570
give you a demo of this one first of all. Yeah. Okay. So now

01:07:29.570 --> 01:07:33.950
here, uh, this AI powered multiple PDF search engine, we can

01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:37.730
try to upload as many document as I want.

01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:56.420
So here I'm uploading and, uh, yeah,

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:08.770
so many documents it is able to upload. Okay. There is some,

01:08:08.770 --> 01:08:13.450
uh, problem with this, showing one of three, two of three.

01:08:13.530 --> 01:08:16.050
Okay. So yeah, all the document, as you can see, it's been

01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:19.730
uploaded, right? So three. Then three and then two. So in

01:08:19.730 --> 01:08:23.490
total eight document has been uploaded. Now once it is going

01:08:23.490 --> 01:08:25.770
to upload, it simply means that, that everything is

01:08:25.770 --> 01:08:30.990
available into my vector DV. Now, uh, give me a summary of

01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:32.350
this or

01:08:35.010 --> 01:08:45.050
give me a loop based assignment question from document.

01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:57.260
What do you document will be duplicated by mistake? We are

01:08:57.260 --> 01:09:00.980
not taking care of that by the way. Okay. Not defined a plot

01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:02.760
vector, which

01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:18.320
line? So one 29 number line plot vector. Okay. One

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:23.930
29 plot

01:09:26.710 --> 01:09:28.450
vector, not

01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:33.140
defined.

01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:44.230
I'm doing some sort of a visualization in this one. So there

01:09:44.230 --> 01:09:48.350
is a function which I have missed. Uh, let me keep this

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:51.390
function here. All

01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:56.840
right. Once again.

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:30.840
Yeah. Give me, uh,

01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:55.940
so loop assignment in the documents are print all the

01:10:55.940 --> 01:10:57.860
element, this, this, this, this, this loop through the

01:10:57.860 --> 01:11:01.460
matrixes. So this is basically like a, something that it is

01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:03.940
able to retrieve, which looks good to me. And again,

01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:06.920
formatting wise, it's looked pretty much good now, top

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:11.100
relevant chunks. So it is trying to even, I'm trying to show

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:13.860
you. So basically in a code, I have written that, that, uh,

01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:19.540
so try to showcase even a top relevant chunks to me. So if

01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:21.940
I'm saying like a three. So this is chunk. This is chunk

01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:24.500
number one. This is chunk number two, top K basically,

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:28.540
right? So try to showcase even a chunk. Now those who are

01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:31.280
confused, right? So how chunk looks like and what is

01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:34.260
basically called as chunk. This is a chunk, which I was

01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:37.440
talking about, right? So we are printing even a chunk part

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:39.760
over here and as you can see, it's not a complete one,

01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:41.900
right? Because wherever there will be a chunk size, it will

01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:46.680
chop off and it will try to send to the next one now. So a

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:51.100
vector similarity visualization. So here, let me make it.

01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:58.080
Small, which I'm not able to do it. So here it is trying to

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:01.380
even a, so you, I'm just trying to like use a matplotlib,

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:04.460
which is one of the worst one to plot the graph, but yeah,

01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:07.320
I'm just trying to show you that the chucks that you have

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:10.440
and the query that you are trying to pass, what is our

01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:13.100
distance between these two? So on this particular scale,

01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:17.260
plus here, I'm trying to even show you a conversational

01:12:17.260 --> 01:12:20.320
memory. I can show you maybe by printing it, which I was

01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:22.740
doing it last time. Yeah. It's all itself. So I was printing

01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:26.760
it and I was trying to like show it to you, but here there's

01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:30.340
something which I'm holding into the memory and I'm even

01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:34.140
able to like a printed in this particular place. The simple

01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:38.580
part of this entire thing is that yes, I'm able to upload as

01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:42.560
many document as I want and I will be able to do a

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:46.140
conversation with this entire document that I have uploaded.

01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:50.140
So now let's do one thing.

01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:05.520
This is a code guys. So. So maybe you can try to execute it

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:08.580
once and then let me know. Right?

01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:21.340
Now Ranjith has asked me a question. What if documents are

01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:24.640
duplicated by mistake? If documents are duplicated, we are

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:26.500
not handling that by the way over here.

01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:33.090
Because at the end of the day, if you'll think logically, so

01:13:33.090 --> 01:13:35.150
we are trying to store something into the embeddings

01:13:35.150 --> 01:13:39.550
embeddings. And again, if documents are duplicate, it's

01:13:39.550 --> 01:13:42.650
embedding is going to be zero, but it's still, it's not

01:13:42.650 --> 01:13:47.810
advisable to discard those information. And if we have to

01:13:47.810 --> 01:13:50.250
prevent that, so basically I have to keep all the previous

01:13:50.250 --> 01:13:53.470
documents and then if someone is going to upload a new

01:13:53.470 --> 01:13:56.490
document, so I have to match the exact similarity between

01:13:56.490 --> 01:13:59.830
the previous one and the new one. So again, that is going to

01:13:59.830 --> 01:14:03.070
give me a lot of pain in terms of doing this kind of a two

01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:06.750
document matching and as document will grow, so it is going

01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:11.610
to be more painful. So it's document is a duplicate, leave

01:14:11.610 --> 01:14:14.470
it, let it be in that way. And let's try to create the

01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:17.450
embeddings and store it inside your system.

01:14:24.630 --> 01:14:28.330
So everything is same. Like I said, after this for loop that

01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:31.030
we are trying to run, right after this for loop. So this

01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:33.450
project and the previous project is exactly same. There is

01:14:33.450 --> 01:14:35.510
no difference. You will be able to find out because

01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:38.990
eventually we are trying to like take one single text

01:14:38.990 --> 01:14:39.310
information.

01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:55.800
Okay. So question for me, guys, anyone.

01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:21.460
So they're quite saying when usually we are working on this

01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:24.540
kind of a task in a Langchain framework. The chunk size does

01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:29.740
not affect much. Is chunk size affecting more for working

01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:31.700
only using the Python function without a Langchain

01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:35.480
framework? Yeah. See, so in case of Langchain, when we are

01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:37.900
talking about Langchain, right? So a lot of like things with

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:40.660
respect to a chunk size, it will be able to handle

01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:45.660
automatically. Right. So basically something that we are

01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:49.800
trying to handle over here in Python, by writing a code in

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:53.820
case of Langchain, it's a framework itself, which is trying

01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:57.480
to. Handle it. So basically try to apply some sort of a

01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:01.660
metadata filtering, which will be able to like give you data

01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:05.720
with respect to more relevant one. And then I believe there

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:07.860
is something called as document combiner, which is available

01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:12.180
by default inside the Langchain. So yeah, Langchain handles

01:16:12.180 --> 01:16:15.300
this thing, this framework. But if we are writing our own

01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:17.580
Python code, then we have to handle it.

01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:52.280
Plus even in a Langchain function, right? So you will be

01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:55.860
able to get a control the way we have a control. In terms of

01:16:55.860 --> 01:17:00.760
basically a chunk size and in terms of the overlap, these

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:04.160
two parameter. So just go and use any like a Langchain

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:07.020
functionalities for like a checking, you will be able to

01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:09.460
find out same thing. Like you will be able to find out this

01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:14.160
parameters and you can try to like upgrade it or downgrade

01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:16.700
it means you can try to increase the chunk size, overlap

01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:19.380
size, or maybe decrease the chunk size, overlap size, or

01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:23.520
depends upon your experimentation. So if your chunk size is

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:25.600
going to be very, very big. Obviously it is going to give

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:27.660
you the memory error. So when it will start giving you a

01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:30.900
memory error, stop it. So beyond that, you should not keep a

01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:34.380
chunk size at all. And this feature is already available

01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:38.400
even inside a Langchain. But yeah, in a inbuilt function,

01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:39.880
these parameters are available.

01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:59.900
Okay. Doctor is asking how can we optimize our token uses

01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:08.980
without affecting the output? So in this situation. Oh. Here

01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:09.960
you're talking about.

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:18.020
So see, try to send as less data as possible and try to

01:18:18.020 --> 01:18:20.940
retrieve as less data as possible. That's the only way by

01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:23.900
which you will be able to save some token. Because whenever

01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:26.180
you are sending a data, you are consuming a token. Whenever

01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:30.780
you are getting an output, you are like consuming tokens at

01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:38.220
the end of the day, right? So here, if I'll go to URI, a

01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:38.940
default code.

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:50.540
Here. If I will go to this one and a code example. So here,

01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:54.620
maximum token is thousand. For example, thousand we have

01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:58.420
given over here and everywhere you will be able to find out

01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:00.280
the maximum token thousand thousand, we have given over

01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:05.720
there. So just try to clip this one, don't go ahead with

01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:07.920
like a thousand for all the tasks. Maybe for some of the

01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:12.620
tasks go ahead with the 200. And again, so try to work on

01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:16.700
your input as well. so better input smaller input if you are

01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:20.060
going to give with the smaller number of tokens if you can

01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:23.840
explain each and everything in that way you will be able to

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:26.960
save the token otherwise there is no other way is

01:19:35.850 --> 01:19:40.230
there limit for a size of the file not at all so here this

01:19:40.230 --> 01:19:44.770
is the default one that i am using 200 mb basically so i can

01:19:44.770 --> 01:19:48.290
try to give or i can try to extend it as much as i want in

01:19:48.290 --> 01:19:54.450
terms of like a taking a file file one now someone has asked

01:19:54.450 --> 01:19:58.550
me a question that how to handle a tabular data into a pdf

01:19:58.550 --> 01:20:02.230
this pdf plumber will be able to handle that so for example

01:20:02.230 --> 01:20:09.290
if i have maybe a tabular data so here extract text from the

01:20:09.290 --> 01:20:13.030
pdf right so let's suppose if i have a tabular data so what

01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:17.450
i can do is i can try to call a function called as extract

01:20:17.450 --> 01:20:21.330
table for example so here extract text we are using right

01:20:21.330 --> 01:20:28.250
similarly so page dot extract trsct extract underscore table

01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:31.950
so this function is also available in the same pdf plumber

01:20:31.950 --> 01:20:35.470
now this will extract especially a tabular format of the

01:20:35.470 --> 01:20:40.230
data from your pdf so in this way you will be able to handle

01:20:40.230 --> 01:20:46.340
it from a pdf at least it's available inside this pdf

01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:47.680
plumber can

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:11.820
we use a mix of local and api model in a same code you can

01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:15.920
try to use see at two places we are using basically api so

01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:18.800
one for the embedding and one for the llm these are the only

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:22.660
two places if you would like to like remove the embedding at

01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:25.780
least and then use some sort of offline model for the

01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:28.320
embedding maybe there are a lot of models which is available

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:31.760
on a hugging phase which is an open source model so maybe

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:35.420
you go ahead and remove this particular url so don't use

01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:38.420
this embedding maybe you try to use just a llm out of this

01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:41.060
one so in that case it will be a combination of offline and

01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:45.560
online vice versa so even this llm this kind of llm models

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:48.940
are available so you have to just download it and then you

01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:52.900
have to send all the llm request instead of sending to this

01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:55.480
one you have to send so format is going to be same just you

01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:58.260
have to like read the models format is going to be same just

01:21:58.260 --> 01:22:00.280
you have to read the model and then instead of like calling

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:03.880
the apis means request dot post so you have to basically

01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:07.840
load the model and then send this same thing to your payload

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:09.180
to the local model so you have to basically load the model

01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:11.660
that's it you will be able to get a similar kind of a

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:11.940
response

01:22:25.370 --> 01:22:30.150
ok now moving to the next one guys so next project that we

01:22:30.150 --> 01:22:32.950
have which is a very very small one

01:22:51.810 --> 01:22:55.230
this done this one is done this one we have already done in

01:22:55.230 --> 01:22:58.810
my previous class so sentiment analysis dashboard build a

01:22:58.810 --> 01:23:01.510
real-time sentiment analysis tracker so this project is

01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:05.190
nothing by the way we are going to see a simple UI interface

01:23:05.190 --> 01:23:09.930
am I going to write something that will go to my llm

01:23:10.050 --> 01:23:13.470
basically and then it will be able to like tell me whether

01:23:13.470 --> 01:23:18.230
it's a positive or it's a negative that's it that's it about

01:23:18.230 --> 01:23:21.250
this project so this is one of the basic project right one

01:23:21.250 --> 01:23:23.650
of the basic one of the very very basic project and I

01:23:23.650 --> 01:23:27.330
believe the kind of a label that we have now in a class so

01:23:27.330 --> 01:23:31.590
obviously we all can do it in no time so let me create one

01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:38.190
simple oh so many pdf I have uploaded so so

01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:50.380
now here I'm going to create a file sentiment dot py file

01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:54.420
yeah sentiment dot py file and let's try to see that how we

01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:58.960
can try to build a sentiment application so

01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:11.940
like I said it's technically nothing means nothing so

01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:16.020
basically I'm going to this is the only thing which is which

01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:19.200
is going to work so basically I'm trying to like a send a

01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:21.040
prompt that you are a professional sentiment analysis system

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:24.460
analyze the following following text classify its sentiment

01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:29.040
as one of the following so positive negative neutral maybe

01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:32.240
if if I'm going to say that a political

01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:42.640
po political or maybe like a racist something like that

01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:47.400
let's not write that part yeah so positive negative neutral

01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:51.600
whatever in in whatever segment you will you would like to

01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:54.680
like a divided you can just try to divide it so this is the

01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:57.220
only prompt which is going to work so it is going to take a

01:24:57.220 --> 01:25:00.720
data and then it is going to hit my model as simple as that

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:03.800
so apart from that the system is not doing anything whatever

01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:07.440
response it will go it will give it to me it is it is going

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:10.300
to like you know give you that as a response that's it

01:25:10.300 --> 01:25:12.980
nothing nothing much by the way so let me run this one

01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:16.960
quickly and then let me show you so this this is one of the

01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:19.040
like a childish

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:28.720
project you can say s t r e a m l i t even the next one is

01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:33.280
same next one is also like a very simple one sentiment and

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:40.640
here I am going to enter a text so I am not feeling well

01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:42.760
today simple

01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:48.840
so I have this is going to be passed inside so this is

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:51.620
basically a negative and reason also it is trying to give

01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:55.840
you um donald trump

01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:12.560
have taken lots of decision with respect to tariff

01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:22.610
maybe political it is going to give complete uh neutral okay

01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:25.950
so maybe it is not able to understand our donald trump uh

01:26:25.950 --> 01:26:30.450
because it's not a real-time model so maybe I can go here

01:26:30.450 --> 01:26:34.750
and then I can try to change a model id there so code

01:26:34.750 --> 01:26:40.590
example and then available models and gemini flash so gemini

01:26:40.590 --> 01:26:43.590
flash is having a capability to do a real-time search right

01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:48.790
so instead of using this particular model uh maybe I can try

01:26:48.790 --> 01:26:52.950
to change my uh model id so

01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:01.580
my model should be gemini flash let's suppose yeah

01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:48.260
analysis complete unexpected token so

01:27:56.580 --> 01:27:59.840
it has crashed with my gemini

01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:04.380
flash model let

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:23.600
me fix it

01:28:52.410 --> 01:28:54.910
so my text set

01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:00.400
page configuration

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:08.980
input fine get

01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:21.700
sentiment is fine if response status code is 200 okay then

01:29:21.700 --> 01:29:29.060
try result response fine so it is going to give me so

01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:40.320
it's zero message content raw

01:29:49.250 --> 01:29:52.050
result so

01:29:54.450 --> 01:29:57.290
basically this is the error which I am receiving uh because

01:29:57.290 --> 01:29:57.430
if receiving a bit because if i select log in閉 in Facebook

01:29:57.450 --> 01:30:00.690
of I have changed the model and all the models gives a

01:30:00.690 --> 01:30:07.770
different kind of a like a responses import re yeah

01:30:20.190 --> 01:30:23.830
so json let's parse it parse

01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:41.370
result and

01:30:49.050 --> 01:30:55.850
return here in case of error just give me raw result

01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:59.770
whatever result whatever is the raw result just give me that

01:30:59.770 --> 01:31:00.790
get

01:31:11.740 --> 01:31:14.620
sentiment analysis okay text

01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:22.540
input sentiment output okay I think it should work this time

01:31:22.540 --> 01:31:28.890
because there was a minor fix which I have done sentiment

01:31:28.890 --> 01:31:29.630
dot pi

01:31:55.970 --> 01:32:03.110
json parser unexpected token error again

01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:27.900
parser error raw

01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:50.500
result clean

01:32:53.890 --> 01:32:54.650
result

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:08.200
json loads

01:33:15.050 --> 01:33:16.530
cleaned

01:33:32.010 --> 01:33:35.410
import json this this this into

01:33:59.090 --> 01:34:02.510
some text so this looks good

01:34:24.970 --> 01:34:29.230
okay response looks good now I can ask questions so there

01:34:29.230 --> 01:34:31.970
was just a issue with the model response I have just

01:34:31.970 --> 01:34:34.350
switched the model right I was using gpt and then I have

01:34:34.350 --> 01:34:38.110
started using a gemini flash so that was the issue and

01:34:38.110 --> 01:34:42.990
because of that it was giving me an error trump have taken a

01:34:42.990 --> 01:34:44.090
yeah

01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:06.260
like it is trying to say neutral but this time if you see

01:35:06.260 --> 01:35:11.740
the response basically it is able to understand something

01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:13.720
from an internet as well because this model is having

01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:18.020
capability to understand something which is available on a

01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:21.120
like an internet gemini flash so that is the reason I was

01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:24.360
using this one because it will not be waiting for just for

01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:28.240
the like a trained data so this is one of the example guys a

01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:32.160
simple sentiment analysis nothing much I am just trying to

01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:35.780
take a data and passing it into the models and based on that

01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:40.380
it is like able to give me a sentiment of that previously if

01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:43.400
you will see and you must have done that maybe at some point

01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:47.520
of a time so previously we were like building a sentiment

01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:49.800
analysis system right guys how many of you have actually

01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:51.100
build it yeah

01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:56.510
I believe almost all of us as a part of machine learning

01:35:56.510 --> 01:36:00.010
project or as a part of like a beginning we all have built

01:36:00.010 --> 01:36:03.450
the sentiment analysis right but now it's not required now

01:36:03.450 --> 01:36:06.470
we have like a lms which will be able to understand the

01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:09.810
sentiment. And again. Okay. with any kind of a data, it will

01:36:09.810 --> 01:36:12.750
be able to understand the sentiment because my models are

01:36:12.750 --> 01:36:15.810
aware about all kind of a data set, right? And not just

01:36:15.810 --> 01:36:18.210
positive, negative or neutral, but yeah, so maybe other

01:36:18.210 --> 01:36:21.770
labels, other sentiment also we can do. Sandhu is saying I

01:36:21.770 --> 01:36:25.390
did. Almost all of us, right guys? Almost all of us have

01:36:25.390 --> 01:36:28.890
trained the model, sentiment analysis model for positive and

01:36:28.890 --> 01:36:33.850
negative. Maybe not in a company, but yeah, as a part of

01:36:33.850 --> 01:36:37.350
like a learning project, we all have done that, but it's not

01:36:37.350 --> 01:36:41.750
required now. We have LLMs, right? We have LLMs and the best

01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:45.350
one we have, which will be able to like tell you negative,

01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:48.050
positive because it understand the context and understand

01:36:48.050 --> 01:36:51.050
data in a better way. And you don't have to even like, you

01:36:51.050 --> 01:36:55.450
know, tag it with some industry. We generally try to like do

01:36:55.450 --> 01:36:58.270
a movie reviews, negative, positive or something like that.

01:36:58.510 --> 01:37:01.390
But yeah, it's not required. So that was the whole objective

01:37:01.390 --> 01:37:04.750
behind showing you this project. Objective was not to teach

01:37:04.750 --> 01:37:09.410
you how to use LLMs because that we already know. We are

01:37:09.410 --> 01:37:12.450
using it since a very, very long time now. I think since

01:37:12.450 --> 01:37:15.470
last three, four months in this class itself. So I think

01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:19.430
objective is fulfilled. Now I can close this part. Now let's

01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:23.370
go to the fourth project. Again, very simple one. I'm not

01:37:23.370 --> 01:37:25.650
going to create. I have not created the UI for this one. If

01:37:25.650 --> 01:37:32.730
you want, you can create it. So unstructured data underscore

01:37:32.730 --> 01:37:40.410
parsing dot IPYNB. Not IPYNB. Let's create a Python file,

01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:51.220
rename and then by file. Yeah. So this is again, one of the

01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:54.640
simplest one that you are going to find out.

01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:24.400
Yeah. So this project says that, that whatever information

01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:26.760
that you are going to pass, basically, this is the

01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:31.060
unstructured data night. As of now, I'm just like, I have

01:38:31.060 --> 01:38:33.380
given the data. Maybe you can try to take a user input.

01:38:33.740 --> 01:38:36.860
Maybe you can try to read. A document or maybe Excel sheet,

01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:41.160
and then you can give a input, uh, inside, uh, like this

01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:44.520
one. So as, as you wish, you can try to do it because we

01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:47.500
know that how to parse the files and everything. So this

01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:52.320
will be the data, which will go as an input, simple. And I

01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:55.360
have written a prompt over here, just a prompt, right? And

01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:58.580
it's all, all it's game of the prompt, basically. So you are

01:38:58.580 --> 01:39:00.900
an intelligent information extractor, extract the key

01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:03.040
entities from the following text and return the structure

01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:05.800
JSON format. This is what I'm asking. So I'm saying that,

01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:08.840
that whatever information, which I'm giving you, so try to

01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:11.780
extract a full name out of it, email ID out of it, a phone

01:39:11.780 --> 01:39:14.240
number out of it, a date out of it, address out of it,

01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:16.440
company out of it, designation out of it, a skill education

01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:20.360
experience, and all the other useful meta information. Now,

01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:23.500
why I'm showing you this a small demo, why we have included

01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:26.360
this as a part of you in a project. The reason is that

01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:30.320
generally we try to use a regex, right? RE package, regex

01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:33.140
package. We try to use, and with the help of regex package.

01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:36.280
So we try to like, uh, parse the information. So we try to

01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:39.940
write a regex. We try to handle all the edge cases for name.

01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:42.260
It's practically impossible, but yeah, for email ID, for

01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:44.440
phone number, then again, country wise, phone number

01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:47.460
parsing, then date parsing and date parsing that too in a

01:39:47.460 --> 01:39:51.800
MMDD, YYYY, MMDD, right? Address parsing, company name

01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:54.500
parsing. So a lot of like, uh, NER tagging, we try to like,

01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:57.360
uh, do over here, uh, designation, again, a lot of NER

01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:00.620
tagging that we try to do over here, a skill. So we try to

01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:03.920
create our own list and then match with the regex. So, so

01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:08.540
far. Perform all of these operation to extract this kind of

01:40:08.540 --> 01:40:13.200
information from, uh, data. We use write a lot of code and

01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:16.100
then again, so it's not like that code is going to be full

01:40:16.100 --> 01:40:22.580
proof in a very fast day. So that, that code, uh, will be

01:40:22.580 --> 01:40:24.960
having a lot of edge cases, right? A lot of edge cases, even

01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:26.860
with respect to email ID, right? If I'm going to write

01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:29.420
something for Gmail, it is going to fail for a Yahoo. It is

01:40:29.420 --> 01:40:32.220
going to fail for Rediff. Uh, we all have experienced those

01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:35.480
things, uh, in our past, uh, at least like people who is

01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:38.380
working, uh, in our industry since last couple of year,

01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:41.440
right? Uh, because as a part of our day to day job, when we

01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:43.600
build a system, so these are the normal thing that we try to

01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:46.580
do, right? Uh, functions we try to write or classes that we

01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:50.240
try to build. Now, the, uh, why I'm showing you over here

01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:54.880
that, that how easy it is now to do it with the help of

01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:58.640
LLMs, LLMs can do everything, right? Everything. You don't

01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:00.420
have to write a regex. You don't have to write a separate,

01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:03.160
separate functions for this one. You don't have to even go

01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:05.640
and handle, uh, edge cases. Uh, edge cases. Uh, for this

01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:09.340
one, right? Uh, even LLM will be able to distinguish between

01:41:09.340 --> 01:41:14.280
a person name and, uh, like, uh, uh, entity name. It will be

01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:18.360
able to understand. So LLM is way more powerful as compared

01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:20.620
to the things that we have been building and we have been

01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:23.080
doing. And this is what I'm going to demonstrate a very

01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:27.020
simple example. So what ever line that we have written over

01:41:27.020 --> 01:41:29.940
here, I'm just passing this line to the LLMs. Technically

01:41:29.940 --> 01:41:33.460
URI AI, it is going to extract all the information as per

01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:37.460
the, uh, like things that is given. So it's copy paste of

01:41:37.460 --> 01:41:39.940
the URI code itself. That's it. Nothing, nothing different.

01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:42.740
It's, it's basically a URI code, right? The URI code that

01:41:42.740 --> 01:41:45.320
you will be able to find out is the same thing, uh, that you

01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:48.060
will be able to find out. I have just like a tweaked a

01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:51.360
prompt a little bit. That's it. And so that it will be able

01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:54.380
to extract a data from the unstructured, uh, data as well.

01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:58.020
So here I can run this one, Python and then, uh,

01:41:58.220 --> 01:42:00.380
unstructured data

01:42:04.130 --> 01:42:08.230
parsing and, uh, yeah, so you must be able to see that. Full

01:42:08.230 --> 01:42:11.350
name, Rahul Sarma, email ID, able to extract phone number.

01:42:11.410 --> 01:42:14.190
It is able to extract date. It is able to extract, although

01:42:14.190 --> 01:42:17.270
I think date was not there, so it was able to extract at

01:42:17.270 --> 01:42:20.110
least a year automatically. Right? Yeah. See, date was not

01:42:20.110 --> 01:42:22.190
there. Right? So it is able to understand that. Okay, fine.

01:42:22.230 --> 01:42:25.390
So as a date, MM and DD is not there. Let's try to extract Y

01:42:25.390 --> 01:42:29.630
basically. So date, okay. Address, null, address, null,

01:42:29.710 --> 01:42:32.750
address it is not able to understand. That's fine. Uh, maybe

01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:35.750
I can try to write a prompt in a better way. IIT Delhi.

01:42:35.950 --> 01:42:39.010
Okay. So I can, I can say that. So if you're able to see

01:42:39.010 --> 01:42:42.190
some entity fetch their address, I can even do that. So my,

01:42:42.310 --> 01:42:46.310
uh, Gemini flask model can go and it can, it can try to

01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:49.070
fetch IIT Delhi address right over from the internet.

01:42:50.890 --> 01:42:53.370
Company enforces. Okay. It is able to understand company,

01:42:53.470 --> 01:42:56.490
digital software engineer, a skill, Python flask, NLP,

01:42:56.630 --> 01:43:00.210
right? Education, all those things, skill education. Okay.

01:43:00.570 --> 01:43:04.770
So some of this data is redundant data. Maybe I can like,

01:43:04.810 --> 01:43:10.260
uh, do a prompting in a little bit better way. Yeah. Okay.

01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:13.060
Okay. Beta computer science, this, this, this. So this is

01:43:13.060 --> 01:43:16.620
how amazing the LMS are basically. Right. Uh, and obviously

01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:20.520
we all understand now the capability of the LMS that how LMS

01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:24.020
actually works and then like, uh, uh, what, what LMS can do

01:43:24.020 --> 01:43:27.700
and what LMS can't do. So this is again, another project

01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:32.980
guys. Now let me wrap up the entire project and, uh, give it

01:43:32.980 --> 01:43:34.320
to you as

01:43:36.980 --> 01:43:39.820
a file. And now I'm open for any kind of a question.

01:44:06.260 --> 01:44:09.600
Okay. So yeah, I have just uploaded the file guys. Now tell

01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:11.080
me if you have any kind of a question.

01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:49.380
So no question for me or

01:44:52.230 --> 01:44:54.290
somebody for explanation. So with this saying, sir, I'm new

01:44:54.290 --> 01:44:56.530
to this batch, I was a part of, you know, skills, FSDs.

01:44:56.570 --> 01:45:01.590
Okay. You are from there. Okay. So I have gone through the,

01:45:01.610 --> 01:45:03.990
your own entry bootcamp, MLM scores, please, or how to move

01:45:03.990 --> 01:45:07.790
forward. A simple summit. So simple advice to all of you

01:45:07.790 --> 01:45:11.290
will be including like a summit. Uh, you will be that try to

01:45:11.290 --> 01:45:14.830
create an application, try to build a project. We all used

01:45:14.830 --> 01:45:17.750
to learn a lot. Again, learning is not going to give you an

01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:21.690
outcome, uh, build it, uh, mentioned inside the resume. We

01:45:21.690 --> 01:45:25.150
have a resume AI go over there, try to find tune your resume

01:45:25.150 --> 01:45:30.070
or even from a scratch, start creating a resume at list, go

01:45:30.070 --> 01:45:34.850
and give two to three interview. At least go and apply for a

01:45:34.850 --> 01:45:39.050
couple of jobs, right? Because a first two to two or two to

01:45:39.050 --> 01:45:42.890
three interviews, uh, will be just like a mock-up for all of

01:45:42.890 --> 01:45:45.870
you. you will be able to like get some sort of a grip over

01:45:45.870 --> 01:45:49.190
there so and then when you will go for the next to next

01:45:49.190 --> 01:45:51.530
interview so obviously you are going to perform better so

01:45:51.530 --> 01:45:55.450
here just go create a resume from a scratch if you have

01:45:55.450 --> 01:45:59.370
resume then you can try to just upload the resume and then

01:45:59.370 --> 01:46:02.650
try to tune the resume part number one it is even going to

01:46:02.650 --> 01:46:04.810
give you some sort of a question then come to the job part

01:46:04.810 --> 01:46:08.530
and then start searching so every day we are trying to bring

01:46:08.530 --> 01:46:11.110
a tons of job by default this is going to show you a

01:46:11.110 --> 01:46:15.050
recommended job now this recommendation comes based on your

01:46:15.050 --> 01:46:17.690
resume if something you have if you have not mentioned

01:46:17.690 --> 01:46:21.430
inside your resume this recommendation is not going to come

01:46:21.430 --> 01:46:25.350
simple right this recommendation is not going to come now so

01:46:25.350 --> 01:46:28.830
you can try to search over here so this search is given to

01:46:28.830 --> 01:46:31.910
you and just go over here and maybe you start searching

01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:37.150
machine learning i can just search yeah spelling mistake but

01:46:37.150 --> 01:46:40.290
still it's fine yeah so experience level wise contact type

01:46:40.290 --> 01:46:43.950
wise location wise and at least apply for a couple of jobs

01:46:43.950 --> 01:46:47.930
so there are enough number of jobs which even we are trying

01:46:47.930 --> 01:46:53.250
to bring on a daily basis if i'll show you so the number is

01:46:53.250 --> 01:46:58.430
a variable it's not same every day so if i'll show you how

01:46:58.430 --> 01:47:01.870
many job we have today so

01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:14.140
today we have 44,524 jobs in our system active location is

01:47:14.140 --> 01:47:19.980
2407 so we have like our own like a dashboard so where we

01:47:19.980 --> 01:47:24.160
can see each and everything so this is our own internal live

01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:27.780
dashboard as you can see right someday it will be 50,000

01:47:27.780 --> 01:47:30.920
someday it will be 55,000 or 60,000 but yeah it will be

01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:34.920
approximately plus or minus 50,000 so this is something and

01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:37.260
this is a real-time data guys i'm showing you right i'm

01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:43.700
showing you from like our dashboard basically so like jobs

01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:45.680
are available every day we have jobs available every day we

01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:47.080
have jobs available every day we are trying to bring a fresh

01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:50.960
jobs even people are coming and saying that try to bring a

01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:53.940
job for this location try to add this location so every day

01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:57.920
we are trying to add those locations as well so just go

01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:02.580
apply first of all first few interview you have to just give

01:48:02.580 --> 01:48:05.660
it for a practice right you will be able to understand the

01:48:05.660 --> 01:48:09.960
interviewer you will be able to understand that what is the

01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:14.360
expectation industry have from you and then obviously a next

01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:17.040
couple of interview you will be able to crack for sure but

01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:20.180
yeah if you will just sit and then think that i will do a

01:48:20.180 --> 01:48:23.640
preparation that preparation is never going to be over

01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:27.700
believe me preparation never ends and

01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:34.620
again the kind of a learning that we are into so there is no

01:48:34.620 --> 01:48:36.840
end to this learning you will keep on learning even after

01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:40.640
like a joining some sort of a companies they will probably

01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:43.520
give you guidance that after building a package how we can

01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:48.200
update the version day by day and add their our and add

01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:51.160
their or get a repository can you make our own page cycle

01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:54.700
and standard please make a new video for that one okay so if

01:48:54.700 --> 01:48:58.480
you have to update a pipe a package in my english video i

01:48:58.480 --> 01:49:00.680
believe i have already shown you in my hindi video i haven't

01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:03.260
shown like how to update because when i was recording my

01:49:03.260 --> 01:49:05.800
english video so even i have faced some issue i have i did

01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:08.200
some mistakes so because of that i was facing some issue and

01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:11.260
my package was not working so in that video if you'll go and

01:49:11.260 --> 01:49:14.120
check so i have even shown you that how to update a next

01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:16.880
version and next version next version even if that is your

01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:18.220
question yeah

01:49:24.690 --> 01:49:28.670
and the second part of your question is add their our github

01:49:28.670 --> 01:49:32.070
repos day by day and add their over github repository yeah

01:49:32.070 --> 01:49:34.750
so you can try to update your redmi file you can try to like

01:49:34.750 --> 01:49:37.550
a add the code inside our github repository so that people

01:49:37.550 --> 01:49:40.810
can directly even install from your github and you'll make

01:49:40.810 --> 01:49:46.990
oh maybe our pages as a and can can make the our pages as a

01:49:46.990 --> 01:49:51.630
our pages as a cicatype learn standard please make a new

01:49:51.630 --> 01:49:54.670
video for that one so you you are saying that the way how do

01:49:54.670 --> 01:49:56.110
you understand their page style way scikit-learn is having a

01:49:56.110 --> 01:49:58.330
documentation so basically you would like to do a

01:49:58.330 --> 01:50:01.630
documentation in that way this is what your question is yeah

01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:09.580
so I saying that like this kind of a documentation you would

01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:11.320
like to create yeah

01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:15.840
this this kind of a documentation you're talking about if

01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:19.660
you can reiterate your question Sumit is saying as I am a

01:50:19.660 --> 01:50:23.160
telecom domain should I do only apply telecom domain no not

01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:26.460
at all telecom should I do only telecom domain as your own

01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:30.780
as in the your own there is no telecom domain see these

01:50:30.780 --> 01:50:33.840
project that we are talking about right even now the project

01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:36.160
that we are talking about inside the class now these are the

01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:39.120
generic project this is independent like for example

01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:43.420
yesterday we have done SQL right SQL system project where

01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:46.620
with the help of LLM query you will be able to extract a SQL

01:50:47.220 --> 01:50:49.700
information when system will be able to write a complex SQL

01:50:49.700 --> 01:50:53.240
queries now that project was basically a domain independent

01:50:53.240 --> 01:50:56.040
project yeah. So you can even. You can even mention inside

01:50:56.040 --> 01:50:57.980
the resume and then when you are going for the interview you

01:50:57.980 --> 01:50:59.980
can say that that okay so I was working telecom domain

01:50:59.980 --> 01:51:02.320
project there are thousands of table there was like a

01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:05.500
multiple clients and what we have done so we have done this

01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:09.900
kind of automation right so where stakeholder based on their

01:51:09.900 --> 01:51:13.160
role and based on their access basically based on the

01:51:13.160 --> 01:51:15.960
department and based on the division in which they are

01:51:15.960 --> 01:51:19.740
working so we have automated the entire dashboard in such a

01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:22.540
way that just with the help of speech or just with the help

01:51:22.540 --> 01:51:26.100
of some textual like you know inputs. My manager and

01:51:26.100 --> 01:51:28.880
everyone will be able was able to get the report in a real

01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:32.600
time right talk about hundreds of thousands of reports over

01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:36.680
there so all this project that I am talking about and

01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:39.020
majority of the project that I used to discuss right inside

01:51:39.020 --> 01:51:42.260
a your own so I always make sure that these projects are

01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:45.680
basically a generic project it should not be a specific to a

01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:48.180
domain so that doesn't matter whether you are working into a

01:51:48.180 --> 01:51:50.720
health care domain telecom domain supply chain or maybe into

01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:55.380
a finance domain or maybe insurance domain you will be able

01:51:55.380 --> 01:51:58.320
to use all of this project but yes that the kind of a

01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:03.040
storytelling right so that you have to sit think peacefully

01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:08.420
point by point write it down then give it to Yuri Yuri will

01:52:08.420 --> 01:52:11.440
try to give you the beautiful story out of it yeah

01:52:13.650 --> 01:52:18.050
I let me let me help you out with even with that so that the

01:52:18.050 --> 01:52:22.130
story building part you have to do at the end of the day so

01:52:22.130 --> 01:52:24.130
let me close all of it.

01:52:28.450 --> 01:52:39.930
So I have. Okay. Walked into a sequel query automation for

01:52:39.930 --> 01:52:41.570
my one

01:52:45.220 --> 01:52:55.620
of the big client where client based on the department and

01:52:55.620 --> 01:53:06.780
access can access the data and. Dashboard in real time I

01:53:06.780 --> 01:53:10.480
have walked into

01:53:12.170 --> 01:53:20.950
this project end-to-end by using lots of tech stack I don't

01:53:20.950 --> 01:53:25.770
know what but yeah lots of tech stack I'm writing now today

01:53:25.770 --> 01:53:34.850
I am going for an interview and I have to. Convince my

01:53:34.850 --> 01:53:44.930
interviewer that I have worked in this project give me its

01:53:44.930 --> 01:53:46.430
HLD

01:53:50.050 --> 01:53:53.690
LLD tech

01:53:55.640 --> 01:54:00.500
architecture and complete

01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:09.380
a story that I can go and tell to my. Interview well okay

01:54:09.380 --> 01:54:18.000
so. See. Now go and explain this project. This is the

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:23.100
architecture right this is the flow so to see in the in the

01:54:23.100 --> 01:54:26.620
age of the many people you might have like a scene or

01:54:26.620 --> 01:54:29.640
basically like you might have like gone through a course

01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:33.880
right so a person who is not using a so basically you will

01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:37.040
be replaced by a person who is using AI. So. and that's

01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:40.880
pretty much true right so we have a ai access we can try to

01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:45.640
get all the information we can try to modify it do it then i

01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:49.660
have just written a full line of things and it is able to

01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:52.200
give me this much now if i'm going to give more information

01:54:52.200 --> 01:54:56.680
more information so joke just go and talk to ai right just

01:54:56.680 --> 01:54:59.900
go and talk to ai give your context say that okay fine i've

01:54:59.900 --> 01:55:03.500
done this i have done that right now tell me uh in today's

01:55:03.500 --> 01:55:07.380
environment how i can explain so go and talk to ai ai will

01:55:07.380 --> 01:55:10.580
give you a response that's the reason so as a part of this

01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:14.100
entire ecosystem see when i was building yuri right i was

01:55:14.100 --> 01:55:17.600
already aware about the fact that uh there is a chat gpt

01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:20.060
there is a gemini uh even in your whatsapp there is

01:55:20.060 --> 01:55:22.160
something which is available but i was trying to build a

01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:27.240
ecosystem for an education right now in 2025 no one can

01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:30.740
imagine an education without ai that's the reason so we have

01:55:30.740 --> 01:55:34.200
given you yuri i'm into a tech upskilling so obviously

01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:37.300
everyone needs api because you have to develop something now

01:55:37.300 --> 01:55:40.120
again and again i can't ask my student that okay go and use

01:55:40.120 --> 01:55:43.040
a open ai api a group api then student will tell me that

01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:46.020
they are charging this they are charging this no we have

01:55:46.020 --> 01:55:50.260
built it so when we have built this ecosystem for you try to

01:55:50.260 --> 01:55:54.200
utilize this ecosystem believe me this ecosystem is more

01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:58.260
than enough to prepare you for any kind of a job part number

01:55:58.260 --> 01:56:02.300
one part number two is a resume part number three is a jobs

01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:07.320
yeah every day for you can do much for this industry has

01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:11.320
some industry is always a 얼� weekend my episode of solutions

01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:14.500
we have been talking now done so nice one update of featured

01:56:14.500 --> 01:56:16.680
in a newgle in delightful so you will be able to find out

01:56:16.680 --> 01:56:18.800
final recipe will be able to find or interior label you will

01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:20.700
be able able to find out remote you will be able to find out

01:56:20.700 --> 01:56:23.700
full-time part-time every kind of things right so at least

01:56:23.700 --> 01:56:28.300
now you have to take a step you can't just sit ideal and say

01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:34.130
that i'm not able to get an opportunity yeah you can't go

01:56:34.130 --> 01:56:37.170
and say because see if you assume it if you or anyone right

01:56:37.170 --> 01:56:40.170
uh it's not just applicable to one person it's applicable on

01:56:40.170 --> 01:56:43.210
everyone and as a teacher i believe it's my responsibility

01:56:43.210 --> 01:56:47.230
to tell you these things uh that if you will keep on asking

01:56:47.230 --> 01:56:49.910
question and if you'll keep on waiting for someone to give

01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:53.410
you a response that person is going to give you a response

01:56:53.410 --> 01:56:56.770
based on their knowledge right for example if you're asking

01:56:56.770 --> 01:56:59.090
me a question obviously i'm a human being right i have a

01:56:59.090 --> 01:57:02.530
limitation i don't have a kind of a knowledge that ai have

01:57:02.530 --> 01:57:07.010
in in all the domain right in all the domain uh so uh

01:57:07.010 --> 01:57:12.520
basically so instead of asking a question to me maybe you

01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:16.060
can ask to ai right day and night chat with ai nowadays this

01:57:16.060 --> 01:57:17.980
is what i do basically whenever i have to learn something

01:57:17.980 --> 01:57:18.980
right i keep on chatting you can ask to ai right day and

01:57:18.980 --> 01:57:18.980
night chat with ai nowadays this is what i do basically

01:57:18.980 --> 01:57:21.420
whenever i with ai i can say okay do this do that explain me

01:57:21.420 --> 01:57:25.160
this explain me that and that too the best part is as a

01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:28.860
human maybe when i feel tired so maybe i'll not try to

01:57:28.860 --> 01:57:32.100
explain you by giving that much amount of time but ai will

01:57:32.100 --> 01:57:36.300
never get tired right it will explain you in a like a best

01:57:36.300 --> 01:57:39.620
possible way in a deepest possible way so try to understand

01:57:39.620 --> 01:57:45.140
that you are not in 2023 you are in 2025 things has really

01:57:45.140 --> 01:57:49.960
changed you are a part of ai batch so obviously you should

eat ai you should sleep ai you should do everything with ai

01:57:53.700 --> 01:57:59.240
right and if you're not doing it basically you are making a

01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:03.060
big big mistake and that will cost you and those who are not

01:58:03.060 --> 01:58:04.900
using it out there whether it's a student whether it's a

01:58:04.900 --> 01:58:07.880
professional believe me i have seen that in last like a

01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:11.520
couple of months i have seen that that it is it has costed a

01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:17.460
lot to a person to a people yeah hope hope you are you are

01:58:17.460 --> 01:58:20.040
able to understand this part at the end of the list uh from

01:58:20.040 --> 01:58:25.240
this particular class uh so go ahead make use of it right

01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:30.400
motivate others to use it don't wait for any person not even

01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:33.400
for me right not even for your batchmate don't have to wait

01:58:33.400 --> 01:58:35.460
for anyone to get an answer you don't have to wait for

01:58:35.460 --> 01:58:39.160
anyone to build anything now right yes there was a

01:58:39.160 --> 01:58:42.560
dependency two year back right where we were looking for a

01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:45.000
mentor we were looking for a guide we were looking for

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:50.520
someone to give me a support to do a hand holding in 2025 ai

01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:53.280
is holding your hand and if you are not using it and still

01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:55.880
if you are looking for a human being right and yeah there

01:58:55.880 --> 01:58:57.880
are organization out there right who are who are just going

01:58:57.880 --> 01:59:00.860
to charge you for that maybe a lakhs of rupees but

01:59:00.860 --> 01:59:04.060
eventually believe me you will not be able to get a kind of

01:59:04.060 --> 01:59:09.780
a like a the response from any human being including me the

01:59:09.780 --> 01:59:13.240
kind of a response that you can get from ai hope you all

01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:18.560
understand that part so adopt ai again in india so i have

01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:22.420
seen one thing that most of us are talking about ai but when

01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:27.260
i go talk to a people personally right literally like

01:59:27.260 --> 01:59:30.100
everyone is aware about chat gpt everyone is aware about

01:59:30.100 --> 01:59:33.060
deep seek when china has launched deep seek uh everyone

01:59:33.060 --> 01:59:36.580
started talking about it but when i started talking to a

01:59:36.580 --> 01:59:38.800
people right a normal people are common people right those

01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:42.120
who are not in tech even i'll talk come to the tech part but

01:59:42.120 --> 01:59:45.060
yeah those who are not in a tech and i was surprised even

01:59:45.060 --> 01:59:46.620
nowadays i used to

01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:52.320
and then they are blaming they are complaining they're just

01:59:52.320 --> 01:59:55.140
talking about ai everyone knows about chat gpt right ghibli

01:59:55.140 --> 01:59:58.000
images everyone has created almost uh right after that i

01:59:58.000 --> 01:59:59.900
don't think that people have even logged into the account

01:59:59.900 --> 02:00:05.140
majority of the people uh right but that is not a way right

02:00:05.140 --> 02:00:09.280
if you're not using it as a child as a professional as a non

02:00:09.280 --> 02:00:11.800
-professional as a common person as a common man if you're

02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:14.100
not using it right let's suppose i don't have to do anything

02:00:14.100 --> 02:00:18.800
with tech at all still you should use ai on your day-to-day

02:00:18.800 --> 02:00:20.480
business so if you're not using it for everything every task

02:00:20.480 --> 02:00:24.080
that you are doing because that is a reality that is a not a

02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:27.800
future that is a present that we all are living into and in

02:00:27.800 --> 02:00:34.600
future it will become deeper and deeper and deeper yep so

02:00:34.600 --> 02:00:37.980
choice is yours system is available to all of you don't have

02:00:37.980 --> 02:00:41.220
to go and pay even for like chat gpt or something uh even

02:00:41.220 --> 02:00:44.800
for api or something so this is the this this was in my mind

02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:47.360
when i was trying to build a uran that build a ecosystem

02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:50.200
again i'm going to bring a very soon i'm going to release

02:00:50.940 --> 02:00:53.580
experience portal or intensive portal for you so where you

02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:56.520
guys will be able to get hld lld wireframe for thousands of

02:00:56.520 --> 02:00:58.860
project in almost all the domain right thousands of project

02:00:58.860 --> 02:01:01.620
in almost all the domain i think within two three week we

02:01:01.620 --> 02:01:04.240
are going to release it our target is to release by the end

02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:06.780
of this month but yeah so because of this development cycle

02:01:06.780 --> 02:01:12.040
so it's it may be like uh two three five days like uh plus

02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:16.060
minus right a plus obviously uh but yeah hopefully like uh

02:01:16.060 --> 02:01:18.700
in a first week or second week of next month uh it will be

02:01:18.700 --> 02:01:22.720
live again amazing portal so yeah yeah um you know i'm not

02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:24.120
sure what myмет where we will be able to do as many project

02:01:24.120 --> 02:01:26.680
as you want you will be able to get a later official letter

02:01:26.680 --> 02:01:29.000
from your own side so obviously which you are going to go

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:32.740
and showcase and it will be having a values right because

02:01:32.740 --> 02:01:35.660
you have worked and then we are giving you a later it's not

02:01:35.660 --> 02:01:38.320
like you have not worked and we are giving you no so for

02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:40.440
that we are giving you a class course certificate course

02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:42.480
certificate is different and that later is different that

02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:44.720
will be a proper later into a later head that is something

02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:48.480
that we are bringing because now we understand that that for

02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:51.740
a fresher it's very difficult to get a job in a market, in

02:01:51.740 --> 02:01:54.760
any company, not even in TCS Infosys Bipro because we all

02:01:54.760 --> 02:01:59.500
know that what is going inside TCS Infosys Bipro. So it's

02:01:59.500 --> 02:02:02.340
very difficult for a fresher even to get a job. People are

02:02:02.340 --> 02:02:06.040
looking for someone who has worked into a project. Even

02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:10.080
today, when I go and I used to hire a fresher for my

02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:13.680
company, my expectation is not same. The expectation that I

02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:19.140
had 2-3 years back, even from a fresher, 2 or 3 years back

02:02:19.140 --> 02:02:21.260
fresher means okay fine. So that person don't know anything,

02:02:21.380 --> 02:02:23.820
fine, I'll onboard that person, a person will go through a

02:02:23.820 --> 02:02:26.220
training, he or she will work in some project, eventually

02:02:26.220 --> 02:02:29.220
they will learn and then they will be productive. That was a

02:02:29.220 --> 02:02:32.480
mindset that we as a business people used to hold 2 or 3

02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:35.000
years back or any company used to hold. But now the same

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:40.120
perception has changed, completely changed. From day zero,

02:02:40.180 --> 02:02:43.300
you should be aware about anything and everything almost in

02:02:43.300 --> 02:02:47.860
a tech side, especially. You must have done the research,

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.160
you must have done the very good amount of projects, you

02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:50.880
must have done the very good amount of projects into a

02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:54.040
different, different segment. Then only people are going to

02:02:54.040 --> 02:02:58.220
onboard you and then it will be very easy to get a job. And

02:02:58.220 --> 02:03:02.400
yes, there are jobs in a market and there will be a job in a

02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:06.760
market. But only for those who is having expertise, not for

02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:10.200
those who says that I just know one or two things and then

02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:14.620
like hire me and I'm very enthusiastic and I will do this, I

02:03:14.620 --> 02:03:18.340
will do that. Now those dialogues are not going to work.

02:03:18.340 --> 02:03:23.180
Because we are living into a very different reality now. So

02:03:23.180 --> 02:03:25.580
when things have changed, when market has changed

02:03:25.580 --> 02:03:29.440
completely, you have to adopt that sooner will be better.

02:03:30.580 --> 02:03:34.280
And now things are more accessible. Believe me, even before

02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:36.320
we had an internet, right, we had a YouTube and everything.

02:03:36.500 --> 02:03:40.280
But believe me, things are very, very easy now, as compared

02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:42.940
to before. Now with the help of these things, which is

02:03:42.940 --> 02:03:46.700
available easily to all of you build a bigger one. Right?

02:03:46.700 --> 02:03:50.140
Now that should be your target, solve a bigger problem

02:03:50.140 --> 02:03:53.260
because it's not like so when when technology was not that

02:03:53.260 --> 02:03:56.820
advanced, we had problems and we used to call that bigger

02:03:56.820 --> 02:04:00.140
problem as a problem. Now that bigger problem became a very

02:04:00.140 --> 02:04:02.760
small problem. And now the definition of the problem has

02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:07.020
changed. Now we have another bigger problem. And this is a

02:04:07.020 --> 02:04:12.760
never ending process. So hope enough of discussion for

02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:17.980
today, by the way. But yeah, I'm assuming that. You all are

02:04:17.980 --> 02:04:23.300
going to remember it. You all are going to use whatever I

02:04:23.300 --> 02:04:28.280
said. From today onwards, not from tomorrow, there is there

02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:32.140
is no tomorrow, by the way. So it's today only today. So

02:04:32.140 --> 02:04:35.660
from today onwards, you will be start using it. Euron has

02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:39.160
already given you an ecosystem, try to use it, we are

02:04:39.160 --> 02:04:41.240
building more and more. So obviously, we'll try to bring

02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:44.980
more and more things, whatever is necessary for my learners,

02:04:45.060 --> 02:04:48.020
for my students or for any professionals. Who would like to

02:04:48.020 --> 02:04:50.440
get into one field to another field or same field to same

02:04:50.440 --> 02:04:54.260
field, right? So obviously, from our side, it's a as a

02:04:54.260 --> 02:04:57.040
company, it's our responsibility. And we'll keep on doing

02:04:57.040 --> 02:05:02.730
that. But again, you have to go and give an interview, you

02:05:02.730 --> 02:05:06.010
have to crack a job, you have to like negotiate with the HR.

02:05:08.790 --> 02:05:12.450
So there is something that you can only do, we can't do it

02:05:12.450 --> 02:05:14.850
from our end, doesn't matter how many system we are going to

02:05:14.850 --> 02:05:19.870
give you. But that part, we can't do it. So take a charge,

02:05:19.990 --> 02:05:23.570
take a responsibility, start doing it. So Lily subscription

02:05:23.570 --> 02:05:25.970
is too expensive. I don't think that it's expensive, it's

02:05:25.970 --> 02:05:31.210
just like a 3499. Is it like expensive? And again, you're

02:05:31.210 --> 02:05:33.450
getting some discount 215% discount you are getting it's

02:05:33.450 --> 02:05:38.430
it's very, like just just tell me one single company name or

02:05:38.430 --> 02:05:42.010
one single competitor, which is giving you all of the system

02:05:42.010 --> 02:05:46.090
that you are able to access in a Euron, right, and that too

02:05:46.090 --> 02:05:49.290
by charging you. So the price that we are charging into 10

02:05:49.290 --> 02:05:53.330
times 30,000 40,000, even after taking 30,000 40,000 resume,

02:05:53.430 --> 02:05:58.530
I know, Yuri, no API, no jobs, no couple of courses, maybe

02:05:58.530 --> 02:06:03.740
yes. And some people are charging even 5000 6000 Yeah, there

02:06:03.740 --> 02:06:06.320
are courses available, just courses available in 5000 6000

02:06:06.320 --> 02:06:10.460
3000 as well, right. But when we say we say that as an

02:06:10.460 --> 02:06:16.400
ecosystem, yeah, so I think like 3400 400, right for the

02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:21.000
entire year. Tension free year. Yeah. Right. I think it's

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:24.220
it's very small. Right? I don't think that anyone is

02:06:24.220 --> 02:06:27.440
providing it with this much affordability and this this many

02:06:27.440 --> 02:06:31.280
kinds of things. So we are not earning anything, don't

02:06:31.280 --> 02:06:33.620
believe me, I'm telling you, we are not earning anything.

02:06:33.720 --> 02:06:37.040
I'm just like investing my money. Maybe we'll earn after

02:06:37.040 --> 02:06:40.980
like a three, five year, I don't know, right. But as of now,

02:06:41.020 --> 02:06:44.800
we are not earning anything. But we are we are in a building

02:06:44.800 --> 02:06:48.080
phase of will will build I like building things. So this is

02:06:48.080 --> 02:06:50.660
what I've been doing since last 11 years. So I'll continue

02:06:50.660 --> 02:06:54.560
doing that. I love teaching people. So I'll continue doing

02:06:54.560 --> 02:06:59.540
that. I love tech a lot. So I'm building it, whatever comes

02:06:59.540 --> 02:07:02.120
to my mind. So I sit with my team and my team is amazing.

02:07:02.820 --> 02:07:06.780
They just like API access is the best part exactly, right?

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.200
Everything in one single place going forward, I'm going to

02:07:09.200 --> 02:07:12.520
bring even a speech API. Believe me, like in some time, we

02:07:12.520 --> 02:07:16.240
have a target that after 2025, so this year, which is like

02:07:16.240 --> 02:07:20.700
seven months more. No learner. Especially in our upskilling

02:07:20.700 --> 02:07:24.140
segment should go to anywhere for anything like that. That's

02:07:24.140 --> 02:07:26.160
a target. And that is a kind of a system that we are trying

02:07:26.160 --> 02:07:29.280
to create. So obviously, like, I'm not saying that I will be

02:07:29.280 --> 02:07:31.900
able to get even a single person market that that depends

02:07:31.900 --> 02:07:34.380
upon the marketing stuff and everything. But yeah, system

02:07:34.380 --> 02:07:36.600
wise, I'm talking about that I'm going to build a system in

02:07:36.600 --> 02:07:39.740
such a way that that anyone who would like to like do

02:07:39.740 --> 02:07:44.880
anything, it's available inside your own. Okay, so with

02:07:44.880 --> 02:07:47.500
that, thank you so much, everyone. Take care and see you

02:07:47.500 --> 02:07:51.840
again next week, Saturday. With. A genetic AI discussion. So

02:07:51.840 --> 02:07:54.780
I'm going to start a genetic AI. So I will be using all

02:07:54.780 --> 02:07:58.580
those Lang chain, Lama indexes, Lang graph, crew AI, all of

02:07:58.580 --> 02:08:02.080
these framework and back to back. So we are going to see our

02:08:02.080 --> 02:08:05.480
practical project. I believe we have now an enough

02:08:05.480 --> 02:08:08.640
understanding with respect to a generative AI. We are able

02:08:08.640 --> 02:08:12.540
to do a lot of things. It's time to move and take one more

02:08:12.540 --> 02:08:17.140
step forward. And let's start learning a genetic AI and then

02:08:17.140 --> 02:08:20.020
obviously like a fine tuning, which is again one of the

02:08:20.020 --> 02:08:22.880
amazing part, one of my favorite part you can say. So with

02:08:22.880 --> 02:08:25.660
that, thank you so much. Take care and see you again next

02:08:25.660 --> 02:08:27.120
week, Saturday. Thank you everyone.
