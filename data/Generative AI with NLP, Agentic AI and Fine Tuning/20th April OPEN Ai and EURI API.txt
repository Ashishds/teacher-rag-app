WEBVTT

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.210
everything is perfect. They want to check your video the

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.430
YouTube uploaded might find the differences. Yeah, some guys

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.850
they try to use a sound enhancer while doing a recording.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.550
I'll check I'll check from my side like if we can enhance

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:12.970
the sound a little bit. So even inside. Okay, so how about

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.070
like sound but I think it looks good. I believe so. Again,

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.230
we have launched even a poll inside a group. So let's see.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.260
Okay, so produce such in everyone. Good afternoon. So just

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.000
wait for some time so that everyone can join and then we can

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.680
start with the class.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.060
Okay, all good. Hmm. Fine. They were saying it is good. But

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.040
it is low. I'm like, it is good. Okay, it is fine.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.960
Okay, good. Good afternoon, everyone. Good afternoon. Tamil

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.620
Selvan, Bharti, Abhishek everyone, you

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.820
are giving a good content but only concern is low volume.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.540
I'm checking I'm checking on but not so we are having

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.600
conversation. I'm even looking into like a poll. So how many

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.180
people are facing this issue by the way, because I have to

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.460
fix it anyhow. So if it is a problem from my side, so

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.960
obviously I have to fix it. But to fix anything I have to

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.760
identify first of all, that what is the problem? from my

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.420
side because I'm not able to see the problem from my side.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.620
Everything is perfect. They want to check your video the

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.840
YouTube uploaded might find the differences. Yeah, some guys

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.260
they try to use a sound enhancer while doing a recording.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.390
I'll check I'll check from my side like if we can enhance

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:16.110
the sound a little bit. So even inside Okay,

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.280
so how about like some sound now, guys?

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.800
Yeah, no, I don't think that anyone should use a headphone

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.820
even without even without using an earphone. I think it

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.300
should be audible.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.500
I think when you change to your desk speaker it worked and

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.260
when you turned off, then when went back to the perfect my

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.780
side improved a little bit. Okay.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.070
Okay, fine. Let's get started. And I'll check it once again.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.110
Yeah, I'll check once again from my side. So I think sound

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.990
wise, we can try to make an improvement. That's not an

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.770
issue. We have like a kind of a gear. So where we can adjust

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.490
the sound volume, the output volume. And even I'll have to

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.270
check into my like OBS

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.290
so where I can change the sound.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.900
Okay.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.740
Okay, fine. So let's start with the class guys. Let me share

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.640
my screen. So today agenda is going to be so first of all,

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.000
let's set the agenda for today. So you are on and study I

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.220
believe I was talking about a hugging face and we have even

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.820
done a fine tuning with the help of hugging face. That is

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.480
something Okay, I have opened up MCP syllabus, not this one.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.820
Yeah. So yesterday, basically, I was talking about a hugging

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.160
face. And we have seen that how we can try to, you know, use

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.860
a hugging face how we can try to do a fine tuning with

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.220
respect to a hugging face. And we were able to do a fine

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.800
tuning with respect to a model. Now, today's chapter is

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.980
going to be this one open AI is a chapter which has been

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.260
mentioned over here. But now we have Yuri. So I'll be

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.980
talking about open AI. And I'll be talking about Yuri as

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.480
well. So how many of you have an open a paid account, by the

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.080
way? Yeah. So in a chat, guys, how many of you have a paid

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.120
account of open AI?

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.780
How many of you don't have a paid account? Let's go in that

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.160
way. So just write no, if you have like we if you don't have

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.540
a paid account and just write yes. I have a paid account.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.680
Okay, Imtiaz, Abhishek, Adiv, I don't have Sachin no, Sai

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.000
no, Tamil Silva I'm using, Sachin don't have, Anu I have,

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:45.060
Amanat no, Santosh O means no, I'll consider Vijay no. Okay,

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.540
so most of us Sandeep, yes, a couple of people have like, I

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.980
have Azure open, okay, fine. So okay, so I think like, it's

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.360
a 60-40 kind of a ratio. Because maybe some of us have an

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.160
open AI paid account. And some of us don't have open a paid

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.340
account. But yeah, not an issue you are covered. So we have

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.440
Yuri and now we have not just Yuri. So basically, we have

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.900
API access as well. So you will be able to access not just

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.800
open AI model. That model you will be able to access anyhow,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.500
but apart from that, so you will be able to access other

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.220
model as well. So I'm going to show you that from Yuri. So

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.560
how you will be able to use an API. And again, there is

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.460
nothing to show much over here, because the way you are

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.060
going to use our open AI exact same way, you will be able to

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:37.240
use URI. So like a users wise, you won't be able to find out

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.440
much of difference and not much I would say this is how API

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.060
is in call. So basically, like whether you are going to use

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.560
OpenAI or maybe API from a group or maybe API from some

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.900
other platform, you will end up using or you will end up

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.840
doing the exact similar kind of things and similar kind of

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.220
things we have implemented inside a URI. Advantages that you

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.400
will be able to get over here is so we have a multi model

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.200
access basically. So like even you will be able to use a

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.780
Gemini 2.0 flash. So which is going to give you a search

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:12.120
capability, a real time search capability. For example, in a

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.000
class itself, I'm going to ask that what is the temperature

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.660
of Bangalore or maybe like, give me some sort of a news from

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:22.280
a Bangalore. So obviously, this GPT 4.1 nano and mini will

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.080
not be able to give you a response. But yeah, so this flash

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.560
is going to give you a response. So every model comes with

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.660
its own capability by itself. By the way, and we are going

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:34.260
to like explore some of those capability in my today's

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.840
class. And the way you are going to use this model here

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.460
inside a class or open a model or any other model that you

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.520
are using any API that you are using to call the LMS, you

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.420
will be able to use the same thing anywhere means, let's

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.460
suppose I'm trying to build something from a lang chain,

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.080
maybe lang smash, maybe an 8n if I'm trying to use so

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:57.480
whatever and wherever you need an API, we have a solution

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:57.740
now.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:05.020
So you will be able to like find out and I'm going to tell

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.300
you like how you will be able to use our different different

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:11.060
model from the URI itself. So from like this particular

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.700
endpoint, how you will be able to use all of these things.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.940
So let's move ahead guys. And let's try to like explore and

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.820
let's try to understand that how I can try to use a API and

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.640
then how I can try to like you know, complete the work.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.680
Are you providing all the endpoints exposed by open AI as of

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.820
now we are, like providing you a chat completion and yeah,

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.520
real time search, basically. So basically, this completion

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.940
endpoint itself is like going to do a chat completion that's

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.640
completely fine means whatever you do with respect to open

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:49.180
AI, you will be able to do 90% of the task basically. So you

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:51.160
can you can try this out maybe after this class and let me

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.320
know what tasks you are not able to do. So yeah, we are

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.180
giving you a chat completion, image and all those things you

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.720
will not be able to generate. But yeah, for image, so we

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.540
have other model. So we have other models. So if you go here

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.320
inside a new chat, and then if you are going to click on

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:09.100
generate, so here Gemini 2.0 flash experimental. So this

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.020
model you can try to call if you have to generate the

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:14.180
images. So even you will be able to generate images by using

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:19.300
a Gemini 2.0 flash. So we have our models over here, we have

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.820
a model available in this particular place.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.980
Yesterday, I'm trying to build a blog generator with the UD

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.560
API but unable to build it. Okay, let's see today we will be

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.040
able to build it or not. Fine. I don't think that we should

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.900
face any kind of a problem. And we are fixing it, we are

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:40.480
fixing all the issues and when it comes to us, so we are

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.900
fixing each and everything. So fine, guys, let's get started

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:48.260
with the class. And let me like explain you one by one one

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:52.500
by one. So how we can try to use open AI or maybe this URI

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:58.480
API at the end of the day, fine. Now, so here, open AI is

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.880
going to provide you maybe embeddings, it is going to

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.100
provide you a content filtration, it is going to provide you

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:08.080
image and audio, we are providing image not with open AI, we

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.260
are providing image with a Gemini, we are not providing you

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.120
as of now embedding and moderation. But yeah, completion we

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.420
are trying to provide you. And I think this is the API that

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.340
we try to use 99% of the time.

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:26.050
Translation and transcription endpoint is not available in

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:28.050
URI. Yeah, that is not available that will be available

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:29.170
going forward.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:41.620
Okay, so let me share my VS code screen. So VS code and

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:49.050
open folder. D drive code,

00:11:50.880 --> 00:12:03.100
open AI URI URI. Okay, so let's get started. So test dot or

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:12.610
I can write today's date. So 20th APRIL 20th April API

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:17.590
testing dot IP YNB.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:24.530
Okay, so first of all, what I will do is so maybe I'll go to

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:29.310
open AI, and then those who are not aware about open AI, so

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:33.030
maybe I can try to show you that part. So you have to create

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:35.890
an account in a very first place. And once you have an

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:39.650
account from open AI, I believe chat GPT screen we all have

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:43.090
seen, right, but maybe some of us, I'm not saying that all

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:44.410
of you, but

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:56.560
yeah, maybe some of us have not like a use this particular

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.640
feature, which is an API. And any anyone who don't

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:05.800
understand like what is API, anyone guys, so like, I can

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.240
like maybe give you some sort of explanation for that. If

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.740
you don't understand what is API, by the way?

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.260
Yeah, anyone?

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:41.980
Okay, I'm just assuming that, like, most of us understands.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.320
Okay, someone has said that. Yes, please explain. Okay, see

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:49.420
guys API, I think you must have built some sort of if you're

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.780
going through like a recent project that I'm publishing on a

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:55.320
regular basis. So you must have seen that I'm using a fast

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.800
API or in some of the project I have, even used a flask. So

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.200
basically, with the help of these fast API, or with the help

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:07.180
of this flask, what I'm trying to achieve. So basically, I'm

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:11.860
trying to expose my function or I'm trying to expose one of

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:15.820
my module to the outer world. Now, in a layman way, if we

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:19.960
have to understand that what is API, so let me explain, let

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.800
me explain you that in a very first place and hope after

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.460
today's class, you all will be able to understand that what

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:31.680
exactly the API is. So see, guys, this entire world, the IT

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.920
world or software industry that you are able to see, it

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:39.980
works on API. Now, why API is required. So let's suppose

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:44.920
let's suppose you are trying to use some of the payment.

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.920
Generally, I tried to give a payment app example, because

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:51.380
it's easy to understand. So let's suppose you are trying to

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:55.600
use some payment app, maybe you are trying to use a GP as a

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:59.020
payment app, basically, right? G pay. So what do you do

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:02.260
while making a payment? So you go to your GP application and

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.180
you try to put some sort of a mobile number over there, or

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:09.000
maybe UPI ID you try to put up over there. Or maybe you try

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.320
to search a user and then select it or maybe you try to scan

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:17.440
a QR code. Right. So you are basically trying to give an

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:21.000
input input to home. So basically you are trying to give an

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.020
input so that transaction is going to happen. From my

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:28.400
account to your account, or from account to some vendors

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.700
account so transaction is supposed to happen and even you

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.860
must have like a paid for Euron plus so you must have seen

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.880
that there is a payment gateway which has been integrated

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.360
over there and we are not managing a payment gateway by the

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.760
way so we are using a service from someone right so

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:48.800
basically you have to pay let's suppose for a Euron plus so

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.540
with the help of Google pay so you are trying to pay for

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:55.780
what so you are trying to pay for your on plus right so

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:58.580
whenever you are going to select okay. So, whenever you're

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:00.420
going to celebrate that. Okay, I have to purchase this Euron

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:04.680
plus. So what we are trying to do? So, we are basically

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:08.420
trying to send a request, right, we are trying to send a

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:11.800
request with all of your detail that this is the payment

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.740
amount and this is the user our details. So we are trying to

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:18.780
send this entire things with the help of Jeep, let's suppose

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.340
you are trying to scan this Euron plus with them up of GP.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.260
So we are trying to trying to send all of this detail from

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:29.680
Euron plus to GPay over here for example and then this GPay

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.880
is going to call what so maybe this GPay is going to call a

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:38.480
UPI right UPI server so or maybe your bank server it is

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.020
going to call directly or maybe some other payment system it

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.340
is going to call directly so whatever like it is going to

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:47.400
support so it is going to call the UPI server so here server

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:51.740
now your UPI server is technically connected with a multiple

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:56.060
banks right maybe I am using HDFC bank you are using ICICI

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.760
bank bank of Baroda, Canara bank whatever it is Grameen bank

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.820
whatever it is right so technically your UPI system is

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:08.120
connected with all of this bank B1 bank B2 bank B3 bank B4

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:11.220
and so on so it is connected with a multiple bank so here

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:17.700
when you are trying to send a request request that okay fine

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:18.160
and then you are trying to send a request that okay fine and

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.100
then you are trying to send a request that request you have

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:22.140
received from Euron so Euron is sending a request to this

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.840
one and this one is sending a request to a UPI UPI is

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.880
sending a request to a bank now so when Euron is going to

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.840
send a request it will say that that okay so basically this

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.060
is the user detail this is the login id basically maybe your

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.480
email id or maybe your mobile id because we are giving you

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.560
both the option so with the help of mobile id mobile number

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.800
or with the help of maybe uh like a google login you will be

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.180
able to log in so we are going to send that detail that this

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.680
is the user this user is trying to like do the transaction

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.840
so and the user is this this is you basically right so this

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:56.220
is you user who is using gpay basically so you are going to

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.620
send your gpay is going to send a request automatically to

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:02.180
UPI UPI is going to send a request to a respective bank in

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:06.260
whatever bank your UPI is basically connected then bank is

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:09.760
going to check all the details or this UPI end itself so we

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.980
are going to check some of the detail and even over here we

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:15.340
are going to check some other detail that whether you have a

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:18.080
sufficient balance in your account or whether you have a

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.320
sufficient balance in your account or not whether you are

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.200
authorized to make this payment on this particular app or

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.620
not so all this kind of a detail it is going to check

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:28.780
immediately and then it is going to send back a response so

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:31.500
basically it is going to send back a response then this is

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.480
going to send back a response over here and then this is

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.920
going to send back a response over here saying that that

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.660
bank will send to a UPI that okay fine this payment is

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:44.040
authorized now the amount will be directed from your bank

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:49.140
account and then with the help of UPI so this gpay is going

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.920
to authorize that okay fine so this transaction is

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:54.440
successful and then it is going to send us a response to

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:58.180
your own system that okay fine so this user has made the

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:00.660
payment and your own system is going to do what so your own

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:05.820
system is going to give you access of a course so access of

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:09.820
basically your own plus and then when you will go inside

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:12.320
your profile you will be able to find out an access of all

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.580
the courses and all the services that we are trying to offer

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:15.580
to all of you

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.900
so this is basically a story that i'm trying to build up

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:24.540
over here now let's imagine that we have a multiple banks

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:28.380
over here we have a UPI system in between we have a gpay

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:32.200
system in between and we have a Euron system over here now

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:36.400
all of this system has been built by using a different

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.560
different tech stack now your own system can't go and say

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.780
gpay that okay so i'm using this particular tech stack maybe

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:45.820
i have written my back-end code into a python so you are

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.880
also supposed to write the back-end code in python so you

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:47.880
are also supposed to write the back-end code in python so

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.700
you are now gpay system can't ask upi the same upi system

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.280
can't ask the same thing to the bank any of the bank right

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:57.120
so maybe they have done their implementation in java maybe

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.680
upi has been implemented with the help of node maybe gpay

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:04.100
has done their implementation by using a go and maybe we are

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:07.320
using a python over here so just layman way i'm trying to

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:11.260
explain these things so basically our system is written in a

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.100
different different language or in a with the help of

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.540
different different kind of a framework we are using and we

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:19.300
have written the entire system because all the systems are

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.440
what all the systems are software at the end of the day a

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.780
piece of code even your banking system even your upi even

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:27.780
your gpay and even your iran plus system is what just a

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:31.060
piece of code by the way right just a piece of code so

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:35.080
system is supposed to communicate when i say that send a

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:39.500
request right so request from one system request from one

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:43.140
system to other system to this system and then get a

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:46.560
response from this system to this system to this system so

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:50.140
obviously this system is supposed to communicate between

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:53.980
each other right communicate between each other now this is

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:57.900
where the concept of api application programming interface

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:01.060
comes into a picture now with the help of application

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:04.760
programming interface what we do is so we try to basically

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:10.280
allow other system to access some of the function because at

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:13.520
the end of the day eon plus has written some function gp has

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.160
written some function to make a transaction upi has written

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:20.180
some function it's a function piece of code means what again

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:22.840
a module packages function and classes at the end of the day

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.680
right this is the this is something that you will be able to

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:29.900
find out everywhere so with the help of api so what do we

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:34.020
say that that at this url right maybe i am writing a payment

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:39.980
pay ment payment url so at this url my function is available

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:43.620
so you can call it and then pass a data the way you try to

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:47.900
pass a data into a function so i will pass a data i will try

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:51.280
to call your function right with the help of what with the

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:55.920
help of a url right with the help of http request or https

00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:00.320
request i will try to access your particular function so

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:04.200
this url by which you will be able to access some other

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:09.360
heterogeneous or homogeneous functions from other system is

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:13.220
called as api application programming interface so it works

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:16.180
as a bridge in between two different different kind of a

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:20.000
system now just now after some time so we are going to use

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.840
basically open ai right open ai api and then you will be

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:29.360
using even our yuri api right yuri api now we have

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.980
implemented a system by using some different frameworks so

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:35.880
let's suppose we are using a more mean kind of a framework

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:39.060
inside a yuri open ai maybe have done some sort of

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.700
implementation by using a java or something like that right

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:47.000
so open ai has exposed a api endpoint so that any developer

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.260
any programmer will be able to call open ai different

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:52.700
different kind of endpoints maybe a chat completion endpoint

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.220
maybe an image generation endpoint maybe an audio endpoint

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:58.480
so all those endpoints you will be able to access and same

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.560
goes with yuri so this the api that you are able to see so

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:05.160
we are giving you a url now so with the help of that url you

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.320
will be able to access something and with that we have done

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.620
what we have attached basically authentication and this is

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:13.920
the reason so you need a key key is nothing but a password

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:17.000
basically so whenever you go to gmail or any other like a

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.320
linkedin or you maybe like a facebook anywhere so you try to

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.780
pass your password and then you try like try to give your

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:26.100
user id and password so basically these keys are nothing but

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.420
it is going to behave like a password for you that at this

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:32.420
point at this url i am trying to access some function now

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:36.880
this is the password take it and then let me access fine

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.140
guys making sense what is the endpoint this url the url

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:42.860
which i am talking about now this is the url url which has

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:47.000
been designed for the specific purpose technically this url

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.840
let's see if i am trying to call slash payment so let's

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:55.360
suppose i am trying to call 127.0.0.1 which is my localhost

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:58.720
technically and then i am saying payment right payment so

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.420
what it is going to access it is going to access or it is

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:05.540
going to execute my payment function so payment function it

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:09.360
is going to execute so this is nothing but this is my end

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.800
point yes

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.080
why

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.740
do we need a api like a fast fast api is not a api so it's

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:24.660
actually a framework to create an api its name is given in

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:27.880
that way but yeah it's basically a framework where you will

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.660
be a pythonic framework so where you will be able to use a

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:34.860
python code and a fast api library and then you can expose

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:38.660
your function to the outer world so please check the project

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:41.080
otherwise please go through a basic of python because that

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:44.100
is very much required and without api you will not be able

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:47.960
to work in any means literally any real world project

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:53.960
because every real world project needs an api yes without

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:57.600
that believe me any production grade product you will not be

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.580
able to create even as a data scientist it's not like a

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:04.220
responsibility of someone who and it's not difficult it's

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:08.120
just a concept right that i have to access x y g function

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.960
simple i have to access x y g function which i have written

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:14.760
in python what i will do is i'll try to simply host it on

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:20.180
maybe this url 0.0.1 slash x y g so anyone is calling this

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:23.340
entire url they will be able to access x y g function which

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:26.280
i have written in python right maybe someone has written the

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:29.700
same function by using a java that's completely fine i'll

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:33.660
try to expose it even by x y g so now this url that you are

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:37.660
able to see the url this url is basically a language

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:41.060
independent url it doesn't depends upon the language because

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:46.020
it's a protocol https is what https is technically what

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:50.020
https is technically a protocol right doesn't matter like

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.520
whether you are going to hit some url with the java with the

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.980
python go with any other programming languages right so

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:59.600
basically this is nothing but this is a protocol that we are

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:03.680
trying to use over here protocol means what a rule someone

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.200
has defined a rule that if you have to expose your function

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:11.680
if you have to expose your system right create a url create

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.660
a https and with the help of https i will allow you to

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:20.840
access it making sense guys a little bit of it yeah

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:23.880
otherwise please come and join my python class i'll teach

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:28.460
you how to create api i teach a lot that part or even when

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.300
you will go through my project so over there i'm not

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:33.700
teaching you how to create a like api from the basic but

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:37.540
yeah i'm using api over there in almost all the project but

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:43.630
yes without api and yeah don't don't get afraid about the

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:47.190
api it's a very very simple concept right one time in a life

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:50.150
you have to learn you have to create one or two function and

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:54.030
map it with the a particular like a url particular path

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:57.870
that's it you will be able to understand each and everything

00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:02.590
for the entire life and you will be able to establish a

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:06.410
communication between any system to any system okay so now

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:10.390
moving ahead so this is where this open ai api comes into a

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:13.890
picture where in a programmatic way you all will be able to

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:17.390
access this open ai and you all will be able to basically

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:22.250
like a use whatever function that they have exposed whatever

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:27.510
end point that they have exposed so while retrieving a data

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:31.010
from a database is it risk to a data leak to a open ai see

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:33.610
whatever data you are sending to an open eye so obviously

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:38.050
they are using it to build their memory and again so they

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:41.390
say that they're not using your data but i don't know no one

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:43.710
knows actually right so

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:49.070
can't say anything as per their claim they're not using it

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:52.730
but yeah so there are again like a tons of claim where

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:55.710
people are saying that they're using it so i can't comment

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:57.250
on that part fine

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:05.000
guys okay so let's go ahead so

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.920
here now this is the openai dashboard so once you are going

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.540
to log in so you will be able to find out that this is the

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:19.020
platform.openai you have to go platform.openai.com i am

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:21.720
pinging you the link as well so if you are going to go over

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:25.480
here right so you will be able to find out our openai

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.800
dashboard now just go to your profile and click on your

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:32.200
profile option this is your profile option now over here you

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.440
will be able to see api keys option so here they are giving

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:39.000
you api key option and it's very simple to create an api key

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.520
so create a new secret key click and then my test key so

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:46.360
maybe i am going to give a name it's optional again select a

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:49.560
default project and then i am going to click create a secret

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.680
key so now this is the secret key which is available with me

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.620
from openai basically this is a secret key and with the help

00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:01.660
of this openai secret key i will be able to access the api

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:03.640
key that they have exposed so whatever model whatever

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:06.460
functions or whatever endpoint that they're exposing i will

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:10.000
be able to access each and everything so this is how easy it

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.020
is to create an api in case of openai and even on other

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:16.560
platform you will be able to find out the exact same thing

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.400
now billing you will be able to check your billings over

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.840
here right so if you are going to add some payment methods

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:24.400
so you can do a payment like i have already added over here

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:28.240
i keep on paying a lot to openai and all the other platform

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:32.280
so you can do that then you can also try to use this api key

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:32.280
and i will be able to get the payment method for you as well

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:35.340
so they have already mentioned a limit that for what model

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:39.160
what is a token limit that you will be able to find out

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:42.820
right so 300 token per minute and then 2 lakh token and then

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:45.260
2 lakh then 2 lakh and all those things there is something

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:47.440
that you will be able to find out based on the different

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:52.360
different model that they are exposing simple right now here

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:56.480
so they have again a multiple tab basically so data sharing

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.020
wise someone has asked me a question

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:04.420
model feedback for the platform so you can enable it or

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.900
maybe you can try to disable it so technically I have

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:09.960
disabled or by default it will be disabled right unless and

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.720
until you are not going to enable it they are not going to

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:15.180
take your data but again no one knows basically you are

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:20.140
interacting with their system so I'm not the one who can

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:22.600
make a claim that they are not going to use your data or

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.100
they are going to use your data I think I'm not like

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:29.520
authorized enough basically to make a comment on that part

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:34.520
at least so here at the end of the day mostly you need a key

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:37.680
over here right so once you are going to create a key you

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:41.180
will be able to hit these models and then you will be able

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:45.460
to get a response now so key wise it's completely fine I

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:49.160
will be able to like you know create a key just by writing

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:52.980
some single like just by clicking over here but how I am

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:57.320
going to use it and just. And how I will be able to get a

00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:00.580
response at the end of the day let's try to understand that

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:03.720
part with the help of code for that I'm going to do a code

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:08.380
over here so let me select my Python environment and any

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:12.300
environment I can try to create maybe you like a CNN based

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:14.700
Python yeah this is the environment kernel I have selected

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:22.070
now what is the reinforcement running if I am not using our

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:24.850
data so reinforcement doesn't mean that it is supposed to

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:30.310
use data it's more about the feedback. By the way okay so

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:35.650
here try to import open AI and those who will be able to get

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:37.870
some sort of error so maybe you can try to write over here

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:41.270
pip install open AI so that you will not be able to get any

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:44.570
kind of error over here so just like a write pip install

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:48.390
open AI and you will be able to install open SDK inside your

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:52.270
local system now here so you have to call just import open

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:56.910
AI now after importing open AI. So. So you have to give a

00:31:56.910 --> 00:32:02.370
key, the key that you are going to use at the end of the day

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:06.850
to access those model and then you can give an input model

00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:10.810
is going to give you the output. So here to give a OpenAI

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:13.890
key or to set OpenAI key, there are multiple way by which I

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:16.810
will be setting this OpenAI key as of now in a simplest

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:21.110
possible way. So I can try to like write over here. So

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:26.630
OpenAI API key and then I'm going to copy my own OpenAI key.

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:30.710
So let me create once again, something like this and then

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:36.810
create a secret key, copy, simple. And then I'm going to

00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:41.870
keep it as a string. Keep it as a string. Now in this way,

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:45.170
OpenAI will be able to understand that okay, so this is a

00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:48.950
key and whenever I'm going to access any of these models, so

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:52.110
it will be able to authorize. It will be able to authorize

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:55.190
and it will be able to give me some sort of a response at

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:58.590
the end of the day. So here to get some sort of a response

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:01.710
from OpenAI, so what we can do is we can try to call OpenAI

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:07.850
.completion, completions, I think it should be like a

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:14.150
capital. So completion, no, I think it became small now. So

00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:20.310
completion.create, C-R-E-A-T, create. And then you can try.

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:23.250
You can try to create your load over here, right? You can

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:26.650
try to create your load over here and you all will be able

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:31.770
to hit a particular model at the end of the day. So here,

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:37.030
model wise, I have already shown you. So here, data

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:42.260
control, general, not

00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:45.290
limit,

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:50.650
uses,

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:56.470
yeah. So here inside a limit, you will be able to see a

00:33:56.470 --> 00:34:00.470
variety of a model. And you all will be able to call it

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:02.870
again, if you're going to click on, so model, you will be

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:04.910
able to see other different, different, different, different

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:09.110
kind of a model. So they have exposed a tons of model over

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:13.070
here, not just one or two model. They have exposed a tons of

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:16.070
model. You all will be able to find out in this particular

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:19.690
place, which you will be able to call as per your uses

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:23.950
simple, right? Any model, any model that you want. So you

00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:25.630
will be able to call it here.

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:34.920
So let me call. So let me call. So let me call some of the

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.040
text

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:43.690
embedding, large fine. This is the embedding based text

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:49.230
model, the Vinci. Let me search the Vinci. Yeah. The Vinci

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:54.130
002. This model is available. So this model has been used

00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:55.850
for a generation.

00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:00.630
So text completion. So maybe I can try to use this

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:04.350
particular model if I want. So copy this model and then

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:08.090
inside a code and you can try to use any other model so I

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:12.010
can try to write ENGIN engine. So engine is equal to this

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:15.270
engine. I would like to use, let's suppose. So DaVinci a

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:20.690
point 002, a model I'm going to use. Now you have to give a

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:24.030
prompt PROMPT prompt you have to give. So what is going to

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:27.170
be the prompt? So a simple chat. So whatever chat that you

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:30.510
try to do with respect to any other elements. So here I'm

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:36.370
going to write that, write a poem about Yuri. There's

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:38.030
something which I'm going to write over here. There's

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.790
something which I'm going to write over here. And then

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:42.630
maximum underscore token. So this is again another

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:46.150
parameter. So give me a output response with hundred tokens.

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:52.230
Temperature I can try to set T E M P E R A T U R A

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:54.850
temperature and temperature. Let's suppose if I'm going to

00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:57.550
keep, you should always keep temperature between zero to

00:35:57.550 --> 00:36:02.050
one. So closer to zero means randomness will be less closer

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:05.290
to one means randomness will be high means model is going to

00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:09.270
hallucinate more. Basically. So maybe I'm going to keep 0.2

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:13.990
so that model should not hallucinate. And then basically I'm

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:16.310
going to hit this particular model just with these main

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:19.030
number of parameter. I'm going to hit the model and let's

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:22.030
see whether I'm able to get an output or not, or the output

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:24.850
is going to be good or output is going to be bad. I should

00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:29.410
not use a curly braces over here. So it's a method call.

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:35.270
Okay. Now execute and let's see missing a required position

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:38.330
argument. Either model. Or prompt or model prompt or a

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:46.600
stream argument to be given model prompt M O D E L. Okay so

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.720
E N G I N it is not able G I N E I think.

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:58.620
Okay so they have deprecated it seems so I can try to call

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.540
model completion

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:07.140
create got unexpected keyword argument.

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:15.830
Yeah so now I'm able to get the completion. So basically

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:18.990
whatever model that you are going to use. For example, I'm

00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:21.450
using this particular model. So you have to go and check

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:25.470
that what are the parameter this models are going to take

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:28.130
basically so what what and all things which I will be able

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:30.670
to provide and then eventually I will be able to get an

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:33.310
answer out of it. This is something that you have to check

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:36.050
all the time and with all the API's whatever API's you are

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:40.030
going to call now here. So I'm trying to use this API key

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:42.950
and then I'm able to call this one I'm saying that that

00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:46.830
write a poem about a URI spelling is again there is a

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:49.570
spelling mistake, but still it will be able to understand

00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:53.710
it. So completion ID then choice and here you will be able

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:58.630
to see a final text as you can see right text you are able

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:01.630
to see over here. So this is something

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:09.150
that it is going to give you as a response. Now if I'm going

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:12.830
to copy this entire things, or maybe I can try to print it

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:15.790
in a formatted way. So at the end of the day, this is

00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:19.150
something that you are able to get. And even if I'm going to

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:21.870
ask like a give me something different or maybe tell me

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:24.650
about this particular. Subject or that particular subject,

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:27.830
so it is going to give me a response in this way. Now so we

00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:31.770
have to format all of those response and show it to a user

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:35.570
in a user friendly way. As of now you are able to see slash

00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:39.290
in slash in and then slash in means a new line. So whenever

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:41.610
we try to like a build a chatbot kind of a system, for

00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:44.790
example, URI. So whatever response we are getting, we try to

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:48.290
format those responses and then we try to show it to you so

00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:53.430
that it should not look bad. It should be human readable.

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:56.710
Yes, what is the relation of temperature parameter

00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:59.390
temperature parameter for example, if I'm going to set

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:02.490
seven, it simply means that that I'm trying to increase our

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:06.770
randomness means based on the prompt system will try to give

00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:11.650
me an output. So how relevant that output should be that we

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:14.590
can try to control with the help of temperature. Temperature

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:16.990
is one of the parameter there are other parameter as well.

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:20.330
So there is something called as top P and number of attempts

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:23.390
all those parameter but temperature is one of the. The most

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:27.150
important parameter by which you try to increase or decrease

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:32.730
the randomness or we say hallucination making sense. So

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:36.410
closer to once means more hallucination closer to zero means

00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:39.730
less hallucination. So if I'm going to keep a number, maybe

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:42.590
0.2, so obviously it is going to hallucinate less if I'm

00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:45.770
going to make it maybe 0.9. So it is not going to give you

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:49.850
maybe a response with respect to your own as you can see

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:54.950
early lyrics to start anything. Songs. It's so sad at the

00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:58.290
something like that it is trying to give me a response some

00:39:58.290 --> 00:40:00.150
some random response it is trying to give me because

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:03.510
temperature is equal to 0.9 which I have made over here. Now

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:08.350
this is one of the way by which we are able to call API. Now

00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:11.610
let me show you back to back with the help of same API that

00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:16.050
how I will be able to like you know, build or I will be able

00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:19.030
to call a different different if I will be able to do a

00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:22.750
different different API call. So higher the temperature.

00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:25.250
Higher the creativity and lower the temperature higher the

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:28.150
accuracy higher the creative receive meaning of creativity

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:32.890
in the world of AI is randomness basically. So yeah, people

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:34.790
say that higher the temperature higher the creativity

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:39.630
doesn't mean that your result will be accurate because it

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:42.730
will try to like use some jumble word in between or some

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:44.930
jumble output in between okay

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:51.320
fine everyone. So how are you printing the output so simple

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:53.600
I have just called this function I'm not storing it into any

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:56.360
variables. So simple. This one I'm trying to call that's it.

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:59.480
Okay so let me like ping you this piece of the code so that

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:02.440
all of you will be able to execute place your own API key

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:05.280
and then try to execute it. Now let me show you a couple of

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.780
more example with respect to open AI right. So I'm going to

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:13.760
show you basically a chat completion with GPT-4. So here I'm

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:18.780
using a DaVinci 002 which is a very very old model. Now with

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:22.740
a latest model which is like a chat GPT GPT-4 so let me show

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:25.580
you how I will be able to communicate. And how I will be

00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:29.800
able to generate some sort of a responses out of it. I'm

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:32.680
going to use my same key by the way so I'm going to copy

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.420
this two line so

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:40.410
I'm going to copy this two line import open AI and open API

00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:43.470
key is equals to this one. Same thing I'm going to use I'm

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:46.210
not going to change my key over here. Now what I'm going to

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:50.850
do is I'm going to call open AI and then dot chat completion

00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:58.590
I'm going to call and then dot dot create. C R E A T E. Okay

00:41:58.590 --> 00:42:02.490
so chat completion chat completion means so the way you try

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:04.850
to communicate with the open AI. I'm going to say that that

00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:08.270
you are basically a helpful assistance or you are basically

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:11.550
a system admin and then based on that give me try to give

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:14.570
you this answer or maybe I can say to the model that you are

00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:18.690
like a pro grade basically a data scientist. Now based on

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:22.890
that try to give me that kind of a response means I'm trying

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:25.330
to build a relation first and then I'm trying to basically

00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:30.090
text with a system. Okay. So here open AI chat completion

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:33.490
then create so here model wise model wise I can try to give

00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:38.110
which model so maybe GPT GPT four I can try to give over

00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:41.130
here so it will be able to understand that okay so hit this

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:44.030
particular model previously I was trying to hit which model

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:48.310
old one DaVinci 002 again from open AI. So this time I'm

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:52.310
going to hit a GPT four and then I'm going to basically

00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:55.590
prepare my message basically over here. So what kind of a

00:42:55.590 --> 00:43:01.630
messages I'm going to prepare. So M E double S messages I'm

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:05.730
going to prepare. So here message wise what I'm going to do

00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:09.810
is so I'm going to define a rule that okay. So you are this

00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:13.470
I am this and then based on that try to give me the output

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:16.710
generally this is how we try to build our own LLMs or

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:19.870
whenever we are trying to like build a URI. This is how we

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:22.490
have built it. And we keep on correcting this particular

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:25.530
part so that system will be able to understand that. That

00:43:25.530 --> 00:43:28.650
what it should do and what kind of a role and responsibility

00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:31.830
is supposed to perform. So here I'm going to write a role

00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:35.530
for the system. So I'm saying that that this one is

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:38.170
basically a system. I'm trying to say system is system

00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:41.710
basically and then I'm trying to say that with the help of

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:45.570
content C O N T E N T content that you

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:54.920
are you are an experienced data is

00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:01.740
C I E N T I S T. You are basically an experienced data

00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:04.680
scientist. I'm saying that that try to consider yourself

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:08.660
mean system. So system is supposed to consider that system

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:12.220
is basically a data scientist now based on that right based

00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:16.840
on that try to give a output. So here again I'm going to

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:21.480
define a role and this time role is going to be user and

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:26.320
then content is going to be C O N T E C O N T E N T content

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:27.420
is going to be.

00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:39.720
Give me. Give me a roadmap to become data scientist

00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:45.440
simple. So here this is for system. So system will be able

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.440
to understand that I'm I have to behave like a data

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:50.260
scientist and then this is my answer. This is my question.

00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:53.040
So based on that it is going to give me the answer even if

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.860
I'm going to make some sort of a spelling mistake that's

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:57.900
completely fine system will be able to understand it. So

00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:02.200
here temperature T E M P R A T U R A temperature is equals

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:06.360
to let's suppose I'm going to set a. 0.4 so so that it

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:09.880
should not hallucinate. Now I'm going to call this

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:14.120
particular model. What is the error? This is no longer

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:19.640
supported in open AI greater than this one. Okay. So you can

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:22.320
run migrate to automatically upgrade your code base to use

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:26.460
this one this one this one pip install. Let me downgrade

00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:29.620
this chat completion one successfully

00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:42.080
uninstall the previous version. Okay. You

00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:55.570
try to access. So it was not available in the latest one. It

00:45:55.570 --> 00:45:59.610
was available in the previous one. So it's a version is so

00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:01.310
basically that I'm facing or

00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:22.160
else I can try changing the model GPT four is not supported

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:25.100
in the latest version. So maybe I can try to change the

00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:32.740
model itself. So maybe 4.1 nano I can try to use. So like I

00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:35.560
have shown you. A multiple model so you can try to use any

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:41.060
latest one. It is going to work for sure. So nano I'm going

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:42.660
to call and let's see

00:46:55.200 --> 00:47:01.040
temperature chat completion is not supported. Let

00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:17.230
me call migrate user

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:29.860
and content.

00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:43.170
Let me do one thing. So pip uninstall pip uninstall open AI.

00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:48.270
First on INS TA double L. Okay, so I'm uninstalling my open

00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:51.650
AI. I'll try to install the older version the version it is

00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:53.810
suggesting me open AI 0.28.

00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:18.590
It's taking a lot of time by the way, maybe what I can do is

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:22.610
I can go and I can try to create a new virtual environment

00:48:22.610 --> 00:48:25.650
for me that will be quick.

00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:31.770
So here because uninstallation is taking a lot of time. So

00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:40.250
here conda create hyphen n GPT environment I'm going to name

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:48.890
it python is equals to 3.10 install everything. So say yes

00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:49.850
happened

00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:00.160
so conda CREAT hyphen n.

00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:09.540
So I'm just trying to create the new environment. This old

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:14.400
one is like taking some time to do an installation. So I'm

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:15.240
just trying to create the new environment. So conda activate

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:20.560
GPT. Let me change a kernel for my Jupyter notebook. So GPT

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:24.640
I have to select so kernel wise select another kernel python

00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:28.560
environment. And where is my it

00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:39.300
is not showing me yet.

00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:02.440
Let me close it and open up VS code once again. This

00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:13.050
one then open AI URI. Yeah. Now

00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:23.450
kernel wise. Yeah, now it's showing GPT. So I'm going to

00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:27.090
select basically GPT environment. And here what I will do is

00:50:27.090 --> 00:50:33.460
I'll try to install open AI 0.28 version.

00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:50.920
And I'm assuming that your environment is working fine guys,

00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:53.160
everyone, anyone is facing environment issue.

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:12.560
Okay, looks like it's getting installed. And yeah, looks

00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:13.920
like it

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:18.240
should work. Let's check.

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:27.320
Okay, request argument is unrecognized. Now error has

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:31.940
changed. So unrecognized. Again, once version changes,

00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:35.440
everything changes actually, sorry,

00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:42.860
why the need of change of environment. So basically, my

00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:45.060
current environment got corrupted. That's the reason. So it

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:47.100
doesn't mean that your environment will give you the same

00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:51.140
issue. I keep on like doing a lot of things. So my current

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:53.820
environment got messed up. So I have changed then created

00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:54.920
the new environment for me

00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:05.080
temperature. So this takes argument in a bit different way.

00:52:07.170 --> 00:52:14.750
So maybe message, then maybe model. Okay. Yeah. So this

00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:19.350
version of open AI takes this input in this way.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:30.580
Okay, should work. I cannot be content where I have equal

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:34.940
equal to Okay, so again, I have to check there. Where

00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:08.490
is my code? Yeah. So open AI chat completion create tmpe.

00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:14.780
R a t u r e. Yeah.

00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:34.160
So basically, I'm trying to hit the open AI for a point one

00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:37.640
nano, and I'm just trying to set the temperature, which is

00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:40.400
not a big deal. I think we all know what is the meaning of a

00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:42.420
temperature. So what I'm trying to do over here is that,

00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:45.940
that I'm trying to ask a question that give me a roadmap to

00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:48.740
become a data scientist. Now, let's see, so what kind of a

00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:51.840
response it has given to me. So content wise, certainly here

00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:53.760
is a comprehensive roadmap to become a data scientist

00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:57.860
covering the essential skills tools, all those things built

00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:01.280
so lot of like a long response it has given to me, as you

00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:05.200
can see over here. And I can try to parse that response and

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:08.420
I will be able to show it to my user or maybe I can try to

00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:13.380
make use of anything simple, right. So here, I'm just trying

00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:17.720
to like define the rule that what is like this role. What is

00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:21.360
the user role? And what is the system role and what you are

00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:24.760
supposed to think about yourself? And then based on that,

00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:27.640
give me the answer. So now you can ask any question and it

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:29.740
will be able to give you all the answers. I'm bringing you

00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:33.480
this code guys. This is up and running and working. Yeah.

00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:38.780
But yes, try to change your open AI version to 0.28.

00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:41.800
Otherwise it will give you issue.

00:54:50.070 --> 00:54:55.890
Fine. Okay. Now. So here. We are, we are able to perform

00:54:55.890 --> 00:55:00.810
like a, we are able to hit one of the latest one. So GPT 4.1

00:55:00.810 --> 00:55:04.950
nano API as well. And we are able to get some sort of a

00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:09.730
response. So likewise, you can try to hit open AI key one by

00:55:09.730 --> 00:55:13.370
one, one by one, and you all will be able to get a response.

00:55:13.650 --> 00:55:17.290
It's very easy to like, you know, get a response. And this

00:55:17.290 --> 00:55:21.990
is how we try to chat with the open AI in general. Now. So

00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:26.010
we can try to even do a function calling. We can, and we

00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:28.270
will be able to get a response. That's again, completely

00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:32.050
fine. This is completely fine. Like we are able to hit open

00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:35.350
AI, but now let's try to do the experimentation with your

00:55:35.350 --> 00:55:41.190
URI. So here comes URI and I'm going to show you. So how you

00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:45.930
will be able to use API even from a URI. So we are giving

00:55:45.930 --> 00:55:48.110
you introduction over here. So there are some sort of a,

00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:51.350
like a writeup that we have given to you. Okay. So we are

00:55:51.350 --> 00:55:54.990
trying to say that this is the base URL. Now here we are

00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:57.690
giving you authentication. So you will be able to find out

00:55:57.690 --> 00:56:00.130
your API token. You will be able to find out your

00:56:00.130 --> 00:56:05.330
authentication header and API key here is a curl based

00:56:05.330 --> 00:56:08.010
example. So if you are trying to do a request through a curl

00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:11.070
and not in a programmatic way, maybe you are trying to like

00:56:11.070 --> 00:56:14.370
a hit this entire things through your console or like

00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:17.210
through your command prompt, you can try to use a curl over

00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:22.090
here. End point wise. So. This is just an end point that we

00:56:22.090 --> 00:56:25.830
have given to you and here. So available model wise, a lot

00:56:25.830 --> 00:56:28.810
of models and models that we have given to you. And here we

00:56:28.810 --> 00:56:33.130
have given you a code example. Now let's try to do one

00:56:33.130 --> 00:56:38.510
thing. So let's try to use this code example, and then let's

00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:43.510
try to understand that how I will be able to access GPT 4.1

00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:49.210
nano without using open AI with using just a URI at the end

00:56:49.210 --> 00:56:52.030
of the day. Just by using a URI, how I will be able to

00:56:52.030 --> 00:56:55.610
access it. So whatever I will be able to perform with the

00:56:55.610 --> 00:57:01.050
help of like a, whatever I will be able to perform with the

00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:04.130
help of open AI, I will be able to perform the exact same

00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:06.970
thing, even with the help of URI, that's completely fine.

00:57:07.110 --> 00:57:11.630
And that's like a pretty much possible. Okay. So let me show

00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:17.010
you that part. So just copy this code guys, you don't have

00:57:17.010 --> 00:57:21.010
to do anything as of now. Just copy this code. And then go

00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:27.930
to your Jupyter notebook, paste this code, Python code, and

00:57:27.930 --> 00:57:33.250
then execute and then see. So what happens here? We are

00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:36.970
trying to say that role is equal to user, content is equal

00:57:36.970 --> 00:57:40.790
to write a poem about artificial intelligence, temperature

00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:44.350
we are setting, maximum number of output token, we are

00:57:44.350 --> 00:57:48.490
giving a thousand. Model wise, we are trying to use GPT 4.1

00:57:48.490 --> 00:57:53.190
nano. Same model we have used even now, if you can see GPT 4

00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:59.670
.1 nano, right? And we are able to hit it and we are able to

00:57:59.670 --> 00:58:02.770
get the response. No open AI library, anything is required

00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:05.710
to be installed. Only request is supposed to be installed.

00:58:05.950 --> 00:58:08.450
That's it, which is a default installation while you install

00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:12.790
a Python. I'm going to ask this AI to write a poem about

00:58:12.790 --> 00:58:17.030
artificial intelligence and here, so you will be able to get

00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:20.510
your poem. Okay. That inner circuit of woven silent and

00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:26.390
deep, mind awake from the cold sleep, born of the logic

00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:30.870
crafted with care, a spark of truth in the digital air. I

00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:35.430
think it is rhyming. For data streams, it learns and grows,

00:58:35.690 --> 00:58:41.110
mimic of the human source. In its code, no heart we find,

00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:46.810
just patterns set by human mind. So a complete response it

00:58:46.810 --> 00:58:52.490
is giving you. It's a thousand token long response that you

00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:57.390
will be able to receive from here. Just by hitting a code

00:58:57.390 --> 00:58:59.750
from your URI. Are you able to get a response guys?

00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:09.380
Yeah. Are you able to see the response all of you just

00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:13.300
execute it and then let me know about the response.

00:59:30.190 --> 00:59:32.530
Yes. So you must be getting a different, different kind of a

00:59:32.530 --> 00:59:34.950
response, obviously, because it's a generative AI, right?

00:59:34.990 --> 00:59:37.890
So. Obviously. It must generate a different, different

00:59:37.890 --> 00:59:42.570
things. For all of you. Now, so poem and everything is fine.

00:59:43.370 --> 00:59:46.710
Maybe I can try to like do something different over here,

00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:50.430
right? Something different, maybe like a system and user

00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:53.610
role based kind of things I can try to like ask to it, or

00:59:53.610 --> 00:59:59.070
maybe I can like ask this model to do some different tasks.

00:59:59.430 --> 01:00:05.730
So let's do one thing guys, let's try to change

01:00:08.130 --> 01:00:12.950
a system prompt in the previous one, openAI one. You are,

01:00:13.050 --> 01:00:20.910
you are a weather expert. Now give

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:24.940
me a response.

01:00:27.730 --> 01:00:30.090
Give me temperature

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:43.380
in Bangalore today, today. So I'm just going to ask that

01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:49.980
give me a response and two by four dot one nano, right? This

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:51.880
is the GPT model. And recently they have. I have released

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:55.600
this one as a API basically. So it was released even before.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.200
So I'm just trying to ask a question, right? I'm just trying

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:01.600
to ask a question on 14th itself. It has been released as

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:04.520
you can see, right? So it's a very latest model, six days,

01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:07.240
seven days back. So they have released it. Now I'm just

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:09.920
asking a question that give me a temperature in Bangalore

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:13.740
today. So it is giving me a response that I'm unable to

01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:17.080
provide a real time weather update for a most accurate and

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:20.560
current temperature in Bangalore today. Please check

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:24.360
reliable. Whether website or app such as weather.com, it is

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:26.700
giving me some sort of a hint, but it is not able to give me

01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:29.560
a response. Now what does the meaning of this by the way,

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:33.360
meaning of this one is, so this is the chat completion API.

01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:37.400
So this is not going to give you a real time search. It is

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:40.760
having a limitation, right? It is having a limitation. It

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:44.320
will not be able to give you a real time temperature. Or

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:47.600
even if you are going to ask about some sort of a news, this

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:51.620
model four dot one nano, will not be able to give you such

01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:56.060
kind of a responses. Now I'm going to ask, or I'm going to

01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:59.160
give a same prompt, even with the URI and let's see what URI

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:03.300
says, right? So I'm going to give a same prompt over here

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:08.420
and then I'm going to execute it. Now let's check the

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:08.660
response.

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:15.080
So it is telling me that I'm sorry, but I can't provide a

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:17.120
real time weather update for the current temperature in

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:19.720
Bangalore today, please check the reliable weather website

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:22.660
or app such as weather.com. So almost same kind of a

01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:27.020
response I have received from URI API as well, because in

01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:31.480
both the places model was same, right? GPT 4.1 nano I'm

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:35.920
using even over here from URI and GPT 4.1 nano even I'm

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:40.860
trying to use it from open AI. Okay, completely fine. Now I

01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:44.380
have to do a real time search, a real time search. Maybe I

01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:47.460
have to like know about the news, world news, maybe a

01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:50.300
sports, maybe anything or maybe a temperature, same prompt,

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.920
right? So I would like to know about the temperature in

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:56.780
Bangalore today, basically. So what I can do is so we can

01:02:56.780 --> 01:03:01.200
try to use some model, which is going to support it, which

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:04.240
is going to basically support it. So here, that's the

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:07.620
reason. So we have given you a multiple model access, so

01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:11.220
available model can go over there. And then you can try to

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:16.440
copy Gemini 2.0 flash Gemini 2.0 flash from here, just copy

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:21.000
the model ID and change your model ID here. Inside the same

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.280
URI prompt, change the model ID over here. So from GPT 4.1,

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.940
so I'm just trying to change to Gemini 2.0 flash because

01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:31.300
this model is capable enough to do a real time search,

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:34.040
right? Any question you are going to ask in real time, it is

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:38.340
going to give you all the responses executed now and see the

01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:43.320
response. So here, if I'm going to check the response, the

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:46.160
temperature in Bangalore today, Sunday, which is April 20th.

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:49.720
Like I think today is April 20th, right? Is around 29

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:52.120
degrees. Centigrade 233 degrees centigrade, the maximum

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:54.400
temperature expected to reach 236 degree centigrade. It

01:03:54.400 --> 01:04:00.040
feels like 28.9 to 34.6 degrees centigrade. So yeah, I have

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:03.180
just changed the model ID over here, right? I have just

01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:06.240
changed the model ID over here and it is going to give you a

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.860
response, a real time search response it is going to give

01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:12.760
you. So see, it's not about open AI or it's not about the

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:15.320
model that you are using. Even we don't, we have not created

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:18.460
the model, right? We are using a model, although it's open

01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:20.820
source. Some of the models are open source model, except

01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:24.840
like open AI. But yeah, every model comes with its own

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:28.220
power. So you can't expect that like everything will be done

01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:31.680
by everyone. No, it will not be done by everyone. That's the

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:34.080
reason. So we are creating a multiple different, different

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:37.440
kind of a model, which is going to be export into a

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:40.560
different, different area. And then based on that, you can

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:42.440
try to ask a question and it is going to give you a

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:45.260
response. You can ask anything, whatever news, whatever you

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:48.080
want, maybe a daily news update or anything you want. You

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:52.340
can ask over here. And if you will come to URI, right? If

01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:54.960
you'll come to URI and click on new chat, if you're going to

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:58.780
select a search option by default, GPT 4.1 nano will be

01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:01.840
selected by default, right? Now if you're going to click on

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:04.660
search option, you will be able to see that model will

01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:09.200
change automatically, which model it is started using 2.0

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.720
flash. If you're going to click on think again, model will

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:14.460
change automatically. So just deep seek R1. And then we have

01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:18.160
basically a thinking model wise quinn. 32 billion. Same

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.420
parameter. So this model, we have even given you the symbol

01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:22.700
over here. So this is basically a brain symbol. Brain symbol

01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:26.180
means thinking model, right? Flash means a global means it

01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:29.360
will be able to do a real time search and Gemini 2.0 flash

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:32.020
means we have like a image icon over here. So it will be

01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:34.140
able to generate the image if I'm going to click on

01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:37.180
generate. So it is basically going to switch the model. So 2

01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:41.420
.0 flash experimental, it is going to switch the model now.

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:44.700
So that's many people says that, that, why do we need these

01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:47.680
many model access? We don't know. Like what kind of a task

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:50.940
you are going to do, right? What kind of application you are

01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:53.960
going to build? So obviously you need a different, different

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:57.640
end point along with that, obviously a model because if you

01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:00.260
don't have a model, what you will do with the end point. And

01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:03.520
this is where this multimodal system comes into a picture.

01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:07.580
We are even trying to build a URI in such a way that now,

01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:09.760
right now you're clicking on search. Then you are clicking

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:13.060
on thing. Then you are clicking on generate one by one. So

01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:16.300
we are even trying to build a URI in such a way that doesn't

01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:18.920
matter. What kind of a prompt you are going to give? My

01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:22.900
system will be able to understand that I should do a search.

01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:26.460
I should go for thinking or I should start generating the

01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:29.560
images or I should just give a simple normal response.

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:32.800
Fine, everyone.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:37.360
Yeah.

01:06:40.290 --> 01:06:43.250
So you can go and you can try to like a search anything and

01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:46.610
then it is going to work. Even we have attached like a file

01:06:46.610 --> 01:06:49.130
option, but yeah, we are trying to make it better. So I

01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:51.730
think in couple of week now just a matter of like a couple

01:06:51.730 --> 01:06:55.070
of weeks, so you will be able to find out that plus you will

01:06:55.070 --> 01:06:59.230
be able to track your token users over here. That is also

01:06:59.230 --> 01:07:03.330
there. Plus you will be able to explore all the images which

01:07:03.330 --> 01:07:06.230
has been generated by anyone, right? All this AI generated

01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:09.570
images you will be able to find out. Plus you will be able

01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:12.350
to see even a memories. So whatever chat that you are doing

01:07:12.350 --> 01:07:15.650
with a URI system, a plus if you have uploaded some sort of

01:07:15.650 --> 01:07:18.350
a file, so you will be able to see those files and you can

01:07:18.350 --> 01:07:21.830
even delete it. So we are not taking your files. You can

01:07:21.830 --> 01:07:24.470
delete it anytime. And we are completely fine with it. We

01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:27.290
don't have any kind of an issue. And in a programming way,

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:30.790
if you have to call, which we are doing as of now, so we can

01:07:30.790 --> 01:07:35.910
try to call that as a API. Fine guys, are we able to change

01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:38.890
the model and are we able to like, you know, do the search?

01:07:43.650 --> 01:07:49.030
Yeah. Now coming to the conclusion part, what do we need? We

01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:53.170
just need these two things. One is an endpoint. This is

01:07:53.170 --> 01:07:55.890
called as endpoint. Endpoint means this is where our

01:07:55.890 --> 01:07:59.610
function is. Right? So one is an endpoint. And the second

01:07:59.610 --> 01:08:03.150
thing that you need is this one. So if you have a URL and if

01:08:03.150 --> 01:08:06.670
you have a header, right, that's it. And this header is

01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:10.290
having what open AI kind of a key, right? So if you have

01:08:10.290 --> 01:08:14.970
this URL and header, you will be able to hit any of our

01:08:14.970 --> 01:08:18.610
model, whatever model that we have listed down, you will be

01:08:18.610 --> 01:08:21.810
able to hit it. This is the only requirement that you have

01:08:21.810 --> 01:08:23.830
no need to install anything. It's completely fine.

01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:32.170
I cannot access URI API. Just check your logo by the way. So

01:08:32.170 --> 01:08:36.990
if this logo is org, if it is showing you org, then

01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:39.150
obviously you will not be able to access. You just have a

01:08:39.150 --> 01:08:41.970
course and content access for the particular time period.

01:08:42.190 --> 01:08:44.490
And if you're able to see a plus, then you have actually

01:08:44.490 --> 01:08:47.110
plus access where you can access all the features. Otherwise

01:08:47.110 --> 01:08:49.490
you will not be able to access. So please check your logo

01:08:49.490 --> 01:08:53.990
over here. It will show you like a, for example, I have a

01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:57.110
multiple account. I'm keeping it. I do a lot of testing.

01:08:57.950 --> 01:09:03.670
Okay. Not here. So E-U-R-O-N. So yeah, you must be able to

01:09:03.670 --> 01:09:07.890
see org, org means nothing will be accessible except our

01:09:07.890 --> 01:09:10.210
courses. Courses will be accessible full scale courses,

01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:12.490
books, project, everything means whatever content that you

01:09:12.490 --> 01:09:14.950
have, it will be accessible. I think we have given you the

01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:17.970
initial access when we have launched URON. So you have like

01:09:17.970 --> 01:09:21.250
access for one year of time, but yeah, all this feature that

01:09:21.250 --> 01:09:26.020
we have launched, you will not be able to access at all. So

01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:29.060
in URI, you are calling OpenAI APIs. Obviously we have to

01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:31.980
call at, at least for this one. For OpenAI, right? This one.

01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:35.580
So we are calling actually OpenAI API because it's not a

01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:38.140
free model. It's not an open source model. All these models

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:41.100
are open source model actually. Eight models are open source

01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:44.200
model and these two models are not open source model. So

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:47.760
what we have done is that we have like created our own

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:51.620
wrapper and we have combined everything so that you are not

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:54.400
supposed to go and create a different, different API key for

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:57.540
a different, different models over here, which is available

01:09:57.540 --> 01:10:00.680
in different ecosystem. So let's suppose. I'm just talking

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:04.120
about OpenAI, right? So obviously I will be able to hit all

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:08.580
of these model, which is a part of OpenAI ecosystem by using

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:12.180
one single API key, right? But let's suppose if I have to go

01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:14.980
for Gemini, I have to create again another API key. Then

01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:17.460
like, let's suppose I have to use maybe a Flask. Maybe I

01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:19.740
have to use a Mistral. Maybe I have to use maybe a Quen,

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:23.040
right? Or DeepSeek if I have to use. So again, I have to

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:25.440
like create or maybe go and take a help of different,

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:28.060
different platform. Grooke is giving you obviously like a

01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:32.360
combined API over there. But yeah. So if a DeepSeek from a

01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:34.460
DeepSeek itself, if you're looking for the API, so you have

01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:37.860
to go to that platform, create an API, but here only one API

01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:41.700
key and you just have to change your model name. Our system

01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:43.680
will be able to understand which model you are trying to

01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:46.540
hit. As simple as that. So we have created a wrapper on top

01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:51.380
of it and going forward as we are going to grow, we will

01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:54.760
keep on adding more and more models over there so that it

01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:59.760
should be able to fulfill requirement for all of us. How to

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:02.840
integrate this API with a Langchain? It's very simple. I'm

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:04.960
going to show you that part as well. So once I'm going to

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:08.440
cover a Langchain topic, I think after VectorDB, so we have

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:11.060
to get into a Langchain, Langraph and all those topics. So

01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:12.720
I'm going to show you, but yeah, you don't need anything

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:17.380
actually. Okay. Okay. Let me, let me like do one thing. A

01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:21.540
question is good. I'll try to take help from Yuri. Okay. So

01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:26.740
I'm going to copy and paste the same thing, right? I'll show

01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:33.320
you the example, immediate example. New chat. So here. I

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:41.680
want to use this Yuri API with Langchain. Give me a demo and

01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:43.760
use this API. Okay.

01:11:46.490 --> 01:11:50.790
See, so Langchain, you have to install and then after that,

01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:57.740
so this is a URL. This is the API key, right? All the LLMs,

01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:04.700
call the Langchain. As simple as that, right? As simple as

01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:08.200
that. So you will be able to like call. It's very easy. You

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:10.780
just need, like I said, two things. You need an endpoint,

01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:14.200
which is a URL over here from a Yuri and then API key.

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:17.740
That's it. You will be able to hit anything in this entire

01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:23.300
world. If that thing needs a LLM access for

01:12:27.010 --> 01:12:29.890
all user, is it possible to provide access to a Yuri API

01:12:29.890 --> 01:12:32.950
through a pay-as-you-go kind of, I think we are, we are not

01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:36.790
selling like individual things as of now. So we are like

01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:40.150
selling with the Euron plus where just with this, like a

01:12:40.150 --> 01:12:42.970
much amount, you all will be able to access it as simple as

01:12:42.970 --> 01:12:44.950
that if you need, and then you can cancel any time. So we

01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:48.490
have even given you the canceling option over here. So in my

01:12:48.490 --> 01:12:52.430
account, let's suppose if you have like a subscription over

01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:55.130
here, so we are giving you like option. So action wise,

01:12:55.210 --> 01:12:57.970
cancel it. I have a multiple subscription. I'm paying to

01:12:57.970 --> 01:13:02.210
Euron by the way. So when I, like when we were doing a

01:13:02.210 --> 01:13:05.690
testing, so I was one of the testers. So you can cancel it

01:13:05.690 --> 01:13:07.810
at any time. So, and we are, we are not selling anything. We

01:13:07.810 --> 01:13:11.290
are just selling a simple Euron plus. So that you will be

01:13:11.290 --> 01:13:15.030
able to access, not just courses or this or that because we

01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:17.350
don't want to go and sell things again and again and again.

01:13:17.890 --> 01:13:20.650
It's a huge amount of effort it takes to build a marketing

01:13:20.650 --> 01:13:23.690
team, to burn a money in a marketing. It's better to give us

01:13:23.690 --> 01:13:27.030
facility to our user and just one single subscription. And

01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:29.850
my intention was with Euron was very simple since the very

01:13:29.850 --> 01:13:33.750
first day that let's build a OTT means one single ecosystem

01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:38.970
available in one single price tag monthly or yearly. It's

01:13:38.970 --> 01:13:41.030
your way. It's your way. Again, no one is going to force

01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:44.490
you. And again, cancel anytime. Maybe you need some of my

01:13:44.490 --> 01:13:47.490
job system for maybe one month. So okay, fine. Go ahead and

01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:50.570
take, take a subscription. And we are trying to build all of

01:13:50.570 --> 01:13:54.050
the services in such a way that even if you are going to use

01:13:54.050 --> 01:13:57.330
one single service, one single service in a month, 299

01:13:57.330 --> 01:14:04.110
rupees, your 299 rupees, like a, it, you, it will like look

01:14:04.110 --> 01:14:07.730
like an investment to you, right? I don't think that even if

01:14:07.730 --> 01:14:10.070
you're going to use just a job system. Just one single

01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:13.190
system, even if you're going to use, not all, I think 299

01:14:13.190 --> 01:14:16.490
rupees is worth it. And I don't think that anyone in the

01:14:16.490 --> 01:14:20.650
market is providing it. Do we need to change a model name in

01:14:20.650 --> 01:14:24.530
a code for using a URI API API understand which model to

01:14:24.530 --> 01:14:27.850
use? No. How URI API will be able to. So based on the task,

01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:30.110
you have to change it. For example, I'm trying to do a real

01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:33.410
time search. So for real time search, obviously I have to

01:14:33.410 --> 01:14:37.130
give that model. Yeah. I have to give that model for real

01:14:37.130 --> 01:14:39.550
time. Or maybe parameterize it. Simple. It's just a

01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:42.990
variable. I'm trying to pass. Right. Parameterize it. Just a

01:14:42.990 --> 01:14:43.650
piece of code. Right.

01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:50.700
So any question for me guys? Now, I think now we all know

01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:53.880
how to use a URI API because going forward, I will be using

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:58.600
URI API a lot. I will not be using like an OpenAI API. Those

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:00.500
who would like to use it, it's completely fine. Go ahead and

01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:03.580
use it. It's just a single line of code that you have to

01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:06.880
call and then you will be able to use it because if you will

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:11.060
look into your syllabus and many of you will complain even

01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:14.760
that you are not able to afford or maybe you don't have an

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:17.380
OpenAI paid account or something like that. So keeping that

01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:20.320
in mind, we have to discuss a lot of things. We have to

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:22.760
discuss like an RAG over here. We have to discuss a

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:25.920
Langchain over here. As you can see, in every classes, we

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:29.000
need an API access, right? Without API access, I can't do

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.220
anything actually. So everywhere, everywhere I will be using

01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:38.360
URI API and a different model. Right. Everywhere. Throughout

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:43.980
the entire courses going forward. Yeah. And you don't have

01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:46.880
to go and buy like an API or pay to anyone for the API.

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:51.940
Everything is available here itself. That was the whole idea

01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:54.860
and intention behind launching an API inside a URI. And

01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:59.140
yeah, so as day will pass, so we will keep on like doing a

01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:01.200
lot over here. We are anyhow working day and night on this

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:05.440
one. Question guys, question for me. So hope all of you are

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:09.480
able to understand how to call OpenAI API and how to call

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:11.260
URI API. Anyone who is having confusion.

01:16:14.970 --> 01:16:16.870
We all are understanding. We are on the same page after URI

01:16:16.870 --> 01:16:19.430
API key. No need to. But yeah, you should log in and you

01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:21.530
should experiment at least once. I'm not saying that it

01:16:21.530 --> 01:16:23.790
should not go and log in. I just go and log in on a group,

01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:28.690
log in on a, you know, log in on a like OpenAI account. Try

01:16:28.690 --> 01:16:31.250
once. Otherwise, anyhow, I'm sure I've shown it to you.

01:16:34.250 --> 01:16:36.950
Jitani is saying bit confusing. Org is free for a year and

01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:39.410
for other like API. Yeah. Org is free for other means like

01:16:39.410 --> 01:16:42.730
org means you have the complete content access. You have

01:16:42.730 --> 01:16:44.770
complete course access. So whatever project that we have,

01:16:44.810 --> 01:16:46.770
whatever courses that we have, whether it's a live, whether

01:16:46.770 --> 01:16:48.130
it's a recorded, whether it's a live, whether it's a live,

01:16:48.130 --> 01:16:49.790
whether it's a live, whether it's a hybrid or like a book.

01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:51.750
Everything is free for you. That's the meaning of org by the

01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:54.850
way. And I think that's the commitment that I've given to my

01:16:54.850 --> 01:16:58.930
old student actually. URI we need to plus, yeah, not just

01:16:58.930 --> 01:17:02.850
for URI. So for URI, for resume AI, for Avani, for a job

01:17:02.850 --> 01:17:08.270
system, everything, but URI, all the system looks good. Just

01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:11.810
use our resume AI as well. So you will enjoy it. And even

01:17:11.810 --> 01:17:13.090
job system, you will enjoy it.

01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:19.380
Vinesh is saying, Visesh is saying, use unsloth for fine

01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:22.060
tuning Lama 3.0 and how to evaluate it. Evolution matrix

01:17:22.060 --> 01:17:25.060
anyhow, I'm going to discuss a lot because when we are going

01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:27.580
to do a fine tuning, yesterday I have shown you one simple

01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:30.560
example of fine tuning, but we have 10 chapters, I believe

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:33.720
just for fine tuning. So over there, it depends upon the

01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:35.840
model that we are going to create. So obviously I'll be

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:37.860
using a different, different parameter to evaluate our

01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:40.760
respective models. Anyhow that's a part of your like

01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:41.580
syllabus.

01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:46.120
Devkumar is saying, if you set temperature is equal to 0.1,

01:17:46.180 --> 01:17:49.080
then we'll get most accurate results. So when most relevant

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:51.880
results you will be able to get. As per the understanding of

01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:52.980
like LLMs.

01:17:57.230 --> 01:18:00.370
Is there any token daily monthly limit? Daily limit is 1

01:18:00.370 --> 01:18:04.530
million. I think it's too much, 1 million. You can check

01:18:04.530 --> 01:18:07.390
your limit as well. So we have given you this bar and check

01:18:07.390 --> 01:18:12.530
your limit. So daily limit is 1 million tokens. It's way

01:18:12.530 --> 01:18:16.770
more than like tokens that we are giving you, which you will

01:18:16.770 --> 01:18:20.550
end up consuming on a regular basis. Maybe in one fine day

01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:22.610
you will cross it, but yeah, I don't think that daily you

01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:23.310
are going to cross it.

01:18:26.860 --> 01:18:29.460
10 lectures only for fine tuning. Just go and check your

01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:32.480
syllabus. I think 10, 10 different, different projects wise

01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:36.720
we are like talking about fine tuning. Is this what people

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:41.680
call as prompt engineering, sir? Prompt engineering from a

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:45.060
functional side, if you are going to ask me, then just

01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:48.680
writing a modified prompt in a different, different way from

01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:53.420
a tech side, if you will say, it's, it's a part of it. It's

01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:54.360
one of the part of it.

01:18:58.130 --> 01:19:02.510
Okay. So now we know that how to interact with the LLM

01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:06.950
system. So any LLM system in this entire world, whoever is

01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:10.690
hosting those LLM system in the entire world. So we will be

01:19:10.690 --> 01:19:14.030
able to make use of those LLM system, whether it's a open

01:19:14.030 --> 01:19:17.270
AI, whether it's a URI or whether it's a group that we have.

01:19:17.370 --> 01:19:23.870
So all these things, we all will be able to use it. So if no

01:19:23.870 --> 01:19:28.570
one is having a doubt. So then I think I'm done. Okay. So

01:19:28.570 --> 01:19:33.270
today's class in upcoming classes. So back to back, back to

01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:36.150
back, I will start using an API and then I'll start

01:19:36.150 --> 01:19:39.790
completing your chapters basically. So

01:19:44.850 --> 01:19:49.030
any question for me guys with respect to API calling, how to

01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:51.930
call the API, how to pass this one and going forward, what I

01:19:51.930 --> 01:19:54.970
will do is I'll just try to create one single function. So

01:19:54.970 --> 01:19:57.290
again and again, you don't have to even call this URL and

01:19:57.290 --> 01:19:59.830
header and all those things. Anyhow, this key, I'm going to

01:19:59.830 --> 01:20:02.570
keep it inside dot environment file. This is, this is not a

01:20:02.570 --> 01:20:06.610
standard. Way to keep a key so that everyone can see it. So

01:20:06.610 --> 01:20:10.730
it's a password, right? So basically we can keep a key in a

01:20:10.730 --> 01:20:13.430
dot environment file. We can call it from there. Just again,

01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:16.770
another one line of a code, and I'll try to create one

01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:20.170
simple function and then like every time we will call those

01:20:20.170 --> 01:20:20.550
functions.

01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:28.300
Why the name is Euron? It looks global. And my previous

01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:32.020
company name was iNeuron. So I have just removed iN and

01:20:32.020 --> 01:20:34.400
created Euron. Even iNeuron was a very good name. It's a

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:36.940
very unique name. When I kept that name five years, six

01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:42.280
years, six years back, yeah, in 2019. So yeah, it was a very

01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:44.560
good and polished name, but now I'm not holding that name.

01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:48.820
I'm not an owner of that name. So thought of Euron.

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:55.400
It looks like a neutral, by the way, there is no meaning of

01:20:55.400 --> 01:21:01.360
Euron. It looks neutral, unique and sort. Please explain

01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:03.560
that term endpoint. This is the endpoint actually

01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:06.960
completion. So what this entire things is going to do. So

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:08.920
this is going to do a chat completions. Endpoint is nothing.

01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:13.200
But at this point, at this URL, what function has been

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:16.020
called? So basically you are calling this URL, right? HTTPS

01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:19.780
URLs, but we have in our system. So basically with the help

01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:22.760
of this URL, you are trying to hit our system, right? You

01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:27.000
are trying to hit Euron system. Now below this URL

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:33.860
somewhere, we have written our own function called as

01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:36.960
completion function. Let's assume for that, not necessarily

01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:38.860
that we have written a completion function, but yeah, for

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:42.220
now, let's assume that below this URL, we have written

01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:46.540
compli tion completion function and we are asking for your

01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:49.940
authorization over here. So basically this URL will be

01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:53.460
called so that you are with the help of this URL, you are

01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:56.080
reaching out to the Euron server. So this is our server

01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:58.600
where you are trying to reach out. And then this is the

01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:02.020
whole path, a directory structure that we have given to you

01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:03.980
that you are going into this, then this, then this, then

01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:06.540
this, and then this, then this means you are going to this

01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:08.880
file, this file, this file. And then there is this file. Now

01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:12.860
here, you have to pass this entire API key and you are

01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:15.580
trying to execute our function. Now what our function is

01:22:15.580 --> 01:22:18.380
going to do. So our function is going to like understand

01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:20.660
which model you are calling, what is the maximum token

01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:22.980
temperature, everything, and it is giving you a response,

01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:26.860
the same response that you are able to see below. That's the

01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:27.440
meaning of endpoint.

01:22:33.970 --> 01:22:37.010
Thanks for giving Yuri with your own plus, yeah, I think I

01:22:37.010 --> 01:22:39.130
don't have any kind of intention to sell things in a

01:22:39.130 --> 01:22:43.390
separate way of selling itself is a, you know, a pain point

01:22:43.390 --> 01:22:46.190
every day. You have to go out and say, I have learned this

01:22:46.190 --> 01:22:50.150
course, that course, please take this course, that goes,

01:22:50.150 --> 01:22:52.970
then people will ask a question that is it necessary for me?

01:22:53.010 --> 01:22:55.630
Is it useful for me? What are you going to teach? I'm like,

01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:58.390
okay, take one subscription, explore everything. Everything

01:22:58.390 --> 01:23:02.470
is yours. And that too, if you don't want to like pay for a

01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:06.230
year, although it's a very, very small token amount, but

01:23:06.230 --> 01:23:09.530
yeah, money is like money matters, obviously for all of us,

01:23:09.570 --> 01:23:13.530
even a single rupees matters a lot for all of us. So if you

01:23:13.530 --> 01:23:16.330
don't, if you're not able to find out the values in any of

01:23:16.330 --> 01:23:18.830
the system, if you don't think that 299 rupees is a worth

01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:21.850
for any of the system, right? Because we are trying to

01:23:21.850 --> 01:23:24.090
create all the system, whether it's a courses or all this

01:23:24.090 --> 01:23:27.810
system in such a way that with 299, everything should worth

01:23:27.810 --> 01:23:31.050
like even a single system is going to create that much of

01:23:31.050 --> 01:23:35.350
worth of 299 rupees per month. So yeah, like I have decided

01:23:35.350 --> 01:23:38.390
that because I'm into this EduTech industry since last like

01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:41.530
a eight year, six year, I was running my own startup. Again.

01:23:41.530 --> 01:23:45.650
I have started after selling my previous one. So as per my

01:23:45.650 --> 01:23:50.690
experience, I don't like that model where we go, because I

01:23:50.690 --> 01:23:54.030
was using that model. So in Iuron, so we had like a bundle

01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:56.290
model as well, and we have our individual course model as

01:23:56.290 --> 01:23:59.030
well. So we were selling our courses on a regular basis. So

01:23:59.030 --> 01:24:02.190
whenever we go launch a courses, we go on YouTube and all

01:24:02.190 --> 01:24:04.630
the social media platforms say, take courses, take courses,

01:24:04.650 --> 01:24:08.410
take courses, I'm like, at least doesn't sounds good from my

01:24:08.410 --> 01:24:12.090
end. So it's better to promote Iuron. That okay, it's an

01:24:12.090 --> 01:24:15.710
ecosystem, please come over here, explore it. For sure, you

01:24:15.710 --> 01:24:18.890
will not end up wasting this 299 rupees. And if you think

01:24:18.890 --> 01:24:22.510
you are wasting, not an issue, you have an option to cancel

01:24:22.510 --> 01:24:26.210
it anytime. So that was a whole idea behind creating this

01:24:26.210 --> 01:24:26.990
your own system.

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:33.360
If you're using Uri API, then it's better to buy for a

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:35.860
couple of months, then go for a yearly plan, then we have

01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:37.700
either monthly plan or yearly plan, we don't have a

01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:41.660
quarterly or like a such plan, take monthly plan and keep

01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:44.620
your subscription running whenever you want to cancel. Come

01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:46.640
here and cancel it as simple as that.

01:24:51.070 --> 01:24:54.170
You have all the flexibility so no one is going to force you

01:24:54.170 --> 01:24:57.730
that no pay me this much that much for API or this or that

01:24:57.730 --> 01:25:01.290
like a resume or maybe Avni and it's not just about API like

01:25:01.290 --> 01:25:05.030
Uri is a complete like a chat system in itself. Simple, I

01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:07.790
can come over here I can say like generate something for me

01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:11.430
or think something for me, right? Canvas feature I don't

01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:13.370
know whether you have explored this canvas feature or not.

01:25:13.490 --> 01:25:17.850
So I'm building like this feature especially for me. Where?

01:25:18.290 --> 01:25:20.770
I can try to maybe teach I can like come inside the class I

01:25:20.770 --> 01:25:24.650
can try to teach maybe like a Uri API or something or

01:25:24.650 --> 01:25:29.590
anything, right? So Uri or something I can try to teach over

01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:34.590
here. And then maybe like I can directly send those images

01:25:34.590 --> 01:25:37.730
to my conversational chat system as well so that my system

01:25:37.730 --> 01:25:40.170
is going to give me a response and it will be able to

01:25:40.170 --> 01:25:42.810
explain me that what is there inside the drawing character

01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:48.960
one first character is a capital E or reverse E. Yeah, so

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:53.200
basically image analysis, I can draw something and then this

01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:56.220
is going to give me the analysis. So even Canvas feature is

01:25:56.220 --> 01:25:59.380
as of now not as stable feature I would say, but yeah, in

01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:01.580
couple of week even this is going to stabilize all this

01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:04.760
feature are going to stabilize. I can download it as a PDF

01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:07.680
or I can download it as a PNG I can share with anyone as you

01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:11.480
can see. So as of now I'm using scribbling but I have a plan

01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:14.460
not to use scribbling going forward once this system is

01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:18.080
ready. So I'll just try to use Canvas from my system. Okay.

01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:18.920
So

01:26:23.430 --> 01:26:27.070
why was not URI API used in today's MCB project is possible,

01:26:27.230 --> 01:26:30.850
could you please show how to modify the code to use the URI

01:26:30.850 --> 01:26:33.110
API? Yeah, obviously, I'll show you don't worry, just wait

01:26:33.110 --> 01:26:36.730
for the next project. I'm going to use URI API. See API uses

01:26:36.730 --> 01:26:39.650
Okay, let's let's talk about as person has asked me a

01:26:39.650 --> 01:26:46.470
question. So let me open up today's project. Guys, anyone

01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:50.050
who has like a seen today's project that

01:26:52.610 --> 01:26:54.770
I have uploaded with respect to the like,

01:26:57.510 --> 01:27:02.430
MCPs over there, I'm using like a open API. But yeah, from

01:27:02.430 --> 01:27:06.390
next project onwards, I'll start using like a URI API file

01:27:13.620 --> 01:27:17.320
analyzer. I don't know where that code is. Yeah, it looks

01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:29.060
like here the code is no open folder file analysis analyzer

01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:29.740
is

01:27:34.770 --> 01:27:38.630
open it up. Okay, yeah, here's the code. So here as you can

01:27:38.630 --> 01:27:41.790
see in dot env file. So I'm using like a open AI key, my own

01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:46.370
open AI key. It's still working. So I have just like given

01:27:46.370 --> 01:27:49.030
you the live API. So those who have a code base access, they

01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:52.090
can go and go and check your MCP class. I think it's

01:27:52.090 --> 01:27:55.530
accessible to everyone plus and all both. So here I'm just

01:27:55.530 --> 01:28:01.730
like trying to call the parser inside parser. Yeah. So here

01:28:01.730 --> 01:28:05.930
I'm trying to use like a open AI. Now if I'm going to ask

01:28:05.930 --> 01:28:11.790
URI, right, so if I'm going to ask URI, that do one thing,

01:28:11.830 --> 01:28:12.730
if

01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:24.190
I'm going to ask URI, let me open up a new chat. So this is

01:28:24.190 --> 01:28:35.490
my code. No need to generate. This is my code for sorry, by

01:28:35.490 --> 01:28:44.170
mistake, I'm hitting enter. This is my code for Cy Ghts for

01:28:44.170 --> 01:28:53.010
insights using open AI API. Now open AI API. Now,

01:28:55.610 --> 01:28:58.150
what I'm going to do is take

01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:05.230
a reference

01:29:07.210 --> 01:29:11.750
of this URI API and change it changed,

01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:19.840
see, and you will not be able to find out much of changes

01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:25.280
over here. So I'm just like trying to call URI API, right?

01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:29.540
Everything is same. These parameters is not mandatory. If

01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:31.700
you have to pass it, pass it. If you have to leave it, leave

01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:34.860
it. These are just optional parameter. And I'm just trying

01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:40.960
to like. Yeah. You have to remove this message, choice and

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:46.180
then header, fine, it will go over here, payload wise, write

01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:48.080
a poem about the artificial intelligence.

01:29:52.260 --> 01:30:00.710
Just a minute, take a reference, take a reference of this,

01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:07.020
change this.

01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:14.000
Yeah, it's done. See it has parameterized it. So you can try

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.320
to call the same function, pass a prompt the way you are

01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:20.220
passing it. It is not using like a open AI API basically,

01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:22.240
right? It has removed each and everything as you can see

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:26.360
over here, right? And it is using your URI API, rest of the

01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:30.720
things is exact same, no changes at all. Yeah. So pass your

01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:31.660
prompt and then do it.

01:30:35.180 --> 01:30:38.760
Integrate karke hi dikha dijiye ek baar, chaliye bhai theek

01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:42.220
hai, integrate karke hi dikha dete ek baar. So anyone,

01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:45.720
anyone who has like gone through this project, so basically

01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:48.020
this is the project which I have published. And which was a

01:30:48.020 --> 01:30:51.900
part of your model. Context protocol. So where I'm trying to

01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:55.640
showcase that how you can try to create your own function

01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:59.300
and then how you can try to expose it to a MCP server as a

01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:03.720
MCP tool so that you all will be able to go and you all will

01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:07.380
be able to interact with the, maybe interact with the help

01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:10.760
of cloud or maybe MCP inspector. So in this example, I have

01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:15.860
shown it with respect to MCP inspector now. So this tool is

01:31:15.860 --> 01:31:19.180
using LLM insights. This tool is basically using. This

01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:21.780
particular function LLM inside. So where, what we are trying

01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:25.340
to do. So we, whatever prompt that you are going to pass,

01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:27.640
right, whatever prompt that you are going to pass. So

01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:31.960
basically we are trying to hit chat GPT for open AI.

01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:34.240
Basically we are trying to hit, and then we are trying to

01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:37.240
pass this messages along with the prompt, and then it is

01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:40.400
going to generate a response. As of now, I'm trying to use

01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:44.960
what I'm trying to use basically open AI key over here. Now.

01:31:45.260 --> 01:31:52.560
So what I have to do is. Uh. So I have to basically use my

01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:56.660
own API key and then I have to perform the exact same

01:31:56.660 --> 01:32:00.080
operation means I have to like, uh, give a prompt so that it

01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:04.000
will be able to give me a response at the end of the day. So

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.740
basically like, uh, the requirement is to change this

01:32:06.740 --> 01:32:12.020
entire, like, uh, things, yeah. So just copy this one as it

01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:17.420
is, and I'll just try to modify the code. So remove generate

01:32:17.420 --> 01:32:25.400
completion. And I just need URL and header. So control X and

01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:26.900
then, okay,

01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:30.660
so I

01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:39.010
have this URL and then I have a header over here, which I

01:32:39.010 --> 01:32:42.210
have copied and then I can try to pass up payload.

01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:50.320
So here I'm trying to use client or chat GPT completion. So

01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:54.000
instead of using this, I will be using basically a payload

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:58.960
over here, I will try to pass the exact same. Message

01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:00.080
without

01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:07.880
any kind of a modification to URI system. So same message

01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:12.830
I'm trying to pass to a URI

01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:18.640
system as a part of the payload model is fine. Temperature

01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:24.260
is fine. Everything looks fine. So this is done. Now remove

01:33:24.260 --> 01:33:32.230
this one. It is going to give me a response. I can try to

01:33:32.230 --> 01:33:35.090
name it as a response as well. That's completely fine. So

01:33:35.090 --> 01:33:38.990
response. And then message prompt, I'm able to get from the

01:33:38.990 --> 01:33:43.150
variable, remove this key. It's not required.

01:33:49.870 --> 01:33:54.690
And sorry, it's a payload that we have fine. So just try to

01:33:54.690 --> 01:34:02.300
copy response request dot post. So I have a URL, fine

01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:07.980
header, good payload looks good. We just have to like do a

01:34:07.980 --> 01:34:09.640
little bit of picking

01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:16.280
here. So payload looks good. Message looks good. So it will

01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:19.480
be able to do the analysis of the data. Okay. Now instead of

01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:22.340
bearer, so what we can do is so we can, I can go to my

01:34:22.340 --> 01:34:28.480
account, my own account and I can try to copy my own API. So

01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:34.020
URI, APIs, authentication, show me this, or maybe I can just

01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:38.140
copy this one and I'll just paste it. Or maybe I can keep it

01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:41.440
inside the environment file. Anything suits you. So now this

01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:44.500
entire code is ready. I have changed the same code, which I

01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:50.520
have. Okay. Discussed. Now this open AI import is not

01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:53.840
required at all. I'm not using environment. So even this is

01:34:53.840 --> 01:35:00.860
not required. Control S why it is giving me stream service

01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:02.820
separate new line, semi-colon.

01:35:10.610 --> 01:35:17.210
Okay. So request I have to import, import requests. So

01:35:17.210 --> 01:35:18.770
request issue is also resolved.

01:35:22.510 --> 01:35:30.810
Now why are they showing me this? No. Now let me run it. So

01:35:30.810 --> 01:35:36.970
here I have to run basically streamlint or maybe like I'll

01:35:36.970 --> 01:35:39.630
show you even in an inspector. So inspector also, I can run

01:35:39.630 --> 01:35:45.050
S T R E M stream lit run, run which file. So run basically

01:35:45.050 --> 01:35:47.470
main.py file or

01:35:49.930 --> 01:35:52.650
D drive syntax error line

01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:56.190
number five from LLM.

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:03.600
Okay. Main.py. Line number five. Import. Get LLM insights.

01:36:04.140 --> 01:36:08.040
Have I changed a method name itself? Let me check. It looks

01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:13.540
like get LLM insights and then main.py file line number

01:36:13.540 --> 01:36:16.560
five. So get LLM insights.

01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:28.770
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:34.930
oh, oh, sorry. I have mentioned this one authorization

01:36:34.930 --> 01:36:35.630
twice.

01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:46.120
It will work. Oh,

01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:17.360
this was not there is some issue. I'm not able to, okay.

01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:23.520
This is my complete prompt system content prompt I'm able to

01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:28.070
get so fine messages

01:37:30.570 --> 01:37:32.230
payload.

01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:57.180
Okay. Looks fine. Control S. Go to my streamlint app,

01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:05.380
refresh once again, yeah, looks working. So file analysis,

01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:10.720
I'm just going to pass some file over here. Downloads. There

01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:16.940
was some file I was keeping this download archive file, pass

01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:20.620
the file and yeah, so it is able to do the visualization.

01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:23.980
That is not a main part. This part is actually using a live

01:38:23.980 --> 01:38:29.950
data with LLM. So I'm sending this to my URI and this URI is

01:38:29.950 --> 01:38:32.570
giving me this issue dictionary or it has no attribute

01:38:32.570 --> 01:38:33.070
choice.

01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:40.040
So payload choice content. Okay. So let me check what it is

01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:45.680
going to return a small issue. We'll fix it. So payload

01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:49.040
choice, zero message content. So it's

01:38:58.610 --> 01:39:07.100
giving me a payload. I'm trying to call response dot choice

01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:09.340
zero.

01:39:13.060 --> 01:39:14.480
Just try to call this.

01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:22.260
I always feel better to write a code from scratch instead

01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:27.380
of, you know, like changing something into the new one

01:39:27.380 --> 01:39:30.960
response dot choice. Okay.

01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:40.440
Message content. Okay. I am supposed to return response

01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:50.460
dot post return the response directly. All the responses

01:39:50.460 --> 01:39:51.460
return

01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:09.340
it directly. Yeah. Response 200. So now response is showing

01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:13.240
me like a 200. It simply means that everything is working. I

01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:16.260
have just returned the complete response itself. Now from

01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:21.620
response, I can try to like call the content and then I can

01:40:21.620 --> 01:40:25.380
try to return the content. So analyze data with LLM sending

01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:30.830
again. Now I'm able to get the content. So now I can do a

01:40:30.830 --> 01:40:33.810
formatting and now this content I'm getting from where this

01:40:33.810 --> 01:40:38.530
content I'm getting from my GPT 4.1 nano. Now. So you can,

01:40:38.550 --> 01:40:41.490
even if you have to like send this data for the real time

01:40:41.490 --> 01:40:43.550
search, you can send this data for the real time search, get

01:40:43.550 --> 01:40:47.410
the content formatted and then like a show it to the entire

01:40:47.410 --> 01:40:53.810
user as simple as that. So in today's project, I have not

01:40:53.810 --> 01:40:56.250
changed much, I believe. So everything is same message

01:40:56.250 --> 01:40:59.170
prompt. Everything is same. I've just changed like a URL

01:40:59.170 --> 01:41:04.550
over here and then just call response. Rest of the part is

01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:08.110
going to be exactly the same. So it doesn't matter which API

01:41:08.110 --> 01:41:10.390
you are using, whether you are using from a URI or maybe you

01:41:10.390 --> 01:41:13.470
are using from like someone else. It's actually works in the

01:41:13.470 --> 01:41:15.770
very same way. I just need two things. One is an endpoint.

01:41:15.950 --> 01:41:19.250
One is a key. That's it. So once I have these two things, I

01:41:19.250 --> 01:41:22.030
can hit any API in this entire world, not just my own API.

01:41:23.950 --> 01:41:26.610
Fine guys. Making sense. Those who have asked me like aaj

01:41:26.610 --> 01:41:30.650
wale mein hi dikhaadu, payload

01:41:30.650 --> 01:41:35.710
use nahi ho raha hai. Payload yaha par use ho raha hai na,

01:41:35.770 --> 01:41:39.690
send kar raha hai na payload hum log. Okay. Payload we are

01:41:39.690 --> 01:41:42.090
able to send it right here, tabhi to response aara hai,

01:41:42.110 --> 01:41:43.750
otherwise beena payload ki response kahaan se aayega, jab

01:41:43.750 --> 01:41:46.430
tak system ko nahi padha chalega ki message kya tha aur

01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:48.970
kaunse model ko hit karna hai, jab tak kahaan se response

01:41:48.970 --> 01:41:51.590
aayega. We are sending a request, request dot post. We are

01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:54.430
sending what? A URL. We are saying with the help of this

01:41:54.430 --> 01:41:57.430
URL. We are trying to say that, okay, go to this system,

01:41:57.550 --> 01:42:00.150
then authorize it. So this is what we are trying to do with

01:42:00.150 --> 01:42:02.870
the help of header. And then after authorizing, after

01:42:02.870 --> 01:42:06.030
reaching out to system, do this. So this is something that

01:42:06.030 --> 01:42:13.010
system will do. Okay. So modified the code. Now this, this

01:42:13.010 --> 01:42:17.250
code base again. So if, if I have to check it with the MCP,

01:42:17.330 --> 01:42:20.790
any, anyone guys who don't know what is MCP by the way, and

01:42:20.790 --> 01:42:24.650
anyone who have not even tried a single project in MCP. So

01:42:24.650 --> 01:42:28.030
basically I have exposed this entire things as a MCP tool. I

01:42:28.030 --> 01:42:31.250
can try to call the same function, function calling from my

01:42:31.250 --> 01:42:35.450
cloud and from MCP inspector or any MCP host. I can, I can

01:42:35.450 --> 01:42:40.130
try to call it. Please upload this to, I have just changed

01:42:40.130 --> 01:42:42.470
this much, right? Let me ping you here itself inside your

01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:47.390
chat. Take it. Okay. This is, this is the code like updated

01:42:47.390 --> 01:42:50.830
one. I have just pinged you in a chat. Please keep it. And

01:42:50.830 --> 01:42:54.210
again, from next project onwards. What I will do is I'll try

01:42:54.210 --> 01:42:57.430
to use URI API. I'm not going to use open AI or like a,

01:42:57.490 --> 01:42:59.850
because inside URI, I have everything I have like a Gemini.

01:43:00.030 --> 01:43:04.010
I have like a Mistral. I have deep seek. I have like a open

01:43:04.010 --> 01:43:07.490
AI. So now I have like a 10 models inside URI itself. So why

01:43:07.490 --> 01:43:11.190
I go and I'll just try to use open AI because in open AI, I

01:43:11.190 --> 01:43:14.050
will be able to get just a GPT and I'm getting 10, 10

01:43:14.050 --> 01:43:17.910
different, different things. And even like a, I have a real

01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:23.010
time search API over here. Yeah. So fine. Guys, the classes

01:43:23.010 --> 01:43:25.890
are going to be fun. Believe me, when you interact with like

01:43:25.890 --> 01:43:28.590
a real time system, when you build something real time, I

01:43:28.590 --> 01:43:31.950
believe this is where we are progressing. Yeah. So, so many

01:43:31.950 --> 01:43:34.970
lectures we have to attend. But yeah, at the end of the day,

01:43:35.010 --> 01:43:38.610
I believe you will be able to build like anything that you

01:43:38.610 --> 01:43:43.250
want after that, even a smaller version of your own, like a

01:43:43.250 --> 01:43:47.050
chat GPT, you will be able to build it. I'm going to show

01:43:47.050 --> 01:43:52.780
you those examples with H100 or A100 GPUs. What is this MCP

01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:56.020
course? You can tell. Okay. Oh, I think you have all the

01:43:56.020 --> 01:43:58.020
access, right? Go and explore. It's a model contest

01:43:58.020 --> 01:44:00.520
protocol. It's a new technology, which has been released.

01:44:00.660 --> 01:44:04.420
And like this is the project based courses, like a

01:44:04.420 --> 01:44:07.060
publishing as of now. So I think four project I have already

01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:08.920
done, there are 10 projects, so six is remaining.

01:44:12.210 --> 01:44:15.210
So Suniya and I have one question, if you set temperature to

01:44:15.210 --> 01:44:18.210
0.1, then we get the most relevant results. So why we try,

01:44:18.410 --> 01:44:23.750
see relevancy is one of the context and then like creativity

01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:28.830
or randomness is the other context. Okay. So be me in like

01:44:28.830 --> 01:44:32.730
some of the result, you would not like to see much of

01:44:32.730 --> 01:44:36.750
relevancy, but a creativity from your model side. So in that

01:44:36.750 --> 01:44:39.930
situation, you have to like go and set a temperature

01:44:39.930 --> 01:44:43.710
somewhere in between middle, 0.6, 0.7, 0.4 kind of things.

01:44:45.430 --> 01:44:48.330
So you gave your authorization key in the code, fine, it's

01:44:48.330 --> 01:44:52.930
like use it. I can ask my team to reset it for me. And even

01:44:52.930 --> 01:44:56.510
we are launching a feature to reset the entire API key. On a

01:44:56.510 --> 01:45:00.110
daily basis, as of now, we have implemented a code and in

01:45:00.110 --> 01:45:04.110
that way, so we are like restricting it for 30 days. So in

01:45:04.110 --> 01:45:07.110
30 days, automatically it will refresh. But yeah, so we are

01:45:07.110 --> 01:45:10.010
trying to add more and more parameters. So not an issue.

01:45:10.890 --> 01:45:15.290
It's fine. All of you are my student, right? So it's not

01:45:15.290 --> 01:45:16.150
even but on that basis.

01:45:19.750 --> 01:45:23.750
Okay, with that, guys, thank you so much. Hope it was fun.

01:45:23.910 --> 01:45:27.950
We are anyhow connected over a group. So thank you so much.

01:45:27.970 --> 01:45:30.770
Feel free to communicate, feel free to connect. But yeah,

01:45:30.810 --> 01:45:34.210
start building something. I think you have everything to

01:45:34.210 --> 01:45:36.950
build something. Yeah. So with that, thank you so much,

01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:41.350
everyone. And see you again next week, Saturday with our

01:45:41.350 --> 01:45:44.190
next chapter. Yeah, so I believe you all know what is the

01:45:44.190 --> 01:45:46.270
next chapter that we are going to discuss. So with that,

01:45:46.290 --> 01:45:48.430
thank you so much, everyone. Take care. See you again.
