WEBVTT

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.230
Okay, so hi everyone. Good evening. I think I'm audible and

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.610
visible to all of you. Yeah, so please confirm in chat guys

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.330
if I'm audible and visible to all of you. So that we can

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.970
start with the class.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.430
Jatin is saying not visible. Is it? Am I audible and visible

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.650
guys?

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.560
Okay, visible now. Fine.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.390
Okay, so basically we'll try to understand and we'll try to

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.010
talk about rest of the questions. So I believe we talked

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:26.010
about question till 1.30. I believe in last class. So we'll

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.630
try to start from 1.31 question.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.470
And I'll try to give my version of an answer. Apart from

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.510
that, so I have already prepared write-ups for each and

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.830
every question. So I'm just trying to, you know, realign all

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.650
those write-ups. Starting from question number 1 till

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:50.390
question number 200. So maybe soon, like in next like 2-3

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.410
days. Once I will end up doing my vetting and polygamy.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.070
Placing of those questions and answer in write-ups. Because

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.590
in write-ups I'm trying to add couple of more things. Couple

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.590
of more examples. So I will be sharing those answers with

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.710
all of you inside the dashboard. As well as inside your

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.350
WhatsApp group. So that will be available. So that in an

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.130
emergency, whenever you are going for an interview. And if

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.850
you're looking for a quick revision. So you all can do a

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.970
quick revision from your side. That's a part number 1. Part

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.930
number 2. So even like last week, so many people have sent

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:27.730
me their. Resume for verifications and just to do a cross

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.170
-check. So almost all this resume verification is done.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:35.950
Those who have not sent it to me on my personal DM. Feel

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.510
free to send me your resume. So that, you know, I can guide

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.110
you. I can try to advise you. We can try to make a

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.430
correction inside your resume. And then we can try to

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:49.910
finalize it. Part number 2. Part number 3. So those who are

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:55.490
available for a mock interview. You can DM me. So that we

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.470
can go ahead with the mock interview. I have seen like many

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.810
people are, you know, afraid of like doing a mock interview.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.070
They, they were, I was, I was talking to so many people. And

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:11.130
they said that, that maybe I need some time. Or maybe my

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.990
preparation is not done. Maybe I'm not confident. Maybe I

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.590
have to go through all the questions. And a topic and the

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:23.410
chapters for a revision. I think. We all have to do a mock

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:24.910
interview. We all should go ahead with a mock interview. So

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.570
that, you know, you will be able to get some sort of

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:30.590
experience. Maybe not with me. If you want. Maybe with

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.290
Avani. You can try to go ahead with the interview first.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.890
Right. Because it's a system. So, again, system is not going

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.390
to judge you. There is a high possibility that as a human, I

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.050
will end up judging you. But system will not do that. Right.

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:45.910
So, and, and you can, you can try to go ahead with the

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:50.710
interview anytime you want. Maybe at 4am. Like, it's

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.190
completely fine. Because Avani is a system. And it will be

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:56.690
available. And if you want me to take your mock interview,

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:02.490
then DM me. Yeah. Just DM me. And I think I'm a part of your

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:06.070
group. So, you have my number. You can just DM me that I'm

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.530
interested in giving a mock interview. And I will be

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.250
available at this time. So, whatever time you are going to

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:16.630
choose. So, we'll try to check my own calendar. And if we

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:20.010
are able to find out some slots. So, obviously, we can try

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:23.530
to go ahead with the mock interview. Fine, guys. Anyone?

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:27.910
Anyone who would like to go for the mock interview? Yeah.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:31.010
Anil, Laseed, Bharat, Vishwi, Dhaneshwar, Gahla, Jatin,

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:40.900
Jitender, Sumit, Visala and all. Yeah. Okay. Let's see. I

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.380
know it's a tough call for most of us to go ahead with the

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.460
mock interview. But yeah. I believe you should plan for

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:52.300
that. It will be fun. Okay. Now, let me share my screen. And

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:58.860
let's start talking about question and answer. Okay. So,

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:15.620
we have discussed till 1 30th. Okay. Fine. So, here again,

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:19.980
we have 70 questions left and most probably all the

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:23.480
questions we will end up discussing today itself because in

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:28.160
these sections, so two sections are tech sections and rest

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.240
of the sections are technically a kind of a non-tech or you

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.380
can say a managerial or decision making kind of a section

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:39.200
you will be able to find out. So, again, if I'll talk about

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.060
these questions, so these questions are for senior people

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.680
and mostly it's an experience-based question. So, when you

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.020
are a manager, when you are director or when you are like

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:53.420
trying to maybe handle some of the COEs inside a company, so

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.720
in that case, people are going to ask you this question and

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:01.580
mostly they will try to not check your expertise in AI but

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:06.420
yes, your expertise as a manager or maybe as a stakeholder.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.820
Okay. So, that is something that is given over here. So, the

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.740
very first question says that how do you lead a generative

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:16.900
AI transformation in Fortune 500 company? Maybe not Fortune

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.660
500 company, that's okay. Maybe like a big four or something

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:23.040
like that or maybe some product-based companies. So, how you

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.920
are going to lead this generative AI transformation? So, as

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.680
we all know that every company is trying to adopt AI, right?

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:34.680
And maybe whatever whatsoever is the result but yeah, many

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:39.120
companies are trying to adopt AI in their own domain and

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.060
maybe for a client, maybe for their own product. So,

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:47.140
whenever you have to do this kind of a transformation, AI

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.720
transformation or more precisely a generative AI

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:54.740
transformation, then what should be your roadmap or what

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:58.820
will be like the things that you are going to start with

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.900
basically. So, let's suppose there is no AI concept inside

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:06.320
your company and there is no team which is available to do

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:10.020
this kind of implementation and management has given you a

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:14.000
charge of this entire COE, a center of excellence

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.380
establishment. So, what you are going to do or what you have

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.480
done because many of you as a manager are going to mention

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.460
that I was the very first one who have done this AI

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.460
transformation in my company and obviously as a senior, we

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:32.220
does that, right? We all do that. So, anyone and everyone

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.940
who is having more than 10, 12 years of experience, your

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:37.980
company may ask you that okay, so we are looking for a AI

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:41.460
adoption, we are looking for a gen AI adoption maybe. So,

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.340
it's your responsibility. So, let's try to create a plan,

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.980
let's try to build a team for that, let's try to do a

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:51.780
budgeting for that, let's try to identify the loopholes,

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.140
let's try to identify what we can do best for our customer

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:58.260
so that at the end of the day, company will be able to

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:02.440
increase their businesses, right? So, this is a kind of a

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.820
responsibility you all will be able to get. Now, whenever

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:08.940
you have to lead this kind of a transformation, so again,

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.220
there is no thumb rule that okay, I will just go ahead in

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.700
that way. So, the very first part is let's suppose if

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.000
someone has given me this responsibility, what I will do in

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.440
a very first place. So, in a very first place, I will try to

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.120
understand my business or maybe I already have understanding

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.200
about a business because I am a part of company. So, I will

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.580
try to understand my client because see, at the end of the

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:35.040
day, it's not about building a fancy use cases. Fancy use

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.380
cases, why we all can build, end up doing or we all can end

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.160
up building maybe a thousands of fancy use cases which is of

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.760
no use maybe, right? And everyone can do it, right? Because

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.540
it's very easy to build those fancy use cases and burn

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.500
money. When you are not burning your own money, basically

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.260
it's a company's money. So, it's very easy. But again, at

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.540
the end of the day, company will not be able to get any kind

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.400
of advantage. So, first of all, what I will do, I can try to

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.080
understand deeper and deeper about my client, about my

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:05.820
product. Basically, it's called as. Identifying basically a

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:11.400
high value use cases and then based on those high value use

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.420
cases, I will try to assemble a team. I will try to assemble

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.240
maybe a junior developer, maybe I will try to assemble a big

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.400
data engineer, maybe a data scientist, maybe some of the

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.080
geni engineer because I am going for experimentation, right?

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.540
So, I need every kind of a people in my team, maybe one,

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.840
one, one, one, one. So, every kind of expertise inside my

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:33.120
team, a small team, maybe a team of 8 to 10 people, this.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.000
So, any kind of a COE generally we try to start, a center of

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.980
excellence in any company we try to start. So, maybe I will

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:45.540
try to build a team of 8 to 10 people. So, some are coming

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.940
from a product development background, some of them are

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.940
coming from a big data background, some of them are coming

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.640
from a core data science background, some of them are coming

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.200
from a core generative AI background. So, this kind of a

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.420
mixture of the team I am going to build after identifying

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:02.100
the high value use cases with respect to my client, with

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:05.740
respect to my product. And then obviously I will try to

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:10.700
design or I will try to create a road map for some of the

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:14.740
pilots. Again, this is something that we all do in a next

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.640
step. So, we will try to define some sort of a pilots or

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.420
maybe some sort of MVPs we can say, a minimum viable product

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:25.720
which is aligned with my company's motto or maybe with my

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.900
client's product or service which I am trying to sell it to

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:33.520
them. Because, for me. For me, my existing customer will be

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.760
my first customer, again, my first customer for my new

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.060
experimentation. So, maybe I can go to them and I can try to

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.940
show them that, okay, so maybe this is the new approach

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.600
which we are planning to adopt for your product and we are

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.140
going to charge XYZ amount for this one. Will you be

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:52.320
interested in terms of like, you know, taking a demo or

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.080
maybe if I can give you, if I can talk about maybe a benefit

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:59.720
about it, maybe we are going to cut down a cost by 10%, 20%.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.300
Maybe we are going to, you know. Increase your revenue by

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.220
implementing these things or maybe we will be able to

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:10.160
decrease our time. So, always it's not about a revenue. So,

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.780
sometime we try to cut short even an effort. Sometime we try

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:16.980
to, you know, cut short expenses. Sometime we try to

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:20.940
generate more revenue. Sometime we will end up giving a more

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:25.380
beautiful or better user experience to the user. Sometime we

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.740
try to decrease the complete timeline in terms of a

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.320
delivery. Again, all of these things are basically a USP.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.080
And you can play on all of, any of these things, right. So

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:36.760
you can just go and convince people. So first part, identify

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.800
the high value targets. Second, build a team, maybe team of

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.660
Avengers, 8 to 10 people, right. Not more than that. And

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:45.920
third thing, so build some sort of a pilot or maybe like

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:49.720
some sort of a MVPs or POCs. Again that should be aligned

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.880
with respect to your client and company's goal. And then

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:58.420
maybe a fourth one. So when your MVPs are successful. When

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:02.400
your entire like a pilot. It is done. Then you are supposed

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:06.640
to build a governance around it. And then this COE. So

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:10.320
basically you have to expand this COE now across all the

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:14.340
other team member or other other team or other product that

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.140
you have inside your company. So this is something that I

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:20.020
will do if someone is going to ask me for a generative AI

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:23.140
transformation. Now next question says that what is your

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.760
approach of building a generative AI center of excellence?

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.700
It's the same, the previous one, right. So basically. Like.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.740
I'll try to identify the problem statement, build a team and

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:37.420
then maybe like go ahead with some sort of a pilot basically

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.040
over there, which is aligned with my clients and company's

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:44.120
product. And then like if I'm able to successfully build it,

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.480
if my client, one client is happy, maybe I'll try to go for

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.960
the scale that, okay, fine. So if one client is happy, maybe

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.840
I can try to propose the same thing to my other clients as

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.320
well, or maybe in my other product line as well. So this is

00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:00.060
something that I'm going to do it. Now. One of the 133rd

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.460
number questions says that, that how do you develop a

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:06.960
generic strategy for a different business unit? Okay. So

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.820
again, not a kind of a thumb rule. So maybe I'll, I'll try

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:13.520
to like, you know, uh, give some sort of example over here

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.940
that how I have done that. So here, a question simply states

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:20.200
that how do you develop a generic strategy for a different

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:25.460
business unit? Right. So, uh, let's, let's suppose, uh, in

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.900
my company. So I have a sales team. Then I have a marketing

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:32.800
team and then maybe I have a product team, right? And then

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:37.380
maybe I have a team who try to manage a client or who try to

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:40.120
discover a new business opportunity into a different,

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:43.080
different reason into a different, different, like a domain.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.720
Right? So if I have to develop a generative strategy across

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.180
our different, different team, or this is a team label right

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:53.680
now, there will be, there could be another label on a

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.800
product label basically. So I have a multiple product line

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.900
and maybe across a product line. If I have to, uh, like, uh,

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.760
you know, introduce some sort of a generative AI strategy,

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:05.560
um, even for HR, even for finance. If I have to introduce a

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:09.800
generative AI strategy and, uh, if someone has given me a

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.900
responsibility, so maybe let's suppose I'll, I'll go to HR,

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.660
right? I'll go to HR head. I'll go to my finance head.

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.340
Basically, I'll go to my sales head. I'll go to my marketing

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:21.260
head because in every company, these people will be there,

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.340
right? These units will be there and that too in a massive

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.200
manner, you will be able to see because, uh, when we talk

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.460
about a company, so companies, uh, backbones are basically

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.120
these departments, your HR, your sales, your marketing, your

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:36.080
finance, maybe your product. In every company you will be

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:40.340
able to find out. So here, uh, if someone has given me to

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.420
drive this AI initiative or generative AI initiative in my

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:47.000
company, I'll just go to HR head and I know that, uh, they

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.320
must be using their legacy things, right? Because HR will

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.100
never care about the generative AI, right? So they know

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.040
that, that, okay, fine. So I have to close the hiring. I

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.780
have to onboard a people. Right? So my little sales team

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:58.940
knows that, okay, fine, so I'll get a lead and then I'll

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:02.460
have to like make a sales in a B2B mode or maybe into a D2C

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.860
mode. Uh, my finance team, again, they will keep on like

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:10.000
using their existing tool. So if my company has asked me to

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.300
initiate these things across a different, different team

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.660
member, so obviously I'll just try to connect with all the

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.880
business head. I'll say that, that, okay, so maybe in a

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.620
finance, so maybe we can do some sort of a cost cutting.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.820
Maybe we can try to like fast track the process, maybe we

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.500
can try to like, uh, you know, initiate a best and robust

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:30.400
process for your entire finance or maybe a approval, uh,

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.700
that, that you guys are doing as of now in terms of our

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:37.660
finance. And then I can, I can just discuss their problems

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:40.900
basically that what is the problem that you solve and uh,

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:45.340
what is your flow in terms of giving approval in terms of

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.700
making a payment in terms of, you know, maintaining the

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.980
invoices and many more things, right? And many more things.

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:55.360
And then I can try to propose a solution that, okay. So this

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.900
is a solution which we can try to build for our finance

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.980
team. Now this is the advantages I will be able to do. And

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.240
in every company you will be able to find out that people

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:06.420
are doing it. See finance guy will never talk about the AI,

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:10.340
right? Or maybe any technological advancement, right? It's a

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:15.080
COE, it's a business head who always try to drive this kind

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.100
of a process and says that that, okay, I'll like initiate

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.280
this process and maybe I'll try to do a cost cutting. And

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.660
obviously if we are talking about cost cutting, or maybe we

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:28.320
are talking about, uh, something which is going to reduce a

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.180
timeline, that is again, eventually get converted into a

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:34.800
cost cutting itself. Company will be very happy with me. So

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.560
I'll just go to finance guy and I'll try to smoothen up the

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:41.160
process. Same I'll do with HR, right? See HR, HR will never

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:44.460
talk about, uh, ATS kind of a system, right? But every

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:46.820
company has introduced it. So there must be some guy. So

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:51.260
who, who, you know, who has, uh, like done something with

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.680
respect to this HR department. And they said, okay, let's do

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.460
this. So I said that, okay, so you guys are spending a lot

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:58.460
of time in terms of screening the resume and maybe that too

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:01.240
in a biased way sometime. So let's do one thing. So let's

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.080
try to induce a ATS system in between, right? Let's try to

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.300
smoothen up the entire hiring process. Maybe you are not

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:08.980
even supposed to take a couple of round of interview system

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:12.480
itself. We can do it. Any kind of a system, right? So which

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.520
will go and which will try to take a candidate's interview

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.880
so that, you know, we'll be able to save a lots and lots of

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:22.000
man hours, right? Because if someone is going to take an

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.160
interview from any teams. We are spending money, companies

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.740
spending money, right? Because even if like one hour,

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.940
someone, some, some of the person is just spending from any

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:35.560
team across a company. It's a huge, huge loss for a company

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.200
or it's, it's not a loss I would say, but yeah, it gives a

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.780
cost. And eventually if we are not able to get a return ROI

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:45.260
of that, so it's, it's a loss for me. So I can, I can go

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.280
ahead and I can try to introduce it. Same thing will go with

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.620
the sales that, okay, let's automate the entire process,

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:53.520
right? Let's try to introduce some of the initial sales.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.780
Let's try to introduce a sales chat agent or maybe a sales

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:59.400
voice agent. If I'll go to a marketing team, I'll simply say

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.880
that, that why you're keeping maybe a hundred people, right?

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:04.560
In terms of running a campaigns in terms of, you know, uh,

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.880
creating a collaterals or maybe a assets for the marketing

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:11.200
campaigns, what I can do, or maybe connecting with the other

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.480
marketing guy from outside the company, or maybe giving a

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.500
contract to someone because this is what happens in a

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:20.340
marketing. So maybe we can try to, you know, uh, streamline

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:23.420
the process and uh, maybe we can try to fast track the

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:26.040
process with the help of AI. So my AI is going to create the

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:29.940
entire funnel for you and then nowadays you will be able to

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:33.940
find out that every company without any doubts, right? Every

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:38.960
company is doing it on a massive level across a team because

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:43.000
if you have to like a, you know, uh, like increase the

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.800
profitability, so it's not just about making a more

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:50.600
revenues, but even saving something that, that you can do it

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.980
in a existing process itself. So this is what, uh, I will be

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:56.620
like, uh, this is how I will be doing, uh, you know, uh,

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.880
development start. I will be like, uh, defining the strategy

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.720
for a different, different business unit inside my company.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.680
And whenever you are giving this example, so just take an

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:09.420
example of at least one team that, okay. Uh, so a company

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.900
has given me a responsibility for this finance task, right?

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:16.920
So to identify all these frauds and then like a company was

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:19.260
taking maybe three or four days of time in terms of

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:24.580
processing those invoices or maybe a claim. Okay. So I have

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:28.720
basically built on my team has basically built a generative

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.620
AI or AI based solution. So which has streamlined the entire

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:34.800
process. So previously there was a hundred people who was

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.500
working now only two, three people are just maintaining it

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.960
and my system is up and running like a hundred percent 24 by

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.380
seven, right? So this is a kind of example you can try to

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:47.200
give and obviously your interviewer, whoever is taking your

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.180
interview, obviously some business people will be taking

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:52.100
your interview who just understand the business. Not like a

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:55.200
tech, uh, they will be very happy. Believe me, they will be

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.980
very happy. Now what is the approach of, for securing a

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:05.680
executive, um, buy-ins for, uh, generative AI? Sorry, what

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:10.160
was that? Yeah. What is the approach for securing executive

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:16.620
buy-in for gen AI? Okay. So executive buying means, uh,

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.600
let's suppose if I'm trying to propose something to my

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:22.000
management, uh, right. And they should say yes, right? All

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
the executives would say yes. So obviously I'll just try to

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.020
start with the storytelling story is the best way to

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:30.720
convince anyone. And obviously, uh, we all sell the stories.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.680
So I'll just go ahead, I'll say that, that, okay, we have

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.960
done this small MVPs and it was very much successful, uh,

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:40.300
with maybe a 90% result, we were able to reduce a cost by

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:44.360
20, 30% over there. Uh, we were able to even like, uh, we

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.640
have seen some sort of a feedback from a customer, which was

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:50.060
amazing. And maybe you can, you can just talk about the real

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:55.220
story and this is how we all, you know, uh, impresses

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:59.300
anyone, any, any like a board basically. Right. Uh, then how

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:01.540
do you manage generative AI project with the multiple

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:04.400
stakeholder? Yeah. So on this level, so let's suppose if

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.480
you're on an executive position or maybe on a manager

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.660
position, so it's not like you will be running only one

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.480
project, so you will be running multiple projects

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:14.820
parallelly. And again, so multiple leads are going to report

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:17.040
you. So how do you manage? How do you manage generative AI

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:21.500
project with the multiple stake holder? So basically, uh,

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.600
uh, the very first question, which I have already answered,

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:27.360
right? So here we are going to build a team, right? A small

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.900
team by the way. And once I'm going to like, uh, do the

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:34.060
experimentation, uh, maybe my MVPs or maybe my pilot

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:37.000
project, if I'm able to do it. So obviously I have to spread

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.340
across a different, different, different, different team

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:46.000
member, right? So if, uh, this entire COE is new, right?

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.080
Center of excellence is new in my company, what I will do,

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.220
maybe I can try to do some sort of a training and

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:55.040
retraining. Every company does that, right? You must have

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.840
seen that, that, uh, TCS has, you know, uh, trained, uh,

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:03.540
one, uh, black people. Maybe, uh, this was the news. Uh, and

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:05.720
every day you will be able to see that, that, uh, these

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.980
companies have trained maybe their 10,000 employees or maybe

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:12.760
like, uh, they're one lakh employees and, uh, something like

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.420
that. Right? So basically everything starts from COEs. One

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:18.720
division, one core division in every, uh, such kind of a

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:22.840
companies. And then they try to spread across all the other

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:28.100
domain and across all the other stake holdings. So here,

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.480
what I will do, first of all, I'll try to organize a

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.880
training. I'll try to give them a demo. I'll try to give

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:37.540
them a clear idea that, okay, this is what we have done. Now

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:40.960
you guys can go and you guys can try to identify that, uh,

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.780
what can be, what can be done in your department with

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:45.980
respect to your clients. With respect to the product that

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:49.360
you are building with respect to the services that you are

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:54.160
trying to, uh, deliver. Now once this part is done, right,

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.820
once this part will be done because you have to go on a

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:59.360
scale and you can't jump into every project as a, as a

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:03.380
manager, right? Uh, or maybe as a director. So basically you

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:06.160
can't be a part of like a thousands of project. You can't go

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:09.380
and say that, that, okay, I'm a Superman and then I can, uh,

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.640
handle all the projects on all the clients altogether. No,

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:17.660
not going to work. Right? So I have to build people first in

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:20.840
a company and I think this should be the answer that you

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:24.080
should give that you always believe in a people. So you

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:27.000
always follow a people first approach and you just go

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.600
outside, go out and then build a people based on your

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.200
experiences, based on your team experiences and obviously

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.820
based on their experiences, right? So you build a team, you

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:39.760
train the team, you transform the entire team across a

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.540
different, different COEs, center of excellence or like a

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:47.120
departments. And then you ask them to identify the problem

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:50.000
in their department, in their domain, maybe in their

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.060
product, maybe the services that they're trying to deliver.

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:56.300
And then once they will come up with the plan, right, we'll

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.160
discuss with the board and we try to go ahead with the

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.380
approval or maybe a disapproval or maybe with the

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:05.420
enhancement. So this is how I used to manage a multiple

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:11.460
stake holder on a COE label right now there can be a

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:15.020
multiple stakeholder. Okay. So even from a client side. So

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:17.780
again, it's just one of the example on a COE label as we are

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:21.760
talking about building a new department from this side, from

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.460
question number 131 itself. So I'm just trying to give you

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:27.000
an answer with respect to that. Again when we talk about a

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.400
multiple stakeholder, so there can be a multiple stakeholder

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:32.940
even in a single project, right, there can be a multiple

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:36.560
stakeholder even across a service region or maybe across

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:40.920
different countries, simple, but yeah, from this

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:44.540
perspective, from building a new excellence. This is how I

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:47.160
will do train, transform, believe on the people and then

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.860
just forward the entire work that you have done as an

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:54.560
experience to other people and let them do their job and

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:58.020
they will just try to give you a reports and yeah, you have

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.760
to present that report to your seniors. That's it. This is

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:04.580
what we do. Now, what are the consideration for gen AI

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:09.260
talent acquisition? A very important part, right, a very,

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.700
very important part, I would say, because at the end of the

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.580
day, you are building a company. You are building a team and

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:17.860
the only thing which matters is the people. If you don't

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.480
have a right people at right time in right place in right

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:24.380
project, obviously projects are going to fail and you must

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:28.080
be a part of many companies, right, or maybe it's your first

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:31.180
company and as you will progress in a life, you will see

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:35.420
that that many projects fails actually in a big, big

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.720
companies as well. Even I have seen many projects, right,

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:41.240
there was a very interesting like things which I have seen

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:44.540
in my life. Yeah. When I was a part of Deloitte, so

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:48.400
basically we have received a project from a Daimler. So

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.000
Daimler Japan, basically Mercedes Benz, Mercedes Benz

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.140
parents companies, basically Daimler, right, Daimler Japan.

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:57.300
So basically what happened is back then, I think in 2016,

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:03.900
2017 that that project went to Deloitte Germany, right? So

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:07.020
we have a Deloitte Germany, we have a Deloitte USI, we have

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:11.220
a Deloitte India. I was a part of Deloitte USI and I was

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:13.640
working in that company. You know, different, different

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:17.620
projects, but out of sudden what happened is that, that we

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:21.800
have received a new project from Daimler Japan and the story

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:25.600
behind that project was that that we were not the very first

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:29.040
one who was supposed to implement that project. So people

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.460
were trying to implement even from a Deloitte itself, but

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:34.220
different division, right? Deloitte Germany was trying to

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:37.820
implement that project since a very, very long time. But

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:41.060
yeah, they have burnt a lot of money, time, everything and

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:43.400
they were not able to deliver that project. It was a supply

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:46.120
chain project, a big one, a very, very big one. And we all

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:49.700
know that, that for any automobile industry or maybe like a

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:54.200
supply chain industry basically, how crucial these kinds of

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.560
projects are. So they have failed it and then we have

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.000
received that project and then in a record time because we

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.660
had a pressure, we had a lot of pressure when we have

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:06.380
received because that project has already failed. So we have

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:09.320
given our day and night, we were like eight to 10 people

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:12.580
only in that project, right? We have given day and night and

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:15.840
then we have like delivered that project. So somewhere,

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:21.720
right, somewhere when we went into a deep that why that

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:26.140
project has failed in a Germany, like a Germany division of

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:29.240
Deloitte, the simple reason was a correct people mapping,

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:32.120
right? If you don't have a correct people at a correct place

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.740
in a correct project at the correct time, obviously your

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.620
projects are going to fail because at the end of the day,

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.740
robots are not going to do a project. It's a people. It's a

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:41.920
person who is going to do a project and you must have

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.660
experienced a similar kind of things even in your life if

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:47.240
you're a senior or maybe if you're on a mid-senior level. So

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:51.400
we all see this kind of a failure across our industry. It's

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:55.600
nothing new, right? It's nothing new. But if I'm a senior,

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:58.580
if I'm on a manager label, so obviously I have to follow an

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:02.580
approach where I will end up mitigating things as much as I

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:06.080
can, right? Maybe not a hundred percent, but yeah, maybe

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.920
like a 90% I think that will be a win-win situation. And all

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:13.260
of these depends upon the correct people. If I have a

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:16.160
correct people in my team, obviously I'm going to win,

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:20.600
right? So when I'm going to build a generative AI team, so

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:24.900
it's not like I will just hire a guy personally if you're

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:26.940
going to ask me, right? That if I have to build a generative

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:30.380
AI team, so personally I will not just go and hire a guy so

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:34.060
who understand just a generative AI or maybe who has used

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:37.560
some tool, maybe Langchain, Langraph or any kind of a tool.

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.620
No. Yeah. That kind of a person will be a part of my team.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:44.280
That's completely fine. But along with that, I'll try to

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:48.300
even onboard some of the data scientists who is having a

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:51.320
core understanding and who's having a very strong

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:55.080
understanding about our core philosophies. I'll even try to

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:59.020
like onboard a guy in my team who understands our data

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:03.280
because a big data guy basically, right? A big data guy. So

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.920
who can, who can build a system and robust system for me?

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:10.500
So. So the entire game is all about the data, right? I'll

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:13.380
try to even onboard a guy. So who understands our

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:16.580
operational ops part, right? Maybe you can say like a dev

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:21.120
ops, right? Eventually ML ops or LLM ops. So again, all of

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.520
these ops are coming from the core part, which is a dev ops.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:26.820
So I'll try to hire that kind of a person as well in my

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:31.140
team. Basically I'll try to hire a product manager who has

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:34.080
worked in at least two to three projects and that too in a

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:37.280
diversified manner, not just in one single similar kind of a

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:42.160
project. So this is how I am going to build my team. So

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.940
whenever you are going to give an answer that how you are

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:47.960
going to do a talent acquisition for maybe this particular

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:50.800
unit, I'll never say that, that, okay, I'll go and pick a

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.900
one junior generative guy, one lead generative guy, one

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:56.580
manager generative guy, all guy will be in generative and no

00:33:56.580 --> 00:34:02.020
diversity matters a lot inside a team. Their experience

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:05.740
matters a lot at the end of the day, just a technology if

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:08.380
you have a good people. So even big data guy will end up

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:10.680
implementing your generative AI application, not a big deal

00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:15.860
at all. I've seen that, right? That happens. But yeah, so if

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:18.900
you are going to create a diverse team from a day zero

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:22.840
itself, there will be a balance inside a team and you will

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:26.300
be in a position to find out a solution easily because if

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.420
you just have a generative AI guy, they will just think in a

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:32.920
linear direction, not in a diversified direction. So I

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:35.820
always prefer a kind of a person in my team. Generally. When

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:38.520
I build a team, even in my company, this one, previous one,

00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:41.160
previous to previous one or previous to previous to previous

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:45.140
one. So when I, I have built a team, so I have always went

00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:48.960
for a diversified approach, not with the singular approach.

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:52.720
And I believe this is what we all are supposed to do. Is it

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:55.720
fine if you want in a chat? Yes, no, don't know anything.

00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:00.540
Yeah. All these things are like just a managerial round

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.160
means you just have to talk about the story.

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:09.840
Yeah. Okay. Only one person. There are so many people I can

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:12.320
see in a, like, uh, they have joined me. I don't know

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:16.000
whether they are celebrating for Steve festival and they're

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.040
not replying in a chat or maybe they are sleeping. So Jenny,

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:27.300
I ML and DL also important as, uh, the sigh, I'm not able to

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:32.140
get the last word. Uh, submit, of

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:32.880
course. Yes. Okay.

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:40.120
Hmm. How do you build, uh, build and lead a generative team?

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:43.820
I think I have already given an answer here itself. What is

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:46.300
the approach of your DDI team development and training? I

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:48.940
have already given an answer for that as well. How do you

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:53.660
manage in a vendor, uh, relations? Okay. So, uh, basically

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:59.080
by, you know, um, uh, giving them a good product, uh, by,

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.760
uh, by black, putting them in some, uh, win-win kind of a

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:05.500
situation. So where, uh, even, uh, they will be able to

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:08.200
enjoy us. Miss. They will be able to enjoy the whole

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.480
partnership. So basically if, if I'm able to save someone's

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:16.340
time or maybe a money or, uh, uh, maybe they are like a user

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:19.540
experience. If I'm going to make better, obviously I'm going

00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:24.140
to like, uh, when, and that vendor will be with me for a

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:27.660
very, very long time. And whenever guys, whenever you are

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:30.000
giving an answer, right. Always try to talk about the story

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.460
that, okay, how you have done in one of the cases. Yeah. Uh,

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:38.680
that, that will like, uh. Theoretically anyone can say, and

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.220
anyone can talk about the sugar-coated words. That's okay.

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:45.160
But, uh, these kinds of questions you should always answer

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.080
and it's a managerial round question, right? So you should

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:50.740
always answer with respect to your past experience that what

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:54.120
you have done so that people will be able to trust you in an

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.040
interview that, okay, this is not a guy who just talk about

00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.200
something in theory. This is a guy who has done something in

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:04.640
their past and, uh, yeah, like, uh, same thing again, if you

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:08.140
have done that. Yeah. You will be doing it once again, but

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:10.500
again, no one is going to cross check that whether you have

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:13.100
done that or not. So you are supposed to be a very, very

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:17.980
good storyteller in this kind of a questions. So that's a,

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:25.420
that's a whole thing. Yeah. Okay. And now, uh, what are the

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:29.760
consideration for gen AI partnership strategies? Okay. So

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:33.440
when we talk about a partnership, right. Uh, it depends upon

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:37.160
many things. Uh, you must have seen, uh, recent partnership

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:40.060
with respect to a multiple companies. For example, uh,

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:42.980
reliance has done partnership with open AI or maybe with a

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:46.680
Google Nvidia has done a partnership with maybe a open AI

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:51.320
for, uh, even like a open AI has done partnership with the

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:54.860
article cloud, $300 billion of a deal. So you will be able

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:59.040
to see a lot of partnership among big companies and even

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:02.680
among a small companies. Even we do a partnership. We do a

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.500
lot of like a partnership. We do a partnership with respect

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:06.680
to our different, different companies because it's not like

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:10.000
when I'm building a company, so I will end up building a

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.300
solution, all the solution by myself. No, it will take time,

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:17.260
right? Uh, to build any kind of a solution. So obviously to

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:21.400
run my company, I need a lot of plugins inside my company

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:25.660
and obviously I will just go ahead with the, uh, like a lot

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:29.920
of like a partnership. So when people are going to ask you a

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.440
question that when you do a partnership, so what are all

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:36.320
things? What are your partners? Right? The very first, uh,

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:39.940
things which I generally look into my partners is a ethical

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:43.280
alignment because there are many people, right, who will,

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:46.440
there are many, not people I will say, but a company who

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:49.800
will never hesitate to, you know, go unethical in terms of,

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:53.060
uh, security in terms of our compliances in terms of our

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:56.420
transactions, uh, they, they can, they can go ahead and

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:58.860
maybe they have, they have done that hundreds of times and

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:01.980
they will never hesitate to do that. But, uh, as a, as a

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.460
comp, as a, as a stakeholder. So, uh, so, so, so, so, so,

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:03.760
so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so. So

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:07.300
obviously it's my responsibility to protect my company or to

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:11.220
protect my division from those kind of, uh, unethical

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:14.860
alignments. So obviously I'll try to evaluate my partners on

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:17.800
a very first day based on the ethics. It's completely fine

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.420
because we have, we have to go for a very, very long, uh,

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:24.200
like a run, maybe for a, like a five year of partnership or

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:26.260
three year of partnership or a year of partnership we are,

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.960
we are planning to explore. So ethical alignment is

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:32.340
something that always comes into a first place. That's the

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:36.440
first part. Second, basically, uh, data security and IP

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.960
ownership. And here you will be able to see a lot of fights,

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:42.940
right? Even company tried to file a lawsuit. So when you are

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:45.920
trying to do a partnership, so with collaboration, so

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:48.080
obviously maybe you will build something, you will try to

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.980
develop something, you will try to innovate something. So

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:55.120
there should be a very, very like a, you know, a strong line

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:59.480
you should draw in terms of a intellectual property or IP

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:03.640
ownership. Because that creates a lot of pain. In a later

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.720
stage for a company, and believe me, from my experience, I'm

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:08.440
telling you, and if you will just go and read out the

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:11.800
stories of other partners, if you will be able to find out

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:15.960
the exact same thing, right? That with our collaboration, we

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:18.940
have built something, we have developed something. And then

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:21.560
other people will come and then maybe after two years, after

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:23.600
three years, once management had changed, our person has

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:26.600
replaced and they will start claiming that that, okay, fine.

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:30.260
This was my IP. So why, why you have claimed it, right? Why

00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:32.120
you are using it? If you're using it, you have to pay me for

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:35.580
that. And again, it creates a lot of long term legal battle

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:40.720
plus it creates a lot of monetary pressure on any clients

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:44.720
and companies. And again, it like creates a lot of risk even

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:48.840
on your brand name, basically. So ethical alignment is one

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:52.160
thing, data security and intellectual property ownership. So

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:55.260
I will try to like, you know, draft each and everything in

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:58.760
my contract, not I. So in every company, you will be able to

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:02.860
find out a strong legal team, a corporate legal team. So who

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:05.900
take care of the compliances and who knows each and every

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:09.220
policy of the company as well as they will try to explore

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:12.580
the policies of other partners as well, a partner with whom

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:15.640
you are doing the collaboration. And once your legal team is

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:18.880
going to give a sign off, once you will end up taking enough

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:22.660
consultation with everyone, then I believe you should go

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:24.880
ahead with the partnership and service terms and agreement

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:29.360
again, right? Because let's suppose if, if I'm going with

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:33.920
some company, so who is providing me a GPU? Right? GPU. So

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:37.380
maybe we have done a partnership for like a two year, right?

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:41.680
But in my service terms and my service agreements, so I have

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:45.140
not defined that what will happen to my data after two year,

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:48.960
right? Or what would will happen like to our data even

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:51.560
between two years. So if I would like to like take out all

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.000
the data, if I would like to like wipe out all the data from

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.480
all the reasons of their hosting, are they going to allow

00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:01.520
how they are managing and maintaining this data transfer

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.260
from one place? This is rather busy because it's their

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:06.500
machine, right? Their system. So even if they say, so they

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:08.920
are supposed to be very, very transparent, right?

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.140
Transparent in terms of our processes, in terms of our

00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:15.320
policies. So I have to draft each and everything into my

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:17.700
service agreement that what will happen during this tenure,

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:20.540
what will happen after this tenure, what will happen is this

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:23.940
kind of edge cases which will come into a picture. And then

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:27.440
only you are supposed to design the partnership strategies.

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:30.580
So ethics, compliances, data security, IP ownership.

00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:35.760
Partnership and your like co-innovation potential. So based

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:39.280
on that, you should frame the entire partnership strategies.

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:44.320
Then next question says that how do you handle generative AI

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:50.800
project failure and recovery? Okay. So again, failure and

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:54.340
recovery, most time you will say that if project has failed,

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:59.140
it has failed. So like there are very few people, few

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:04.940
projects. So who gets recovered by the way. But yeah, so you

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:09.040
can, you can say that, that in my entire like a lifetime. So

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:12.460
I have handled multiple projects, but I have never seen a

00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:16.080
failure. So maybe in that, that way you can try to give an

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:20.500
answer that yes, there is a very high possibility that any

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:24.660
project is going to fail. But if we are going to do a proper

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:27.900
planning, if we are going to do a proper budgeting, if we

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:30.660
are going to align a proper plan. Then number of people and

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:35.300
the stakeholders in between and if we are able to see that

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:38.560
what is going to happen tomorrow and even try to mitigate

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:42.780
all those things beforehand, maybe we can try to mitigate

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:45.640
those failures and you can try to give an example. For

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.980
example, in my case I was talking about the Deloitte

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:52.800
project, right, which has failed in Germany. So if we have,

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:55.400
we have started that project from the scratch. Right. But

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.700
first of all, we have investigated into the story. That

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:02.700
what? that project has failed, right, same company, so

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:07.880
Deloitte, but division was different, USI versus Germany, so

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:11.340
why that project has failed there and if that project has

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:15.140
failed over there, then what we are not supposed to do,

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:18.080
right, what we are not supposed to do, so sometime we can

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:21.220
learn from the other failures, this is what everyone says,

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:24.980
right, and this is what we did, that what was the problem

00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:27.560
over there, right, so maybe there was a problem from the

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:30.340
customer side, from a functional side, from a technical

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:34.500
side, from a delivery side, right, and then we have

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:39.580
mitigated all of those things on a day zero itself, so maybe

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:43.060
you can say this kind of a story, that instead of getting,

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:47.300
going for a failure, so maybe we can try to learn first that

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:51.180
where in all places or it is called as risk management,

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:54.420
right, so every company does that, right, every company does

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:57.300
that, so risk calculation or risk management. And then like

00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:00.660
we can try to mitigate those kind of a situation. I think

00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:03.100
that's the next question, what is your approach for Gen AI

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:08.040
risk management? So nothing related specific to like a Gen

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:11.500
AI risk management, risk will be involved in every project,

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:16.400
right, if I will talk about a Gen AI, right, especially in

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:21.100
terms of a Gen AI, that where my Gen AI project can fail on

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:24.220
a technical label specifically, not on a people label, not

00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:28.220
on a process label. So obviously. I can create a project, I

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:30.520
can, I can deliver the project, but there is a possibility

00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:34.100
that my project will hallucinate, yeah, means it will not be

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:37.220
able to give the answer or like output, which was expected,

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:42.000
maybe I have not implemented a guardrails, right, I have not

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.060
mitigated all those risks, basically over there, maybe I

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:50.220
have not implemented a core like a monitoring technique over

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:53.960
there, maybe I have not built that project for a scale,

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:58.520
right, I have just like a, you know. Under estimated or over

00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:02.720
estimated something, so these are the technical failure that

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.800
you will end up getting and I think in terms of technical

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:09.440
failure, if you are experienced person, you must be aware

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:12.680
about it beforehand, right, you must be aware about it. So

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:15.080
these are the things, these are something that we try to

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:20.260
plan beforehand itself. In terms of operational risk, right,

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:22.540
because there can be a operational risk as well, operational

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:27.440
risk wise, a cost, right, a cost. Maybe client has given me

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:34.500
a budget of maybe 500k dollar, right, and I have ended

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:38.740
burning maybe 800k dollar, which is huge and as compared to

00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:42.020
500k dollar, it's a huge one, right. So obviously my client

00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:45.260
will not be happy for that, right, because money is

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:51.000
something which matters in top by the way. So cost overrun

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.520
can be one thing. Maybe I will end up, another risk factor.

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.560
Another risk factor. So this part is a compliances risk,

00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:02.740
right, a data breach, privacy, biasness into a data. So all

00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:07.020
of this risk we try to calculate beforehand. We try to draft

00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:11.180
a proper like a documentation for that and then when we try

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:14.360
to hand over the project or even during building this

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:18.480
project, we will try to keep a check on each and everything

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.520
because this is what you will do, right. This is how you

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:23.560
will build a trust with the client or maybe you will try to

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:27.220
build a trust with your team. Because as a director, as a

00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:30.040
manager, you will not be writing a code. Then what you will

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:34.140
be doing, 9 to 5, right, and as a manager, it's not 9 to 5,

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:38.120
it's like 12 hour, 13 hour, 14 hour a day. So you will do

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:40.820
something, right. So this will be your task. This will be

00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:44.600
your job that you will keep on doing it to make sure that

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:47.640
whatever you are delivering, whatever you are building, it's

00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:51.260
robust, it's risk free, it's compliance free. Basically

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:54.520
there is no technical one. Basically there is no technical

00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:57.100
one. So you will just deliver. My customer should say wow,

00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:00.860
right, so that I will be able to gain a trust of the market

00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:05.020
plus I will be able to get revenue out of it plus I should

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:10.040
not give a cost overburden. Yeah, we do that. We do that as

00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:13.380
well. So we do that in terms of like developing a new

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:16.260
feature. So we just deliver something and then we say to our

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:19.500
customer that okay, so can we add this feature as well,

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:22.880
right, and if my customer was happy, already a happy

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:26.580
customer, so a client. So in that case obviously like they

00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:29.340
are going to say yes, they will not say no, right. So this

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:31.500
is how we keep on increasing our budget of the project.

00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:34.300
Everyone does that. Every manager, every delivery manager

00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:36.540
does the same thing because at the end of the day they have

00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:40.500
to bring more and more businesses, right. But yeah, by

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:44.040
making my clients happy or by building a good product, not

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:49.120
like a substandard one. Then okay.

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:54.060
Risk management is done. How do you manage generic risk

00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:58.140
management? So basically

00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:02.560
GDPR is something that we try to implement or HIPAA or maybe

00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:06.840
any AI act which has been created by a particular country,

00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:09.920
right, because nowadays everyone is trying to create some

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:13.580
sort of a law, some sort of a rule across AI or not just

00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:16.620
across AI, across a data sharing, across a technology,

00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:20.560
right, because it's a quite new thing for many countries. In

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:23.060
many countries still you will not be able to find out any

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:26.500
kind of a law. In terms of even a data privacy and security.

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:31.000
So there are very few country, right, so who have actually

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.840
implemented it and who actually monitors it, right, who

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:39.240
actually monitors it. If I will talk about maybe India, so

00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:44.360
there are some rules, there are some law on paper but I

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:48.180
don't know how implementation happens because I don't know

00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:51.520
like when I go to Google and when I search something where

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:56.560
my data goes, right. And who is using it and I think when I

00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:01.340
go online, right, even when I do a WhatsApp chat or maybe a

00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:06.600
Telegram chat, so I have a firm belief that my data is

00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:10.260
universal. So anyone and everyone is having my data access.

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:13.320
This is what I believe in general because I am not aware

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:17.460
about the actual law and its implementation. And likewise

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:20.020
there are many other countries, right, so there are very few

00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:22.900
countries who have like, you know, created a very strict

00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:24.780
law. There are very strict guidelines and law and they

00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:28.800
actually, they have actually implemented it, yeah, they have

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:34.280
actually implemented it. So yeah, in terms of regulatory and

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:37.680
compliances, if you are building some product for some

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:40.460
country, for some community, so obviously you should

00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:43.820
understand their law, their regulations which your legal

00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:46.420
team will help you out obviously. You don't have to do it.

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:50.720
You just have to like, you know, come into a picture and you

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:52.660
just have to ask your team to do the implementation. The

00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:54.720
implementation of that, right, and make sure that this

00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:58.620
happens but yeah, your legal team is going to give you the

00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:03.020
guidelines. Generally we heard about this GDPR and HIPPA and

00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:07.960
all those things or some other AI acts and mostly it will be

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:11.920
around data privacy and maybe like a consent of the user if

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:14.900
you are taking a data, right, or like some sort of

00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:18.160
explanation in terms of you are using their data set. So you

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:21.120
can say that okay, I connect with my legal team and they

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:24.480
advises me, they try to investigate, they advises me with

00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:27.200
respect to all the compliances. You should not say that I go

00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:30.500
and I read out all those like laws and everything, right. No

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:33.280
one does that. That's the reason we have a legal team. They

00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:36.620
understand legality better than you. So you can say that

00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:39.040
okay, fine, so we have advisory team, we have a legal team

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:42.960
and who does this kind of things for me and yeah, I just,

00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:45.720
whatever like points they used to like give it to me with

00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:47.720
respect to my client or maybe with respect to the reason,

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:52.620
just I have to enforce those things. Okay. So this is how I

00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:55.340
do it across entire product line. This is what I do and this

00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:59.320
is how I try to maintain the compliance and regulatory

00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:03.600
requirements. Now next question says that what are the

00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:06.860
consideration for gen AI intellectual property, IP

00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:12.240
basically, right. So generally what happens is that many

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:15.260
company try to do a lot of research, right. Even in India,

00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:17.700
even outside you will be able to find out that many company

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:20.740
are doing a research. They try to even publish a paper,

00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:23.820
right, a research paper. Okay. And they try to build some

00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:27.520
sort of a prototyping and they go for a patent. So this is

00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:30.040
what happens. There is a possibility that you have hired

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:32.620
some sort of a vendor and they are doing some sort of a

00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:35.740
research. They have like found out some breakthrough, right.

00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:45.740
And so to protect anything, the very first step that we all

00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:49.180
used to take is bind under the agreement when you are

00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:52.720
onboarding them. That as long as. And as far as you are a

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:57.080
part of my company, your heart, soul, your time, everything

00:52:57.080 --> 00:53:00.860
is mine. So whatever you are doing during this tenure,

00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:04.500
right, a productive or unproductive, this is what you will

00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:06.620
be able to see in an employer agreement. So I don't know

00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:09.840
whether you have read out some employment agreement or not,

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:12.980
but just go and check the last employment agreement and

00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:15.540
terms and condition that you have received. Or maybe it must

00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:18.440
be of level in your company's portal, right. Just upload it

00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:30.380
in a chat GPTs. Okay. I think,

00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:32.000
maybe this is really important. So let me just leave that.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:37.720
So, you will be able to like, consider this as more of a

00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:43.160
strategy, but this is how the company could be designed. You

00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:48.180
see, I mean, the company is going to be able to give you a

00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:48.860
very good result, you know, a positive result, but you don't

00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:48.860
have to do the best you can, you know, you can So you are

00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:49.300
just going to be. It is not a time to be, say you are going

00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:51.000
to work for Amazon. You are going to be working for Amazon.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:51.560
You are not going to be going on a business that I can get

00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:51.560
out and make money on. You can just do the rest of your

00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:54.740
work. So the very first part is agreement right because

00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:58.420
whenever there will be a conflict you will not go and fight

00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:02.080
right. So we are not a wrestler. So obviously you will go

00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:05.480
ahead with the legal approach or even employees or vendors

00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:08.860
will go ahead with the legal approach and in terms of a

00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:12.520
legal approach you need a proof of that right. So unless you

00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:15.020
don't have a proof or you don't have some signed agreement

00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:19.160
you can't enforce anyone. So if some person has developed

00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:22.520
some IPs and if they are claiming that that it's mine it's

00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:25.520
not yours right or maybe a patent it's mine it's not yours

00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:28.900
unless and until you have not binded that person beforehand

00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:32.300
under the agreement you will not be able to claim it and

00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:36.180
many many such kind of you know legal suits you will be able

00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:39.280
to find out across a world. Again that is very much common

00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:42.680
pretty much common right. So you have to fill the gap you

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:46.900
have to basically like you know bind that particular person

00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:50.240
under the agreement. So that if anyone is developing and

00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:53.100
delivering anything because at the end of the day you as a

00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:55.460
manager you as a director you have to protect the right of

00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:58.620
the company in the very first place right. That's a that's a

00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:02.380
reason so company is going to hire you right not to do a

00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:05.600
charity but to protect our company's interest at the end of

00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:08.220
the day. Yeah sounds sometimes harsh but that's a reality

00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:12.880
right. That's the reason company is paying you. So this is

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:16.200
what you should do by the way and this is how you should

00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:18.660
answer that I'll just try to bind a person under the

00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:22.220
agreement. How do you handle a Gen AI competitive analysis.

00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:28.240
Okay okay so basically let's suppose if I'm working into

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:31.920
some domain maybe into a finance domain I'm building some

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:35.160
product or delivering some services. So obviously I'll keep

00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:38.380
eye on all the competitors. Everyone does that. So generally

00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:42.620
what what I do so we try to keep one analyst or maybe one

00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:46.800
junior person one analyst. So we'll keep on looking over the

00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:51.000
internet. That what someone is building what like someone is

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.620
trying to develop what someone has launched even as an MVP's

00:55:54.620 --> 00:56:00.240
sometime we even try to create a deep connect with other

00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:04.240
companies team members so that you know before they will

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:06.600
launch we'll be having some sort of idea and every company

00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:09.400
does that right. Every company does that so they try to

00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:11.200
create that's the reason so you must be able to see some

00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:16.200
sort of a news even before the product release. So

00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:21.540
basically. If I have to like take a competitive advantage so

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:25.420
keeping eye on a competition is a very very first part

00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:30.160
right. So we always try to like keep an analyst under us and

00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:33.180
they will keep on like you know investigating that what my

00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:36.760
competitors are doing what new competitors are emerging into

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:40.320
a market and then based on their inputs based on their

00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:43.020
research based on their guidelines we try to align our team

00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:46.820
or maybe my entire businesses. Basically. That's what we do.

00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:50.880
What is the approach for Gen AI market research question

00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:55.400
number 146. So approach for generative AI market research.

00:56:55.800 --> 00:57:00.620
So again I will not be like doing everything generative AI

00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:04.320
like or in a AI itself millions of product can be developed

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.960
but I should not go ahead and develop everything. So as a

00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:09.200
manager as a director so obviously I will be aligned towards

00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:14.240
my product line right. So here also what I will do. So I'll

00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:18.720
try to keep a small team. Maybe two three person senior

00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:21.620
junior or maybe the existing team but I'll try to give them

00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:26.500
generally will not we don't hire the new team member. So

00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:31.420
what we do is generally we try to you know utilize existing

00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:34.900
team member itself maybe a lead maybe some developer. So who

00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:38.160
is having some sort of an intention of doing some sort of

00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:42.600
you know market research to understand someone else product

00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:45.160
or maybe my product manager and I'll give them some

00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:47.620
additional tasks. That okay so whatever you're doing do it.

00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:51.380
That's not an issue but along with that right along with

00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:55.920
that. So try to basically do market research in this product

00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:58.880
line. Maybe I'm working for a finance or maybe for a sales.

00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:02.500
So in a sales line. So what is the new product which is

00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:06.420
coming up into a market. What what what is the approach of

00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:09.580
like building their product. What kind of a customer they

00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:13.100
are able to acquire all all of these things you have to read

00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:16.540
out you have to research. And then maybe present it to me on

00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:20.100
a weekly basis or maybe twice in a week. Right. So in this

00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:23.560
way without like you know investing much of time because as

00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:25.480
a director as a manager you will be having so many other

00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:28.520
tasks as well so many other works as well. This will be

00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:32.500
again one of your work. So on a weekly basis on a monthly

00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:35.560
basis you will keep on getting a lot of inputs. They will do

00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:37.880
the hard work. They will do a genuine research and you will

00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:42.120
be having a summary of it. And yeah. So based on that you

00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:45.360
will be able to take your decision. Okay. So this is what we

00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:49.760
all do in terms of doing a market like a research or

00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:53.400
competitor research you can say. Another one is how do you

00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:57.440
manage a customer relationship. Everywhere I have mentioned

00:58:57.440 --> 00:59:00.100
generative AI but yeah so this is something which is like

00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:03.980
not just with generative AI with respect to all the product

00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:09.080
line. Right. So how do I. What was the question. Yeah.

00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:12.720
Customer relationship. So how do I manage a customer

00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:19.060
relationship. So obviously not just by doing a party with my

00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:23.820
customer or like you know bringing my customers for a treat

00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:28.040
or something that happens obviously in terms of like that is

00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:31.060
also part of customer relationship. No doubt about it.

00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:35.200
Right. But at the end of the day everything will go for a

00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:40.000
very long time based on the trust and the actual revenue

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:45.020
based business. If you are able to build. So a good product

00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:49.700
a good team right aligned with a good intention for a very

00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:53.740
very long time. Right. And creating a small impact at a

00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:57.160
time. So this will be my philosophy in terms of building a

00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:01.340
customer relationship. Right. So that will be my philosophy.

01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:03.480
What are the considerations for generative AI product

01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:10.240
management. Okay. Product management. Same thing. I think I

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:12.440
have already answered so many times. How do you handle

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:18.160
generative AI sales and marketing. Okay. So whenever any

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:21.600
anyone is like creating a generative AI like a product. So

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:24.400
the very first part right. Let's suppose if I am a big

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:27.180
company as we are talking about fortune 500 over here. So

01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:30.420
obviously I will be I will not be new for the market. People

01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:32.600
are already aware about it. I have I must be having a

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:36.800
multiple clients across all the different verticals. So if I

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.600
have to like if I have built something something even a

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.200
small. Maybe I have built something. For a sales automation

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:47.220
or maybe for a finance automation what I will do. So I'll

01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:49.940
try to connect with all the business heads. I'll just tell

01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:52.100
them I'll just explain them that okay. So this is the

01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:56.380
product that I built. So maybe we can try to approach to

01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:58.900
your clients. Right. Because every business head will be

01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:02.600
having their own client base. So I can I can approach to all

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:06.140
of them and then we can try to you know give a demo. We'll

01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:08.800
try to take their feedback. We'll try to convince them that

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:12.580
how this can be implemented. Okay. And in this way right

01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:16.580
this will be my very first approach in terms of doing a

01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:20.640
sales and marketing so that word will go to everyone. Right.

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:24.140
It should float to everyone. Right. Everyone should be aware

01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:26.240
about that. We have done something. We have built something

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:31.320
as a company. Once they will be happy then we can try to

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:34.040
take some sort of our testimony some sort of our feedbacks.

01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:38.200
Right. And then I'll go out in terms of finding a new

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:41.380
customer in terms of finding a new client. So. So this is my

01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:45.460
approach in sort for us sales and marketing apart from like

01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:47.840
budget planning team and everything and even sometime.

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:52.020
Right. So sometime events sometime we try to even like on

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:55.520
board some sort of a celebrity and they just do a sales and

01:01:55.520 --> 01:02:00.120
marketing for us. But yeah, my first approach will be reach

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:04.260
out to the existing and then look out for the outer world.

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:08.800
Next, what is the approach for generative AI business

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:09.600
development?

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.560
Same. Identify the problem. The very first question which I

01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:17.860
have answered. So identify the problem in a very first

01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:21.940
place. If I am doing a new business development, build a

01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:26.460
team, right people at a right time in a right place with a

01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:31.140
right budget and then once they will be able to build some

01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:36.920
sort of MVPs or some sort of a product, then go for a scale,

01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:40.660
go for a robust governance and start spreading that product

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:43.780
across our different. Different COEs, different, different

01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:48.400
excellence. So that's my answer guys. So hope it's fine.

01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:52.600
Yeah. All of you are able to get some idea. Mostly it's for

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:56.020
senior people, not for like a junior people on a developer

01:02:56.020 --> 01:03:00.400
label. People are not going to ask you this question. Yeah.

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:04.180
But someday you will become a lead. Someday you will become

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:08.440
a manager and then this these questions will be pretty much

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:09.360
relevant for you.

01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:16.520
Yes. Yes. Fine. Anyone hope people are not sleeping. If you

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:19.580
can like ping me in a chat. Yeah.

01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:28.360
Okay. So 50 questions out of that, I think some 20, 20, 30

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:30.900
questions are technical. Okay. Very few questions are left

01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:31.160
now.

01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:41.170
Okay. Let's start with one 51 now.

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:56.640
Okay. So here, a question says that, that, uh, how, uh, do

01:03:56.640 --> 01:04:00.920
you, uh, implement, uh, advanced prompt engineering? It's a

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:03.260
tech question. Now it's a tech section. A complete section

01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:06.880
is like a tech. So one 50 till one 70, it's a 20 question,

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.180
right? 20 questions set. Okay. And plus, like I said, so I'm

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:14.160
preparing the writeups basically for all of these, for most

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:16.440
of the question I have already prepared with the help of AI,

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:19.360
I'm just trying to read out all of these things so that, you

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:22.340
know, I can, I can try to put my flavor. It should not be

01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:26.140
just an AI. It should even come with the human feedback. So

01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:29.960
I'm just doing it from my side. And, uh, mostly by this

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:33.400
week. Uh, it will be ready from my side because the 200

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:37.960
questions, uh, easy to talk about it. Uh, but yeah, so when

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:40.040
you have to type, so you have to type it, right? So you

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:42.040
should not make grammatical mistake and a spelling mistake

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:45.100
and many more things. And then vetting and all those things

01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:46.900
come into picture. That's the reason it's taking time for

01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:49.860
me. Uh, but yeah, so whatever answer, which I'm giving you

01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:52.700
almost similar kind of answer, you will be able to find out

01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:55.580
even in those lighters, because again, it's coming from my

01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:59.260
site with my flavor, uh, basically with some sort of, uh,

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:05.780
additions over here. Yeah. So, uh, here question says that,

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:09.380
that, uh, how do you implement a advanced prompt engineering

01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:11.960
technique? We all know about prompting, right? Few sort

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:15.860
prompting, or maybe like a zero sort prompting. We all have

01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:20.620
discussed that a lot, right? Uh, basically what we do, so

01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:23.160
whenever we try to talk about the prompting, so obviously we

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:27.700
have to break down our prompts as a correct instruction. So

01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:30.240
whether we are trying to give a user prompt or maybe a

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:31.020
system prompt. So, uh, if you are trying to give a user

01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:35.240
prompt, breaking down things, uh, is pretty much important.

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:39.420
Like how, uh, you should think, what kind of a data format

01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:43.020
that you should generate, what you should not generate, what

01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:45.580
you should like, uh, do it, what should you not do it?

01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:48.740
Everything you should mention inside the prompt, because,

01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:52.860
uh, LMS are nothing but just like your junior, right? And if

01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:55.000
you're a senior and if you're giving an instruction, you

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.600
have to be very clear in terms of giving instruction.

01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:00.720
Because same instruction. Your juniors are going to follow.

01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:03.240
Okay. And, uh, by following that instruction, juniors are

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:06.400
going to deliver something. So this is what happens with

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:08.780
respect to a prompt. Many times we have already discussed

01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:12.440
about it, right? So always try to use a few short, a few

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:16.100
short prompting. I would say, uh, chain of thought, right?

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:20.820
Always try to provide a proper role that you are an

01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:24.420
assistant, you are a scientist, you are a researcher, or

01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:27.840
maybe you are just a student, right? Maybe you are a senior

01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:30.840
grad. So that, you know, your LLM will try to generate a

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:33.840
prompt. So you have to generate it with that capability. So

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:37.420
roles assignment is pretty much important. Breaking down a

01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:40.820
prompt is again, pretty much important. Giving a example,

01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:44.360
maybe one example at a minimum, right? This is something

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:47.460
called as few short prompting. So when you give an example

01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:50.260
that, okay, I'm looking for an answer in this manner, or

01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:52.180
whenever you are generating an answer, generate in this

01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:55.420
manner so that your system will be able to take some sort of

01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:58.360
inspiration out of it. And then it is going to generate some

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:00.820
answers. So this is what we do. Okay.

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:08.220
So this will be the implementation from the problem. Digging

01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:12.580
technique now 152 questions says that, that, uh, what is the

01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:16.540
approach for building a custom language model? Okay. So

01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:20.200
basically if I have to, you know, build a custom language

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:23.960
model, I have to approach one approaches. So take the

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:27.160
transformer architecture and then like, you know, prepare

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:30.980
the dataset and go ahead with the training. I have. already

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:35.320
shown that part as well right but again so you will not end

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:38.480
up generating a very good model because the very first part

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:41.080
is you don't have a world's data you don't have a world's

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:44.360
information maybe you just have a data with respect to your

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:48.500
own domain which is a very like a small data set as compared

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:52.680
to the world's data right to build actually a good model

01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:56.960
second part is that you don't have a compute power right so

01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:01.040
having hundreds of GPUs is not even called as a compute

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:04.440
power in real to train such kind of a model so you have a

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:07.260
very limited compute power you have a very limited budget so

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.660
even one million dollar of budget is not enough for that

01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:13.080
maybe like seven to eight crore Indian currency is not even

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:15.760
enough for building such kind of a model so you need

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:19.880
hundreds of crores or like millions hundred millions kind of

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:23.980
a dollar plus you need a team of the research research

01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:28.120
developer everyone right a data labeler right data labeler

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:31.500
again big team is required for that so if I'm trying to

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:36.200
build or develop my own custom model I'll not follow a more

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:38.980
like building a model from the scratch because I know my

01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:42.240
company can't do it right so what I will do I'll try to

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:46.240
adopt a fine tuning approach all the time right and we I

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:48.760
think we talked about a fine tuning a lot even in previous

01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:52.900
questions right we talked about like a full fine tuning we

01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:53.820
talked about a lot of fine tuning and we talked about fine

01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:54.260
tuning and we talked about a lot of fine tuning we talked

01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:57.500
about a Quora, we talked about a DPO or we talked about a

01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:00.200
reinforcement learning with a human feedback, right. All

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.700
these terms I think we all are aware about, right guys,

01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:10.370
yeah, okay, Jithin is saying even a chat GPT cannot answer

01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:12.690
like the way you asked, thank you sir, thank you for your

01:09:12.690 --> 01:09:17.970
positive feedback and words. So I think, I think, yeah, Asit

01:09:17.970 --> 01:09:22.410
has written a very good, he is very senior to me, I know, so

01:09:22.410 --> 01:09:24.950
he has written a very good article on LinkedIn. I think I

01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:28.490
have already shared that article. Even today he has

01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:31.310
published a very good one, right, but with respect to a fine

01:09:31.310 --> 01:09:33.850
tuning technique, so he has, I remember and even I read that

01:09:33.850 --> 01:09:37.110
one, so he has like articulated a various like a, you know,

01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:41.250
beautiful one, so maybe you can, I think I have already

01:09:41.250 --> 01:09:44.450
shared and even he has shared in a group, so maybe you can

01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:47.070
take out some 2-3 minutes of your time and then you can read

01:09:47.070 --> 01:09:50.510
out. But yeah, even in class I have already discussed about

01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:53.610
it, right, this is like a fine tuning technique. But yeah.

01:09:53.610 --> 01:09:57.130
So yeah, do read his LinkedIn article, it's a very good one.

01:09:57.310 --> 01:10:00.510
You will get a very great idea and knowledge and again a

01:10:00.510 --> 01:10:05.130
kind of a revision, right. Because see, doing something is

01:10:05.130 --> 01:10:08.570
different, but in an interview, right, presence of mind

01:10:08.570 --> 01:10:11.770
matters a lot or you can say presence of mind matters the

01:10:11.770 --> 01:10:15.190
most. It's not like interviewer will ask you a question and

01:10:15.190 --> 01:10:18.710
he will say, okay, let me give 5 minutes of time and then

01:10:18.710 --> 01:10:21.610
I'll answer, I'm just thinking, I'm just processing, no, you

01:10:21.610 --> 01:10:24.830
don't have that much of time, right. It should always comes

01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:28.730
in a conversational way that, okay, two like, you know,

01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:32.550
intellectuals are interviews is all about like conversation

01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:36.330
between two people, right. And again, at the end of the day,

01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:39.330
you will get hired or they will like, they will be able to

01:10:39.330 --> 01:10:42.490
onboard you if they will be able to find some sort of a

01:10:42.490 --> 01:10:45.310
click inside you. If they are able to find out a click in 5

01:10:45.310 --> 01:10:48.390
minutes, believe me, you will be hired. This is how easy

01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:53.410
like interview is, right. Otherwise, it will look tough.

01:10:53.610 --> 01:10:56.790
Believe me, like 45 or like 60 minutes, you will end up

01:10:56.790 --> 01:11:00.350
sweating again and again. And that happens, that happens,

01:11:00.450 --> 01:11:03.010
right, if you're not confident enough. So it's more about,

01:11:03.230 --> 01:11:07.810
you know, interview is more about things on fingertips,

01:11:08.110 --> 01:11:13.550
right. That okay, so even in my like sleep, I can come and I

01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:18.630
can talk about it, just like I'm doing as of now, right. So

01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:21.990
it's and that will come from the multiple iterations, right.

01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:26.650
Not for knowing things but from a multiple iterations. So I

01:11:26.650 --> 01:11:29.750
think, I talked about like a moral building, right. So

01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:34.330
obviously, I will not go ahead with like a scratch moral

01:11:34.330 --> 01:11:37.450
building approach. And people may ask you a question that

01:11:37.450 --> 01:11:40.330
why not a scratch moral building approach. You can simply

01:11:40.330 --> 01:11:43.450
say that, are you going to give me a 100 million dollar? Are

01:11:43.450 --> 01:11:45.730
you going to give me a team of researcher? Are you going to

01:11:45.730 --> 01:11:48.470
give me a team of like a developer? Are you going to give me

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:51.470
a team of like a labelers, data labelers by the way? Are you

01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:54.150
going to give me this data? me a world's data even in your

01:11:54.150 --> 01:11:56.070
domain let's suppose I'm talking about healthcare domain

01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:58.470
right so again in healthcare domain itself maybe your

01:11:58.470 --> 01:12:01.290
company is having data but that is not data is not enough to

01:12:01.290 --> 01:12:04.210
train a good model right so maybe you need a world's data

01:12:04.210 --> 01:12:07.450
and first of all your models to understand a general English

01:12:07.450 --> 01:12:10.610
or maybe French German whatever it is right a general

01:12:10.610 --> 01:12:13.670
conversation your model is supposed to understand if your

01:12:13.670 --> 01:12:16.050
model don't understand your general conversation doesn't

01:12:16.050 --> 01:12:18.270
matter what kind of a specialized like a training you are

01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:21.030
trying to do your model will end up generating some random

01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:24.770
XYZ things right means I will not even say hallucination

01:12:24.770 --> 01:12:29.310
it's like generating some something right so that there

01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:31.230
should be a question that yeah if you are going to provide

01:12:31.230 --> 01:12:35.270
me that I will train a model from scratch if not then I will

01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:38.510
try to follow the fine tuning approach again in fine tuning

01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:40.850
so I will not go ahead with the full fine tuning because

01:12:40.850 --> 01:12:43.650
again that will be a cost less approach for me I will try to

01:12:43.650 --> 01:12:45.750
go ahead with the you know parameterized efficient fine

01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:50.090
tuning RLFH fine tuning. Okay. RLHF yeah reinforcement

01:12:50.090 --> 01:12:54.870
learning human with a human feedback RLHF I always like you

01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:59.850
know interchange these characters in between sometime I will

01:12:59.850 --> 01:13:02.350
go ahead with the DPO so I will go ahead with the LoRa I

01:13:02.350 --> 01:13:05.670
will go ahead with the Cora right so this is this is how

01:13:05.670 --> 01:13:08.190
your answer should be and then if someone is going to ask

01:13:08.190 --> 01:13:10.210
that can you please explain me DPO can you please explain me

01:13:10.210 --> 01:13:13.650
like RLHF how you prepared the data set what you have done

01:13:13.650 --> 01:13:17.010
in your previous one right which platform you have used for

01:13:17.010 --> 01:13:20.570
fine tuning. How many GPUs you have stacked basically how

01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:25.110
much time did it take what was your evaluation mechanism for

01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:28.170
the model that you have produced or the model that you have

01:13:28.170 --> 01:13:32.050
trained right what was the total cost on that then you can

01:13:32.050 --> 01:13:34.990
start breaking it down because after saying this obviously

01:13:34.990 --> 01:13:37.970
it is going to or there is a very high possibility that

01:13:37.970 --> 01:13:41.210
interviewer will start firing a sequence of the question an

01:13:41.210 --> 01:13:43.870
interesting one right that we have already discussed in our

01:13:43.870 --> 01:13:46.190
past so many times right so many times we have already

01:13:46.190 --> 01:13:49.270
discussed about those sequential questions. So this is this

01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:52.650
is how you know you are supposed to basically like answer

01:13:52.650 --> 01:13:58.310
then now next question says that that how do you implement

01:13:58.310 --> 01:14:02.590
an advanced fine tuning strategies same like nothing new

01:14:02.590 --> 01:14:09.010
LoRa Cora Prefet like DPO or ORPO is another term RLHF is

01:14:09.010 --> 01:14:11.870
another term so this is how I will do it right and then I

01:14:11.870 --> 01:14:15.670
will try to like you know so advanced fine tuning strategy

01:14:15.670 --> 01:14:17.390
so strategy wise. So strategy wise I will start from the

01:14:17.390 --> 01:14:19.910
data preparation so whenever I will try to give that answer

01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:22.690
so obviously everything will start with my data preparation

01:14:22.690 --> 01:14:25.830
so what kind of supervised training if I am trying to do or

01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:28.710
maybe unsupervised training I am trying to do then what code

01:14:29.210 --> 01:14:31.990
is the base model which I have considered right base model

01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:34.610
selection is again one of the things so what is the base

01:14:34.610 --> 01:14:36.850
model which I have selected basically because that is

01:14:36.850 --> 01:14:39.910
something that you will fine tune right if you are doing of

01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:42.770
talking about fine tuning so obviously you must be having a

01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:45.290
base model you have selected the base model right and that

01:14:45.290 --> 01:14:46.990
model. Similarly you are trying to do a fine tuning for

01:14:46.990 --> 01:14:53.050
maybe LLM maybe for multitask transformers anything and then

01:14:53.050 --> 01:14:56.470
how much data you have prepared what is the accuracy of your

01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:58.730
data how you have done the labeling part how you have

01:14:58.730 --> 01:15:02.470
maintained the labeling or authenticity of the labeling of

01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:04.750
your data set if you are going out with a supervised one

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:08.890
supervised like a fine tuning so this will be the strategy.

01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:12.470
Then obviously hardware right so how you have decided that

01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:15.270
this much hardware is required then what was the time it

01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:18.250
took. Okay. What was the total cost on that one then how you

01:15:18.250 --> 01:15:22.990
have done the evaluation if your evaluation is like you know

01:15:22.990 --> 01:15:28.350
less than expected one then what you have done all this

01:15:28.350 --> 01:15:33.490
story fall in the same line in terms of planning the fine

01:15:33.490 --> 01:15:37.590
tuning strategies. Now 154 number question says that that

01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:39.950
what are the consideration for building a domain a specific

01:15:39.950 --> 01:15:43.570
model same answer right starting from the data preparation

01:15:43.570 --> 01:15:47.970
then team then a labeling of the data right and define the

01:15:47.970 --> 01:15:50.990
proper model model that I'm going to fine tune and then till

01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:55.010
evaluation how to implement advanced evaluation methodology

01:15:55.010 --> 01:16:00.430
see evaluation always depends upon you know task in my hand.

01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:02.950
So evaluation is not something called as like a thumb rule

01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:06.710
that okay I will just use same because you know evaluation

01:16:06.710 --> 01:16:09.170
strategy but yeah in terms of designing the strategy of

01:16:09.170 --> 01:16:12.010
methodology so there will be a unit test there will be a

01:16:12.010 --> 01:16:14.710
functional test there will be adversarial test. We try to do

01:16:14.710 --> 01:16:17.290
there will be an end to end simulation we try to do with the

01:16:17.290 --> 01:16:20.230
real scenario right again inside that there will be a

01:16:20.230 --> 01:16:24.710
multiple breakdowns and then we like try to like evaluate

01:16:24.710 --> 01:16:29.130
basically any kind of a model. Now what is the approach for

01:16:29.130 --> 01:16:32.750
building an automated evaluation system so depends upon the

01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:36.290
task right then I will try to like build a complete CI CD

01:16:36.290 --> 01:16:41.190
pipeline for that one. So that model will be trained and

01:16:41.190 --> 01:16:44.150
then it will go through my unit test it will go through my

01:16:44.150 --> 01:16:47.150
functional test it will go through my adversarial test it

01:16:47.150 --> 01:16:51.630
will go with my end to end evaluation it will go to go

01:16:51.630 --> 01:16:55.010
through my safety checks by the way right safety checks all

01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:58.890
the like guardrails and then it will try to deploy itself

01:16:58.890 --> 01:17:02.870
and somewhere all of these things you can try to attach

01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:06.070
inside your CI CD pipeline that you are going to create that

01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:11.090
we all do for any kind of a model next is that how do you

01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:14.810
implement advanced monitoring and observability. Okay kind

01:17:14.810 --> 01:17:19.670
of a MLOps part you can say right so basically we try to

01:17:19.670 --> 01:17:24.730
monitor model plus we try to monitor even infrastructure so

01:17:24.730 --> 01:17:28.310
it's basically a post deployment things right not pre

01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:31.090
deployment. Pre deployment is one and post deployment is

01:17:31.090 --> 01:17:34.430
this one or you can say hyper care generally we say hyper

01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:38.430
care in an industrial world that okay now project is in

01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:40.790
hyper care hyper care means we are trying to monitor it we

01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:43.470
are trying to observe it so if my model is going to drift if

01:17:43.470 --> 01:17:47.830
it is hallucinating more all these things we try to do it

01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:51.610
and again like I said it's a part of a ops basically second

01:17:51.610 --> 01:17:57.450
infra right infra so we try to even check that are we not

01:17:57.450 --> 01:18:02.210
like a have you not commenced like a something more than

01:18:02.210 --> 01:18:04.970
required or maybe less than required what is the traffic

01:18:04.970 --> 01:18:07.970
which I am receiving and what is the percentage of

01:18:07.970 --> 01:18:11.070
utilization of my entire infrastructure all of these things

01:18:11.070 --> 01:18:15.930
we try to observe. And then a security so anyone can do a

01:18:15.930 --> 01:18:19.770
DDoS attack maybe any kind of injections or something no one

01:18:19.770 --> 01:18:23.230
should be able to do it so this is something that we try to

01:18:23.230 --> 01:18:25.470
like a implement with respect to monitoring and

01:18:25.470 --> 01:18:29.850
observability and nowadays right nowadays let's talk about

01:18:29.850 --> 01:18:33.490
AWS let's talk about Azure let's talk about GCP everyone

01:18:33.490 --> 01:18:37.730
provides you this so it's not like we do it right we just

01:18:37.730 --> 01:18:41.370
plan it and my ops guy will do it this is the standard

01:18:41.370 --> 01:18:44.990
approach we try to follow not just in a GNI project but in

01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:48.810
every project it's a standard nowadays because we are

01:18:48.810 --> 01:18:51.270
developing software we as a world right are developing

01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:55.290
software since last 35 years especially from 1990s at least

01:18:55.290 --> 01:18:58.550
you can say 1980s 1990s so it's a 35 year 45 year of

01:18:58.550 --> 01:19:02.530
experience industry is having and now we are able to reach

01:19:02.530 --> 01:19:05.430
out to the place so where these things are pretty much

01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:08.450
normal right these things are so I just have to strategize

01:19:08.450 --> 01:19:11.110
it the rest will be done and if you have not strategize it

01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:12.570
because as I said you have to be a senior that would be your

01:19:12.570 --> 01:19:15.950
responsibility then obviously your developer will not do

01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:21.090
right what are the consideration for building a gen AI ML

01:19:21.090 --> 01:19:28.870
ops okay so consideration for building a gen AI ML ops I can

01:19:28.870 --> 01:19:32.710
try to use maybe ML ops kind of a tool for that one I can

01:19:32.710 --> 01:19:35.550
try to like you know maintain a worsening of the model I

01:19:35.550 --> 01:19:37.730
will try to maintain the prompts I will try to maintain the

01:19:37.730 --> 01:19:41.550
data set I will try to automate the evaluation. I'll try to

01:19:41.550 --> 01:19:43.950
maintain the data set. maintain my deployment so maybe CI CD

01:19:43.950 --> 01:19:47.070
based deployment green blue line kind of a deployment I will

01:19:47.070 --> 01:19:51.270
try to choose for how do you implement a advanced security

01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:54.490
measure so technically it's the same question but yeah

01:19:54.490 --> 01:19:57.270
everywhere there is a advance that's the only differences

01:19:57.270 --> 01:20:01.690
you will be able to find out so security measures basically

01:20:01.690 --> 01:20:06.750
first always start with the authentication that user should

01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:09.950
always get a privilege to access a system with their role

01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:12.990
everyone should not be able to access everything so role

01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:15.670
based access is a very first part for any system that we

01:20:15.670 --> 01:20:21.770
build right and then once this is done so whenever someone

01:20:21.770 --> 01:20:25.190
is trying to like you know send a input to your system to

01:20:25.190 --> 01:20:28.950
your server so input sanitization so we try to check that

01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:32.790
whether someone is sending a input which I was expecting or

01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:36.630
someone is trying to inject something with the input because

01:20:36.630 --> 01:20:40.110
input will go into your server right where you have. Your

01:20:40.110 --> 01:20:43.470
actual like you know software up and running or your actual

01:20:43.470 --> 01:20:46.410
code which is up and running so if someone is able to this

01:20:46.410 --> 01:20:49.610
is how injection happens right or DDoS attack happens so

01:20:49.610 --> 01:20:53.890
basically you have to like do a input sanitization from your

01:20:53.890 --> 01:20:56.210
side so you have to write a code for that you have to define

01:20:56.210 --> 01:21:00.250
the process for that one allow list right all of these

01:21:00.250 --> 01:21:03.090
things you have to implement in terms of a advanced security

01:21:03.090 --> 01:21:08.270
measure now next one is what is the approach for building a

01:21:08.270 --> 01:21:13.870
gen AI threat risk. Detection system so basically threat

01:21:13.870 --> 01:21:17.150
detection system is all about you know spotting a jail

01:21:17.150 --> 01:21:22.190
breaks right or maybe a data leaks or maybe a tool abuse now

01:21:22.190 --> 01:21:24.550
what will be the approach for building a gen AI threat

01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:30.250
detection system so here in terms of basically if I am

01:21:30.250 --> 01:21:35.150
building a threat detection system for my system so

01:21:35.150 --> 01:21:37.450
obviously first of all I will try to build maybe some sort

01:21:37.450 --> 01:21:40.610
of anomaly detection system right. Okay. Which will up and

01:21:40.610 --> 01:21:42.750
running for each and every input and each and every

01:21:42.750 --> 01:21:46.050
activities and it will try to pass a log that will be my

01:21:46.050 --> 01:21:49.410
first approach in the age of AI right instead of writing a

01:21:49.410 --> 01:21:52.050
rules so obviously I will try to build maybe a anomalies

01:21:52.050 --> 01:21:55.350
detection system for my security for the inputs for the log

01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:59.430
each and everything. Another thing is to prevent maybe a

01:21:59.430 --> 01:22:02.890
jail break to prevent a data leaks to prevent a tool abuses

01:22:02.890 --> 01:22:07.370
input sanitization is again one of the major part because

01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:09.830
that will be the entry point right. Right. Right. Right.

01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:13.470
Right. Right. Who will try to harm my system so I should

01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:17.090
always like a check recheck and write as many conditions as

01:22:17.090 --> 01:22:20.670
possible on an input sanitization because see I'm talking

01:22:20.670 --> 01:22:24.790
about LLM right and it's basically a generative system right

01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:28.270
it basically a generative system so maybe if I have not

01:22:28.270 --> 01:22:32.270
taught my model that this input or this word right is a

01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:35.930
harmful word my model will use it because for model it's not

01:22:35.930 --> 01:22:39.330
a word internally it's a vector it's basically like a

01:22:39.330 --> 01:22:42.630
numeric. Right. So my model will end up generating. It never

01:22:42.630 --> 01:22:45.710
understands a difference between abusive words, good words

01:22:45.710 --> 01:22:49.210
or bad words. I listen until I'm not going to label or I'm

01:22:49.210 --> 01:22:52.270
not going to tell to my models. Right. And many people can

01:22:52.270 --> 01:22:55.190
take advantage of that. Right. Maybe many people can inject

01:22:55.190 --> 01:22:59.310
some sort of input, which is not which they should not.

01:22:59.450 --> 01:23:02.410
Right. Which they should not and which may exploit the

01:23:02.410 --> 01:23:06.930
outcome of my model. Yeah. So you must have seen a lot of

01:23:06.930 --> 01:23:10.610
cases in last like two, three years that model is

01:23:10.610 --> 01:23:13.790
hallucinating. It is able to even give an answer which it is

01:23:13.790 --> 01:23:18.030
not supposed to. All those things. And we try to basically

01:23:18.030 --> 01:23:21.270
prevent it. So obviously, input sanitization is the very

01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:26.110
first part we'll try to do. Right. Apart from that, so human

01:23:26.110 --> 01:23:30.690
reviews comes into a picture or maybe refusal. So I'll not

01:23:30.690 --> 01:23:33.150
give this answer. So many people, many model, you must have

01:23:33.150 --> 01:23:36.170
seen that it refuses. That, OK, I'll not give this answer.

01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:42.150
Sorry. It's not like it's beyond my capability, by the way,

01:23:42.190 --> 01:23:47.650
or a rate limit. So how many user or how many times you will

01:23:47.650 --> 01:23:52.050
be able to access my system. Right. So that I'll just try to

01:23:52.050 --> 01:23:55.210
decrease your number of trials, basically. So if I'm

01:23:55.210 --> 01:23:57.470
decreasing the number of trials, somehow I'm decreasing the

01:23:57.470 --> 01:24:01.190
probability of injection as well. So this will be the system

01:24:01.190 --> 01:24:05.210
I am going to build if someone is going to. Ask me, how do

01:24:05.210 --> 01:24:09.250
you implement the advanced privacy protection? OK, so

01:24:09.250 --> 01:24:12.370
privacy protection first comes with the law. If there is no

01:24:12.370 --> 01:24:16.790
law, then there is no privacy. Simple. Right. So law. So

01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:20.270
basically, like in whatever reason, I'm going to publish my

01:24:20.270 --> 01:24:25.010
software or I'm going to publish my like models. So I have

01:24:25.010 --> 01:24:27.790
to read out the law where my legal team is going to help me

01:24:27.790 --> 01:24:32.230
out in that way. And then if they say that, OK, fine. So my

01:24:32.230 --> 01:24:34.890
data should be available in this server. I have to build my

01:24:34.890 --> 01:24:38.050
application in that way. If they say that this application

01:24:38.050 --> 01:24:42.230
should not be accessible under the age like who's having age

01:24:42.230 --> 01:24:45.450
less than 18 or 14, by the way, because, yeah, that some

01:24:45.450 --> 01:24:48.030
companies have some countries having that kind of a law as

01:24:48.030 --> 01:24:52.050
well. Dislike protection. So I'll have to implement a

01:24:52.050 --> 01:24:56.250
system. So which will be able to do the checks. Right. All

01:24:56.250 --> 01:25:00.030
these things. So basically, it basically like this technical

01:25:00.030 --> 01:25:04.290
things, we try to derive it from the law. Law, which is

01:25:04.290 --> 01:25:07.850
available in that particular reason. Now, this question is,

01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:10.290
what are the consideration for building a gen AI data

01:25:10.290 --> 01:25:15.410
protection? Yeah. So data protection, again, come from the

01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:18.430
policies. Same same answer. I'll try to give not very

01:25:18.430 --> 01:25:22.570
different. How do you implement advanced bias detection and

01:25:22.570 --> 01:25:28.830
mitigation? OK, so bias means so maybe my biased is biased

01:25:28.830 --> 01:25:32.690
towards a race, maybe some ethics, maybe towards some

01:25:32.690 --> 01:25:36.770
gender. Right. You just like a human being. So there is a

01:25:36.770 --> 01:25:39.530
possibility because model is what a generative model. And

01:25:39.530 --> 01:25:44.290
like I said, so for model, it's actually a vector means it's

01:25:44.290 --> 01:25:47.850
actually a numeric value. So you will it will take the input

01:25:47.850 --> 01:25:51.190
and based on its learning, it will end up generating the

01:25:51.190 --> 01:25:55.910
output. But but but if I'm trying to build a model, so

01:25:55.910 --> 01:25:59.350
obviously it should not be biased towards some gender. It

01:25:59.350 --> 01:26:02.690
should not be biased towards some like a ethnic group or

01:26:02.690 --> 01:26:07.170
somebody. Some sort of race, basically, I have to make sure

01:26:07.170 --> 01:26:11.470
about it. It should not be a toxic just like we as a human

01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:14.950
being. Right. When we get angry. So we start abusing

01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:21.350
someone. We start, you know, you know, saying some some or

01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:24.930
you start using some sort of foul languages. So my models

01:26:24.930 --> 01:26:27.810
would not do it. It doesn't matter how many times you are

01:26:27.810 --> 01:26:31.450
going to ask the same question to your model and to do that,

01:26:31.570 --> 01:26:34.390
obviously, there are human feedback. There are some toxic

01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:37.690
classification which is required even in our output. So when

01:26:37.690 --> 01:26:40.890
model will give the output, there should be some system that

01:26:40.890 --> 01:26:46.630
should do a checks that is this output ratio. Is this output

01:26:46.630 --> 01:26:50.810
like against some ethnics or is this output is toxic? There

01:26:50.810 --> 01:26:53.610
should be a system which check the output and then it should

01:26:53.610 --> 01:26:56.890
show to the user. So we have to build that guardrail and

01:26:56.890 --> 01:26:59.790
that classification as well. And we do that. Right. We do

01:26:59.790 --> 01:27:03.970
that a lot. We try to like, you know. So it's not like model

01:27:03.970 --> 01:27:06.190
will give me output and I'll try to show the output to the

01:27:06.190 --> 01:27:09.370
end user. No model will give the output and then it will

01:27:09.370 --> 01:27:12.410
filter through the system that I have built and then it will

01:27:12.410 --> 01:27:15.450
be shown to the user. So basically it's a double check.

01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:18.350
Right. So this is how I will be building a bias detection.

01:27:18.610 --> 01:27:21.810
So whenever someone is going to ask you a question, I simply

01:27:21.810 --> 01:27:24.270
say that that, OK, I have built the model. I have trained

01:27:24.270 --> 01:27:27.390
the model. I have fine tuned the model along with that.

01:27:27.550 --> 01:27:30.490
Right. So I have built another system. So where model will

01:27:30.490 --> 01:27:34.910
not give an answer directly to my. My end user, right. It

01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:37.430
will go through the system. Obviously, it will end up

01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:42.230
introducing a little bit of latency. Right. But still, I'm

01:27:42.230 --> 01:27:45.670
just trying to make sure because my business is a very

01:27:45.670 --> 01:27:48.150
sensitive business for me. Right. My clients are very

01:27:48.150 --> 01:27:52.210
sensitive. So obviously, I can't like unleash my model after

01:27:52.210 --> 01:27:56.350
doing a fine tuning to the entire world. So I have to keep a

01:27:56.350 --> 01:27:59.490
check on it because eventually it's a model. Right. It's a

01:27:59.490 --> 01:28:04.050
generative model. So, yeah. That will be my approach, by the

01:28:04.050 --> 01:28:08.690
way, attaching a parallel system to check the output. What

01:28:08.690 --> 01:28:11.210
is the approach for building a generative AI fairness

01:28:11.210 --> 01:28:16.570
system? This question. OK. So basically, fairness is nothing

01:28:16.570 --> 01:28:20.390
but governance, you can say. Right. So basically, my

01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:25.870
approach will be enforce the policies, audit the output on a

01:28:25.870 --> 01:28:30.210
regular basis, develop as many gates as possible, as I have

01:28:30.210 --> 01:28:32.990
already told you in a previous answer. Right. So develop a

01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:35.530
gate, so which will keep on filtering input as well as keep

01:28:35.530 --> 01:28:38.930
on filtering the output and then keep on checking, keep on

01:28:38.930 --> 01:28:43.390
like creating a logs that how many times system has actually

01:28:43.390 --> 01:28:49.930
generated something which my gate has blocked it and then

01:28:49.930 --> 01:28:53.030
again, like fine tune the model based on that. So this is

01:28:53.030 --> 01:29:00.690
something you can say. Yeah. Now, how do you implement an

01:29:00.690 --> 01:29:03.510
advanced explanatory? Explain. Explain. Explanability

01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:08.310
technique. So as vast explanatory technique, if I have to

01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:13.070
build it, it's not like basically like model will give me

01:29:13.070 --> 01:29:15.450
some sort of explanation, but that's completely fine. If I

01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:18.870
have to make my model better, my approach will be to

01:29:18.870 --> 01:29:24.410
implement RIG technique over here so that it will be aware

01:29:24.410 --> 01:29:28.130
about the local data set local when I say it simply means

01:29:28.130 --> 01:29:31.350
that the data related to a business or particular domain in

01:29:31.350 --> 01:29:33.150
which you are working and for which you are building RIG.

01:29:35.050 --> 01:29:38.470
And from there, model will be able to get a advanced

01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:41.970
explainability. Apart from that, this is one part that we

01:29:41.970 --> 01:29:46.790
should always do. And we do that. Apart from that, so give a

01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:49.990
search capability. Right. So whenever you are building a

01:29:49.990 --> 01:29:52.970
system, so give a real time search capability because we are

01:29:52.970 --> 01:29:55.930
living in a world where every day we are able to see a new

01:29:55.930 --> 01:30:00.010
information, new advancement. Right. And so maybe that you

01:30:00.010 --> 01:30:02.550
have not captured into your document. So you're even RIG

01:30:02.550 --> 01:30:06.230
will not be. Able to return. Right. So try to attach a

01:30:06.230 --> 01:30:08.890
search capability around it, a real time search capability

01:30:08.890 --> 01:30:12.170
in terms of giving an output. So RIG plus search capability

01:30:12.170 --> 01:30:16.710
plus LLM capability. Right. Plus, whenever you are doing a

01:30:16.710 --> 01:30:20.190
prompting. So always try to go ahead with the example and

01:30:20.190 --> 01:30:25.490
maybe try to, you know, don't try to cap the outcome like

01:30:25.490 --> 01:30:29.410
tokens. Maybe try to give as much as possible so that it

01:30:29.410 --> 01:30:32.710
will give a lot of examples, a lot of like interpretation. A

01:30:32.710 --> 01:30:35.610
lot of. You know, observation, it will try to give you and

01:30:35.610 --> 01:30:38.530
that you will be able to see as a final outcome. And that is

01:30:38.530 --> 01:30:41.910
something which I will be doing in terms of advanced

01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:47.430
explainability technique in terms of a model outcome. Now,

01:30:47.550 --> 01:30:50.290
next question says that that what what are the consideration

01:30:50.290 --> 01:30:55.150
for building a generative AI interoperability? OK, so

01:30:55.150 --> 01:31:00.550
interpretability is basically like interpreting basically

01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:04.750
some sort of answer with respect to. Some sort of a specific

01:31:04.750 --> 01:31:09.030
context, right. A specific context. So obviously for that, I

01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:11.890
will be doing a tool calling. Right. So tool calling for

01:31:11.890 --> 01:31:15.750
like doing a specialized basically like a task to do the

01:31:15.750 --> 01:31:19.350
interpretation. For example, maybe email access tool I can

01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:21.790
try to give Slack access tool I can try to give a Jira

01:31:21.790 --> 01:31:25.250
access tool I can try to give so that it will be able to,

01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:28.370
you know, access those tools and it will be more context

01:31:28.370 --> 01:31:32.270
specific in a real time. And then it will be able to fetch a

01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:34.510
data. And take some sort of action. So technically, I'm

01:31:34.510 --> 01:31:38.090
talking about the agents over here. Right. Agents over here.

01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:42.670
How do you implement an advanced human AI collaboration? So

01:31:42.670 --> 01:31:46.690
basically, in terms of like building this one, we'll go

01:31:46.690 --> 01:31:48.970
ahead with in terms of training, we'll go ahead with RLHF

01:31:48.970 --> 01:31:51.750
DPO kind of approach. What is the approach for building a

01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:54.690
human in loop system? Same. How do you implement an advanced

01:31:54.690 --> 01:32:01.170
agent architecture? OK. So framework wise, you can say maybe

01:32:01.170 --> 01:32:04.030
you can just choose one. One of the framework yesterday I

01:32:04.030 --> 01:32:06.230
talked about and I don't know whether you have attended that

01:32:06.230 --> 01:32:08.690
class or not. Yesterday and day before yesterday, two days,

01:32:08.770 --> 01:32:11.850
we had a very good discussion with respect to anything. So

01:32:11.850 --> 01:32:15.410
yesterday when Dhruv was saying showing the example, so he

01:32:15.410 --> 01:32:18.710
has shown a multi agent system as well, where we have like a

01:32:18.710 --> 01:32:21.750
sequence of agents and in our upcoming classes as well. So

01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:25.450
we are going to see a sequence of the agents. Plus, we have

01:32:25.450 --> 01:32:29.290
also created a multi agent in a crew AI multi agent into a

01:32:29.290 --> 01:32:34.730
land graph, multi agent into a land chain. So here agent

01:32:34.730 --> 01:32:39.330
architecture depends upon the problem in hand. Sometime only

01:32:39.330 --> 01:32:42.770
one agent is required, not more than that. Sometime. So we

01:32:42.770 --> 01:32:45.230
have to break down the problems and then in every step. So

01:32:45.230 --> 01:32:48.670
we have to introduce one or another agents. So that depends

01:32:48.670 --> 01:32:51.530
upon my problem in hand. So just try to take one of the

01:32:51.530 --> 01:32:53.570
example that we have already solved, maybe content

01:32:53.570 --> 01:32:58.030
generation example that we have already taken. Right. And

01:32:58.030 --> 01:33:00.310
you can you can try to talk about that when they're OK. I

01:33:00.310 --> 01:33:03.010
was trying to solve this and. And maybe the resume example,

01:33:03.290 --> 01:33:06.090
right. It is resume example. If you remember, we have we

01:33:06.090 --> 01:33:08.890
have written a code for that. We have implemented that part.

01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:14.410
So even we have, I think, implemented like an invoice

01:33:14.410 --> 01:33:17.470
processor. Right. So where it will take an invoice, it will

01:33:17.470 --> 01:33:21.610
do OCR. So one agent will do OCR. Then the next will try to,

01:33:21.650 --> 01:33:24.490
you know, clean it all, all those things. So again, you can

01:33:24.490 --> 01:33:28.070
you can try to talk about that example and then you can talk

01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:30.450
about the agent that, OK, I have built this product. I have

01:33:30.450 --> 01:33:32.550
used three agents. Four agents. Five agents. One was doing

01:33:32.550 --> 01:33:34.970
this. One was doing this. One was doing this in a sequential

01:33:34.970 --> 01:33:39.290
manner. And yeah. So and it was giving a fantastic output

01:33:39.290 --> 01:33:41.770
for me. Our next question says that that what are the

01:33:41.770 --> 01:33:44.830
considerations for building a gen AI autonomous system?

01:33:46.750 --> 01:33:52.090
Autonomous means it should like keep on working. Right. With

01:33:52.090 --> 01:33:56.550
its own accountability. So first consideration will be a

01:33:56.550 --> 01:33:59.110
framework. Right. A framework which supports it. So

01:33:59.110 --> 01:34:04.630
langchain, langgraph, crew AI. All of these. So all of these

01:34:04.630 --> 01:34:08.630
supports like this kind of things where I can build a gen AI

01:34:08.630 --> 01:34:11.470
automation autonomous system and then talk about some of the

01:34:11.470 --> 01:34:14.570
use cases. So that will be my answer for 170th question.

01:34:16.490 --> 01:34:20.710
Then research innovation. OK. Fine. Let's talk about this.

01:34:21.050 --> 01:34:25.270
So here the question says that that what are the latest

01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:30.990
advances in transformer architecture? OK. So I think we all

01:34:30.990 --> 01:34:33.650
are aware. About the transformer architecture. We all are

01:34:33.650 --> 01:34:36.930
aware about the formula of the transformer with respect to

01:34:36.930 --> 01:34:43.110
key Q and V KQV basically. Right. So and we know that that

01:34:43.110 --> 01:34:48.710
transformer architecture is nothing but it's something which

01:34:48.710 --> 01:34:52.610
can try to focus on a relation of one with others. Right.

01:34:52.750 --> 01:34:55.850
Others other work. And in this way it will try to do it for

01:34:55.850 --> 01:34:59.110
all the other whatever like tokens is available inside my

01:34:59.110 --> 01:35:02.390
data set. This is what. What a transformer architecture is

01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:06.710
going to do. Now what are the latest advancements. So recent

01:35:06.710 --> 01:35:11.530
latest one. If I'll talk about which I have an idea. So

01:35:11.530 --> 01:35:16.690
basically people are trying to give a sparse attention.

01:35:17.170 --> 01:35:20.990
Right. For and people are trying to implement some sort of a

01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:26.170
linear transformation so that it will be able to give or it

01:35:26.170 --> 01:35:28.710
will be able to handle a long long context. So this is one

01:35:28.710 --> 01:35:33.290
of the advancement which I am aware about. Then you must be

01:35:33.290 --> 01:35:36.090
able to see nowadays people are trying to build a more kind

01:35:36.090 --> 01:35:40.970
of a model a mixture of expert kind of a model where it will

01:35:40.970 --> 01:35:44.430
not be just one model system but a multiple model system and

01:35:44.430 --> 01:35:47.450
there will be an input layer. So input will go it will

01:35:47.450 --> 01:35:50.430
decide that it should go to which expert that expert will

01:35:50.430 --> 01:35:53.610
give the answer and then user will be able to get an answer.

01:35:53.810 --> 01:35:58.210
Our latest example I would say is a GPT-5 because it's kind

01:35:58.210 --> 01:36:01.550
of a combination of mixture of expert model. It's not a GPT

01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:04.810
-5 model only. It's many different different models. But

01:36:04.810 --> 01:36:09.410
yeah GPT-5 is just a layer umbrella. So input go to this

01:36:09.410 --> 01:36:12.250
umbrella and this umbrella will be having a layer which

01:36:12.250 --> 01:36:15.130
decides OK. So which model is going to give an answer. And

01:36:15.130 --> 01:36:17.910
that's the reason. So you must be able to see sometime that

01:36:17.910 --> 01:36:21.070
GPT is going to give you a response quickly. Sometime it

01:36:21.070 --> 01:36:24.130
says I'm thinking. Right. I'm thinking I'm trying to

01:36:24.130 --> 01:36:27.610
generate more reasoning over here. So it's called as MOE a

01:36:27.610 --> 01:36:31.150
mixture of expert where it won't be one single model. So

01:36:31.150 --> 01:36:33.930
maybe there will be a coding model. There will be a good

01:36:33.930 --> 01:36:36.310
model with respect to mathematics. There will be a very good

01:36:36.310 --> 01:36:39.130
model with respect to a world affairs or current affairs and

01:36:39.130 --> 01:36:42.790
system will decide that OK. My input should go to which

01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:47.310
expert. So MOE basically mixture of expert and many people

01:36:47.310 --> 01:36:52.990
are like trying to do this build this kind of a model. Then

01:36:52.990 --> 01:36:58.530
basically retrieval augmented transformer. So basically RAG

01:36:58.530 --> 01:37:01.530
kind of a concept. But inside a transformer. So this is

01:37:01.530 --> 01:37:05.070
again a latest advancement you will be able to find out a

01:37:05.070 --> 01:37:08.290
multimodal transformers like multimodal transform is one

01:37:08.290 --> 01:37:11.470
model can understand text can understand audio can

01:37:11.470 --> 01:37:14.530
understand a video. Right. So that is something called as

01:37:14.530 --> 01:37:17.810
multimodal transformers. So nowadays you must be able to see

01:37:17.810 --> 01:37:22.130
a lot again. Right. Multimodal transformer. So these are the

01:37:22.130 --> 01:37:25.090
latest advancement you will be able to find out is pass

01:37:25.090 --> 01:37:28.190
attention or inattention for a long context. And we make

01:37:28.190 --> 01:37:31.170
sure of expert. So not just one model but a multimodal. With

01:37:31.170 --> 01:37:35.790
a layered input and RIG based like a transformers and a

01:37:35.790 --> 01:37:40.330
multimodal transformers Gemini you can say right kind of a

01:37:40.330 --> 01:37:43.890
model. Now how do you contribute to a GNI research and

01:37:43.890 --> 01:37:46.710
development if you have done that say yes I have done that

01:37:46.710 --> 01:37:49.630
if you have not done that say like I was not able to get the

01:37:49.630 --> 01:37:54.610
time. So basically when we say that I have contributed into

01:37:54.610 --> 01:37:57.150
a GNI research development is a very specific question right

01:37:57.150 --> 01:38:00.910
and specific to a researcher I would say. So who just do a

01:38:00.910 --> 01:38:03.670
researcher or maybe a developer who is coming from some like

01:38:03.670 --> 01:38:07.610
a very good background right maybe a research background. So

01:38:07.610 --> 01:38:10.730
if someone will say how do you contribute or how you have

01:38:10.730 --> 01:38:14.510
contributed talk about it right talk about your past talk

01:38:14.510 --> 01:38:17.110
about like what kind of a problem that you have solved talk

01:38:17.110 --> 01:38:19.430
about your research paper if you have a link of that

01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:22.210
research paper many of my student have done that so they

01:38:22.210 --> 01:38:25.110
keep on publishing a lot of research paper. Research blogs

01:38:25.110 --> 01:38:28.730
basically so just let's try to like a present it because

01:38:28.730 --> 01:38:30.290
this is something if you have done that. If you have done

01:38:30.290 --> 01:38:33.510
that if you have not done that you can't talk about it so

01:38:33.510 --> 01:38:36.890
again not a generic question for everyone what is the

01:38:36.890 --> 01:38:40.250
approach for building a next generation language model okay.

01:38:41.350 --> 01:38:45.290
So language model if I'm trying to build so obviously I'll

01:38:45.290 --> 01:38:50.570
try to build a specific to a domain because almost general

01:38:50.570 --> 01:38:54.630
purpose models are available a very very good one which is

01:38:54.630 --> 01:38:57.710
good with not just with a good good with the text but also

01:38:57.710 --> 01:39:00.890
with the audio video and images yeah. Now beyond that

01:39:00.890 --> 01:39:04.990
nothing even exist we have seen like a group right so again

01:39:04.990 --> 01:39:07.930
very good with respect to a even like a text or image

01:39:07.930 --> 01:39:13.290
generation we have seen a like a view three from a Google

01:39:13.290 --> 01:39:17.330
recently which is literally amazing amazing with a realistic

01:39:17.330 --> 01:39:21.150
image by the way realistic image and even a video right

01:39:21.150 --> 01:39:26.150
again like we have basically a cloud is on it which is

01:39:26.150 --> 01:39:29.770
technically good with respect to a code. So we have a lot

01:39:29.770 --> 01:39:33.410
of. General purpose model I will not go and I'll not try to

01:39:33.410 --> 01:39:36.550
even like a build it build such kind of a model if I'm doing

01:39:36.550 --> 01:39:41.090
it I'm full very simple right because it like cost a lot so

01:39:41.090 --> 01:39:43.930
the very first part is not about talent but yeah about the

01:39:43.930 --> 01:39:47.610
costing which which no one is going to be a. So if I'm

01:39:47.610 --> 01:39:50.150
trying to build a next generation model I'll try to focus on

01:39:50.150 --> 01:39:53.690
one domain maybe one language maybe one problem statement

01:39:53.690 --> 01:39:57.750
and I'll try to build up best of best out of it by taking a

01:39:57.750 --> 01:40:01.650
general purpose model as a. base model because something has

01:40:01.650 --> 01:40:03.990
been trained something is very very expert in terms of

01:40:03.990 --> 01:40:07.030
understanding the language and relations on top of that so

01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:11.870
I'll just go ahead with the domain is specific. So that will

01:40:11.870 --> 01:40:15.330
my first approach the second approach is so maybe I'll not

01:40:15.330 --> 01:40:18.610
build just one model but a multiple one means a mixture of

01:40:18.610 --> 01:40:22.030
expert. And then I'll try to build a layer so which will try

01:40:22.030 --> 01:40:25.070
to direct my input to a different different expert as per

01:40:25.070 --> 01:40:28.770
the input maybe in one company itself I'll build a model for

01:40:28.770 --> 01:40:33.450
our finance for HR for. legal for all the other division but

01:40:33.450 --> 01:40:36.530
for user it's just one single interface when you have an

01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:39.850
input system will decide that okay it should go with here

01:40:39.850 --> 01:40:43.290
here or here this is how I can try to like you know do it.

01:40:44.590 --> 01:40:49.490
If I have to like build it maybe I'll try to like do a multi

01:40:49.490 --> 01:40:52.610
model integration right so where it will be able to take

01:40:52.610 --> 01:40:57.030
input as a video or maybe a live feed maybe audio maybe a

01:40:57.030 --> 01:41:00.230
code that is also possible that okay so based on the. live

01:41:00.230 --> 01:41:04.330
feed let's let's do something so this is something that I

01:41:04.330 --> 01:41:07.450
will try to do so which is going to balance research plus

01:41:07.450 --> 01:41:11.190
engineering both I will not just get into a research I'll

01:41:11.190 --> 01:41:14.570
not just jump into the engineering hundred percent I'll try

01:41:14.570 --> 01:41:17.650
to make. a balance one this is how I will be able to build a

01:41:17.650 --> 01:41:21.210
next generation model and I'll not try to reinvent the wheel

01:41:21.210 --> 01:41:23.530
so don't go and say that okay I'll build a model for you

01:41:23.530 --> 01:41:26.010
from the very scratch no one is going to buy that a

01:41:26.010 --> 01:41:28.570
statement at least in our current situation because we all

01:41:28.570 --> 01:41:31.170
know the reality. yeah. yeah two year back so many people

01:41:31.170 --> 01:41:34.830
have sold that story and many people was able to raise the

01:41:34.830 --> 01:41:37.710
fund but now no one is giving you a fund for that believe me

01:41:37.710 --> 01:41:42.310
as for the market then how do you implement a cutting edge

01:41:42.310 --> 01:41:45.770
gen ai technique now first of all what is this cutting edge

01:41:45.770 --> 01:41:48.690
technique by the way which is available in a market so

01:41:48.690 --> 01:41:51.990
obviously agents is a cutting edge technique a to a protocol

01:41:51.990 --> 01:41:56.350
mcb protocol is a cutting edge technique all this framework

01:41:56.350 --> 01:42:01.850
lang chain lang graph lama indexes auto gen. in it and

01:42:01.850 --> 01:42:04.630
basically likewise there are hundreds other platform which

01:42:04.630 --> 01:42:07.870
is like evolving every day so these are the cutting edge

01:42:07.870 --> 01:42:10.910
right model fine tuning is obviously a cutting edge things

01:42:10.910 --> 01:42:15.310
for all of us so these these are basically a cutting edge

01:42:15.310 --> 01:42:19.730
things in a world of ai mostly you will be able to find out

01:42:19.730 --> 01:42:23.910
a low code system a no code system kind of a things right

01:42:23.910 --> 01:42:27.410
for example a lovable kind of a system so you can just go

01:42:27.410 --> 01:42:29.810
over there and then try to give a prompt your requirement.

01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:32.790
and it will be able to create a beautiful back front end and

01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:35.650
back end as well so it will be able to do even a back end

01:42:35.650 --> 01:42:38.610
mapping with the super base or any other like a back end

01:42:38.610 --> 01:42:42.030
system if you have a database that you have so these are the

01:42:42.030 --> 01:42:47.410
cutting edge like things so just talk about one of your use

01:42:47.410 --> 01:42:50.290
cases that where you have used any of this you should not be

01:42:50.290 --> 01:42:53.930
like should not say that i okay i have used everything but

01:42:53.930 --> 01:42:57.210
yeah even if you have used anything just talk about it and i

01:42:57.210 --> 01:42:59.310
believe in my class this is something that i have discussed

01:42:59.310 --> 01:43:02.010
so. So take one example and explain that, that okay this is

01:43:02.010 --> 01:43:04.550
how I have used this cutting edge one and I am aware about

01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:09.410
other cutting edge things as well. Now so what are the

01:43:09.410 --> 01:43:12.350
consideration for generative AI research ethics, forget

01:43:12.350 --> 01:43:14.350
about it. How do you handle generative AI research

01:43:14.350 --> 01:43:17.890
collaboration, like just for the researcher. What is the

01:43:17.890 --> 01:43:21.850
approach for generative AI patent development, nothing so

01:43:21.850 --> 01:43:25.390
maybe just like try to do some sort of a breakthrough in

01:43:25.390 --> 01:43:27.630
terms of algorithm, in terms of architecture, in terms of

01:43:27.630 --> 01:43:30.490
some optimization or training something or maybe in terms of

01:43:30.490 --> 01:43:33.210
a security. This is what people are doing across the

01:43:33.210 --> 01:43:37.590
industry, right. So just just do it and then file the patent

01:43:37.590 --> 01:43:39.810
again when you are going to file the patent there will be an

01:43:39.810 --> 01:43:42.890
organization so who is going to check that they take six

01:43:42.890 --> 01:43:45.990
months of time in general, maybe sometime more. They try to

01:43:45.990 --> 01:43:48.370
check across the world that someone else has not filed the

01:43:48.370 --> 01:43:50.290
patent. They try to do a lot of matching. They have their

01:43:50.290 --> 01:43:53.850
own portal and accesses and based on that so your patent

01:43:53.850 --> 01:43:55.830
will be approved. This is how it happens. How do you

01:43:55.830 --> 01:43:58.550
implement? And again your company and your legal team is

01:43:58.550 --> 01:44:00.910
going to help you out or patent team is going to help you

01:44:00.910 --> 01:44:05.370
out. How do you implement gen AI research validation? So by

01:44:05.370 --> 01:44:09.590
publishing a like in terms of gen AI research validation, so

01:44:09.590 --> 01:44:13.130
maybe by doing some sort of a benchmarking with other

01:44:13.130 --> 01:44:16.830
existing like a matrixes, right. For example, maybe a glue

01:44:16.830 --> 01:44:20.550
matrix, maybe with respect to a Helm matrixes, maybe by

01:44:20.550 --> 01:44:23.690
checking some of the F1 score of the similar kind of a model

01:44:23.690 --> 01:44:26.090
and many more things depends upon the context in the task.

01:44:26.110 --> 01:44:30.470
In hand, now what are the consideration for generative AI

01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:35.490
research publication, okay. So consideration means basically

01:44:35.490 --> 01:44:41.650
places where you can try to like publish it basically. So

01:44:41.650 --> 01:44:44.030
there are so many organizations there is something called as

01:44:44.030 --> 01:44:46.410
neural IPS, there is something called as ICLR, there is

01:44:46.410 --> 01:44:49.750
something called as ICML, ACL. So these are basically like a

01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:52.050
places, these are basically a venues where you can go and

01:44:52.050 --> 01:44:55.030
you can try to publish your research. But yeah, if you have

01:44:55.030 --> 01:44:58.030
not done that. Let's not talk about it. Don't even mention

01:44:58.030 --> 01:45:00.350
inside your resume. If you have done that, you must be aware

01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:03.470
about it. Like you must be having a link for that, right. So

01:45:03.470 --> 01:45:09.150
we can just like attach that link. How do you handle a gen

01:45:09.150 --> 01:45:10.550
AI research funding? Okay.

01:45:13.490 --> 01:45:17.290
So research funding wise, obviously the governments used to

01:45:17.290 --> 01:45:20.270
give a grants, almost all the governments nowadays is

01:45:20.270 --> 01:45:23.270
giving. Yeah. That's another question. How much people are

01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:26.090
able to get it? How many genuine people are able to get it?

01:45:26.090 --> 01:45:29.170
That's still a question, especially in a country like India.

01:45:29.310 --> 01:45:32.990
But outside, yeah, there are like a genuine funding, which

01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:36.190
are genuine grants, which people are able to get, government

01:45:36.190 --> 01:45:38.230
support people are able to get, they are able to build it.

01:45:39.010 --> 01:45:42.210
Not true for all the country, right. But yeah, some of the

01:45:42.210 --> 01:45:44.550
country have taken these things in a very, very serious

01:45:44.550 --> 01:45:46.930
manner. And they are helping entrepreneur, they are helping

01:45:46.930 --> 01:45:49.470
researcher. And because of that, so they're able to build a

01:45:49.470 --> 01:45:51.370
best of best, right. Because without grant, without

01:45:51.370 --> 01:45:54.710
government support, or without a full financial backup, not

01:45:54.710 --> 01:45:57.150
full. I would say a massive financial backup, these kinds of

01:45:57.150 --> 01:45:59.590
breakthroughs are not possible. Believe me. It's not

01:45:59.590 --> 01:46:03.830
something like you will, you know, you won't sleep for five

01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:06.570
days, and then you will be able to do it. No, it requires a

01:46:06.570 --> 01:46:09.190
massive, massive, massive investment in terms of brain as

01:46:09.190 --> 01:46:13.090
well as in terms of, you know, resources. So yeah, some

01:46:13.090 --> 01:46:15.810
governments are like doing it, I believe you all are aware

01:46:15.810 --> 01:46:20.090
about it, we should not like talk much here. So basically,

01:46:20.150 --> 01:46:24.010
in terms of funding, we try to take a grant, we try to take

01:46:24.010 --> 01:46:28.070
a, we do a lot of corporate research, right, VC funding, you

01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:30.350
can try to go ahead with VCR angel funding, you can try to

01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:35.090
go ahead with and then, you know, and align your objective,

01:46:35.230 --> 01:46:37.730
your goal that I'm building this and this will be the

01:46:37.730 --> 01:46:40.690
societal impact or this is going to be the business impact,

01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:43.930
your pitch deck should say each and everything. And then,

01:46:43.990 --> 01:46:48.070
you know, go for the pitch. This is how we raise our

01:46:48.070 --> 01:46:51.730
funding, by the way, the Lord which goes behind the funding,

01:46:51.790 --> 01:46:54.810
when I was raising a funding for the very first time. Yeah.

01:46:54.830 --> 01:46:57.870
In a previous company. So yeah, there is there is like a

01:46:57.870 --> 01:47:03.410
almost six to nine months of story. So it is a very long

01:47:03.410 --> 01:47:06.730
story, maybe some someday I'll talk about it. But yeah, it's

01:47:06.730 --> 01:47:10.070
a completely different process. What is the approach for JNI

01:47:10.070 --> 01:47:13.430
research team building, hire a good brain, proven one,

01:47:13.530 --> 01:47:17.530
right, who have published the paper, who have done a

01:47:17.530 --> 01:47:20.730
breakthrough, a small one, at least, this is the only way of

01:47:20.730 --> 01:47:24.690
building a research team. How to implement a generative

01:47:24.690 --> 01:47:24.990
approach? What is the approach for JNI research

01:47:24.990 --> 01:47:28.350
infrastructure? So obviously, like, you must be having a

01:47:28.350 --> 01:47:33.130
sandbox with Nvidia H100, A100 kind of a GPU, you must be

01:47:33.130 --> 01:47:36.790
having an access of AWS, or maybe it's hyper stack kind of a

01:47:36.790 --> 01:47:41.570
cloud, right? So this is how you will build it. So you must

01:47:41.570 --> 01:47:45.030
be having us like, you know, a sizable amount of

01:47:45.030 --> 01:47:48.430
infrastructure. So this is this is what we do. And when we

01:47:48.430 --> 01:47:52.750
say generative AI, I'm talking about GPU more, right? CPU?

01:47:52.750 --> 01:47:56.110
GPU must be in a reserve. But yeah, I'm talking more about

01:47:56.110 --> 01:48:01.450
the GPU, like Nvidia H100 kind of a system access basically.

01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:06.960
What are the considerations for generative AI research data?

01:48:07.180 --> 01:48:09.740
So again, industry tie up, right? Industry tie up. So let's

01:48:09.740 --> 01:48:11.340
suppose if I'm building something for healthcare, so

01:48:11.340 --> 01:48:14.420
obviously, I'll go and I'll tie up with healthcare,

01:48:14.540 --> 01:48:16.680
pharmaceutical, or maybe with the hospitals or maybe with

01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:19.440
the healthcare researcher, which can like seamlessly provide

01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:23.380
me a data. And I can I can keep on building it. How do you

01:48:23.380 --> 01:48:24.540
handle JNI research? How do you handle research partnership?

01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:27.920
If you have done that, then it's fine, otherwise, no. So

01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:30.760
basically, like, in terms of doing a research partnership,

01:48:30.940 --> 01:48:35.860
generally universities and startups, and companies and NGO,

01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:38.460
so they did try to come together, they try to collaborate,

01:48:38.580 --> 01:48:40.940
and then they do a research. This is how like actual

01:48:40.940 --> 01:48:43.800
research happens. So basically, academic and industry

01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:46.560
collaboration, academic industry and the NGO collaboration

01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:49.700
on a company level. What is the approach of generative AI

01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:54.080
research commercialization? Okay. So if I'm talking about

01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:55.940
JNI. If I'm doing a research, so obviously, my research must

01:48:55.940 --> 01:48:58.800
be having some sort of a final goal, final end goal that I

01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:02.260
will end up building this, for example, OpenAI, who was the

01:49:02.260 --> 01:49:04.780
very first creator of this LLM, after that everyone has

01:49:04.780 --> 01:49:08.940
created, we know, right. So it was basically a NGO, right,

01:49:09.020 --> 01:49:12.300
or NPO, nonprofit organization, you know, first, and then

01:49:12.300 --> 01:49:16.900
they have like, converted that into a like, you know, kind

01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:19.740
of organization for a profit. But yeah, it has started

01:49:19.740 --> 01:49:22.060
actually as a research company, if you know the story,

01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:25.460
right. And majority of breakthroughs, you will be able to

01:49:25.460 --> 01:49:28.680
see that all of these started has been the open source with

01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:32.380
the like a research initiative itself, and then in a later

01:49:32.380 --> 01:49:36.460
stage, it become like a commercialized one. So this is how

01:49:36.460 --> 01:49:40.720
it is going to happen. Now this is the last question, 15

01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:45.500
one. Let's talk about this. Again it's a leadership question

01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:49.480
only. How do you save the JNI industry standard and best

01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:54.040
practices? Same thing, I think discussed, nothing to like

01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:58.800
discuss much here. What is the approach of JNI? What is the

01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:01.760
approach for JNI, thought leadership, okay, thought

01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:08.000
leadership. I mean like, you have to build a like a good

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:11.840
relation, good team, good product, with a good pricing, then

01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:15.980
everything will fall into place. That's my answer. How do

01:50:15.980 --> 01:50:20.320
you influence a JNI policies and regulations? Policy depends

01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:23.280
upon two things. One is a company policy, another one is a

01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:27.660
country policy. And yeah, so whatever is the policy, which

01:50:27.660 --> 01:50:30.760
country has designed and company has designed. As a leader,

01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:33.720
you should not violate it, right. Maybe tomorrow you will

01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:36.860
not be in a place, but someone else will be and that person

01:50:36.860 --> 01:50:39.500
will get into a trouble. And eventually your company will

01:50:39.500 --> 01:50:43.500
get into a trouble, right. So just like follow the rule of

01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:46.260
the company and a country both. What are the considerations

01:50:46.260 --> 01:50:49.700
for JNI industry collaboration? I have. I think I've already

01:50:49.700 --> 01:50:51.760
given the answer, this is the repeated one. How do you

01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:55.120
handle JNI industry conference and event? So you can say

01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:57.940
that, yeah, we do it sometime for a marketing event,

01:50:58.060 --> 01:51:01.620
sometime for a client collaboration, sometime, you know,

01:51:01.620 --> 01:51:03.900
showcasing something because every country, every company

01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:07.160
does that, right. So they do even in my previous company, so

01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:09.240
we were doing a lot of hackathons, right. So obviously

01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:11.940
hackathons helped us in terms of reaching out to more and

01:51:11.940 --> 01:51:16.340
more youth, students, people, young people, I would say. So

01:51:16.340 --> 01:51:19.060
every company tried to do this kind of a conference back.

01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:21.760
And in every city, and if you're a part of maybe Bangalore,

01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:28.120
Pune, Hyderabad and Chennai and Noida, Delhi even outside,

01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:31.080
right. Every week if you would like to attend some sort of a

01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:36.460
conference in these like a genre, you will be able to find

01:51:36.460 --> 01:51:40.380
one. Yeah. Easily you will be able to find one, right. It's

01:51:40.380 --> 01:51:43.320
very, very easy. So even in Bangalore, Bangalore like is a

01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:45.960
IT hub, so obviously you will be able to find out hundreds

01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:49.080
of conferences. Yeah. Yeah. So if you want to attend those

01:51:49.080 --> 01:51:52.640
conferences, you can just go ahead with that. Generally, I

01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:56.000
don't like going to these events and conferences, but yeah,

01:51:56.080 --> 01:52:00.860
maybe as a newcomer, as a learner, you should attend couple

01:52:00.860 --> 01:52:04.380
of those conferences, right. What is the approach for Genia

01:52:04.380 --> 01:52:07.520
industry networking? These conferences, the above one, how

01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:11.140
do you implement a Genia industry partnership? So yeah, as a

01:52:11.140 --> 01:52:15.480
leader, so obviously I have to like, we can say that we try

01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:17.840
to host a lot of conferences, meetings and parties with

01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:21.260
respect to our CEOs, CFOs. From a small company, from a big

01:52:21.260 --> 01:52:24.360
company, from a stakeholder. Because as a director, again,

01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:29.280
that is your job, right? So your job is not just to, you

01:52:29.280 --> 01:52:31.780
know, build a product or manage a team, but as a director,

01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:35.560
even company's relationship will be on your shoulder, right?

01:52:35.640 --> 01:52:38.680
And you have to increase that relationship. So obviously you

01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:42.340
will keep on meeting with the other CEOs and other CTOs,

01:52:42.340 --> 01:52:46.200
other CXOs, I would say more precisely, other CXOs,

01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:49.780
stakeholders, or maybe a partners. Maybe a small startup

01:52:49.780 --> 01:52:53.580
owners. We keep on meeting, we keep on sharing the ideas, we

01:52:53.580 --> 01:52:57.220
keep on sharing the business goals. And this is how the

01:52:57.220 --> 01:53:00.340
entire collaboration happens and which establish a network

01:53:00.340 --> 01:53:04.220
for a very, very long time, even on a personal level, right?

01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:07.760
That helps so many people on a personal level across the

01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:10.400
industry. And those who don't do it, right, a networking,

01:53:10.660 --> 01:53:14.080
believe me, there will be a dead people after some time in

01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:20.830
industry. Because as you will grow into industry. More than

01:53:20.830 --> 01:53:25.350
your talent, your genuine network matters. Agree with me or

01:53:25.350 --> 01:53:32.070
not, guys, yeah, everyone, as, as we grow into industry, I

01:53:32.070 --> 01:53:36.750
believe more than talent. Your network matters genuine one,

01:53:36.830 --> 01:53:39.410
actually not, not those like a LinkedIn kind of a network,

01:53:39.530 --> 01:53:42.610
but yeah, social network is one social media network is one

01:53:42.610 --> 01:53:46.730
and the network that we try to build on a personal label by

01:53:46.730 --> 01:53:50.670
creating something valuable, right. By collaborating. It's

01:53:50.670 --> 01:53:54.930
not always about a creation. I would say it's about, you

01:53:54.930 --> 01:53:58.470
know, sometime giving a help in a professional manner,

01:53:58.630 --> 01:54:01.490
sometime on a personal label, right. That is also going to

01:54:01.490 --> 01:54:05.470
build a network for you. It's, it's also, you know, sometime

01:54:05.470 --> 01:54:08.630
helping them to build their team, getting some sort of a

01:54:08.630 --> 01:54:12.370
meeting, some sort of a calls or maybe a clients, right. On

01:54:12.370 --> 01:54:15.370
many levels, right. Many levels we do a networking and

01:54:15.370 --> 01:54:19.970
believe me, that always gives you a, like a very good return

01:54:19.970 --> 01:54:23.310
in a long term, right. In a long term. So I always advise

01:54:23.310 --> 01:54:27.070
everyone that we are, yes, we are trying to build AI. We are

01:54:27.070 --> 01:54:29.650
trying to build a robots. We are trying to build a machines,

01:54:29.810 --> 01:54:33.550
but still we are human, right. And even tomorrow, even after

01:54:33.550 --> 01:54:37.490
a hundred year, we need human. Yeah. So you should always

01:54:37.490 --> 01:54:42.390
find out a way by which you will be connected with a human,

01:54:42.550 --> 01:54:45.630
not just on social media. That's a virtual world, right?

01:54:45.970 --> 01:54:49.210
Maybe on social media, you have like a 1 million followers.

01:54:49.450 --> 01:54:53.050
Right. But when you will be in need or maybe all those 1

01:54:53.050 --> 01:54:55.530
million follower is going to come in that, okay, I will

01:54:55.530 --> 01:54:57.730
help. But no one will help. Believe me, no one will come for

01:54:57.730 --> 01:55:01.490
your help, right? The person who will be genuinely connected

01:55:01.490 --> 01:55:04.570
with you, a person who has done some sort of a collaboration

01:55:04.570 --> 01:55:08.050
with you in your past, only those person will come to you

01:55:08.050 --> 01:55:11.290
and come for you. Right. And again, you will do the same

01:55:11.290 --> 01:55:13.390
thing. I'm not saying that they will come for you. Even you

01:55:13.390 --> 01:55:16.130
will go for that kind of a person, not for like person over

01:55:16.130 --> 01:55:20.790
the social media. Right. So always try to build such kind of

01:55:20.790 --> 01:55:24.570
a network. It takes time. You should not keep like a very

01:55:24.570 --> 01:55:28.430
high expectation that today I said hello and then tomorrow

01:55:28.430 --> 01:55:30.910
I'll just ask for the help. No, things doesn't work in that

01:55:30.910 --> 01:55:34.210
way. We are smart. We can understand very easily and we can

01:55:34.210 --> 01:55:37.910
judge people within a fraction of second. Right. We start

01:55:37.910 --> 01:55:40.730
judging people. We all of us, we all as a human being is

01:55:40.730 --> 01:55:43.270
having that kind of a tendency. That's the nature. So again,

01:55:43.310 --> 01:55:47.150
nothing wrong in that. But yeah. I always advise everyone

01:55:47.150 --> 01:55:50.050
because as you will grow, maybe you're a junior, maybe you

01:55:50.050 --> 01:55:52.990
are having 10 year experience, 20 year experience, right? As

01:55:52.990 --> 01:55:57.050
you will go, believe me, network matters more than your

01:55:57.050 --> 01:56:03.010
talent. It was true 10, 20 years back. It is true even now,

01:56:03.230 --> 01:56:08.170
right? And it will be true even after 20 years. So it's not

01:56:08.170 --> 01:56:10.870
just about your talent. It's all about your network as well.

01:56:10.910 --> 01:56:13.390
And that will bring a luck or maybe whatever it is. Right.

01:56:13.390 --> 01:56:16.750
So start doing it. Start building it all across, maybe on

01:56:16.750 --> 01:56:20.310
social. So I'm not saying just on social media and I'm not

01:56:20.310 --> 01:56:24.550
even saying that you should leave social media. No, you

01:56:24.550 --> 01:56:27.290
should balance out and you should keep on working even on

01:56:27.290 --> 01:56:30.450
that. You should keep on investing some time even on those

01:56:30.450 --> 01:56:35.030
networking. Right. Always. Always. But again, at the same

01:56:35.030 --> 01:56:38.230
point of time, I never say that, you know, go for X, Y, G

01:56:38.230 --> 01:56:40.490
conference attend all these things. No, it's not required.

01:56:40.710 --> 01:56:44.250
Right. It's not required. So, you know, try to build

01:56:44.250 --> 01:56:48.450
something valuable, share it, do some like, you know, a

01:56:48.450 --> 01:56:52.250
productive talk with people, help each other. It will happen

01:56:52.250 --> 01:56:55.810
eventually. So you don't have to do much on that part. Yeah.

01:56:56.030 --> 01:56:59.530
But yes, you should take an initiative. And as you will

01:56:59.530 --> 01:57:02.370
grow, as you will like go older and older inside the

01:57:02.370 --> 01:57:10.050
industry, you should do more. So yeah, that's a network. For

01:57:10.050 --> 01:57:12.910
example, in my network. So obviously like so many people are

01:57:12.910 --> 01:57:16.710
there. Starting from a fresher, dropout, till a person who

01:57:16.710 --> 01:57:22.590
is in their 70s. Right. All across the world. So somewhere

01:57:22.590 --> 01:57:25.450
like talking to people, teaching to a bit, not just in

01:57:25.450 --> 01:57:28.170
class. Even I used to talk a lot, you know, with everyone

01:57:28.170 --> 01:57:32.330
over a WhatsApp, over a call, just an informal discussions.

01:57:32.530 --> 01:57:36.670
Right. Plus I'm coming from my industry. So again over

01:57:36.670 --> 01:57:39.990
there, I had a lot of like a good friends. We are still like

01:57:39.990 --> 01:57:43.550
a very much like a well connected. I would say. apart from

01:57:43.550 --> 01:57:46.550
that so i have done a startup so obviously a lot of investor

01:57:46.550 --> 01:57:49.870
relations forums and many things comes into a picture i have

01:57:49.870 --> 01:57:53.530
raised funding as well so again so all of these things is

01:57:53.530 --> 01:57:56.270
accumulating right and whenever you need a help obviously

01:57:56.270 --> 01:58:00.570
people will come for you or not just help i would say i say

01:58:00.570 --> 01:58:02.750
business right so whenever you will do a business obviously

01:58:03.470 --> 01:58:07.490
you you will be able to you know exercise all of your powers

01:58:07.490 --> 01:58:11.150
over there and things will be easy things will get easy for

01:58:11.150 --> 01:58:13.770
you otherwise every time you will keep on hustling so that's

01:58:13.770 --> 01:58:17.950
a power of a network right so always try to build it and

01:58:17.950 --> 01:58:23.650
yeah i guess keep on working on that part okay so industry

01:58:23.650 --> 01:58:29.770
cooperation fine what where were i so which question what

01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:35.620
leadership collaboration networking partnership okay what

01:58:35.620 --> 01:58:37.620
are the questions for general industry competition uh

01:58:37.620 --> 01:58:40.980
nothing just try to keep some analysts they will keep on

01:58:40.980 --> 01:58:45.700
watching you like uh basically your competitor and they will

01:58:45.700 --> 01:58:48.580
keep on reporting you on a weekly basis this is how i i do

01:58:48.580 --> 01:58:52.500
it even like i have i have handled multiple projects and

01:58:52.500 --> 01:58:55.380
everywhere we have to keep a check on competitions and we

01:58:55.380 --> 01:58:59.060
have to evolve with that speed right because speed matters

01:58:59.060 --> 01:59:04.660
so we do the same thing so instead of watching me everything

01:59:04.660 --> 01:59:09.880
so maybe my junior can do it 24 by 7 right that will not

01:59:09.880 --> 01:59:12.840
cost me much how do you handle junior industry disruptions

01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:18.560
uh disruption is a bad word i would say so uh you can say

01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:21.840
that it's not a disruption so anything will not come out of

01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:25.820
the boom automatically uh right so you can say that that uh

01:59:25.820 --> 01:59:29.140
yeah so basically every day we are trying to do some sort of

01:59:29.140 --> 01:59:31.880
a progress uh we are trying to build we are trying to study

01:59:31.880 --> 01:59:36.000
competitors we are trying to study the market uh so this is

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:39.300
how we are we are able to handle the genii industry

01:59:39.300 --> 01:59:42.420
disruption so we have just aligned ourselves and then you

01:59:42.420 --> 01:59:45.240
can give an example that we have done same thing for other

01:59:45.240 --> 01:59:48.260
10 clients as well and we were able to generate this much of

01:59:48.260 --> 01:59:54.080
revenue so we are the part of this boom not a part of the

01:59:54.080 --> 01:59:57.720
disruption so this is how you can give an answer uh what is

01:59:57.720 --> 02:00:01.000
the approach of genii industry transformation what is the

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.860
approach of genii industry transformation there is no

02:00:03.860 --> 02:00:08.040
approach it's like solve the problem how do you implement

02:00:08.040 --> 02:00:12.020
genii industry innovations yeah research paper to basically

02:00:12.020 --> 02:00:15.260
like a practical so you can say that okay so our team keep

02:00:15.260 --> 02:00:18.920
on doing a lot of like research papers and uh we we just try

02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:22.180
to convert that into mbps prototypes and then we check that

02:00:22.180 --> 02:00:24.860
whether it's like uh we can we can align that with the

02:00:24.860 --> 02:00:27.400
business or not what is the consideration for general

02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:30.040
industry sustainability again these are just a question i

02:00:30.040 --> 02:00:31.920
think anyone can answer how do you handle genii industry

02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:35.960
challenges by building a best team the best way to handle

02:00:35.960 --> 02:00:39.720
challenges is go and get a best team what is the approach

02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:43.160
for genii industry uh what is the approach for genii

02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:47.420
industry opportunity keep yourself updated right keep

02:00:47.420 --> 02:00:50.420
upskilling keep yourself updated that is the best how to

02:00:50.420 --> 02:00:55.700
implement genii industry vision and strategy again same

02:00:55.700 --> 02:00:59.460
thing like keep on upskilling keep on exploring keep an eye

02:00:59.460 --> 02:01:06.400
every time and then deliver fast right deliver fast as fast

02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:09.500
as possible so that you will be having a advantages some

02:01:09.500 --> 02:01:11.320
sort of advantages over there so this is the approach for

02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:11.680
genii industry opportunity keep yourself updated how we do

02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:15.920
it so that's all guys about this 200 questions right now

02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:20.080

which which you will enjoy because uh you will be able to

02:04:25.300 --> 02:04:28.800
find out that every time discussing just a core technical is

02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:31.820
not a solution sometime you should even do a discussion

02:04:31.820 --> 02:04:35.400
which can you know summarize the things summarize the things

02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:38.720
