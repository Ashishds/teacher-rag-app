WEBVTT

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.860
Okay, so hi everyone, I think I'm audible and visible to all

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.280
of you. So we are going to start class in next like a five

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.000
minute of time. We can wait for others to join. He has

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.180
changed.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.670
Okay, so fine guys. Good evening. I think I'm audible and

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.130
visible to all of you, right? Everyone.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.200
Okay, so great. I believe I'm audible and visible. So fine

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.260
guys, let me set an agenda for this particular week. So this

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.060
week I will be talking about project architecture. Basically

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.780
a project design project architecture execution flow or you

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.520
can say all the edge cases that we are going to face with

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.040
respect to a project so that you all will be able to modify

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.560
your resume and you all will be able to write down a project

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.720
inside your resume after a modification. So in whatever

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.660
technology you have been working so far or maybe in whatever

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.260
domain you have been working so far, but yeah, it's time to

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.680
revamp your resume. If you are not doing it, then. It's not

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.510
going to work, right? So shall we start everyone? Yes, I

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.430
know it's Monday. So most of us are like working and it's

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.070
tough to, you know, join a class on Monday and Tuesday, but

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.130
this is a short bootcamp. So I believe just for like a four

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.390
to five week, we are here right in this bootcamp. Okay,

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.490
fine. So let's start. Fine. Let me share my screen, by the

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.630
way. So yeah, so today guys, I'll be talking about one

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.710
project called as Nexus RAG. So Nexus RAG is, let me set the

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.610
agenda. Let me set the context. Let me set the background of

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.950
this particular project. And again, it is going to be a

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.870
very, very amazing one, a big one. I will be talking about

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.670
not just a project architecture, but I'll be talking about

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.190
even a team specification, a team distribution. I'll be

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.970
talking about even a costing. So what kind of a cost this

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.350
project is going to like occur? Uh, when it will go for a

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.550
production for what kind of a crowd or what kind of a work.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.530
So each and everything in a step-by-step manner, I'll be

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.750
talking about and try to take a note of it. So maybe you can

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.330
try to take out your pen and pencil and notebook and start

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.030
taking a note of this particular project along with the

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.750
architecture diagram, because believe me, this is going to

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.730
help you out. And yes, when I'm going to upload our

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.490
recording. So at that point of a time, I will be recording.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.690
I will be uploading even a story document. So I have already

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.010
prepared my story document for this project. So I'll be

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.310
uploading that, but yes, it will be better to take a note.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.670
And because whenever you are going to mention this kind of a

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.530
project into your resume, people are going to ask a lot of

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.830
questions because this is how this project is. They are

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.050
going to ask you a lot of questions from a different,

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.370
different side, not just from a technical side, but maybe

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.450
they're going to ask you a component, they will try to grill

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.570
you on a team structure. They will try to grill you on a

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.190
time or maybe the kind of outcome this project is going to

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.210
give. So there can be a N number of things on which people

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.870
may ask you a question. And I believe I'm going to clarify

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.710
all of those components with the help of this Nexus RAG,

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.930
Enterprise Grade RAG solution. And again, so I'm going to

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.470
discuss about this project in a very, very generic way. So

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.390
it doesn't matter from which industry you belong or which

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.050
industry you are going to join. This is a project that you

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.050
can try to mention. And this is the project about which you

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.870
can talk about in your interview with respect to any domain.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.830
Simple. Yeah. Simple. So it will be covered in this

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.170
bootcamp. See, I'm not covering anything. This is an

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.630
interview bootcamp. I believe we all are aware about it. So

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.450
with respect to our question and answer, I will be like

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.270
covering each and everything. Not in terms of execution, not

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.090
in terms of learning. For that, we have a generative AI

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.390
certification bootcamp. Which happens on Saturday and

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.570
Sunday. Yeah. So I believe expectation for this batch is

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.590
pretty much clear to all of us. We have a separate separate

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.350
batch for a separate work. So this batch is just for

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.710
interview means just for an interview. Nothing much. Okay.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.830
So let's start guys. So like I said, the name of this

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:46.630
project is basically, name of this project is basically a

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:54.770
Nexus RAG. Let me set my screen. Yeah. Okay.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.320
So like I said, guys, so this is Nexus

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.070
RAG now.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.600
So why we are even talking about this project and what this

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.900
project is going to solve. So let me set and context for

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.340
this particular project in a very first place in every

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.760
organization. So let's suppose in my organization there are

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.660
maybe like a 5,000 employees, right? In my organization

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.220
there are 5,000 employees. Now, uh, obviously I will be

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.900
having a multiple project because if there is a 5,000

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.820
employees, so multiple project must be running in a

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:45.260
parallel. And again, there will be a multiple different,

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.140
different kind of a compliance team. Maybe you have a HR

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.580
team, maybe you have a finance team, maybe you have a legal

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:54.260
team and for every project. So there will be a separate,

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:58.100
separate, separate, separate teams, right? Every day across

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:02.060
an organization, there will be a multiple meetings. There

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:05.220
will be a multiple policies discussion. There will be

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.620
multiple client discussion, right? Or maybe there will be a

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:12.720
multiple team discussion, which is going to happen. And uh,

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.560
everything is pretty much scattered whenever we are talking

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.700
about even an organization with the size 5,000 because 5,000

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.000
is a big number, uh, in terms of any organization. So

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.560
obviously all of this data. So whether I'm talking about a

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.380
data from a finance or compliance document from a finance,

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.260
from a legal side. From a HR. From a HR side, or maybe a

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.600
meeting which happens with a client, a meeting which happens

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.600
within a team member. So everything will be pretty much

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.660
scattered. Uh, as an employee, let's suppose if I'm going to

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:47.900
join a company and uh, let's suppose if I have to like, uh,

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.940
build a product or maybe if I have to work on one of the

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:56.420
small application. So where I have to, uh, think about

00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:01.740
exposing our data or utilizing X, Y, G software, right? So I

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.600
have to go through a multiple label of an approval. So maybe

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.540
I'll go and ask my lead. My lead is going to forward to a

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.740
manager. Manager is going to forward to a legal. Legal is

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:16.540
going to forward to a HR. So again, whenever we are trying

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:20.620
to like, uh, build any small project or maybe I'm trying to

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:24.460
build a small product. So where I have to write a logic to

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:28.840
expose our data or to use a client data. So I have to go

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.420
through a multiple layer of the approval. Okay. And once

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.060
they are going to give an approval, then only I will be able

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.780
to use it inside my work or maybe inside my code. Otherwise

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:41.460
I will not be able to use it because someone else has

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.860
created those compliances. Someone else has created that

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.720
policies and that policies are available with a specific

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.180
team and I may be not aware about it. There is a very high

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:55.380
possibility that there is no such policies, right? In an

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.080
organization. And there is a very high possibility in a big

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.720
organization, especially in a financial institution. Or

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.180
maybe any kind of a banking organization that these policies

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:07.460
are already in place, but maybe I'm not aware about it. And

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.580
every organization, right? Every organization is sitting on

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:15.300
a tons of a document, a tons of policies, a tons of meetings

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:20.120
or day to day, any kind of policies or any kind of rules and

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.620
regulation that we try to circulate. Every organization is

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:27.500
having that now for any employee, it's almost near to

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.780
impossible. I would say. To access these policies, to access

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:35.500
these document or maybe a mom, a minutes of meeting night

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:40.500
for any one of us. And that creates a lot of friction that

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.580
creates a lot of bottleneck when we start developing

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.240
something. Maybe so many organization, right? Many product

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.660
based companies, they try to do a lot of research. They try

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.420
to publish a lot of scientific research paper as well,

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.220
right? So company like a Google or I would say Adobe or

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:02.260
maybe a Samsung. So they try to publish a lot of patents.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.040
They try to publish a lot of research paper and thousands by

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.080
the way, right? In thousands, they try to publish it. And

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.260
maybe if I'm trying to work in one of the product and that

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.760
patent is already available or maybe that research paper is

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:19.660
already available with my company, but maybe I'm not aware

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.580
about it as an employee, as a developer or maybe as a

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.980
manager, I'm not aware about it. So it is going to create a

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.840
huge, huge, huge, huge bottleneck for me. In a beginning

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.680
itself. And I'll have to spend maybe a week of time, maybe a

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.080
month of time just to find out that research paper, right?

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.420
Or maybe just to find out that from where I will be able to

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:42.280
get an access of it, right? So every organization, I would

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.140
say whether it's a small organization or whether it's a huge

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:49.340
organization, everyone is sitting on these kind of a problem

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.260
statement and everyone is sitting on these kind of, you

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.360
know, documents or you can say like a digital document or

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:00.760
maybe a scan document. And it creates a bottleneck and

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.900
because of this bottleneck, it is going to create a friction

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:08.420
and because of this friction. So we try to delay our work.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.720
We don't try to delay our work, work gets delayed

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.240
automatically, right? Work gets delayed automatically. Now

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.540
how we will be able to solve this problem. So is this fine

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.320
guys? What is the problem statement that we are talking

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.940
about? Yeah. A problem statement that we are talking about,

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:26.100
right? And I believe if you are working in any company,

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.620
right, whether it's a small or whether it's a big, maybe if

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.520
you're working in a startup where you have just like a 10,

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:35.120
20 team members, you must have observed that even for like,

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:38.940
you know, a simple HR policies are not clear to you. A very

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.840
simple, let's, let's talk about just a HR policy. Forget

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.280
about those research documents, forget about the meets or

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.440
meeting, forget about the, like a financial policies or

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.780
maybe a legal compliances. Just let's talk about the HR

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:53.180
policies. Many of us are not aware about a common HR

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.180
policies, a common leave policies, or maybe a maternity

00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:00.040
policies. And many other policies, right? For a particular

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.320
companies as an employee in a startup, it happens a lot,

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:05.560
right? So let's suppose I have just a team, a 10 members

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.580
team and uh, yeah, so maybe my HR is not able to maintain

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.420
all of these things in one single places. So again and

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.600
again, I'll have to mail to my HR that, okay, fine. Give me

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.880
this, give me that. And this happens very frequently. Now

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.560
think about an organization where we have a 5,000 people and

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.200
then think about the organization. So where we have two

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.880
lakh, three lakh people, for example, TCS, Infosys, Bipro,

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:30.720
KFG BNI, Accenture, IBM, right? These kind of a company. So

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.760
where we have a two lakh, three lakh, five lakh employees,

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.360
where we have a thousands of different, different kind of a

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.620
client, where these companies are working in almost hundred

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:43.020
plus nations. Some companies are working even in a 150 plus

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:46.900
nations, Deloitte, ENY, PWC, KPMG kind of a companies,

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.560
right? So they have a multiple team. They have a multiple

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.200
reason in which they are working. They have a thousand, not

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.460
just thousand, tens of thousands of clients basically,

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.580
right? And that too in a different, different, different,

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:01.700
different domain. So it, it always creates a bottleneck for

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.720
anyone. So not just a developer, I would say, but even for a

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.440
lead architect, managers and everyone to access a source of

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:13.500
truth, right? To access a source of truth. And we keep on

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.660
looking for someone for a validation. So we keep on looking

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:19.460
for an approval again and again and again. So before making

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.560
any kind of a decision, because on all of these

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.960
organizations, compliances, rules, regulations, and

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.120
whatever. Okay. This internal document that they are trying

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.900
to maintain matters a lot and whatever, like a, again, team

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:34.900
is discussing or maybe whatever they have delivered. So

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.780
let's suppose in a Deloitte company like Deloitte, right? So

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.460
where we have a 10 thousands of clients or maybe a lakhs and

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.580
lakhs of projects are running in parallel, right? Across the

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.440
organization and talking about across the organization means

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.680
across all the countries because Deloitte is available

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:53.140
across all the countries right now. So let's suppose some

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:56.440
team has solved some problem, right? Some team has already

00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:00.620
solved some of the problems. Now maybe a team sitting in a

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:04.220
different country. So they are trying to solve the same

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:07.180
problem, but they are not aware about that. Whether this

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.420
problem has been solved by other team or not, right? So

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.520
again, what they will do, they will try to reinvent a wheel.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.460
They will try to reinvent a wheel. So maybe some team has

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.760
spent already six months of time on a particular problem

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.300
statement to solve it. Other team is again going to spend a

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.620
six month of time by reinventing a wheel to solve the exact

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.820
same problem, which has been solved. We already have a

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.340
solution, but we are not aware about it that, okay, fine.

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:34.740
Some team has already solved it and just because of that. So

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.520
again, I'm going to spend six months of time and six months

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.840
of time for any team. Maybe like my team size is 2025 only

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.880
in a Deloitte like company, but it is going to cost me a

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.680
million dollars per month or maybe more than a million

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.880
dollars per month. It is going to cost me a plus time, six

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:54.500
months, right? So time and money, both it is going to cost

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.500
me. Now, what if, if I can try to create a centralized

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:02.200
system? So where anyone and everyone based on the rules,

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.440
again, everything should not be available to everyone,

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.940
right? So everyone should not have kind of access to

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:10.500
everyone. So where I can try to create a role based

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:15.120
hierarchy based system. So where anyone can come, anyone

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.860
will be able to search anything, whether it's a research

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.640
paper, whether it's a code base, whether it's a product

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.160
development that we have done, whether it's a policies that

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.920
we are talking about. Everything means literally everything.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.360
I'm not just talking about the HR policies over there. No,

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.560
I'm talking about the HR finance, legal code base, a

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.520
project, a research paper, um, minutes of meeting. I'm

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:38.020
talking about everything, maintaining everything. So what

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:41.200
if, if I will be able to access each and everything in one

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:47.400
single centralized place and then anyone based on their

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.640
roles, obviously. So if I'm junior, so obviously my role

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.640
will be different and I will be having some limited access.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.200
If I'm a manager, if I'm an architect, if I'm from a legal

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.640
team, if I'm from a finance team, if I'm from a HR team, I

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.520
will be having a different, different kind of accesses by

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.960
the way. Yeah. Different, different kind of access I will be

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:07.000
having and a role based access by the way or hierarchy based

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.500
access I will be having and immediately I can just go, I can

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:16.640
try to search and I will be able to use it. So this is going

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:22.480
to solve a very, very big problem across our industry. Part

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:26.180
number one. Part number two, every company try to keep a

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.420
internal support team. So if you have any kind of an issue,

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.220
so generally we try to reach out to a internal support team.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.720
Every big company is going to keep a support team or support

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.380
staff so that they will be able to support their internal

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:41.520
employees, right? So the companies are keeping a separate

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:45.400
support team. So again, they are trying to maintain them or

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.520
maybe like to provide their or maintain their knowledge

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.980
base, right? To maintain their knowledge base. So again, uh,

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.240
again, they, they. They used to go for a multiple round of

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.440
approval. So generally their work will to like, uh, find out

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.160
that how this problem can be solved, right? How this, who

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.220
will be the contact person point of contact for that

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.760
particular problem statement. And then they try to take the

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:08.440
approval. So again, companies are spending a million dollar

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:12.240
just to keep that particular team just to retain that

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.860
particular team. And uh, again, so by building this kind of

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:19.120
a system, maybe I can replace that particular team with this

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:23.600
robust system. So this is where. This Nexus RAG project

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:28.000
comes into a picture to solve this problem across an

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.460
organization. And this is not a problem from, for one

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:34.480
organization. It's a problem for multiple organization

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:40.930
making sense guys. Yes. Everyone. Yeah. So what are we

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:45.510
talking about? Yeah. So we are talking about basically a

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:49.270
system where only one place to ask a question, instant

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:54.030
answer. Any document or any policy. Or any minutes of

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:58.170
meeting or any product or any code base. People will be able

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:01.930
to search based on their like access label by the way. And

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:06.110
again, so citation is important citation means. So basically

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:10.150
whenever I'm trying to search something, so what is a source

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:13.810
from where this particular things is coming so that I will

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:17.470
be able to refer and maybe if, if something goes wrong. So

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:20.590
again, I can try to attach that particular proof that, okay.

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:24.950
So. So from this company, uh, like a system itself, this is

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:28.030
the citation means this is the source of truth for me and I

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:30.050
have just followed whatever is written. So I have not done

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:34.030
anything wrong by the way, right? So source of trust people

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:37.730
will be able to get in a secured manner, role based access

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:42.350
people will be able to get for any of this product. So this

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:46.770
is where this Nexus RAG comes into a picture now. So when we

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.390
are talking about this Nexus RAG kind of a system, a

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:52.090
retrieval augmented generation, access system, or you can

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:55.170
say enterprise grade REG system, which is a requirement for

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:58.610
every company, right? Not just our it company. I'm talking

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:01.750
about, by the way, let's suppose I'm a legal firm. It's a

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:04.930
need for me, right? Maybe I'm a like a accountant,

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:08.410
accountant firm. It's a requirement for me, right? So for

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:12.830
any kind of a form, it's a requirement now. So when we are

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:16.210
talking about this kind of a system, so again, there will be

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:20.350
a next question which comes in my mind. That. What will be

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:25.110
the source of a data? What kind of a data we are going to

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:28.110
ingest now, once we will be able to figure out that what

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:31.170
kind of a data or what will be the source of the data or

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:35.070
what type of the file we will be able to process, then next

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:38.890
thing comes into a picture that how it will be able to

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:42.290
understand a natural language, how it will be able to, you

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:45.930
know, search maybe a 10 million document. I'm not just

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:47.630
talking about one or two document. I'm talking about. I'm

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:51.110
talking about a 10 million document, right? So how accurate

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:54.590
it is going to be, how we are going to make sure that

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:57.730
whatever answer that the system is going to generate is

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:01.430
relevant, at least with the accuracy of 95% plus so that I

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:05.130
can rely on the system. How good the user experience is

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:08.250
going to be? What is a possibility that the system will not

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:11.370
be compromised? So obviously I'm talking about a security of

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:15.810
this one. What? How I will be able to come or how I will be

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:19.430
able to basically integrate. Okay. All the latest knowledge

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:23.130
inside this particular system, because like I said, we keep

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:26.350
on producing such kind of a document on a daily basis,

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:31.310
right? And how I will keep the system updated on a regular

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:34.870
basis. How I will be able to build analytics and monitoring

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:38.590
across this one. What should be the system architecture for

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:41.790
this one? So many questions, right? So many questions arises

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:44.910
in our mind that what kind of a tools I'm going to use? What

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:46.810
is the programming language I'm going to use? What is the

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:49.550
API layer? I will be using, what is the security layer I

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:52.430
will be using, where I'm going to deploy when deployment

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:55.250
comes in my mind. So again, next thing comes in my mind that

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:58.650
what should be the configuration of my server, right? What

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:01.410
should be the configuration of the server? What external API

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:05.950
is required? So do we have like some, uh, alternative for

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:09.170
the external API is available to me or the model. So there

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:12.970
are so many questions which comes in my mind. And again,

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:16.090
even before that, the, another question which comes to my

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:19.950
mind is a timeline. Okay. What is a timeline? What is a

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:22.170
timeline to, which is required to develop this kind of a

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:25.650
project? And when timeline comes into a picture, then our

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:28.790
team size comes into a picture. So do we just need a

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:32.110
generative engineer or do we need a big data engineer as

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:35.090
well? Do we need analytics engineer as well? Do we need

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:37.650
someone from a front end backend? Do we need someone from

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:40.910
our ops side operation basically, right? To maintain my

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:44.710
entire pipeline? Uh, do we need a manager? If I need a

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:47.470
manager, how many managers? How much cost? How much cost?

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:51.290
And again, this is basically, uh, this is basically a

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:54.130
question which you will get from a lead side. If I'm a

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:57.090
manager or if I'm a director, my very first question will be

00:22:57.090 --> 00:23:01.910
that how much cost we'll be able to save, right? Maybe 30%

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:04.530
for the existing cost. So let's suppose if I'm spending 1

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:08.670
million per, uh, $1 million per month on my, like a support

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:12.870
staff to maintain this entire things, uh, so how much cost I

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:16.370
will be able to reduce? How much reliable this system is

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:19.710
going to be? So many questions, so many questions, and all

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:22.630
of these questions are pretty much relevant with respect to,

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:25.510
uh, interview and we'll try to find out the answer. So first

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:28.890
of all, uh, we'll try to start from the architecture and

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:31.790
when I say architecture simply means that we'll try to start

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:34.590
from the source of the data because there won't be only one.

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:37.330
So the data, there will be multiple sources of the data. So

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:39.790
we'll try to design the architecture in a layered manner,

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:43.030
layer by layer, layer by layer manner. Then we are going to

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:47.130
talk about a cost as well. So let's suppose. If this system

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:50.810
is working in this particular organization for this main

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:54.090
number of employees with this main number of the queries on

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:57.750
a daily basis, and this is the total document that we are

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:01.490
processing on a regular basis, then what will be the cost

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:04.850
estimation? So I will be talking about a cost estimation for

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:08.090
three different types. So a small, medium and large

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:11.390
companies. So small means like a 50, 100 employees and then

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:14.170
medium means 100 to 500 employees and then large means

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:17.310
thousand plus employees kind of a system. So I will be

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:20.770
giving you even a cost breakup that, okay, if you are trying

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:24.250
to put up your system in a production, then this is the

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:28.350
estimated cost. You may expect, and again, there is a scope

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:31.370
of optimization, cost optimization, but yeah, this is the

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:35.510
bare minimum cost that you will end up spending on a monthly

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:39.830
basis or maybe on a yearly basis because even cost part is

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:43.070
important because I will not try to build a project. So

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:46.350
which project, the project, which is going to cost me. More

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:49.670
than the team. If some humans are able to do the same work

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:53.470
and if machines are able to do the same work, but if machine

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:57.610
part is costly to me, maybe as a director, as a manager, I'm

00:24:57.610 --> 00:25:00.050
not going to approve this project, right? I'm not going to

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:03.150
approve this project. So all of these things in a step by

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:06.530
step, a step by step manner, we are going to discuss. So I

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:10.430
believe we are okay with the problem statement guys. I

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:13.050
believe we all are able to understand some 10,000 feet of

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:16.650
overview that what we are talking about. Yes. And, uh, what

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:19.490
kind of a quotient, uh, will be asked in an interview?

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:23.230
Little bit of idea. I believe we all are able to get, yes,

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:29.530
okay, uh, 10 feet overview at 10,000 feet. Let's say a 10

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:32.970
feet over. I'll give you 10 feet over. You don't worry. So,

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:36.790
uh, very soon in next, like a one, one and a half hour, you

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:39.090
will be able to get that overview. It will take some time,

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:42.090
but yeah, in next one and a half hour, uh, you will be able

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:42.690
to see it.

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:51.130
Okay. So let's get started. So here, let's talk about, first

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:56.250
of all, a source of the data, yeah, source of the data. Uh,

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:58.930
so we are, so we generally, whenever we try to build a

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:02.070
project, so we try to build a project layer by layer, layer

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:04.630
by layer, layer by layer. And when we talk about our team,

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:09.890
so generally we try to call those team as a pod. So pod for

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:13.470
this pod for this pod for this, so maybe ops pod, maybe a

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:17.190
front end pod, maybe a backend pod, maybe a security pod. So

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:20.770
we try to divide our team as a pod. So pod pod basically.

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:23.830
And then, uh, whenever we talk about the architecture, so we

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:26.370
try to say, okay, layer. So there will be a ingestion layer.

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:29.050
There will be an indexing layer. There will be a pre

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:31.130
-processing layer. There will be a retrieval layer. There

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:33.230
will be a security layer. There will be an application

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:37.670
layer, right? So in layers, we try to divide it. So layer by

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:41.790
layer, first of all, try to unwrap the entire architecture,

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:46.030
then pod by pod. Let's try to talk about the team. Okay. And

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:51.810
then let's talk about the cost. So here the very first thing

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:53.570
which I will be discussing layers,

00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:04.130
architecture, layers. Then on a second line, I'll be

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:10.880
discussing about a team pod, pod by pod, right? Because it's

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.020
not like there will be only one team which will be involved

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.880
inside this kind of a project. And obviously I'll be talking

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:18.940
about a timeline that what will be the timeline. And again,

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.640
so breakdown of the timeline. So let's suppose if I'm saying

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:25.100
that it is going to take six months of time, then in a month

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.620
one, month two, month three, month four, month five and

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:30.340
month six, what will be the deliverables? Because people are

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.520
going to ask you a question that what was your day to day

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.560
job? And if you're saying that I've been working in this

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.460
project for six months, then obviously you must be having a

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:43.040
answer for that, right? So architecture, team pod, and then

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:46.660
obviously I'll be talking about a cost, right? So existing

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:50.980
cost, basically, which is our team cost. Versus. The cost,

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:54.620
which it is going to give you when you are going to

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:58.560
productionize this entire system into an environment. So

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:01.060
first come first, let's talk about the architecture layer.

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:04.480
So if I'll talk about this kind of a Nexus REG project, so

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:08.500
where I have to basically accumulate all the document across

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:14.220
the organization. So what will be my data sources? So here,

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:32.450
architecture first. Yeah. Now. So here. So the very first

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:35.290
layer. So let's talk about this layer and this layer is

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:36.810
called as let's suppose ingestion layer.

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:45.530
Ingestion layer. Now so I'm a part of this project and I'm

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:49.390
trying to build this entire ecosystem. So obviously as an

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:51.150
architect, let's suppose if I'm trying to design this

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:55.010
project, so obviously I have to figure out that what and all

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:59.150
sources from which we have to get a data, right? We have to

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:03.010
get a data. So obviously when I'm trying to prepare my PRD.

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:06.350
A project requirement document. So at that point of time I'm

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:10.310
going to list down the team or maybe a overall work that

00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:16.370
okay, I'm going to get a data from maybe an HR. I will be

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:19.850
getting a data maybe from a finance. I will be getting a

00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:25.890
data from a legal. I will be getting a data from MOM. So

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:28.550
whatever meeting happens across the organization and there

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:30.390
will be thousands of meeting which is going to happen across

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:32.250
the organization. So minutes of meeting by the way. Okay.

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:37.950
MOM. Right. And I will be getting a data from all the

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:43.930
scientific paper or research paper. Research paper published

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:49.050
by my organization. So which like a patent is available with

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:53.870
my organization. Maybe all the code base, a code base, which

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:55.890
is a shareable code base, right? Let's suppose if I have

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:58.130
developing a product and that code base is already available

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:02.990
and maybe my source is going to be.

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:16.080
Project slash product PRD, LLD, HLD. So let's suppose if

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.400
organization is working in some segments since last like a

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.900
10 years, one decade, right? So obviously they have worked

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.480
on a multiple project. So they must be having a multiple

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:26.900
PRDs. They must be having a multiple LLDs and HLDs by the

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:29.280
way, a low level design document, high level design document

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.900
and project requirement document, right? So technically this

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:35.840
will be available with all the organizations. But yes, it

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.600
will be available with the team. Right? So everyone will not

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.720
be aware about it or maybe it's not available in a

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:45.840
centralized system by the way. So project PRD, LLD, HLD. So

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.540
there will be again tons of document, uh, which any, any

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:51.740
organization will be having again code base wise. So many,

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:54.560
uh, many companies try to build some internal product as

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.600
well, right? So many companies are going to use some

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.720
services from the outside, but yeah, many companies will be

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.020
having internal solutions. So for example, if I'll talk

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:04.160
about Kafka, so Kafka is a solution which has been built by

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.980
LinkedIn, right? If I'll talk about Hive. Hive kind of a

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:09.680
system. So Hive was a system which was built by a Facebook

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.800
and in the latest days they have made it as an open source

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:15.300
under Apache license, right? So likewise, there are almost

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:18.580
all the big, big open source project that you are able to

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:22.020
see today, right? Almost all of these project was an

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:24.720
internal project of some of these big companies. If I'll

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:27.500
talk about a TensorFlow, right? So TensorFlow, Google have

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:31.120
been using like, uh, since many, many years before making it

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:34.160
open source for a public, right? So the entire team members

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.680
of the Google was using it. Okay. They have been using Hive

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.160
torch. Again, it's been delivered by Facebook, right? They

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.360
have been using it for a multiple years and now the entire

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:44.040
world is using it. So many companies, many companies, even

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:47.520
as a small companies, even in my company, uh, my tech team

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:50.640
and me and other teams. So basically we try to build a

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.360
small, small product which is not even visible, which we

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.880
don't even publish over a Euron platform. So it's not like

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.460
whatever we build, we used to publish it. No, there are

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:00.480
something that we try to experiment. There are something

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:04.340
that we try to like, uh, build, but yeah, maybe we don't see

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:07.600
any kind of a business use cases. At that point of time, we

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.080
don't even publish it, right? Maybe we try to keep it for

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:13.460
our future estate, but there is a possibility that if other

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:16.300
teams are trying to build the same thing, right? Other team

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.760
was trying to build the same thing they, they might end up

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:21.900
using or reusing these things without wasting any kind of a

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.200
time because time is equivalent to a money because at the

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.700
end of the day, companies are paying to their employees and

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:30.440
if employees are involved in terms of reinventing a wheel

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:33.680
again and again, the cost is going to come to the company as

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:36.520
simple as that, right? Right. So this is one of the major

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:39.300
cost optimization strategy and again, I believe many

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:41.940
companies are doing it and many companies will do it in the

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:44.860
future because they know that, that if I have to do a cost

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:47.840
optimization, so layoff is not the only option, maybe

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.940
reusability is done on another option. So where I will end

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:53.420
up saving time and money and I will, I will end up acquiring

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:57.520
more and more client if I'm able to save my, uh, like a time

00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:02.780
of my employees. So here project product, PRD, LLD, HLD and

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:07.560
many more X, Y, G document, right? More X, Y, G document. So

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.940
these are the different, different like a segment or major

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:14.180
segment I can say from where I have to acquire a document,

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:18.580
the, but the problem is right. The problem is that, that

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:22.520
every team is trying to maintain their document, but it's

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.940
available into a complete different format in a different

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:30.520
places possibility, right? Pretty much possible. For

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:33.200
example, my HR team is trying to maintain the document they

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:35.460
are trying to maintain everything in a PDF form. Maybe. Or

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:37.900
maybe into a word doc format, maybe into a PowerPoint

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:41.200
format. Yeah. And they are trying to keep their document,

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:45.440
everything on a, maybe a Google drive or maybe on a one

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.240
drive. They are trying to maintain it, right? Maybe my

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.500
finance team is trying to keep everything on a SharePoint.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:54.140
Yes. Maybe my legal team is trying to like, you know,

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:57.040
maintain each and everything on a S3 bucket or maybe on a

00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:02.080
Azure blobs. Yes. So we have a multiple team, we have a

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.480
multiple sources, but with these multiple teams, we have

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:08.740
these kind of a sources, again, problem comes into a

00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:11.840
picture. So I have to deal with when I'm working on this

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:14.760
kind of a project. So I have to deal with a multiple format

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:18.020
of the file system, right? And that too, with the

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:20.900
heterogeneous sources, heterogeneous sources means some,

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.480
something is available on a SharePoint. Something is

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.940
available on a Slack or team space. Something is available

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:28.420
on a Google drive. Something is available on a S3 bucket.

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:31.100
Something is available on a Azure blob. Something is

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:34.000
available inside my, my SQL or MS SQL databases. Something

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.860
is available on my MongoDB databases or maybe in a Neo4j

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:42.060
database. Something is available. So basically I have to

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:47.140
create a design or create this ingestion layer in such a way

00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:51.120
that my system should be able to connect with all of those

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:54.600
system. It should be able to do an incremental load because

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.140
they will keep on updating the document. And again, so I

00:34:57.140 --> 00:35:00.640
should not parse or process the old document that I had. So

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:04.420
I have to build a system. So which will be able to connect,

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:08.120
connect with all of these systems. System these are just a

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:13.000
team right overview like a, of the team now system wise. So

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.440
I may have a data on a, maybe a SharePoint,

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:25.620
SharePoint, maybe on a Google drive, one

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.460
drive,

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:33.880
S3 bucket,

00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:41.550
Azure blobs.

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:46.010
Maybe in some SQL.

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:54.620
Maybe in some no SQL DB. So this is my first problem, right?

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.580
That my data set is available into a heterogeneous system.

00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:00.760
This is a place or there is a, this is the source. But

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:03.320
again, inside the source, again, I have a problem, right?

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:07.080
Again I have a problem that some data is available into a

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:11.740
PDF format. Some data is available into a docs format. Some

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:15.240
data is available into a PPTX format, PPT by the way. Yeah.

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:21.500
Yeah. PPT format. Some data is available into maybe a VTT

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:25.340
format, a video transcript file, right? So VTT format, some

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:30.120
data is available in some OCR or Parquet or Avro, some

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:33.280
different kind of a file format, right? Dot Excel format,

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:38.120
right? So all of these data sets are available into a JSON

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:41.180
format, maybe, maybe in XML format. So there is a multiple

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:44.100
different, different kind of a file formats, right? File

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:47.840
formats. So all of these data sets are available into a JSON

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:51.300
format. Different, different file format. Again a problem,

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:53.920
right? Let's suppose if I'm trying to capture a minutes of

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:59.220
meeting. So that is available into a audio format. Minutes

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:01.820
of meetings are available maybe into a audio format. So I

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:05.540
have to do a automatic speech recognition, ASR and TTS, text

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:08.000
to speech or speech to text. I have to implement over here.

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:12.720
So again, my complexity has increased, right? Multiple

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:17.440
sources and multiple file type inside a particular sources.

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:19.200
And I can do that. So I can't go back and say that, that,

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.160
okay, no, you should give me a data in only in this manner.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:24.820
No one is going to give you by the way, right? No one is

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:27.940
because they're not like, uh, these teams are not like, uh,

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:30.640
uh, meant for that, right? They're, they're not like getting

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:33.140
paid for like giving you a data. Basically you are a tech

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:35.000
team. So obviously, and you are designing this entire

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.480
things. So it's, it's your responsibility to handle it the

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:41.440
way it is. Otherwise, if you're going to ask your HR finance

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:45.160
and legal team to do it, they will never do it simple. So

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:48.180
it's your responsibility. So data is scattered. Okay. Across

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:51.360
a different sources. That's one story. The another story is

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:54.420
that, that I'm talking about this one and how many such kind

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:57.900
of a document. So just to get a start with my organization

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:02.260
size is thousand employee, right? So my organization size is

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:05.440
basically thousand employees just to start with. Yes. And

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:09.620
let's suppose I'm processing a five year old document means

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:13.140
till today. So starting from today and go back to the

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:16.000
timeline. So basically I'm, I'm processing a five year

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.160
document. So in the total approximately I have to process 1

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:23.860
million docs basically, including all of this format. So

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:26.580
almost a 1 million docs or 10 lakh docs, which I'm talking

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:31.140
about on an average, right? So this is the total document

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:34.920
which I'm processing. And again, so an average size of this

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:38.900
document, let's say because 1 million document is not a like

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:41.640
a something which you can quantify. So in terms of

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:44.560
quantifying something. So maybe an average size of this

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:50.260
document is around 20 million. 25 MB to 30 MB because you

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:52.780
have to quantify it so that you will be able to do a exact

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:55.740
calculation in terms of compute, in terms of APIs and many

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:59.460
things. So maybe this is the average size of the document,

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:03.220
25 MB to 30 MB and 1 million document I have to process

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:07.440
since last five year for thousands of employees. So a

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:11.000
company with capacity of thousand employees. So this is

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.060
again create a hurdle for me. This is again going to create

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:18.500
a bottleneck for me. Because size will increase or decrease.

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:22.760
So entire stats is going to change, right? So every

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.800
everything is going to change again when I'm going to talk,

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:27.880
I'll be talking about the second label, sorry, this one cost

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:32.160
label, you will be able to see that cost is going to

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:35.660
fluctuate a lot when these metrics are going to move or

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:42.540
these KPIs are going to move. So I have 10,000 sorry, 1000

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:45.180
employees, five year document I'm trying to process 1

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:47.320
million, 1 million in total document I have on an average

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.860
document size is 25 MB to 30 MB. So that that's a story that

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:55.200
I have and I have to build a system which can give an answer

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:58.940
to everyone for everything. The another problem that I have

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:03.540
is that that under, under some of the document, right? Some

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:08.880
PDFs or maybe into a PPTs, I have a data available, but

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:13.640
those data's are available, not just in a plain text. Maybe

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.780
those data sets are available. In a image format. So maybe

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:20.860
inside a PDF, maybe inside a docs, maybe inside a PPT, I

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:24.740
have a data, right? But not available in a plain text. It's

00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:30.240
available as a image. Another problem, right? So data set is

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:34.440
available again as a image because obviously if I have to

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:37.360
parse a PDF, so maybe I can use some of the libraries, maybe

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:40.660
PI to PDF libraries I can try to use. I will be able to read

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:44.880
all the PDFs, but if inside a PDF or document, if I have a

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:48.360
images if I have a complex formulas or something like that,

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:53.120
I will not be able to read it with the help of PI to PDF. So

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:56.420
maybe I'll have to identify something different, right?

00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:00.000
Maybe I have to, maybe, maybe there are numbers or there is

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.020
something inside the images. So maybe I have to go for some

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:07.200
sort of OCR. Maybe I have to go for maybe a Google document,

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:11.300
AI kind of a system where I can take a help of it and I will

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:14.920
be able to even understand, uh, this, uh, images. So

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:20.060
basically I'm talking about a multi-model system, yes, multi

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:23.940
-model system. And again, uh, in my document, so let's

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:26.680
suppose my company is working across a different, different

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:30.560
reasons, means different, different country, right? So all

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:35.260
of these documents data is not available in a plain English.

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:38.780
Some of this data set is available in a Spanish, maybe in

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:41.680
Chinese, maybe in Hindi, maybe in some regional languages.

00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:46.740
So again, I have to process. Uh, multiple languages, even

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:49.620
inside a data. So I'm not just talking about the single,

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:52.600
like simple plain textual information over here. I'm talking

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:56.940
about the image information. So now my complicity has

00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:59.580
increased once again, yes, everyone.

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:09.040
Yeah. So again, my complicity has increased on another

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:11.420
label. So let me write it down over here. I don't worry

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:13.360
anyhow, the document, which I'm going to share the story

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.980
document. So in that it will be mentioned, uh, I have

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:18.480
already prepared, but yeah, uh, I'll write it down over

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:21.860
here. So inside a document. So again, my complicity is that,

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:26.480
that I have a image based data. And again, I have some

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:31.700
problem like, uh, I have basically, uh, over here, multiple

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:34.840
language. So multi language

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:44.180
inside my data set. So I have to take care of these things

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:48.260
as well. Now this is basically a data ingestion layer and it

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:52.200
always comes with the complexity, right? Plus. I have to. I

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:55.160
have to even like, uh, pass those data. I have to even

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:59.000
identify that if some data set is not required, let's try to

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000
filter it out. Not just this, not just this, I would say. So

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.260
apart from that, right? So I have to maintain our meta data,

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:12.220
meta data management as

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.080
well. It's again, a very crucial part, metadata management.

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:21.060
Maybe many of us are not able to think as of now that why

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:23.540
this metadata comes into a picture, but believe me. In terms

00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:26.160
of searching, in terms of indexing, in terms of giving a

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:30.540
citation, it's important, right? It's important. So again, a

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:34.660
meta data management for 1 million record, just imagine. So

00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:38.700
it's a very, very huge task for me, right? It's a huge task

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:42.800
for me because then only I will be able to build a robust, I

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:45.740
will be able to build a solid RIG system. Generally people

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:49.040
think that that RIG system is what, uh, try to send all of

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:52.640
those data into a vector databases. And then, uh, start like

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:56.280
integrating LLMs and then chat with it. Bingo. My RIG system

00:43:56.280 --> 00:44:01.020
is ready, but no, lot of design, lot of architecture, lot of

00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:05.920
concept falls inside RIG kind of a system or this kind of a

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:09.020
system. If you are trying to create in a real time, yeah,

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.720
uh, for a learning purpose, if you're doing it, then you

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:14.100
will not be able to find out that complex. And I believe

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:17.480
that is true for everything. Uh, but, uh, if you're trying

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:21.180
to build it, something for enterprise grade. Obviously these

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:24.960
things are pretty much obvious, uh, nothing new for anyone

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:28.360
who is like a working in such kind of a system by the way.

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:32.160
So fine. So these are the different, different problems that

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:35.840
I have just on one single layer, which is what, which is

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:38.360
basically a ingestion layer. So I'm just talking about the

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:41.580
ingestion layer, right? Multiple team, multiple sources,

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:44.120
multiple different different type. These are the metrics

00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:46.880
that I have to take care and then again inside this multiple

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:51.340
problem statement. With respect to the data. So here, right?

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:58.640
So here I need a team, right here I need a team. So first of

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:02.980
all, who will be able to connect with each and every team as

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:07.000
spoke, right spoke. So who will be able to connect and who

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.460
will be able to identify all the data sources? Because there

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:11.360
is a very high possibility that even they are not

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:14.260
maintaining it, even they are not maintaining it, even they

00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:18.320
are not maintaining it, right? So I need a spoke. First of

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:21.900
all, I need someone from a project management side or maybe

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:25.740
my lead or maybe my manager, what they will do. So they will

00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:28.440
try to connect with all of these teams across the

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.940
organization, right? Because a regular connects are required

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:35.360
so that they can give an instruction that, okay, so reveal

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:39.540
all the sources, basically check the citation, check

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:42.200
basically a Meta information. Meta information means a

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:45.300
document page or maybe who is the author who has, who was

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:48.000
the approver each and everything. If it is not mentioned by

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.700
default, it will be mentioned. But yeah, if it is not

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:53.720
mentioned, then try to maintain those things. And then once

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:57.600
this has been maintained parallelly, so I have to keep my

00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:01.000
tech team ready. A team who knows how to write the APIs or

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.180
team who know how to write just a Python code or maybe a

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:08.700
backend server. So I need a team who will end up writing a

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:12.560
connector, connector for all of these sources. They will

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:14.540
just write a connectors basically. So connect with the

00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:16.560
SharePoint, connect with the Google drive. OneDrive, S3

00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:19.700
bucket, Azure, SQL, NoSQL, they will write the connectors,

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:22.520
right? They will write the connector. So maybe I need one or

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:24.840
two people over here. So who is just having an understanding

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:27.760
about, and that too in a secure manner, right? That too in a

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.200
secure manner. So we'll write basically a backend, a

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:32.720
backend, which will be able to connect with all of these

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:37.140
sources. Now there is a possibility that, uh, uh, their

00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:40.400
frequency of the data is very high. So obviously I have to

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:44.060
create a pipeline that, okay, fine. So like, uh, this is

00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:45.760
timestamp. This is timestamp. Let's try this. Let's try to

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:48.520
process this data, something like that. So I need a team. So

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:51.360
who will write a connector, who will try to fetch a data and

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:53.780
in a scheduled manner, basically in a scheduled manner,

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.900
because it's not like, uh, the data that we are fetching as

00:46:56.900 --> 00:47:00.580
of now. So it will not change. There is a possibility that

00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:03.400
another day, so maybe team will try to dump another data,

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:05.800
right? So I have to write my system. I have to schedule my

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:09.660
system. I have to write my watcher basically. So which will

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:12.120
keep on watching a particular place, maybe a SharePoint,

00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:16.940
maybe a Google drive, maybe a Slack, right? A teams, maybe a

00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:19.280
Slack, something like that. All of these places, it will

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:21.580
keep on watching and as soon as data will be available, it

00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:24.300
will try to pull the data on a timely basis, whatever

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:28.900
schedule. So I simply, I need a team on what this team will

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:32.460
do. So on an ingestion layer, team

00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:40.460
work wise, I'm just talking about data ingestion layer. So

00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:42.100
here, write

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:45.840
a connector,

00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:53.320
scheduler,

00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:59.170
watcher, right? So basically you will write a connector,

00:47:59.230 --> 00:48:01.350
which will connect. Across all of these data sources, then

00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:04.050
schedule it on a timely basis. You have to transfer the

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:06.370
data. You have to fetch the data from all of this

00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:09.410
heterogeneous system to your unique system and then watch

00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:11.810
it. So which will keep on watching all the incremental load

00:48:11.810 --> 00:48:15.830
of the data over there. So I need someone with expertise of

00:48:15.830 --> 00:48:18.190
like, or maybe they have, they should have understanding

00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:20.670
about a little bit about the big data, maybe a little bit

00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:23.490
about the big data. And then obviously any programming

00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:26.430
languages. So let's suppose my tech stack is Python, not

00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:29.330
Java. So I can write all these things in a Python. So for

00:48:29.330 --> 00:48:31.330
the scheduling, again, I have a multiple tools, which is

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:33.850
available to me, even for a watcher. So I can write my

00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:35.790
custom watcher, or maybe I can try to use some of the

00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:38.710
existing tool, maybe open source tool or maybe a paid tool I

00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:43.070
can try to use. So this is the very first label team work

00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:49.850
wise now. So label one, let's suppose label one, yeah, label

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:52.950
one, or generally we say layer. So layer number one. So from

00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:57.590
there we will try to connect with the data now. So if I'll

00:48:57.590 --> 00:49:01.750
talk about a layer. So layer two, or maybe I'm writing label

00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:05.690
two over here. Once I'm able to connect, once I'm able to

00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:09.110
like, I'm able to get the data from the sources, then what?

00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:16.090
So then I have to write basically a program, write basically

00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:19.410
a complete class or maybe a program, which will be able to

00:49:19.410 --> 00:49:23.310
process a different, different data sources, right? So here

00:49:23.310 --> 00:49:27.410
on a label two, my task is going to be process.

00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:34.880
Process different files. So maybe PDF file, maybe a doc

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:38.980
file, OCR file, maybe a JSON file, XML files, Parquet files,

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:43.200
or maybe a Excel sheet or anything, right? So process are

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:44.980
different, different, different, different files, because

00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:47.520
there's a possibility that from one team itself, I will end

00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:50.440
up receiving a different, different kind of files. Apart

00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:54.540
from that, this team should be able to handle, uh, images

00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:57.380
should be able to handle a multi languages and should be

00:49:57.380 --> 00:50:00.860
able to attach a meta. Okay. Data information. So again on a

00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:03.220
label two, so while handling this file, while reading this

00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:05.500
file, so obviously these things will be available inside a

00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:10.980
file itself. So I have to handle, uh, images, uh, second

00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:16.320
number. So basically I have to handle, uh, multi language.

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:23.780
I have to handle basically, uh, meta info and uh, yeah. So

00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:26.980
if I'm talking about the MOM, so maybe I have to handle

00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:31.060
audio as well. Right. Audio as well. So these are the things

00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:35.160
that I will try to do on a label too, so that I will be able

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:38.160
to process our data. At least I'm just trying to read the

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:40.940
data by the way. Yeah. I'm just trying to extract a data

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:44.560
from the original sources. That's it. So label two, my team

00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:47.380
is going to do maybe team number one or part number one. I

00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:49.840
say, let's suppose part number one. So part number one is

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:52.260
going to like, uh, again inside part number one. So I have

00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:54.980
label one team. I have label two team. Label one team is

00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:58.140
doing this. Label two team is doing this basically. Okay. So

00:50:58.140 --> 00:51:03.180
once this will be done, right? Once this will be done. So

00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:07.560
technically I'm trying to build a RAG system, right?

00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:11.720
Retrieval augmented generation system. I'm trying to build

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:14.620
over there. And again, inside this label two, when I say,

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:19.380
right, so to process our image, I have to identify which

00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:22.660
library or which API I'm supposed to use. If I'm dealing

00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:25.700
with a multi languages, again, I have to identify that which

00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:28.980
one. So every day, it's not like. You will just go ahead and

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:31.640
write all of these things immediately. No, because to

00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:35.380
process an images again to process even a different file. So

00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:38.120
I have to even check, I have to test with hundreds of files

00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:41.140
that, okay, so whether accurately I'm able to read all of

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:43.300
these data or not, because when you just write a simple

00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:45.300
plain code and it looks like that, yes, you are able to

00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:48.420
read, but you're able to read all the data, but when you

00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:51.340
test it, right, you will be able to find out that maybe you

00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:54.120
are just able to read 80% of the data 20, you are losing

00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:58.040
20%, which is used. Right? So. So this is the heavy task

00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:00.180
that we are talking about over here, right? And with the

00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:02.620
precision, you have to do all of this task because your

00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:06.640
final result ultimately depends upon this one, unless and

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:09.880
until you are not handling this, your final result will be

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:14.260
horrible, right? Which, which no one can use by the way. So

00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:16.900
process a different file than images, then multi language, I

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:19.720
have to handle a meta information. I have to handle and, uh,

00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:22.360
audio and maybe X, Y, G different, different kinds of things

00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:25.380
I'll have to handle. Like I said. So to process our images

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:27.520
again, I have to identify which API I'm supposed to use.

00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:31.560
Which model or like, uh, what kind of a technology I can try

00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:35.260
to use over here, multi-language again, which model, right.

00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:38.720
Comes into a picture, meta information. So how to handle a

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:40.920
meta information, what to keep inside a meta information,

00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:43.480
what not to keep inside the meta information, whether it's

00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:46.380
going to be a useful or not in terms of doing a worsening in

00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:49.320
terms of doing a deduplications and in terms of giving me

00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:52.040
the correct exact like a document out of it or citation out

00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:54.500
of it. So many, many things which comes into a picture

00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:57.520
again, audio wise, right? So how precisely you are able to.

00:52:57.540 --> 00:53:00.140
To handle the audios because every audio will be very, very

00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:02.520
different, right? There will be a lot of hiccups. There will

00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:04.840
be a lot of fumbling inside the audio. There will be a lot

00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:08.140
of like, uh, uh, breakup. There will be a lot of people who

00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:10.720
will be talking inside one single audio. If I'll talk about

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:12.800
the minutes of meeting, it's not just like one people,

00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:15.940
right? So you have to basically do the segregation between

00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:18.860
all of these, like, uh, people who is talking. So maybe you

00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:21.560
have to call ASR over there, automatic speech recognition,

00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:25.440
ASR inside this one. And then you have to call a speech to

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:29.000
text again. So many things, a lot of work, right? A lot of

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.020
work with the precision that you will have to do. So again,

00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:34.300
a huge workforce will be required over here, right? Huge

00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:36.980
workforce, a talented one, talented one, experienced one,

00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:40.640
which will be required on a label to work. Level one work is

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:42.900
quite simpler, but yeah, if I'll talk about the label to

00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:47.440
work, it's not that simple by the way. Now label three, I'm

00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:49.480
able to process, let's suppose I'm able to identify all of

00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:52.600
this technology. Now label three, label

00:53:58.070 --> 00:54:01.290
three. So once I'm able to do this one, right? Once. Once

00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:04.770
I'm able to do this one, then what I'm supposed to perform.

00:54:05.050 --> 00:54:10.030
So basically I'm supposed to do the indexing of the data.

00:54:10.590 --> 00:54:14.750
Yeah. My data set is ready, right? So I have to do a

00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:17.850
indexing of the data, which is also a part of ingestion

00:54:17.850 --> 00:54:20.390
layer, or maybe you can try to separate it. Now what does

00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:23.310
the meaning of indexing of the data? So indexing of the

00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:26.890
data, or let me like, uh, keep it separate. I can keep it

00:54:26.890 --> 00:54:29.310
inside the ingestion layer, or maybe I can try to write it

00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:30.510
down separately over here.

00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:39.940
So indexing of data. Now this is something that we have been

00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:42.020
doing since a very, very long time with respect to RAG.

00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:46.320
Right? Indexing means what? Storing this data into a vector

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:50.320
db. That's called as indexing. Yes. So vector db, because

00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:53.960
ultimately I need all of my data set into a vector db. But

00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:59.680
when I say indexing of the data, so which vector db, right?

00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:02.900
What kind of a search technique we are supposed to use? So

00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:04.880
basically are, are we supposed to go out with the code? Are

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:06.540
we supposed to go ahead with the cosine similarity or we are

00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:08.960
supposed to go ahead with the dot product or we are supposed

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:11.420
to go ahead with the Euclidean distances or we are supposed

00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:16.400
to go ahead with the BM 25, uh, best matching 25, right, or

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:19.460
we are supposed to go ahead with the hybrid approach with

00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:22.740
respect to my dense vector and sparse vector. Many questions

00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:26.360
again arises over here. Many means literally many questions

00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:29.040
again arises over here. The very first question will be

00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:33.840
which databases, right? Are we supposed to use a pine cone?

00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:38.260
Or maybe a quadrant or maybe a baby yet, or maybe a Facebook

00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:42.540
as in that research or maybe a Google chroma db or maybe a

00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:47.040
Mongo db or maybe some other X, Y, G. Yes. So again, many

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:51.020
question arises over here and to answer this question that

00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:55.060
which database I should select them. Cost also plays a vital

00:55:55.060 --> 00:56:00.100
role, right? Cost versus latency. So basically cost also

00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:03.060
going to play a major role over here in terms of making a

00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:07.160
decision. That which database I'm supposed to select and

00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:10.400
where I'm hosting it. So are we supposed to like, are we

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:13.820
looking for some databases which I can like a self host or

00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:17.200
I'm looking for some of the databases which where they

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:20.280
provide a hosting, right? For example, if I'll talk about a

00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:22.420
quadrant, if I'll talk about a baby, if I'll talk about a

00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:26.220
pine cone, they are providing you a hosting, right? And

00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:28.600
again, you can kind of be the AWS or your GCP. So they have

00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:30.460
that feature. They have that facility. But yeah, through

00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:32.940
their portal, through their dashboard, you will be able to

00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:35.240
connect it. Okay. Or maybe I can go ahead with the Facebook

00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:38.460
as a search or maybe a ChromaDV and I can try to spin my own

00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:41.140
server, my own instances and then inside that I can

00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:43.960
configure it. Right? So likewise, there are multiple other

00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:48.140
databases which also have level into a market, right? So

00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:51.700
basically I can try to go ahead with the like a self-served

00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:55.980
or maybe I can go ahead with the managed one depends, right?

00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:59.180
That depends upon my cost. That depends upon the latency. So

00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:01.600
obviously here deal happens between organization to

00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:03.400
organization. So obviously you will be able to get

00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:05.760
everything. Everyone is going to offer you the best deal and

00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:08.840
then your managers, managers are going to decide that, okay,

00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:12.880
so we have to go with which one. And if you have decided as

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:15.280
an architect that no, we should not go with anyone. Maybe I

00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:19.120
can do this entire things in an optimized way by hosting

00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:21.520
this entire things in my environment. That's also fine,

00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:24.720
right? So if you have a huge concern with the security, if

00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:27.340
you don't have a trust on over the other organization, then

00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:30.700
in that case, go ahead with your own like a hosting, but

00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:34.600
that's okay. Basically. Okay. That's all of the data. Now

00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:38.260
let's suppose, let's suppose I have selected, uh, maybe

00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:45.700
vector database wise chroma DB, yes, which I can self host

00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:51.240
or maybe I'm going to select pinecone pinecone. So pinecone,

00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:54.100
I can't host it by the way. So I have to use their system

00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:56.980
and from their system so I can connect to my own AWS. That

00:57:56.980 --> 00:57:59.220
option is available, right? That option is available with

00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:02.120
respect to pinecone or maybe Azure or maybe GCP. I can even

00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:05.200
connect all three major cloud provider. I will be able to

00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:07.900
connect in case of chroma DB. So obviously I have to spend

00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:10.760
my own server, my own instances and then I have to like

00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:14.220
maintain it. Chroma DB is also providing you that dashboard

00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:16.900
that facilities, but yeah, chroma DB is also like open

00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:18.900
source. So you can try to download it and you can try to

00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:22.540
self serve it like a Facebook as in that as well. Yeah. But

00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:26.460
you'll have to maintain your own cluster. So in, in case of

00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:28.880
self serving, in case of like a going out with these

00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:32.480
services, you don't have to maintain manage. So maybe it is

00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:35.520
going to cost you a little bit higher. But they are going to

00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:37.560
do a work for you. You don't have to worry about anything.

00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:42.760
Yeah. A super base generally for experimentation. It's fine.

00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:47.960
I was not able to like a, I was not convinced with respect

00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:51.640
to our production users by the way. Yeah. A lot of promotion

00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:54.200
is going on with respect to super base. Many people are

00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:59.060
using it in terms of developing their like a MVPs and POCs

00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:04.720
as of now. But maybe it will take time. Right. To reach

00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:07.060
there. So we're in a production system, people will start

00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:12.660
using it sooner or later. It will happen now. So can

00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:15.940
VectorDB deploy as a microservice on AKS? Obviously you can

00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:17.700
deploy on a AKS as a microservices.

00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:26.490
Yes, basically you can deploy a like a chroma DB on AKS, AKS

00:59:26.490 --> 00:59:31.350
or EKS anywhere you can deploy it or GKS in all three cloud

00:59:31.350 --> 00:59:34.630
you can deploy it. So EKS, AKS and GKS everywhere you can

00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:38.770
deploy it. Right. So yeah. Chroma DB. Even Facebook, even ID

00:59:38.770 --> 00:59:41.330
search, you can deploy it on AKS, EKS and GKS all three

00:59:41.330 --> 00:59:46.390
places now. So we have to deploy this one that that's like a

00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:51.810
one thing right on an indexing layer. Now while, sorry, so

00:59:51.810 --> 00:59:56.830
while configuring this databases, obviously, so I have to

00:59:56.830 --> 01:00:01.590
indexing of the data. Yeah. So basically I have to prepare

01:00:01.590 --> 01:00:05.050
maybe a deduplication and versing logic. Yeah.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:10.440
Deduplication

01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:17.470
and data worsening because this is important, right? You

01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:19.730
can't like end up storing the same data again and again and

01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:22.010
again inside the same system because unnecessarily you will

01:00:22.010 --> 01:00:26.150
end up occupying the space. So you have to handle a

01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:29.410
deduplication. You have to do a worsening of the data

01:00:29.410 --> 01:00:31.050
because there is a possibility that there will be an

01:00:31.050 --> 01:00:33.790
updates, right? So obviously you have to delete a previous

01:00:33.790 --> 01:00:37.930
chunk and then you have to ingest a new chunk. Then when I

01:00:37.930 --> 01:00:41.230
said chunk, so obviously we have to talk about a chunking

01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:42.490
and overlapping strategy.

01:00:46.090 --> 01:00:46.450
Chunking

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:52.080
overlapping strategy that what should be my chunk size,

01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:55.320
right? And what should be the overlap when we are talking

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:58.380
about indexing of the data. So not just this, right? Not

01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:02.640
just this. We have to even talk about embedding

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:09.040
models because you are talking about indexing. Now what you

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:12.080
will store inside the vector DB. Can I say embedding? Yes.

01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:15.700
Technically you are going to store embeddings of the data,

01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:18.560
right? The vector of the data inside a vector DB. Yes,

01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:27.260
everyone. I think now you guys can participate, yep. So

01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:30.300
embeddings, so when embedding comes into a picture, I

01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:33.620
believe we all know we have millions of options, not just

01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:37.560
one, right? We have millions of options for embeddings. So

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:41.680
we can try to use like a lot of, so again I have an option

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:45.900
basically with me. In case of embeddings, shall I go ahead

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:49.680
with the API approach or shall I go ahead with a local?

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:53.400
Local models. Local model means a model which I can, or open

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:59.030
source I can say, right? So again API approach means so

01:01:59.030 --> 01:02:03.090
Google is providing you API, open AI is providing you API.

01:02:03.290 --> 01:02:06.010
So again inside URI, inside URI you have an embedding model,

01:02:06.110 --> 01:02:08.750
right? Which embedding model by the way guys? I will come to

01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:11.470
dimension. Just wait. First of all let's talk about models.

01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:16.850
So again inside like a URI, I believe you all are aware

01:02:16.850 --> 01:02:21.270
about embedding inside URI, right? Yeah. So text three

01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:24.650
small, basically embedding that we are giving you where

01:02:24.650 --> 01:02:28.790
dimension is one, five, three, six, right? So open AI small,

01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:32.050
yeah. So open AI text three small model access that we are

01:02:32.050 --> 01:02:36.750
giving you as a part of like a Euron basically. So API and

01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:41.650
again I can go to hugging phase and on a hugging phase I

01:02:41.650 --> 01:02:44.650
have like a thousands, thousands, not thousands, I would say

01:02:44.650 --> 01:02:48.450
tens of thousands, right, a model access, open source model

01:02:48.450 --> 01:02:53.290
access. So where I can use it for a embeddings, right? I can

01:02:53.290 --> 01:02:55.750
use it for a embeddings, a dense embedding. This is

01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:58.070
technically called as dense embedding. If I have to go out

01:02:58.070 --> 01:03:00.670
with a sparse in that case I will end up using maybe a

01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:05.190
TFIDF, maybe I will end up using some other vectorization

01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:07.950
technique, bag of word kind of a technique in case of a

01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:11.110
sparse. But yeah, I'm looking for, let's suppose a dense,

01:03:11.290 --> 01:03:14.050
right? A dense vector. I believe we all understand

01:03:14.050 --> 01:03:17.230
difference between a sparse and a dense vector. I think

01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:19.090
yesterday itself. I have given you a definition in your

01:03:19.090 --> 01:03:22.590
generative AI class when I was like discussing about the

01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:27.910
project, right? So here I have to create a dense vector.

01:03:28.170 --> 01:03:31.590
Dense vector means non-zero vectors by the way, right? Now I

01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:34.450
have options. Go ahead with the APIs or go ahead with the

01:03:34.450 --> 01:03:37.950
locals. Now again, in case of APIs, I have tons of options.

01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:41.810
In case of local, again, I have a tons of options, right?

01:03:42.730 --> 01:03:46.470
And everyone will be having a pros and cons. So here I'm

01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:49.430
talking about. A multi-language, right? I have already

01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:52.290
mentioned multi-language. So whenever I'm trying to select a

01:03:52.290 --> 01:03:56.070
model, I should keep all of these things in a mind, all of

01:03:56.070 --> 01:03:58.250
these things in a mind, and I have to configure, I have to

01:03:58.250 --> 01:04:01.470
write a system in that way. So if there is an image, use

01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:04.410
this. If there is a multi-language, first of all, identify,

01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:08.910
then use this, use this, right? So it's not just a simple

01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:11.410
pipeline that I'm talking about. It's not just a simple, a

01:04:11.410 --> 01:04:13.510
single line of, and these are the edge cases, by the way,

01:04:13.530 --> 01:04:16.930
right? These are basically the edge cases. So. So you can go

01:04:16.930 --> 01:04:20.990
ahead and select the model, but not blindly, right? It's not

01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:23.630
like you will go and use UD API everywhere and it is going

01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:27.010
to work for everything. No, not like that. Because it

01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:29.770
depends upon the data, right? Obviously it is going to

01:04:29.770 --> 01:04:32.630
convert everything into a numeric, but I'm not looking for

01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:35.530
just a numeric value. I'm looking for something which can

01:04:35.530 --> 01:04:38.990
derive the relations basically, right? Which can derive the

01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:41.330
relation. Unless and until I'm not going to derive the

01:04:41.330 --> 01:04:43.030
relation, what I will do with those numerical values?

01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:45.390
Nothing technically, right? I will not be able to do

01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:50.470
anything. So here, right? So here, I mean, I have to talk

01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:54.290
about the APIs and I have to be maybe API based approach and

01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:58.930
maybe local model or maybe mix hybrid because nature of my

01:04:58.930 --> 01:05:01.070
data will change. So obviously like these things will

01:05:01.070 --> 01:05:05.130
change. So I have to go ahead with either of these two

01:05:05.130 --> 01:05:07.810
approach or maybe a hybrid approach. So I have to select

01:05:07.810 --> 01:05:12.110
those models, right? Select those models. Uh, so obviously,

01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:14.510
uh, once I will be able to select those models. Uh. Once I

01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:16.610
select those models, then it will automatically define the

01:05:16.610 --> 01:05:20.490
size of the vector because size depends upon what? Model

01:05:20.490 --> 01:05:24.250
size? Sorry, size of the vector depends upon what? Model

01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:31.010
output, right? So size or vector size, vector size will be

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:33.610
defined automatically. So for example, if I'm using like a

01:05:33.610 --> 01:05:36.850
open AI text three small model, so we all know that size is

01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:38.990
basically one, five, three, six. So whatever vector it is

01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:41.510
going to create, it is going to create it with the one,

01:05:41.610 --> 01:05:44.730
five, three, six, uh, numeric values. Right? Dense numeric

01:05:44.730 --> 01:05:46.890
values, by the way. Yeah. To be precise, dense numeric

01:05:46.890 --> 01:05:49.950
values where like almost all the data will be non-zero.

01:05:50.350 --> 01:05:52.430
Again, if I'm going to use some different models, so we have

01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:56.710
even seen that, that maybe like a 4,000, 24, maybe seven,

01:05:56.850 --> 01:06:00.370
six, 68, there's a possibility. So different model will be

01:06:00.370 --> 01:06:03.950
having a different, different output size. And uh, once my

01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:06.310
selection will be done, embedding model selection will be

01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:10.750
done. This will be fixed automatically and then the same

01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:13.890
will be fixed inside my databases. So whenever I'm trying to

01:06:13.890 --> 01:06:16.390
create the indexing over here, so obviously I'll try to

01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:19.710
create an indexing with this particular size that I'm going

01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:24.650
to define. Is it making sense guys till this second layer,

01:06:24.790 --> 01:06:27.130
indexing layer, any confusion?

01:06:29.710 --> 01:06:31.050
Yeah. Making sense?

01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:38.400
Yeah. So I think we are, we are able to like, you know,

01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:43.660
unwrap layers. Right. We, we never think in this way, I

01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:49.320
believe. Yeah. We never think in this way. Like not all of

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:52.780
the concepts. We are considering all of these factors, you

01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:55.120
know, this is where this, this kind of a class comes into

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:57.600
picture where we don't write a code. We do write a code, but

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:00.100
in other classes, but yeah. So in this kind of a classes, we

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:02.220
just talk about these things because these things are

01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:06.140
literally pretty much important, uh, basically. So okay.

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:08.740
Indexing of the data. Now this is done. Let's suppose I'm

01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:10.760
able to create the indexing. I'm able to select the model

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:13.440
hybrid approach. So whenever someone is going to ask you a

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:15.540
question, always go with the hybrid approach. Never say

01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:17.560
that, no, I have used this model or that model because we

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:20.240
all know that one is not going to solve your problem. We all

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:22.700
are aware about it by the way. Yeah. That one is not going

01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:24.820
to solve the problem. Take three force name that. Okay.

01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:27.520
Fine. I, for images I have taken this for you. OCR. Have you

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:30.880
used maybe a EGOCR or Amazon Tracer act I have used, right?

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:34.640
So always, always go in that flow so that, you know, in an

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:37.820
interview you have to convince people that you have a lot of

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:40.960
knowledge and you have already used it. So never go over to

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:46.320
one point, always hybrid multiples. Yes. So much things to

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:48.540
be considered. So you can do before starting a work. Okay.

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:51.720
All are as it depends on costing. Many things, not just

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:54.440
costing, costing, latency, resource availability that you

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:57.040
have, the timeline that you have in your hand, team strength

01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:00.180
that you have. So it's not just one factor which matters

01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:03.760
when we start developing the product. See idea, that's the

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:06.680
reason we keep on saying that, that anyone can get an idea.

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:11.060
But execution is tough. It's literally tough, right? You

01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:13.600
have to work 24 by seven for maybe a very, very long time.

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:16.420
And then you will be able to build something like a, which

01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:19.240
is going to be very, very helpful for some organization or

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:24.300
which you can sell. Yeah. It's very useful for a LinkedIn

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:26.900
exposure. So I'm expecting some LinkedIn post, by the way,

01:08:28.230 --> 01:08:32.610
correct interviewer, I don't even know that much. Yes, I

01:08:32.610 --> 01:08:35.510
mean, those who are working, they will know. I mean, it may

01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:38.430
not be complete, but they will know. I mean, if you work

01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:40.710
once, it happens that you don't see a lot of edge cases.

01:08:41.490 --> 01:08:44.410
There is a very high chance that even for a people who is

01:08:44.410 --> 01:08:46.930
working, maybe they have not gone through all the, you know,

01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:54.010
edge cases at a time. Yes. Okay. Now. So indexing is done. I

01:08:54.010 --> 01:08:56.930
think now we are able to freeze our, like, uh, till this

01:08:56.930 --> 01:08:59.270
point, right? So till this point we are able to freeze the

01:08:59.270 --> 01:09:01.530
embedding models. Now which embedding model? Don't worry.

01:09:01.630 --> 01:09:03.730
I'll give you the list of it. Right. You have to select only

01:09:03.730 --> 01:09:07.290
two or three out of it. Uh, so let's suppose we are able to

01:09:07.290 --> 01:09:10.790
do an indexing. Now my data is available in my vector DB.

01:09:11.250 --> 01:09:16.070
Yes. My data is able to reach out to my vector DB. So

01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:19.990
indexing layer is done. Yes. Indexing layer is done. But.

01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:23.350
But, uh, parallel to this indexing layer, right, parallel to

01:09:23.350 --> 01:09:27.530
this indexing layer. So you have to also build retrieval

01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:31.290
layer because indexing layer is all about storing a data,

01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:36.170
right? But you have to work on third layer and which we can

01:09:36.170 --> 01:09:37.730
call as a retrieval layer

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:48.220
retrieval and you can say RAG layer.

01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:52.830
Now you, you will say that, okay, so what, what about this

01:09:52.830 --> 01:09:55.730
retrieval or RAG layer? So we'll send a query. It will try

01:09:55.730 --> 01:09:57.890
to do a cosine similarity or maybe Euclidean distance or

01:09:57.890 --> 01:10:02.550
maybe a dot product and I will be able to get the data. I'm

01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:06.150
like, is it, is it that simple guys? Generally this is the

01:10:06.150 --> 01:10:08.710
thought that you will get, right? When I say retrieval or

01:10:08.710 --> 01:10:10.850
RAG layer. So what, what is, what is, what is something that

01:10:10.850 --> 01:10:14.370
comes in your mind that, okay, I'll fire the query. We have

01:10:14.370 --> 01:10:17.350
query will get converted into a vector space. Vector to

01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:19.330
vector matching will happen maybe with the help of cosine,

01:10:19.530 --> 01:10:24.950
Euclidean or maybe dot product. Right. Or IP. And uh. I'll

01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:30.450
get the top K. Yes, I'll get the top K. Is it that simple?

01:10:31.170 --> 01:10:31.530
Really?

01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:41.200
Yeah. Generally this is, we, we think about, right? So we as

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:43.280
a learner, we generally think about that. Okay. This is how

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:46.480
easy it is. Uh, because that, that is something. Yeah. Same

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:49.200
thought. Yeah. Generally it's, it's completely okay to get

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:52.240
this kind of a thought because this is how we think. Right.

01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:55.800
This is how we think. But this is not that simple. Right.

01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:59.000
This is, this is not that simple. You see. So, uh, when we

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.360
talk about a retrieval, right, when we talk about the

01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:06.620
retrieval, so basically we are trying to store the data as a

01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:09.980
dense vector, right? Dense vector means as a non zero value.

01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:12.220
So whatever dimension that we have, let's suppose one, five,

01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:15.920
three, six or seven 68, all of these like a data or numeric

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:18.580
values will be non zeros. Simply means that we are talking

01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:22.180
about the dense vector if it is a sparse in the sparse will

01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:25.400
be used basically for non semantic use cases where we have

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:28.240
to do a exact keyword matching. Right. So at that point of

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:30.960
our time we can end up using a sparse, otherwise we will end

01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:34.560
up using basically a dense, right? Dense wherever semantic

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:37.040
comes into a pictures, right? Semantic comes into pictures.

01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:42.720
So, uh, basically, uh, when we talk about a retrieval,

01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:47.180
right, when we talk about a retrieval, so my previous layer,

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:51.820
this one obviously plays a very important role because if my

01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:55.240
embeddings are actually good, right? When I say actually

01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:57.860
good. Good. That means it is able to understand the semantic

01:11:57.860 --> 01:12:01.880
meanings for images, for OCRs or for maybe a simple plain

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:04.880
text, which I'm talking about, obviously it is going to help

01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:07.600
me out a lot in terms of, you know, retrieving a data in

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:11.440
terms of indexing a data into a better manner. But apart

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:15.380
from that, so generally, uh, we try to generally, we have

01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:17.940
seen that, that we try to go ahead with a cosine similarity

01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:20.320
kind of a things, right? Cosine similarity kind of a things

01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:24.340
or maybe equilibrium distances, but in our production grade

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:29.500
system. So we try to go ahead with a hybrid approach, hybrid

01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:35.850
approach. So where we try to do a cosine plus

01:12:38.570 --> 01:12:42.970
we try to do maybe a BM, uh, 25 kind of a ranking best

01:12:42.970 --> 01:12:46.010
matching 25 kind of a ranking. So this is for a dense kind

01:12:46.010 --> 01:12:48.690
of a vector and this is basically for a sparse kind of

01:12:48.690 --> 01:12:51.790
vector. So when we try to combine these kind of approach,

01:12:52.250 --> 01:12:54.710
right, even on a cosine side, we have a multiple approach.

01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:57.210
BM 25 side. We have a multiple approach. Best matching 25.

01:12:57.590 --> 01:13:01.070
Right side. We have a multiple approaches. So we try to

01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:05.050
basically up apply this kind of a hybrid approach in terms

01:13:05.050 --> 01:13:09.390
of retrieving a document in terms of matching a document,

01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:14.330
right? In terms of matching a document. Now once I will be

01:13:14.330 --> 01:13:18.470
able to match a document and let's suppose for every request

01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:23.030
we are able to like extract maybe a 30 document, let's,

01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:26.810
let's imagine 30 document for every query top 30, right? We

01:13:26.810 --> 01:13:30.210
are able to retrieve. And then we'll again try to do the

01:13:30.210 --> 01:13:32.590
experimentation that whether we are able to capture a

01:13:32.590 --> 01:13:34.750
context or not because majority of time you will end up

01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:38.310
facing and problem issue that you are able to retrieve our

01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:42.830
top 30 based on this course. But uh, again, it is not able

01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:47.450
to cover the whole context of the query, right? Or maybe it

01:13:47.450 --> 01:13:50.710
is like a leaving out something and there can be a problem

01:13:50.710 --> 01:13:54.130
for a multiple side. There is a possibility that you have

01:13:54.130 --> 01:13:57.650
done a checking, which is very, very small possible. Okay.

01:13:57.670 --> 01:14:00.150
Let's suppose my chuck size itself is very small, maybe a

01:14:00.150 --> 01:14:03.310
hundred. So a hundred, a hundred, a hundred, a hundred. So

01:14:03.310 --> 01:14:06.210
at max 3000. And then if I'm talking about the overlap, so

01:14:06.210 --> 01:14:10.010
it will be less than 3000 words or tokens that we will try

01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:13.190
to like a retrieving in one go. And maybe this 3000 token is

01:14:13.190 --> 01:14:16.130
not covering the entire context of my question. Are you able

01:14:16.130 --> 01:14:18.910
to understand this context guys, what I'm talking about?

01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:25.450
Yes. If your chuck size is small, right? Let's suppose a

01:14:25.450 --> 01:14:27.530
hundred, a hundred is a chuck size. And then there is an

01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:30.450
overlap of 20. Okay. And let's suppose if I'm sending a

01:14:30.450 --> 01:14:34.750
query and you are retrieving a top 30 document means top 30

01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:38.930
chunks, technically you will end up extracting and there is

01:14:38.930 --> 01:14:41.210
a very high possibility that it will not be able to cover my

01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:45.650
entire context of the question. So again, I'm wrong. I'm

01:14:45.650 --> 01:14:50.950
wrong in terms of selecting my chuck size. Yes. So there are

01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:54.070
again multiple edge cases, which we try to fine tune, right?

01:14:54.170 --> 01:14:56.910
Which we try to fine tune. And generally we try to use a

01:14:56.910 --> 01:14:59.310
hybrid approach. You can go ahead with. We experiment with a

01:14:59.310 --> 01:15:01.430
cosine similarity approach and all the approaches one by

01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:05.390
one. We try to test it and then we try to do it. Not just

01:15:05.390 --> 01:15:09.310
that, not just that. So we try to use our re-ranker. So

01:15:09.310 --> 01:15:11.990
let's suppose I have extracted a 30 based on the similarity

01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:15.570
matching. That's completely fine. But maybe it is not able

01:15:15.570 --> 01:15:19.930
to create a relevancy in terms of giving the orders. So here

01:15:19.930 --> 01:15:24.030
we try to use our re-ranking technique, right? So we try to

01:15:24.030 --> 01:15:26.950
use a re-ranker. So there are multiple, many like

01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:30.370
technologies. Okay. For example, Kohira re-ranking, right?

01:15:30.430 --> 01:15:33.350
One of the famous one. One of the powerful one. But Kohira

01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:35.790
is a paid one. So you have to go ahead with maybe some of

01:15:35.790 --> 01:15:41.520
the open source over here. So re-rankers. Re-rankers we try

01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:46.660
to use over here in terms of like arranging entire things or

01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:50.820
entire output in a particular order, right? In a particular

01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:55.760
order. Then basically what we can try to do. So we try to do

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:59.900
even a context optimization, right? So re-ranking means

01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:02.080
whatever, let's suppose 30 document we are able to extract.

01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:05.780
So again, we try to like re-rank all of these things so that

01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:09.260
it will be able to arrange it in a particular order with

01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:13.660
respect to the context. Now once this is done, right? Once

01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:17.220
this is done, then we have to talk about the RAG layer. RAG

01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:20.080
layer means, so whenever someone is sending a query, it will

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:24.220
try to extract, re-rank, right? Extract means use a hybrid

01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:28.360
approach. After extraction, re-rank it. Extract it. Then in

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:32.220
terms of RAG, what will be next? So next will be, it will

01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:36.940
send our data to the LLMs. Now again, when we talk about the

01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:38.900
LLMs, so we have a multiple different, different kind of

01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:41.500
LLMs. LLMs with the research capability, LLMs which is very

01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:43.440
good with the code, LLMs which is very good with the

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:47.540
thinking basically or deep research, right? We have multiple

01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:50.480
LLMs available in a market, open source as well as

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:54.080
proprietary, yes? Open source as well as proprietary. For

01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:57.200
example, in a URI ecosystem itself. We have access of 29

01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:00.500
LLMs, not 29 LLMs. Some of them are embeddings and image. So

01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:04.760
let's say 25 LLMs, right? 25 LLMs, LLMA series, Mistral

01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:08.940
series, Open AI series, ChatGPT series basically. So ChatGPT

01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:12.560
series, Deep 6 series. So all of these LLMs are available to

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:15.440
me. Some of them are open source. Some of them are basically

01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:20.900
like a proprietary one where you have to call the APIs. You

01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:24.560
can't host it on your environment. So you have to call the

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:31.840
LLMs. Now, again, when we talk about LLMs, API or open

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:37.860
source, I have to decide again based on the cost. So if I'm

01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:41.920
calling an API and if daily number of hits are too high,

01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:45.480
right? Number of hits are too high. And again, my total

01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:48.240
context length or output length, which I'm looking for is

01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:52.020
too high. So in that case, my entire team will end up

01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:55.360
consuming the lot of like APIs, a lot of tokens, basically,

01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:58.660
right? Maybe I can try to go ahead with the open source

01:17:58.660 --> 01:18:01.180
deployment. But again, when open source deployment comes

01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:04.600
into a picture, then inferencing, right? So you have to do

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:05.200
the inferencing.

01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:11.560
And in terms of inferencing, so obviously based on the

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:16.080
nature of the model, so you have to set up a GPU, sorry, CPU

01:18:18.030 --> 01:18:23.070
or GPU kind of a system. Now when CPU, GPU comes into a

01:18:23.070 --> 01:18:25.570
picture, so again, I have to select that whether I will go

01:18:25.570 --> 01:18:28.590
ahead with the A100 or H100. Because again, inside that.

01:18:28.590 --> 01:18:31.990
There will be a multiple series, right? And then a vendor, a

01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:36.790
provider, right? And then inside of this A100 or H100. So I

01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:40.930
have to use maybe a library called as VLLM for doing the

01:18:40.930 --> 01:18:44.370
inferencing, right? Or maybe I can try to integrate some of

01:18:44.370 --> 01:18:47.170
the chat system over there. So with the help of VLLM, I can

01:18:47.170 --> 01:18:50.950
try to expose it as an API to the outer world. My own like a

01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:53.450
hosted, self-hosted model, right? Open source model, which

01:18:53.450 --> 01:18:56.970
I'm hosting. Or maybe I have done some sort of a fine

01:18:56.970 --> 01:19:00.690
tuning. And I'm using the same model even for the RAG

01:19:00.690 --> 01:19:03.790
application, possibly, right? Possible that I have done the

01:19:03.790 --> 01:19:07.770
fine tuning with respect to my data, but same model as that

01:19:07.770 --> 01:19:09.950
model is a fine tuned one, so it will be having a global

01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:12.170
knowledge as well as private knowledge, right? Both the

01:19:12.170 --> 01:19:14.610
knowledge it will be having and same model I'm trying to use

01:19:14.610 --> 01:19:17.130
it. So that will be different project. That will be

01:19:17.130 --> 01:19:19.150
different project developed by different team. But yeah,

01:19:19.190 --> 01:19:21.130
that team has already developed it. So maybe I can try to

01:19:21.130 --> 01:19:25.770
reuse those fine tuned model, right, over here, inside this

01:19:25.770 --> 01:19:31.270
RAG system, right? And maybe in that way, my entire system

01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:34.130
will be way more powerful because it is able to do RAG plus

01:19:34.130 --> 01:19:37.330
it is having knowledge wise global plus it is having a

01:19:37.330 --> 01:19:40.330
private knowledge both at least till certain point timestamp

01:19:40.330 --> 01:19:43.790
by the time it has been trained, right? So till that point

01:19:43.790 --> 01:19:46.490
of time, so it is having some data knowledge, maybe not for

01:19:46.490 --> 01:19:51.790
the new data. So here we have to choose a LLMs basically a

01:19:51.790 --> 01:19:56.710
good one, a one which will be having a very good knowledge,

01:19:56.730 --> 01:19:59.570
right? Which will be quick, fast, which can do a reasoning,

01:19:59.730 --> 01:20:02.870
which can do a deep research, deep thinking or which will be

01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:05.550
able to solve my purpose technically, right? So obviously we

01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:10.090
all look for the best one plus light weighted because if I'm

01:20:10.090 --> 01:20:13.070
talking about 120 billion parameter model, 70 B parameter

01:20:13.070 --> 01:20:19.610
model, right? Again, so if model size is increasing, my cost

01:20:19.610 --> 01:20:22.530
will increase over here and this cost is not a small, this

01:20:22.530 --> 01:20:25.750
cost is again too high, too big cost, right? Too big cost.

01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:29.510
And again, so if like a number of people will increase, a

01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:33.770
number of query will increase per second. So this cost will

01:20:33.770 --> 01:20:37.130
go literally very, very, very, very high. Yeah. So

01:20:37.130 --> 01:20:40.250
accordingly I have to check each and everything and then I

01:20:40.250 --> 01:20:45.350
have to choose the model, then the hosting or maybe I can go

01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:49.310
ahead with the API, right, API, but yeah, so maybe because

01:20:49.310 --> 01:20:51.550
of security concern, I'll not go ahead with the APIs because

01:20:51.550 --> 01:20:54.990
it's my private data, right? It's my client data. So I can't

01:20:54.990 --> 01:20:59.910
rely on other system. So most of the time this will be my

01:20:59.910 --> 01:21:03.490
major worries because many of my document, many of my

01:21:03.490 --> 01:21:06.590
project document, my PRDs and above documents or maybe my

01:21:06.590 --> 01:21:09.710
financial documents, maybe my legal documents. So I don't

01:21:09.710 --> 01:21:12.190
want to expose those documents to the entire world because I

01:21:12.190 --> 01:21:15.390
never know that how they are managing and what kind of a

01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:17.490
data they are keeping, what kind of data they are not. It's

01:21:17.490 --> 01:21:20.070
a complete black box for me. Even open AI system, right?

01:21:20.110 --> 01:21:23.210
It's a complete black box for me. So maybe I'll not follow

01:21:23.210 --> 01:21:25.930
that approach. I'll follow second approach. So this is

01:21:25.930 --> 01:21:27.930
approach number one. This is approach number two. But I'll

01:21:27.930 --> 01:21:30.010
try to follow this second approach, although it's a little

01:21:30.010 --> 01:21:34.010
bit like a costly, but sometime I'll go ahead with this one.

01:21:34.150 --> 01:21:38.070
I can compromise with that particular cost when security or

01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:44.410
integrity comes into a picture. Yes. Yeah. H100 denotes

01:21:44.410 --> 01:21:49.110
cost. H100 is no. Okay. So anyone who is having idea, what

01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:55.350
is the A100, H100? It's a GPU series by the way. Okay. Yeah.

01:21:55.450 --> 01:21:55.670
Yeah.

01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:12.300
Maybe I can open up my HyperStack account. I can show it to

01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:12.480
you.

01:22:33.670 --> 01:22:36.510
Yeah. This is my HyperStack account. So generally I use a

01:22:36.510 --> 01:22:40.650
GPUs from here. I have like a lot of like different,

01:22:40.770 --> 01:22:43.390
different accounts to use a GPUs, but yeah, let me show you

01:22:43.390 --> 01:22:46.610
like my HyperStack. So virtual machine, deploy a new virtual

01:22:46.610 --> 01:22:49.390
machine. So see all of this like a virtual machine, a VM

01:22:49.390 --> 01:22:52.010
they are giving you. So here you will be able to find out

01:22:52.010 --> 01:22:58.210
like H100 with the 80 GB of a, 80 GB of a RAM basically. So

01:22:58.210 --> 01:23:00.790
again, you can try it. You can try to commence like a 1, 2,

01:23:00.910 --> 01:23:05.210
3, 8 all together. So 8 H100 you can take, then A100 is

01:23:05.210 --> 01:23:08.130
again. So you will be, and again, charges are already

01:23:08.130 --> 01:23:10.910
mentioned. Okay. As of now, this is out of stock. This is

01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:14.250
out of stock. Right. So all of these GPUs are available. So

01:23:14.250 --> 01:23:17.830
RTX, this one, this one, this one in my local system. So

01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:21.450
basically I have a RTX 1490 series. So I have 1490 in my

01:23:21.450 --> 01:23:24.270
local system, but yeah, so if you'll come over, but I just

01:23:24.270 --> 01:23:27.990
have one, right. Only one graphics card I have. But let's

01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:29.530
suppose majority of time I have one. One will not be

01:23:29.530 --> 01:23:31.370
sufficient, especially when you're trying to do a training

01:23:31.370 --> 01:23:35.050
of the model. So in that case you will have to use maybe 8X,

01:23:35.170 --> 01:23:39.690
10X, something like that. And that too a managed one. Yes.

01:23:39.910 --> 01:23:43.370
So these are, these are basically a GPU series, which we try

01:23:43.370 --> 01:23:44.270
to use in a real time.

01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:52.540
Sir, can we host Ulama in a cloud and use it? Yeah, you can

01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:55.420
host it in a cloud. I have already done that. Please check

01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:58.580
my YouTube video. And I was using like a, my own private

01:23:58.580 --> 01:24:03.180
GPUs over here. H100 from this HyperStack itself. Even

01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:05.220
documentation I have published. So you can, you can check my

01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:07.600
YouTube video. So in a practical manner, I have already

01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:09.900
hosted it. I have already tested it and I have already

01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:13.240
created a document about it. Documents are open sourced. So

01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:15.020
it's not like you should have the course access or

01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:18.320
something. You can check the document. Just follow. Within

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:20.200
30 minute you will be able to do it. If you're following the

01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:24.060
document, yeah, I have already done that. I think like one

01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:26.780
month back I have done that. Yeah.

01:24:29.650 --> 01:24:33.390
So plus even APIs, not just with Ulama. So with Ulama, there

01:24:33.390 --> 01:24:35.970
is another video and with APIs, so there is another video.

01:24:36.150 --> 01:24:38.790
And with Ulama, so I have taken one 20 billion parameter

01:24:38.790 --> 01:24:47.600
model, the OSS, OpenAI GPT OSS 120B model I've used. We can

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:50.440
fine tune the QN model on a PDF document. Yes, you can fine

01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:52.620
tune. Obviously you can fine tune. Even fine tuning I have

01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:55.360
already discussed. So if you'll go and check my previous,

01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:01.780
this one, Generative AI with NLP lectures, the previous one,

01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:04.400
the one which I have already finished. So over there. If

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:06.460
you'll go, you will be able to find out that multiple

01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:09.100
different, different fine tuning I have already discussed in

01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:12.360
a practical manner with code that is also there.

01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:18.420
Ulama is good. Yeah. So Ulama is basically an interface.

01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:23.000
They try to just make your life easy if you have to use some

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:26.440
of these open source model in a private environment, means

01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:29.220
in your environment, right? Maybe cloud, maybe in your local

01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:34.000
one, local one, it is of no use by the way, because every

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.020
time you will not keep your system up. And every time you

01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:39.920
will not open your laptop and then, you know, uh, run the

01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:41.980
command, although it's a one line, one line of command, but

01:25:41.980 --> 01:25:44.380
again, you will not do it. Generally we go out with the

01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:48.980
cloud one. Yep. Okay. So moving ahead, uh, basically with

01:25:48.980 --> 01:25:54.880
this hope it's not getting a, you guys are not getting bored

01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:58.980
with this lecture. Yeah. All of you are able to learn

01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:00.700
something a little bit at least.

01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:09.900
Okay. So yeah, uh, basically LLMs. Right. So I was talking

01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:12.180
about LLM. So again, LLM selection is very much important.

01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:13.880
And again, like I said, so you can go out with the API

01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:16.800
approach. You can go out with them, uh, like a open source

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:19.120
approach opens, which means private approach basically. So

01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:21.380
where you are hosting your own model in your own

01:26:21.380 --> 01:26:24.160
environment, and like I said, so obviously you need a GPU.

01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:27.840
So calculation needs to be done over there. Now once this

01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:30.720
one is done, right? Once this one is done. So maybe I can

01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:34.460
try to like, uh, use, uh, something like context

01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:37.280
optimization. So I can try to use a Lang chain. I can try to

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:39.960
use a llama indexes. So that it will be able to, you know,

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:43.020
use some agents to route and to use a particular specific

01:26:43.020 --> 01:26:46.040
function. So context optimization is something which I can

01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:46.540
try to do.

01:26:53.110 --> 01:26:55.810
So here are some agentic frameworks comes into a picture

01:26:55.810 --> 01:27:03.900
like, uh, Lang chain or maybe llama index.

01:27:07.890 --> 01:27:12.050
Yeah. No. So this, this part is done. So I'm able to hit my,

01:27:12.170 --> 01:27:15.310
uh, vector DB. I'm able to retrieve it. I'm able to re-rank

01:27:15.310 --> 01:27:19.690
it. I'm able to send those query plus a retrieved document

01:27:19.690 --> 01:27:23.250
to the LLM. And now LLM is able to give me a response. I'm

01:27:23.250 --> 01:27:27.150
able to optimize it. Yeah. Now this story is done till this

01:27:27.150 --> 01:27:31.110
point. So till layer number three, this story is done. Now

01:27:31.110 --> 01:27:35.470
all of these things will run in a backend. Yes. User is not

01:27:35.470 --> 01:27:38.210
aware about it. Your HR team don't know like what you are

01:27:38.210 --> 01:27:41.530
doing in a backend, right? Basically we as a tech team are

01:27:41.530 --> 01:27:44.230
aware about that and we are doing this much of job. We, we

01:27:44.230 --> 01:27:47.050
are like, uh, we have done so much of like a hard work or

01:27:47.050 --> 01:27:50.210
complex problem we have solved. But, um. You know, it

01:27:50.210 --> 01:27:53.210
doesn't matter like for your HR, for your finance team, for

01:27:53.210 --> 01:27:55.190
your non-tech team, or even for your other tech team, it

01:27:55.190 --> 01:27:57.630
doesn't matter at all. Like it's a job, right? So you have

01:27:57.630 --> 01:28:01.070
to build the product like, uh, people in a, like a open AI,

01:28:01.150 --> 01:28:03.470
they're working really, really hard. 24 by seven. We don't

01:28:03.470 --> 01:28:06.930
care. We just care about the final solution that we are able

01:28:06.930 --> 01:28:09.650
to get our like a chat response or not. But yeah, there are

01:28:09.650 --> 01:28:12.070
like thousands of people who is working literally day and

01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:14.790
night. Maybe they're not able to get a sleep even once in a

01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:20.990
week properly. Right. So. Yeah. But we just care about our

01:28:20.990 --> 01:28:24.470
result, our output. So all of these things will be backend

01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:27.570
technically, right? It won't be visible. It won't be visible

01:28:27.570 --> 01:28:31.670
at all. What will be visible by the way? So the things which

01:28:31.670 --> 01:28:38.640
will be visible is a application layer, application layer.

01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:42.980
So layer number four that I have to build is a application

01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:46.940
layer. Application layer means a mobile app, a web app.

01:28:47.140 --> 01:28:51.860
Right. Or maybe some sort of a open UI kind of a system, or

01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:54.900
maybe I can try to integrate it with the slack, with the

01:28:54.900 --> 01:28:58.780
teams, right? As a bot, I can try to integrate. Maybe I can

01:28:58.780 --> 01:29:02.200
try to integrate in a WhatsApp, possible WhatsApp or

01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:05.120
telegram, right? Even I have created one video. So where I

01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:08.220
have shown that in a practical manner that how we can try to

01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:10.880
connect with our WhatsApp and we can like communicate. Uh,

01:29:11.140 --> 01:29:14.440
so I have already shown that demo as well. Maybe you can go

01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:17.300
and check. It's an interesting one. So that you. And with my

01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:21.400
personal WhatsApp, right? So the complete automation. So

01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:24.440
application layer, right? Application layer means web app or

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:27.380
maybe a mobile app, personal mobile app, private mobile app.

01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:30.920
For example, a Nexus RAG. Nexus. So web app with the Nexus.

01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:34.080
Name Nexus, right? Or maybe mobile app with the name Nexus

01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:38.440
or maybe I have to integrate that with the slack. Many

01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:40.860
people are using it. Many teams are using it, right? Maybe

01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:42.940
in my organization people are using slack. Maybe people are

01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:45.940
using Microsoft teams. So I can try to integrate with that

01:29:45.940 --> 01:29:50.840
one. Maybe, uh, my director, right? Uh, so they need an

01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:55.620
access inside a WhatsApp itself. So like that is a

01:29:55.620 --> 01:29:58.120
requirement on my client, right? My client, they need an

01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:01.320
access inside WhatsApp as a bot. So I may be inside a

01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:05.180
telegraph. So I have to attach all of these things and

01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:07.720
everything comes inside what everything comes inside

01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:11.280
application layer, right? Application layer. So here

01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:15.460
application layer wise, babe app.

01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:20.160
Mobile app. mobile app,

01:30:23.070 --> 01:30:26.050
slack, teams,

01:30:28.620 --> 01:30:30.020
whatsapp,

01:30:31.890 --> 01:30:37.250
telegram, etc, right, so many like different tools because

01:30:37.250 --> 01:30:39.850
my client, right, so let's suppose if my client or my

01:30:39.850 --> 01:30:42.650
director is asking, I have to do it, I can't say no

01:30:42.650 --> 01:30:45.390
basically, right, so I have to give them access, not just

01:30:45.390 --> 01:30:50.950
that, so I have to even create an admin dashboard, admin

01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:52.270
dashboard,

01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:57.740
so that I will be able to control the access, control the

01:30:57.740 --> 01:31:00.520
access, I will be able to control the roles because everyone

01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:03.160
should not be able to access everything, right, for example

01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:06.180
my legal team maybe should not be able to access the finance

01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:08.500
document or my junior developer should not be able to access

01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:12.780
all the research, right, so I have to give a role based

01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:16.820
access, so inside this admin dashboard, again I have to

01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:22.080
design what, role based access

01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:26.790
by the way, right, so I will design basically a role based

01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:30.850
access over here. That is also one of the requirement and

01:31:30.850 --> 01:31:33.170
then all the feature that okay fine, so you will be able to

01:31:33.170 --> 01:31:34.970
access this feature, you will not be able to access this

01:31:34.970 --> 01:31:37.570
feature, that feature, something like this I have to

01:31:37.570 --> 01:31:41.590
configure, so this will happen on a application layer which

01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:44.910
is again a layer which will be visible to my final

01:31:44.910 --> 01:31:49.590
stakeholders, yeah, so final stakeholder means your company

01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:52.530
employee, your director, your client or anyone, they will be

01:31:52.530 --> 01:31:55.930
able to access this particular one. Now so once my

01:31:55.930 --> 01:31:59.250
application layer will be done. Obviously I have to even

01:31:59.250 --> 01:32:05.290
take care of a security layer, security layer because you

01:32:05.290 --> 01:32:08.270
are exposing lot of like a private data, not lot of private

01:32:08.270 --> 01:32:11.010
data, all the private data you are trying to work with those

01:32:11.010 --> 01:32:14.330
kind of a data and that too company's data, right, a whole

01:32:14.330 --> 01:32:18.990
company data, so you have to carefully design the entire

01:32:18.990 --> 01:32:21.870
security layer, so you can try to design maybe an end to end

01:32:21.870 --> 01:32:25.790
encryption, you can try to design maybe a single sign on,

01:32:25.970 --> 01:32:27.810
maybe you can try to design end to end encryption. End to

01:32:27.810 --> 01:32:32.850
end encryption over here, E2E encryption

01:32:36.780 --> 01:32:39.600
and then like a layer which is transferring a data in

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:42.040
between, so it should not pass as a plain text over there,

01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:44.820
it should pass as maybe some key values you have to design

01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:51.780
and then you have to even do a audit log, you have to

01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:52.920
configure and

01:32:56.670 --> 01:33:00.230
monitoring you have to do, so maybe you can end up using a

01:33:00.230 --> 01:33:04.130
Prometheus and Grafana over here, right, so you have to do

01:33:04.130 --> 01:33:07.510
this one. So security layer, you have to design and then,

01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:11.450
right, so once all of this design will be done, let's

01:33:11.450 --> 01:33:14.570
suppose once I am able to design all of this five layer, I

01:33:14.570 --> 01:33:17.610
am able to write the code and everything and obviously

01:33:17.610 --> 01:33:21.430
everything is connected with everything, then I have to

01:33:21.430 --> 01:33:28.320
obviously go ahead with the deployment layer, deployment

01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:34.020
layer, right, deployment layer. Now deployment wise. So

01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:36.600
generally we try to create our own security layer. Now

01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:40.040
multiple system, not just one single system, so there will

01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:46.220
be a dev system, there will be a testing system or test you

01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:53.380
can say and then there will be a prod system. In general, so

01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:56.740
you will be able to find out three layers basically. In some

01:33:56.740 --> 01:33:59.200
of the company you will be able to find out even a pre-prod,

01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:02.300
so in between here, so you will be able to find out a pre

01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:05.440
-prod system as well. Now in dev system obviously

01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:08.300
development is going to happen. In test system. So tester is

01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:10.840
going to test. Now your tester can be your stakeholders as

01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:13.660
well, right, your director, your manager and your other team

01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:16.540
member and then our respective team members which I said,

01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:18.620
HR, finance, legal because they are the subject matter

01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:21.820
expert, right, so SMEs by the way. So they can assign their

01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:24.460
SMEs and they can check their own department that whether I

01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:27.420
am able to get a correct response for my respective

01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:30.820
departments or not, right. So there will be a stakeholder

01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:34.140
testing or will happen which may happen in a like a testing

01:34:34.140 --> 01:34:36.300
environment which may happen in a pre-prod environment. And

01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:38.660
then you are going to migrate the entire system into a prod.

01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:43.000
Entire system means all of this five layer in one sort you

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.440
will end up migrating into the final production layer and

01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:50.880
basically user acceptance testing, UAT, technically you can

01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:53.760
say pre-prod, right, so pre-prod, user acceptance testing.

01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:56.620
So once your stakeholders are going to say yes, because they

01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:59.780
will be user, your client can be a user, your internal team

01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:02.100
members can be a user. So generally UAT, user acceptance

01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:05.360
testing we try to do, technically these are the names that

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:07.980
we used to call. Okay. Every team will be calling as a

01:35:07.980 --> 01:35:10.340
different name, right, depends on the organization. But

01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:13.880
yeah, in general you will find these three environment. Now

01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:17.940
so your code should migrate from this to this to this. So

01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:20.340
technically we will be using a CI CD pipeline, continuous

01:35:20.340 --> 01:35:23.920
integration, continuous deployment kind of a pipeline we are

01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:26.520
going to use. Something like a GitHub action kind of things

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:28.720
we are going to use. Now when we talk about this

01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:33.020
environment, dev testing or prod, so dev will be a light

01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:35.360
weighted environment. Testing will be also light weighted

01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:39.740
environment. Prod will be a heavy environment, right. And we

01:35:39.740 --> 01:35:43.020
have to literally do a cost calculation for this prod

01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:45.720
environment. Dev and testing is not going to cost you much,

01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:49.500
right. And anyhow it's necessary, but it should be like a

01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:52.060
very small environment, very small like a resources is

01:35:52.060 --> 01:35:56.160
required to configure this one. But for prod we need a

01:35:56.160 --> 01:36:00.740
proper planning, right. We need a proper planning. So now

01:36:00.740 --> 01:36:07.840
let's talk about this cost basically, right. Let's talk

01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:11.400
about the cost part that how we are going to do a cost

01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:14.180
calculation and what is the estimated cost I will end up

01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:19.500
getting for this kind of a system especially, yeah. Till

01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:22.300
this point it's clear guys, to all of us, yes,

01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:25.780
yeah.

01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:31.580
So let's suppose I'm going to configure a Kubernetes

01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:34.580
environment, right. So EKS, let's suppose I'm talking about

01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:37.900
AWS, so inside AWS there will be elastic Kubernetes services

01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:40.720
which will be available. You can go ahead with Azure, so

01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:43.540
over there you will be able to find out AKS. You can go

01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:45.760
ahead with the cloud, Google cloud, so you will be able to

01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:48.760
find out GKS. It's a Kubernetes environment. So where you

01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:52.760
don't have to manage like all the nodes, so means we are

01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:55.320
talking about basically a cluster. So where there will be

01:36:55.320 --> 01:37:00.040
one master node and then there will be a worker node, right.

01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:02.940
Where there will be a multiple worker node and through one

01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:05.940
master node you will be able to connect all the worker node,

01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:08.560
you will be able to assign the task and they will be able to

01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:12.060
execute it. Technically I'm talking about a system, a

01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:14.640
multiple system which will be connected to each and every

01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:19.220
one. So there's something called as cluster, cluster. And in

01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:22.460
any like a real time environment, we always try to go ahead

01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:26.080
with the cluster deployment and generally so EKS is going to

01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:28.780
provide you a easy peasy kind of a services. So where

01:37:28.780 --> 01:37:31.940
without much of hassle you will be able to configure a

01:37:31.940 --> 01:37:36.280
cluster with any number of nodes, yeah, with any number of

01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:42.780
nodes. Now. So let's start talking about the cost over here,

01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:47.500
which is a major, major component, by the way. And like I

01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:50.960
said, so I'm going to teach you the cost for a small, for a

01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:54.640
medium and for a large use cases. So let me create a

01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:58.680
beautiful table over here. So where I will be able to do the

01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:02.660
estimation, just estimation guys, right. So in reality it is

01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:05.440
going to fluctuate, but it's been a estimation based on the

01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:08.740
number of user and number of the data set. Which has been

01:38:08.740 --> 01:38:14.660
created fine. So here, right. So here, when we are talking

01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:17.540
about a environment, right, when we're talking about the

01:38:17.540 --> 01:38:21.440
environment, so what kind of a cluster we will end up

01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:23.220
creating. So let's suppose I am trying to create this

01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:26.060
cluster, right? So where I have a machines now, what will be

01:38:26.060 --> 01:38:28.620
the configuration of this machine? People are going to ask

01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:31.420
you a question by the way, right? People are going to ask

01:38:31.420 --> 01:38:33.840
you, and if you're a lead, if you're an architect, you must

01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:37.280
be aware about it. Right? So here. So here, let's suppose if

01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:41.940
I'm talking about, uh, maybe like, uh, you know, uh, uh,

01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:47.100
here, let me write down a small, then medium. And then let's

01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:50.680
suppose here we have a large, right now, here we have a

01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:55.540
cost, uh, bucket. Let's suppose I'm going to write down.

01:38:55.660 --> 01:39:01.980
Yeah. Now. So here, if I'm going to configure a EKS cluster,

01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:07.380
right. EKS cluster. Okay. So if I have a small, right. If I

01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:11.580
have basically a small, a small means a small means user is

01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:16.980
user is hundred. This is the assumptions of a small I'm

01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:21.380
talking about, right? So a hundred users and then a small

01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:24.320
means, let me delete this part first. Let me write the

01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:27.380
estimation for the small. So small means I will be having a

01:39:27.380 --> 01:39:29.920
hundred users. Medium is I will be having a thousand users

01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:33.040
and enterprise means large means I will be having a 10,000

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:36.360
users. That will be my estimation. Now. So corpus wise means

01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:38.620
data wise. So how much data we are like, uh, going to

01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:42.420
process in case of a small. So data wise. So let's suppose

01:39:42.420 --> 01:39:47.560
here I'm talking about a 50K docs approximately in a medium.

01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:50.840
If I'm saying medium, medium is I am talking about basically

01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:55.220
500K, five lakh docs basically, which I'm processing. And if

01:39:55.220 --> 01:39:57.600
I'll talk about a large, so I'm talking about approximately

01:39:57.600 --> 01:40:02.000
5 million docs, right? So that is my assumption about the

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.540
small, medium and large in terms of user. In terms of user.

01:40:04.540 --> 01:40:08.660
In terms of data. In terms of QPS. QPS is what? Question per

01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:11.540
second. Basically this is the meaning of UPS because QPS

01:40:11.540 --> 01:40:15.040
matters in terms of RIG system. So what is my QPS by the

01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:19.220
way? So here in a peak time, QPS means question per second.

01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:23.340
Again, remember question per second, fine. So here QPS wise

01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:25.960
in terms of a small system. So let's suppose I will be

01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:28.340
expecting two to three quotient per second. That's a

01:40:28.340 --> 01:40:32.340
frequency, right? In case of a medium organization. So 15 to

01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:35.220
20 will be my QPS. Question per second. And in terms of a

01:40:35.220 --> 01:40:39.100
large organization. So my QPS will be 100 to 200. Let's

01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:42.600
suppose, right? Again, that is my assumption now. So here

01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:48.460
node wise, right? Node wise means machine, node means

01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:50.520
machine I'm talking about. So machine wise, let's suppose

01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:53.380
three machine I'll keep over here, six machine I'll keep

01:40:53.380 --> 01:40:56.620
over here and 15 machine I'll try to keep over here. Machine

01:40:56.620 --> 01:41:01.180
capacity wise, machine capacity wise, basically, so what

01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:04.060
kind of capacity I'm going to use? So let's suppose on an

01:41:04.060 --> 01:41:06.000
average, I'm not taking a very heavy weighted machine over

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:12.120
here. So I'm taking maybe M7G large. So M7G large is a

01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:16.640
series that you will be able to find out on AWS large. I'm

01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:20.960
going to use. So in one M7G large, like a large one, you

01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:24.100
will be able to find out two virtual core CPU and then you

01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:27.220
will be able to find out eight GB of a RAM. So if I'm

01:41:27.220 --> 01:41:29.740
talking about three, so just multiply by three. So I have

01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:34.200
three M7G system over here. So again, seven. Same system.

01:41:35.420 --> 01:41:40.260
I'm just going to write M7G. So same M7G, I have six over

01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:45.120
here and same M7G, I have 15 over here in case of a large.

01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:49.780
So this is the initial estimation and anyone and everyone

01:41:49.780 --> 01:41:52.040
has to do it by the way. Without that, how you will build a

01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:54.820
system, how you will do the configuration. So these are the

01:41:54.820 --> 01:41:59.080
matrixes, right? These are the matrixes which I have to pre

01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:02.680
-consider even without before, like, you know, commencing my

01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:05.660
production environment, I have to pre-consider that, okay,

01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:08.980
how, how many users, what is the data size? What is the

01:42:08.980 --> 01:42:11.700
question per second and how many node I have to configure

01:42:11.700 --> 01:42:14.580
and then what should be the node. Then only you will be able

01:42:14.580 --> 01:42:16.820
to drive the cost. Otherwise you will not be able to drive

01:42:16.820 --> 01:42:20.260
the cost by the way. Right? So this is, this is like a,

01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:22.320
again, this is not the whole assumptions we are taking.

01:42:22.460 --> 01:42:25.500
There are more, right? There are more assumptions that we

01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:27.540
are going to take. But yeah, this is something that you have

01:42:27.540 --> 01:42:30.900
to design that. Let's suppose today I'm launching my

01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:33.680
product. But uh, I'm in. I'm into the small tier. Then

01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:36.700
eventually next month I will move to this one when next

01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:39.100
month I'll move to this one. So I have to plan accordingly.

01:42:39.220 --> 01:42:41.020
Right? I have to plan accordingly. And this is something

01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:43.940
which we try to pre-plan. It's not like build a system and

01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:46.180
then like we'll do the planning in a later stage. No, that

01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:48.880
is, that is not going to happen. Yeah, that is not going to

01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:52.540
happen. So here this is the system configuration or you can

01:42:52.540 --> 01:42:55.080
say a cluster configuration that we have to do. Uh, this

01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:57.720
kind of a cluster configuration. Now let's talk about the

01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:01.640
cost by the way. Yep. So how much it is going to cost me? If

01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:04.320
I'm going ahead with this kind of a system and what external

01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:09.280
cost is going to occur in general on me. So in the general,

01:43:09.380 --> 01:43:12.420
if I'll talk about this because as of now we have machines,

01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:14.960
right? So we have three machines, we have six machine and we

01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:17.880
have five machine over here. So what will be the

01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:20.600
approximately monthly cost? I'm talking about monthly cost,

01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:24.760
right? So in the general, if you are going to configure EKS

01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:28.100
with this capacity, three machine capacity, three M seven G

01:43:28.100 --> 01:43:31.200
large machine capacity. So in the general. It is going to

01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:34.580
give you $201 of cost in general, right? You can, you can

01:43:34.580 --> 01:43:38.400
like even use a AWS cost calculator. They already have. So

01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:41.260
you can even like a do the rough estimation by the way. So

01:43:41.260 --> 01:43:44.400
again, from the same places, this calculation is coming. If

01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:47.580
I'm using a six machine M seven G by the way, so I

01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:50.620
approximate cost with EKS cluster with a managed services,

01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:52.580
right? Because even for a managed services, they're going to

01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:55.400
charge you something, right? So my cost will be $328

01:43:55.400 --> 01:44:00.220
approximately. And for my large. So where I have a 15. M

01:44:00.220 --> 01:44:04.340
seven G machine. So here it is going to cost me around our

01:44:04.340 --> 01:44:13.900
$471 for seven, sorry, not 471, 328, right? So 711, it's not

01:44:13.900 --> 01:44:17.040
7,711 dollar. Approximately it is going to cost you again.

01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:19.780
This cost estimation is coming from AWS cost calculator.

01:44:19.940 --> 01:44:22.040
They have already given you cost calculator. So even you can

01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:26.520
estimate those costs basically. So EKS, now this is just a

01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:29.660
machine cluster is costing me. But this is not the final

01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:33.200
cost. By the way, yeah, this is not the final cost at all.

01:44:33.980 --> 01:44:38.080
So another cost which will come on you, let's suppose if I'm

01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:41.520
not using, so here I'm just using this one for the compute

01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:46.140
for a storage, right? For a storage, let's suppose for a

01:44:46.140 --> 01:44:49.720
vector DBS storage, vector DBS storage, I'm going to use

01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:53.620
maybe a pine cone services, right? For a vector DB. So it is

01:44:53.620 --> 01:44:57.040
going to pine cone, vector DB wise, I'm going to use a pine

01:44:57.040 --> 01:45:03.560
cone, pine cone. So it is going to cost you $500 like plan

01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:06.360
minute. They are giving you like for a small and for a

01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:10.320
medium, it is going to be $500 itself. There's a minimum

01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:13.380
plan. And then if you are going with the enterprise plan, so

01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:17.900
in that case it is going to cost you $1 to $9, $6

01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:20.820
approximately per month. And now this is just for the vector

01:45:20.820 --> 01:45:24.220
storage, right? So you will try to use even S3 bucket

01:45:24.220 --> 01:45:26.540
because a lot of like documents you have to store even

01:45:26.540 --> 01:45:28.440
inside the S3 bucket. So it is going to cost you $500. It is

01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:33.060
going to cost you a $5 per month. If you are taking 20,

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:37.320
sorry, $5 per month, it is going to cost you for a 200 GB, a

01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:41.440
S3 bucket for a storage, right? S3 will be necessary by the

01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:46.440
way, $47 is going to cost you for two terabyte and it is

01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:52.320
going to cost you approximately $471 per month for a 20

01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:56.560
terabyte, 20 terabyte. So S3 bucket, again, this cost is

01:45:56.560 --> 01:46:01.320
added. Vector DB cost is added. EKS cost is added. Now LLM

01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:04.800
wise, right? LLM wise. So let's suppose I'm going ahead with

01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:08.500
the API approach because we had two approach, right? One

01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:11.440
approach is go ahead and use the API. Second approach was

01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:14.560
host the model. Both of this approach is going to give me

01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:17.620
the cost by the way, right? So in terms of hosting, again, I

01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:19.880
have to like take care of the maintenance, my clusters, and

01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:24.100
then I have to pay for H100, A100, right? So both

01:46:24.100 --> 01:46:26.240
approaches, like I said, it is going to give you the cost.

01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:28.660
Let's see. Let's suppose I'm going ahead with the API cost

01:46:28.660 --> 01:46:31.580
approach because you will be with the certainty you will be

01:46:31.580 --> 01:46:34.660
able to do the calculation. So let's suppose I'm using a LLM

01:46:34.660 --> 01:46:43.360
API, right? For example, GPT-5 mini, GPT-5 mini, right? So

01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:46.100
my document is fixed. How much document we are processing,

01:46:46.220 --> 01:46:48.420
we are fixed. So approximately we can do the token

01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:50.640
calculation. Again, size matters. Size of the document

01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:53.600
matters. But yeah, approximation, we can try to do it. So

01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:56.840
here maybe it is going to cost me one, $1, $2 per month.

01:46:56.860 --> 01:47:00.780
Right? So here it is going to cost me in this instances, $1,

01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:05.760
$1, $2, $5 per month, $1,125. And then here it is going to

01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:11.180
cost me $11,250. If I'm talking about the 5 million document

01:47:11.180 --> 01:47:15.180
per month, right? This is the cost which I will be able to

01:47:15.180 --> 01:47:17.900
get if document size approximate 25 MB to 30 MB. The

01:47:17.900 --> 01:47:20.120
approximation which I have taken in the beginning itself. So

01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:23.500
my document of average document size is 25 MB to 50 MB,

01:47:23.620 --> 01:47:28.440
right? Now this is something. Now we have been using a re

01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:32.260
-ranker. Re-ranker also plays a major role in this layer,

01:47:32.380 --> 01:47:35.680
right? Retrieval layer, re-ranker because I have to make it

01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:40.080
robust. So if I'm going to like use open source re-ranker,

01:47:40.140 --> 01:47:43.100
which is not going to be very much good. If I'm going to use

01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:45.840
a Cohera kind of a re-ranker where they try to give you an

01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:52.350
API access as a service. So re-ranker, re-ranker and re

01:47:52.350 --> 01:47:56.870
-ranker wise Cohera, Cohera I'm going to use. So for this

01:47:56.870 --> 01:48:00.350
small case, it is going to cost me. Approximately $90 per

01:48:00.350 --> 01:48:03.010
month for a medium case, it is going to cost me

01:48:03.010 --> 01:48:07.530
approximately $900 per month. And for this large case, it is

01:48:07.530 --> 01:48:11.150
going to cost me $9,000 per month. So again, a lot of like a

01:48:11.150 --> 01:48:14.270
costliest operation we are trying to do over here. This is

01:48:14.270 --> 01:48:16.510
the approximate cost, but this is not the ultimate cost.

01:48:16.690 --> 01:48:19.630
There will be some cost which is going to come on you on an

01:48:19.630 --> 01:48:21.910
infrared side. Now if you are going to do the addition,

01:48:22.070 --> 01:48:26.890
right? So this small is going to give you approximately one

01:48:26.890 --> 01:48:31.770
to five. Yeah. $3,608 per month. This is going to give you

01:48:31.770 --> 01:48:40.930
approximately $3,601 per $3,601 per month. And this is going

01:48:40.930 --> 01:48:46.650
to give you approximately $24,000, 4,081 for, sorry, 481 per

01:48:46.650 --> 01:48:50.590
month. So this is the approximate cost you will be able to

01:48:50.590 --> 01:48:55.750
get for the above requirement. The main mentioned like user

01:48:55.750 --> 01:48:58.450
number, like a hundred thousand and 10,000 and then like a

01:48:58.450 --> 01:49:01.330
data and then a QPS and then number of node. If you are

01:49:01.330 --> 01:49:05.030
going to configure approximately, approximately. Now there

01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:07.430
are a lot of like a scope where you can go with the cost

01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:10.590
increase, or maybe you can go with the cost optimization

01:49:10.590 --> 01:49:14.330
possibility. My heavy cost is going with this one and this

01:49:14.330 --> 01:49:17.130
one. So maybe I can do something about this one, right? Or

01:49:17.130 --> 01:49:19.750
maybe I can compromise with some of the accuracy. Maybe I

01:49:19.750 --> 01:49:22.770
can compromise with some of the ease of uses. So there are a

01:49:22.770 --> 01:49:25.930
lot of like a things, uh, optimization wise that can be done

01:49:25.930 --> 01:49:28.970
and this will be the cost of your. What? This will be our

01:49:28.970 --> 01:49:32.570
cost of your product system. The small cost will come here.

01:49:32.610 --> 01:49:35.550
A small cost will come even over here. But yeah, this is not

01:49:35.550 --> 01:49:39.250
going to be the major one. A major cost is going to be the

01:49:39.250 --> 01:49:44.610
broad one. By the way, you all will be able to get, I'm just

01:49:44.610 --> 01:49:47.030
thinking how much you are burning. We are burning more than

01:49:47.030 --> 01:49:47.550
we are earning.

01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:59.740
So yeah, now do the calculation and estimation. So see

01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:03.240
technology is not tough to, you know. Design or to build

01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:06.520
again, you can run something in your local system and people

01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:09.060
say, wow, I can run in my local system. Why do I need an API

01:50:09.060 --> 01:50:11.780
access? Why do I need this? Why do I need that? I'm like,

01:50:11.880 --> 01:50:14.120
you are able to run something in local system, but how, how,

01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:20.340
how much you will be able to use it for how long? Yeah. I

01:50:20.340 --> 01:50:23.720
just heard come out. I saw my car. I said come on. Come on.

01:50:24.020 --> 01:50:27.240
Chalenge to course ka daam badaana padega. I mean like

01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:32.100
subscription badaana padega. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:50:32.100 --> 01:50:34.160
This is gold. What you are sharing generative architecture

01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:37.080
level detail. Thank you. So do you have any video on VLLM

01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:40.280
available? Yeah. VLLM is already available. See, and that

01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:44.960
too with the document it's available by the way. Go to my

01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:49.160
YouTube, not my YouTube, Euron's YouTube channel. And then

01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:50.200
from there you can search.

01:50:54.630 --> 01:51:00.070
Ab badha do humne subscription le liye hai. Okay. To ek saal

01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:03.070
ke liye matlab secure hai already. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Bala

01:51:03.070 --> 01:51:07.570
you can go to YouTube and maybe you can search. You are on

01:51:07.570 --> 01:51:11.750
YouTube by the way. I have somewhere

01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:21.300
here.

01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:36.860
Here I have also provided the document.

01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:45.180
Yeah. VLLM server. Run the VLLM servers. So it's a simple

01:51:45.180 --> 01:51:48.200
six step that I have provided. So you can just go and like

01:51:48.200 --> 01:51:50.760
execute it and you will be able to host it. You will be able

01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:53.660
to do the inferencing. So everything is mentioned till API

01:51:53.660 --> 01:51:59.160
call with curl and with Python both. Yeah. It's already

01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:03.360
done. So technically this is like a cost that you will be

01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:05.720
able to get. And again, like this is all the final cost by

01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:08.500
the way. So there will be like more and more because I have

01:52:08.500 --> 01:52:12.300
not mentioned many component, many small teeny tiny

01:52:12.300 --> 01:52:14.840
component. And believe me, this teeny tiny component gives

01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:17.660
you more pain. Like even in terms of configuration, even in

01:52:17.660 --> 01:52:23.130
terms of like a cost management. Right. You are very much

01:52:23.130 --> 01:52:25.930
affording. Yeah, we are. Like I said, we are burning. We are

01:52:25.930 --> 01:52:28.230
not earning anything. We have not earned even a single rupee

01:52:28.230 --> 01:52:32.830
since like a launch, a profit. Still, I am burning. I am

01:52:32.830 --> 01:52:34.510
burning on like this year on.

01:52:38.220 --> 01:52:42.940
Well, honestly, if I go somewhere who even teach 10 percent

01:52:42.940 --> 01:52:46.080
of what you are teaching, even you keep a bit of price like

01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:50.020
10k justify, I feel no one can match your pure version.

01:52:50.580 --> 01:52:54.760
Yeah. We will think about it. So obviously.

01:52:56.500 --> 01:52:58.760
Employees cost. Yeah. So this this doesn't even include

01:52:58.760 --> 01:53:01.960
employee cost by the way. And yeah, you have to keep the

01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:05.400
employee. You have to like, you know, keep their houses up

01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:08.760
and running. They will be looking for appraisal. Again, if

01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:11.580
you're hiring someone. So there will be a cost even attached

01:53:11.580 --> 01:53:15.740
with that. And then you have to provide the system of good

01:53:15.740 --> 01:53:18.640
machines. Right. So their system set up for one people

01:53:18.640 --> 01:53:21.740
itself cost us like a four lakh to five lakh because if you

01:53:21.740 --> 01:53:24.020
are giving one maximum. With the high configuration. So that

01:53:24.020 --> 01:53:26.460
is going to cost like a two point five lakh to two point

01:53:26.460 --> 01:53:30.400
eight lakh. And then you have to give like a desktop, then

01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:35.420
beautiful keyboard and mouse and all those things. So four

01:53:35.420 --> 01:53:37.280
to five lakh for one employees onboarding.

01:53:39.820 --> 01:53:44.420
Yeah. Yeah. Like I said, so it's this is where people

01:53:44.420 --> 01:53:48.240
generally break or like, you know, fail because it's

01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:51.680
literally not easy to keep any system up and running for. A

01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:55.380
beautiful system, you can say. Right. A system which which

01:53:55.380 --> 01:53:58.680
actually serve the purposes. Obviously, everything, every

01:53:58.680 --> 01:54:01.880
single click that you do comes with the cost. As simple as

01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:02.080
that.

01:54:05.780 --> 01:54:08.120
Don't increase the price, please. Yeah. If I if I'm able to

01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:12.620
get like like a recommendation from you. So marketing from

01:54:12.620 --> 01:54:15.460
you. I don't have to increase the price in that case. Right.

01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:25.040
You are really helping us. So I do. Okay. Thank you for

01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:26.840
developing. Yeah. So maybe from your point of view. From

01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:29.700
support wise. So you can just increase our enrollment. You

01:54:29.700 --> 01:54:33.040
can be a brand ambassador. You can just try to promote. So

01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:35.900
in that way, we can we can reduce the cost because as number

01:54:35.900 --> 01:54:39.060
of enrollment increase, obviously we can hit the break even

01:54:39.060 --> 01:54:41.220
or we can even get into a little bit of profitability.

01:54:48.690 --> 01:54:52.070
Logic for these calculations is not 100 percent clear. I

01:54:52.070 --> 01:54:54.490
think logic I have given you for this calculation. See this

01:54:54.490 --> 01:54:57.250
is the base for this calculation. Number of user, data, QPS.

01:54:57.630 --> 01:55:00.790
So this is the basically three base which I have taken. So I

01:55:00.790 --> 01:55:02.930
don't think that like it's not clear. And I have not

01:55:02.930 --> 01:55:05.330
explained. I have clearly said that I'm designing for 100

01:55:05.330 --> 01:55:08.030
user, 1000 user or 10,000 user. I'm processing this my

01:55:08.030 --> 01:55:11.070
document per document size is approximately 20, 25 MB in

01:55:11.070 --> 01:55:13.830
general. Right. And then QPS question per second is two to

01:55:13.830 --> 01:55:17.050
three. So this is the base for calculation by the way. And

01:55:17.050 --> 01:55:19.430
all this like down the line, all this calculation has been

01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:22.810
done accordingly. So where the logic is missing, I'm not

01:55:22.810 --> 01:55:23.430
able to understand.

01:55:30.580 --> 01:55:31.020
Oh,

01:55:36.940 --> 01:55:39.860
visualization and AI to be a part of curriculum, say

01:55:39.860 --> 01:55:43.600
education minister. I mean, that's fine. I don't go after

01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:44.040
these names. I think this is going to take longer but I

01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:44.400
think it's going to take longer. This may not be in news by

01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:50.920
the way because yeah, mostly it's a PR which is going on. I

01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:53.400
don't know how much like things are happening on the ground.

01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:56.780
And I think we all are aware about the reality. So maybe it

01:55:56.780 --> 01:55:59.460
will take time. See, when government is doing something

01:55:59.460 --> 01:56:02.320
right, it like always takes time.

01:56:19.140 --> 01:56:22.200
Okay. I have enrolled for my kids, even kids should learn.

01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:26.040
Like see like AI or technology, we always try to keep it

01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:31.160
separate. Right. And we say that. Okay. We'll try to, you

01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:34.380
know, learn when time will come. But I think it's time now,

01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:38.500
just like just the way we are learning like physics,

01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:40.660
chemistry, mathematics or other activities that we are

01:56:40.660 --> 01:56:43.620
trying to do. Along with that, we can learn even a tech. And

01:56:43.620 --> 01:56:46.680
I don't think that it's that tough. It's even easier than

01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:49.560
learning physics, chemistry and mathematics. But, yeah, I'm

01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:54.240
always like advise people that at least try to keep two,

01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:57.140
three things intact. First is mathematics. Believe me,

01:56:57.160 --> 01:57:01.160
mathematics gives you a lot of logical understanding. And it

01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:04.760
is going to be with you for your entire life. Maybe we keep

01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:07.840
on saying that we are not using algebra. We are not using

01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:10.580
calculus. We are not using geometry. And we all have studied

01:57:10.580 --> 01:57:13.760
those things, right? But believe me, it helps you a lot in

01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:15.580
terms of understanding the world, in terms of understanding

01:57:15.580 --> 01:57:18.580
complex things. Anything, literally anything, when you will

01:57:18.580 --> 01:57:21.680
start understanding. So mathematics is very important, even

01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:25.040
in my childhood. So I like I was not able to focus much on

01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:28.400
other things. But, yeah, mathematics, I was very good. And

01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:31.180
more than mathematics. I always. I always loved physics. I

01:57:31.180 --> 01:57:34.940
always loved physics. Believe me, so somewhere like that is

01:57:34.940 --> 01:57:37.880
going to build a logic a lot, right? So forget about other

01:57:37.880 --> 01:57:39.900
things like chemistry, biology, history, geography or

01:57:39.900 --> 01:57:42.320
anything. But, yeah, so if you are good with mathematics, if

01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:45.020
your kids are good with mathematics and physics, it's a very

01:57:45.020 --> 01:57:49.120
logical thing, I would say. Right. And it will increase IQ

01:57:49.120 --> 01:57:53.480
level of our kids. It will help them even in a long run and

01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:56.800
short run both to understand complex things in a very, very

01:57:56.800 --> 01:58:00.080
easy way. And that will give them an edge. And along with

01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:04.120
that, obviously, tech kids will explore. Mathematics is the

01:58:04.120 --> 01:58:06.680
heart of AI. I would say mathematics is the heart of entire

01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:11.040
world, by the way, not just AI. But whatever you see in this

01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:13.280
entire world, everything is actually a beautiful math.

01:58:21.740 --> 01:58:24.460
Maybe Bhakta especially bio say, yeah, I mean, like it's

01:58:24.460 --> 01:58:26.680
it's not that important if you are not getting into like,

01:58:26.740 --> 01:58:29.260
you know, that genre. But if you are good with mathematics

01:58:29.260 --> 01:58:31.440
and physics, if your kids are good with mathematics and

01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:35.820
physics, I believe it will help them. Right. They will never

01:58:35.820 --> 01:58:38.120
they will never feel outdated. By the way, they will be able

01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:41.200
to update themselves like with the time. So it doesn't

01:58:41.200 --> 01:58:43.940
matter today is going to come on. Maybe tomorrow something

01:58:43.940 --> 01:58:47.700
else is going to come. So, OK, this is the cost calculation,

01:58:47.900 --> 01:58:50.460
guys, by the way. Now, coming to the next phase, I have to

01:58:50.460 --> 01:58:54.740
discuss a couple of more things with all of you with respect

01:58:54.740 --> 01:58:58.820
to this one. So this is basically like a approximate cost

01:58:58.820 --> 01:59:02.140
calculation that will go. Now, like I said, so there will be

01:59:02.140 --> 01:59:05.480
a lot which which comes over here. For example, OCR. Right.

01:59:05.580 --> 01:59:09.460
So for OCR, if I'm using maybe a Tresoract or like a Pi

01:59:09.460 --> 01:59:12.640
Tresoract, that's completely fine. But let's suppose if I'm

01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:16.440
trying to use Amazon OCR, that will cost me again. So

01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:20.200
everywhere cost will come and that we have to decide which

01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:24.340
service and all these things will be like a fall under

01:59:24.340 --> 01:59:27.000
architect. They're going to take the decision or senior

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.740
level of developer. Right. So your senior developer, even

01:59:29.740 --> 01:59:32.020
junior developer, try to participate in everything. They do

01:59:32.020 --> 01:59:34.700
the experimentation. They do the planning. And then finally

01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:38.760
they do the budget budgeting as well. So it will be

01:59:38.760 --> 01:59:42.380
basically like a job, the entire team to maintain it and to

01:59:42.380 --> 01:59:46.040
manage it and try to extract the best outcome out of this.

01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:53.500
Entire things right now. So let's talk about basically an

01:59:53.500 --> 01:59:57.100
option. Right. Let's talk about an option that I can try to

01:59:57.100 --> 02:00:00.580
use in every layer tech option, by the way. So we talked

02:00:00.580 --> 02:00:03.480
about all of these layers. Right. Now, what is the option

02:00:03.480 --> 02:00:06.900
which is available to us in terms of all of this layer by

02:00:06.900 --> 02:00:10.780
layer in terms of tech? Right. In terms of tech. For

02:00:10.780 --> 02:00:14.780
example, when I talked about ingestion layer, a very first

02:00:14.780 --> 02:00:15.540
layer, by the way.

02:00:19.820 --> 02:00:23.260
Right. This this layer, by the way. Right. The ingestion

02:00:23.260 --> 02:00:26.200
layer, the layer number one. So obviously I'm trying to

02:00:26.200 --> 02:00:28.940
fetch a lot of things. I'm trying to extract a data. So I

02:00:28.940 --> 02:00:32.060
have to use a technology, some tech over here. Right. Some

02:00:32.060 --> 02:00:35.840
tech over here. So here. If I'll talk about the very first

02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:39.820
layer where I'm trying to extract a data. So I can try to

02:00:39.820 --> 02:00:45.240
use ETL tool wise. ETL is nothing but extract, transform or

02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:49.620
load. And data pipeline, let's suppose I'm going to build.

02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:58.320
So here I can try to use maybe like streaming if I'm trying

02:00:58.320 --> 02:01:00.180
to do. So if I'm doing a streaming.

02:01:03.630 --> 02:01:08.330
So in that case, I can try to use a Kafka. Or maybe I can

02:01:08.330 --> 02:01:11.190
try to use AWS. Which is almost a Kafka.

02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:19.260
Right. Data processing framework wise.

02:01:22.220 --> 02:01:26.520
Maybe I can try to use PySpark. PySpark is a framework.

02:01:26.740 --> 02:01:29.260
Right. So it supports Python. But technically a Spark

02:01:29.260 --> 02:01:33.600
supports four languages. Java, Scala, Python and R. So let's

02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:36.220
suppose I'm writing this entire things into like a Python.

02:01:36.300 --> 02:01:39.700
So maybe I can use a PySpark over here in terms of like

02:01:39.700 --> 02:01:43.700
processing this entire data. In terms of like processing the

02:01:43.700 --> 02:01:47.620
stream data. Maybe a batch data. Or something. Right. And

02:01:47.620 --> 02:01:51.680
here. So let's suppose. So in that ETL pipeline maybe I have

02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:53.780
built with the help of this one. In between. So obviously

02:01:53.780 --> 02:01:56.140
I'll end up using a scheduler. Scheduler wise I can try to

02:01:56.140 --> 02:01:59.880
use maybe an Airflow. So let's suppose scheduler.

02:02:01.450 --> 02:02:06.130
So scheduler wise UJI which is a conventional one. No one is

02:02:06.130 --> 02:02:08.750
using as of now. I think five years back. Yes, we have been

02:02:08.750 --> 02:02:13.070
using a lot. The modern one is Airflow. So by which I will

02:02:13.070 --> 02:02:16.130
be able to schedule it. Or even if I'm using a Databricks

02:02:16.130 --> 02:02:20.830
platform. So that provides. So PySpark or directly I can use

02:02:20.830 --> 02:02:25.010
a Databricks kind of a platform. But yeah, for Databricks on

02:02:25.010 --> 02:02:27.290
enterprise level. So you must be having a tie up. Generally

02:02:27.290 --> 02:02:30.450
if tie up is not there then obviously you will end up using

02:02:30.450 --> 02:02:33.670
a. You will end up writing everything from the scratch. So

02:02:33.670 --> 02:02:36.010
technically you will write into a Spark. Either it's a

02:02:36.010 --> 02:02:39.110
Databricks or you are writing something in a local. But

02:02:39.110 --> 02:02:41.450
yeah, it will be a Spark. And then you can try to use it if

02:02:41.450 --> 02:02:43.350
you are using Databricks. So they are providing you a

02:02:43.350 --> 02:02:45.790
managed schedule services as well. So over there you don't

02:02:45.790 --> 02:02:48.950
have to use Airflow. You can use a Databricks scheduler

02:02:48.950 --> 02:02:52.010
directly. Technically, it's the same thing. But yeah, you

02:02:52.010 --> 02:02:54.430
will be able to configure everything in the single platform.

02:02:54.690 --> 02:02:58.090
But again, if you have a tie up in general for a big, big

02:02:58.090 --> 02:03:01.090
project, we don't go ahead with the tools. We always try to

02:03:01.090 --> 02:03:07.030
go ahead with the scratch like writing the code. Now second

02:03:07.030 --> 02:03:09.990
part was like indexing and then vectorization and storage.

02:03:10.270 --> 02:03:16.610
So indexing wise, indexing and storage wise, I

02:03:18.690 --> 02:03:22.150
have multiple options. Right. So indexing wise, if I talk

02:03:22.150 --> 02:03:26.530
about a vector database. Vector DB, I have already

02:03:26.530 --> 02:03:29.750
mentioned. So I have option number one, Facebook EIS

02:03:29.750 --> 02:03:35.170
similarity search. I have option number two, Chroma DB. In

02:03:35.170 --> 02:03:37.750
my calculation, I have mentioned pinecone by the way. Right.

02:03:38.010 --> 02:03:43.000
So I have pinecone and I think we all know the differences,

02:03:43.140 --> 02:03:46.480
major differences, open source proprietary. Right. So I have

02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:52.120
something called as Baviot. I have something called as

02:03:52.120 --> 02:03:57.410
option wise. Right. And even we can go ahead with the price

02:03:57.410 --> 02:04:00.670
comparison. So I have maybe Mongo DB as well. And nowadays,

02:04:00.730 --> 02:04:04.170
many databases are giving you those things. Right. Let's

02:04:04.170 --> 02:04:06.390
suppose if I'm implementing some sort of a traditional

02:04:06.390 --> 02:04:09.110
search as well. So this is the vector. So where you will go

02:04:09.110 --> 02:04:11.910
ahead with a dense search. Right. Let's suppose if I'm going

02:04:11.910 --> 02:04:13.070
ahead with a traditional search.

02:04:16.510 --> 02:04:18.990
So traditional search wise, we try to do an implementation

02:04:18.990 --> 02:04:21.050
of elastic search or

02:04:23.990 --> 02:04:27.310
same thing you will be able to find out inside AWS as a

02:04:27.310 --> 02:04:32.480
managed services, which is called as open search, search

02:04:32.480 --> 02:04:36.540
another service. Or maybe Vespa. Again, it's been used for a

02:04:36.540 --> 02:04:41.520
search operation, VESPA. Yeah. Okay. Now, so indexing and

02:04:41.520 --> 02:04:46.000
storage, right. Storage wise. So storage wise, what an

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:49.020
option I have. So if I'm using AWS, then obviously I have

02:04:49.020 --> 02:04:51.900
S3. If I'm using Azure. So in that case, I have a blob,

02:04:52.040 --> 02:04:57.940
Azure blobs. Azure BLOB, Azure blobs by the way. Or maybe I

02:04:57.940 --> 02:05:01.060
have a GCS option. If I'm using like a Google Cloud, GCS

02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:06.140
option. Right. Google storage, I have. Now, so this is for

02:05:06.140 --> 02:05:08.620
indexing and storage. So these are the option I can try to

02:05:08.620 --> 02:05:10.840
use like any of these options. So whenever I'm trying to

02:05:10.840 --> 02:05:14.520
design this project, I will be considering all of this. This

02:05:14.520 --> 02:05:16.860
is how and this is what your lead and architect is going to

02:05:16.860 --> 02:05:18.820
do. And this is what your senior developers are going to do.

02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:21.160
Right. So they will be considering multiple options. And

02:05:21.160 --> 02:05:23.480
obviously they will try to filter out only one option out of

02:05:23.480 --> 02:05:26.600
this based on cost optimization, latency, many other factors

02:05:26.600 --> 02:05:30.680
and a business tie ups basically. Right. So out of this one.

02:05:30.740 --> 02:05:32.720
But yeah, these are the option which is available to all of

02:05:32.720 --> 02:05:36.100
you. Now, if I'll talk about. Like embedding and re-ranking.

02:05:36.880 --> 02:05:40.100
So basically it was for layer number two. My layer number

02:05:40.100 --> 02:05:44.960
three was what? So my layer number three was re-ranking and

02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:45.900
embedding. Right.

02:05:49.640 --> 02:05:51.460
Embedding and re

02:05:54.310 --> 02:05:56.730
-ranking. Now, what are the option which is available to me

02:05:56.730 --> 02:05:59.970
for embedding? Very first option, which I would love to

02:05:59.970 --> 02:06:02.390
light, by the way, although you're not going to use it. I

02:06:02.390 --> 02:06:06.970
know URI API. We are providing it right for embedding. At

02:06:06.970 --> 02:06:09.510
least we are providing you 365 lakh token, which is too

02:06:09.510 --> 02:06:13.210
huge. Do the math. Calculate the cost for 365 lakh token.

02:06:13.610 --> 02:06:18.530
You will be amazed. Like, so, yeah, URI API is something

02:06:18.530 --> 02:06:20.690
that you can try to use. So where we are giving you text

02:06:20.690 --> 02:06:24.450
embedding three small model, by the way, from OpenAI. You

02:06:24.450 --> 02:06:30.250
can try to use maybe like OpenAI, OpenAI API directly. You

02:06:30.250 --> 02:06:32.950
can try to use maybe Kohira embedding.

02:06:38.250 --> 02:06:42.450
Kohira embedding. Right. You can try to use something from a

02:06:42.450 --> 02:06:47.880
hugging phase. Hugging phase sentence

02:06:49.730 --> 02:06:51.510
transformer.

02:06:53.710 --> 02:06:56.130
Yeah. So hugging phase sentence transform we can try to use.

02:06:56.190 --> 02:06:58.590
So maybe you can host it inside hugging phase and then use

02:06:58.590 --> 02:07:01.430
it. Maybe you can download it in a local or wherever you are

02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:04.270
processing it and then use it. Simple because whatever is

02:07:04.270 --> 02:07:06.750
available on hugging phase, it's open source. So you can you

02:07:06.750 --> 02:07:09.490
can download it basically and you can try to use it. Right.

02:07:11.370 --> 02:07:14.290
Don't be shy while promoting your own. Yeah, obviously I

02:07:14.290 --> 02:07:19.310
should not. Okay. So you can you can try to, you know, use

02:07:19.310 --> 02:07:21.970
hugging phase and sentence transformer. I think we all know

02:07:21.970 --> 02:07:24.710
inside my class. I have already used my Mr. Mistral. I

02:07:24.710 --> 02:07:27.690
believe last week last last week when I was talking about

02:07:27.690 --> 02:07:30.690
the embedding in my class. So I have already used it. So

02:07:30.690 --> 02:07:32.890
these are the option you have for embeddings, by the way,

02:07:32.930 --> 02:07:36.890
for a re-ranking. Basically, we have some of the open source

02:07:36.890 --> 02:07:45.380
re. These are for. These are technically for embedding.

02:07:45.400 --> 02:07:49.080
Right. I think we all are aware about it. Then re-ranking.

02:07:49.100 --> 02:07:55.020
Now, what is the option which is available to me? My

02:07:55.020 --> 02:07:57.920
handwriting is getting worse, by the way, re

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.840
-ranking. So for re-ranking, we can try to use something

02:08:10.840 --> 02:08:13.600
like open source BGE re-ranker.

02:08:17.650 --> 02:08:21.170
We can try to use a paid APIs by Kohira.

02:08:26.970 --> 02:08:29.510
So Kohira provide you both embedding as well as re-ranking

02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:34.510
services as an API. And we can try to use like something

02:08:34.510 --> 02:08:37.510
from a hugging phase as well, because there are like

02:08:42.690 --> 02:08:45.090
re-ranker which is available over there. So like MS macro

02:08:45.090 --> 02:08:48.610
model kind of things which has been used for the re-ranking.

02:08:48.690 --> 02:08:50.830
So hugging phase is basically a repository repository for

02:08:50.830 --> 02:08:53.570
everything. So you can get even re-ranker embedder, ML

02:08:53.570 --> 02:08:56.610
models, text model, speech model, everything. Right. So

02:08:56.610 --> 02:09:01.830
these are the option that I have in my hand now. So next one

02:09:01.830 --> 02:09:06.690
is basically for RAG purposes. RAG means I'll send a query,

02:09:06.850 --> 02:09:11.290
get the top K and then like send it to the LLM. So for RAG

02:09:11.290 --> 02:09:16.950
and LLM orchestration. So what I'm supposed to use and which

02:09:16.950 --> 02:09:20.470
framework I have. So framework wise, even yesterday when I

02:09:20.470 --> 02:09:22.770
have shown you the example, right. So I was using Langchain

02:09:22.770 --> 02:09:25.030
by the way, so that I can optimize my code because they are

02:09:25.030 --> 02:09:27.870
providing you a connectors. They are providing you the

02:09:27.870 --> 02:09:31.490
basically the high level SDKs. So I can try to use framework

02:09:31.490 --> 02:09:31.770
wise.

02:09:35.270 --> 02:09:37.610
Framework wise, I have what option I have basically

02:09:37.610 --> 02:09:40.450
Langchain.

02:09:41.390 --> 02:09:42.670
I have basically.

02:09:45.850 --> 02:09:54.050
Lama index as an option. I have. Lang. Graph as an option. I

02:09:54.050 --> 02:09:58.670
have. Kroo AI as an option. I have Autogen as an option. So

02:09:58.670 --> 02:10:00.630
there are so many options out there. Right framework wise.

02:10:00.830 --> 02:10:03.130
Yesterday I have already used Langchain when I was trying to

02:10:03.130 --> 02:10:07.430
demonstrate RAG application. Right for maybe Facebook AI

02:10:07.430 --> 02:10:12.990
like similarity search indexing and retrieval. Yeah. Now so

02:10:12.990 --> 02:10:16.030
LLM you need. So these are the framework right. But these

02:10:16.030 --> 02:10:19.270
frameworks needs LLM access LLM access right. So that you

02:10:19.270 --> 02:10:22.290
can send the query and the document to the LLM and then LLM

02:10:22.290 --> 02:10:25.630
is going to give you the final response. So you can try to

02:10:25.630 --> 02:10:31.590
use obviously LLM wise proudly. URI API which is providing

02:10:31.590 --> 02:10:35.690
you what. So which is providing you open AI model which is

02:10:35.690 --> 02:10:38.630
providing you a deep seek model which

02:10:41.410 --> 02:10:44.470
is providing you a Mistral series model which is providing

02:10:44.470 --> 02:10:50.510
you a Gemini series model. Right. All the latest one. So you

02:10:50.510 --> 02:10:53.310
can try to use this one for LLM access. You can try to use

02:10:53.310 --> 02:10:59.190
obviously open AI GPT over here. Not just open AI I would

02:10:59.190 --> 02:11:05.690
say you can try to use a Gemini even series. You can try to

02:11:05.690 --> 02:11:10.670
use a Meta Lama series. Again it's very much powerful. Lama

02:11:10.670 --> 02:11:12.750
series. You have entropic clouded series.

02:11:16.620 --> 02:11:21.700
Entropic. Clouded series you can try to use in terms of API.

02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:25.140
If you have to consume Meta Lama it's open source Gemini.

02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:27.500
Many models are open source. If I talk about a Mistral

02:11:27.500 --> 02:11:30.140
series many models are already open source. If I talk about

02:11:30.140 --> 02:11:32.580
a deep seek series many models are already open source. So

02:11:32.580 --> 02:11:35.160
you can try to even use those model directly into your

02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:37.800
production by self hosting it. If you have a concern that I

02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:42.660
should not use these like models with the API. So this is

02:11:42.660 --> 02:11:44.260
something which I have already shown in my YouTube channel.

02:11:44.340 --> 02:11:46.920
Right. That how you can try to do the inferencing with the

02:11:46.920 --> 02:11:51.060
help of V LLM. Yeah. V LLM framework is already there. So

02:11:51.060 --> 02:11:53.860
you can just quickly go and run it and you will be able to

02:11:53.860 --> 02:11:57.280
even host your model. Yeah. So this is basically like

02:11:57.280 --> 02:12:00.040
elements that I can try to use. So there are multiple LLM

02:12:00.040 --> 02:12:03.260
provider which is available to me. And once this is done

02:12:03.260 --> 02:12:06.540
then I had basically what I had a application layer

02:12:06.540 --> 02:12:14.580
application layer. Where I had to create a web app mobile

02:12:14.580 --> 02:12:16.760
app I had to create I had to create the admin. I have to

02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:20.420
create basically like a connector for a slack connector or

02:12:20.420 --> 02:12:23.700
teams connector for a WhatsApp or telegram or bot you can

02:12:23.700 --> 02:12:27.920
say. Right. So here again. So when I talk about application

02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:31.020
layer inside application layer majorly back end and front

02:12:31.020 --> 02:12:33.060
end will come into a picture in the first place. So back end

02:12:33.060 --> 02:12:38.400
wise back end wise. So in which one I'm going to write the

02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:41.540
back end my choice will be fast API. If I'm using a python

02:12:41.540 --> 02:12:44.620
framework if I'm using a mon framework in that case my

02:12:44.620 --> 02:12:47.600
option my choice will be node. Right. But let's suppose we

02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:50.420
are developing everything in a python. So in that case. My

02:12:50.420 --> 02:12:55.340
back end I can write into a fast API fast API other option I

02:12:55.340 --> 02:12:58.260
have. But maybe I will not prefer to use it in a production.

02:12:58.420 --> 02:13:02.380
For example flask is an option. Right. Django also provides

02:13:02.380 --> 02:13:09.520
you. Django also provides you this option. But my go to

02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:12.940
option will be fast API basically. So my favorite choice if

02:13:12.940 --> 02:13:15.440
someone is going to ask me. So I'll simply say that go with

02:13:15.440 --> 02:13:18.260
the fast API. It's literally a stable production grid that

02:13:18.260 --> 02:13:20.500
you will be able to create. Not with flask. Not with Django.

02:13:21.100 --> 02:13:28.350
If I have to use our front end. Right. So front end. So

02:13:28.350 --> 02:13:31.170
obviously in case of like a front end you will be able to

02:13:31.170 --> 02:13:34.290
create a front end in a streamlint. But again worst one.

02:13:34.410 --> 02:13:36.890
Front end streamlint is not meant for like a production

02:13:36.890 --> 02:13:40.090
grid. It is not going to give you a UI flexibility and a

02:13:40.090 --> 02:13:42.410
better user experience. It's just to create the demo

02:13:42.410 --> 02:13:50.910
application. So my option will be react and next js. So your

02:13:50.910 --> 02:13:53.130
team will do it. So once you are going to create because

02:13:53.130 --> 02:13:55.710
majorly it's a back end game. Right. Majorly it's a back end

02:13:55.710 --> 02:13:58.410
game. Everything is scales in a back end. Everything will go

02:13:58.410 --> 02:14:01.330
and crash in a back end. So front end is just like one

02:14:01.330 --> 02:14:04.330
single like a UI interface which can be like created by one

02:14:04.330 --> 02:14:06.650
single developer. A front end developer. Right. As per the

02:14:06.650 --> 02:14:10.290
design. So here front end you can try to use like this one

02:14:10.290 --> 02:14:18.170
for prototyping. So maybe front end for prototyping if you

02:14:18.170 --> 02:14:20.970
are looking for a quick solution then maybe you can go

02:14:20.970 --> 02:14:26.530
ahead. And use a streamlint. But I never recommend and I

02:14:26.530 --> 02:14:29.310
never like suggest to any team or even in my team that go

02:14:29.310 --> 02:14:34.170
ahead and use like a streamlint and Gradio UI. Which is a

02:14:34.170 --> 02:14:37.050
Python based UI Python based like a library for creating a

02:14:37.050 --> 02:14:40.890
UI in a production environment. So not you don't use it if

02:14:40.890 --> 02:14:44.170
you are just doing a prototyping. It's fine. Right. But if

02:14:44.170 --> 02:14:46.570
you are building something for the user something which you

02:14:46.570 --> 02:14:50.830
would like to like a sell then answer is no. Very simple.

02:14:50.950 --> 02:14:54.230
Right. Answer is going to be. Absolute no from my side. So

02:14:54.230 --> 02:14:56.550
back end and front end again inside that chat interface

02:14:56.550 --> 02:15:00.210
admin and everything you are going to create it. Right. And

02:15:00.210 --> 02:15:04.110
then obviously your back end. So you are going to create

02:15:04.110 --> 02:15:07.010
even a bot. Right. Which you will write in a back end and

02:15:07.010 --> 02:15:09.830
that you will be able to integrate into either as a slack

02:15:09.830 --> 02:15:12.870
bot as a telegram bot as a team bot as a Jira plug in

02:15:12.870 --> 02:15:15.190
something like that. You can try to integrate. So these are

02:15:15.190 --> 02:15:20.090
the tech stack in general you are supposed to use. Then. For

02:15:20.090 --> 02:15:23.950
a deployment of the infrastructure.

02:15:29.780 --> 02:15:32.500
So we have already done the cost calculation. Now that cost

02:15:32.500 --> 02:15:36.680
calculation. So Infrawise I have considered AWS from there.

02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:40.660
I was using M7G by the way which was node which was one of

02:15:40.660 --> 02:15:44.320
the machine and based on that we have like done the cost

02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:48.940
calculation. Now so I'm assuming that I will be going ahead

02:15:48.940 --> 02:15:52.640
with the EKS. You can go to the GKS. You can go with the AKS

02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:57.820
Azure GCP. And like AWS. All three are providing you this

02:15:57.820 --> 02:16:01.480
one or even there are other hundreds of vendors who will

02:16:01.480 --> 02:16:05.000
provide you the same Kubernetes services. Right. The hyper

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:06.780
stack which I was showing you. So even they provide you the

02:16:06.780 --> 02:16:11.800
same but with GPUs. So I can try to like use Kubernetes

02:16:11.800 --> 02:16:16.980
basically and EKS cluster in general. I'm going to use it

02:16:16.980 --> 02:16:21.420
right for maybe API Gateway Gateway

02:16:25.710 --> 02:16:27.370
and load

02:16:32.070 --> 02:16:35.210
balancing. Because whenever there will be more traffic. So

02:16:35.210 --> 02:16:37.970
again one machine will spin automatically when my entire

02:16:37.970 --> 02:16:40.930
machine utilization will be at 60 percent or 70 percent. So

02:16:40.930 --> 02:16:44.530
we try to do a load balancing. By default AWS provides you

02:16:44.530 --> 02:16:47.210
that. So auto load balance load balancer you can try to

02:16:47.210 --> 02:16:50.390
configure. Right. You can try to even integrate NGINX or

02:16:50.390 --> 02:16:58.770
maybe you can try to use a AWS API Gateway. So or AWS API

02:16:58.770 --> 02:17:04.020
Gateway. It's a configuration things basically. So anyhow

02:17:04.020 --> 02:17:05.940
whenever you are going to configure your environment you

02:17:05.940 --> 02:17:09.480
will do it. Then obviously you have to do a CI CD continuous

02:17:09.480 --> 02:17:13.480
integration continuous development. So generally my like

02:17:13.480 --> 02:17:16.120
internally as of now inside of your own we are using GitHub

02:17:16.120 --> 02:17:21.160
action. GitHub action even now. And even my previous

02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:23.660
organization I was using GitHub action. We have other option

02:17:23.660 --> 02:17:26.100
as well. So we have like a GitLab CI.

02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:34.280
We have like Jenkins for continuous integration continuous

02:17:34.280 --> 02:17:37.720
development. So as of now we are using this GitHub action.

02:17:37.860 --> 02:17:40.760
But yeah you have like other hundreds option as well. I have

02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:43.140
mentioned out of that three options basically for all of

02:17:43.140 --> 02:17:46.220
you. Right. So deployment is fine. Now once deployment will

02:17:46.220 --> 02:17:49.140
be done then obviously I have to think about the monitoring

02:17:49.140 --> 02:17:50.240
because

02:17:53.120 --> 02:17:56.640
you have to keep on monitoring the entire server right from

02:17:56.640 --> 02:18:02.360
every side. So in terms of monitoring metrics and alert

02:18:02.360 --> 02:18:07.660
wise. I can try to configure Prometheus plus

02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:12.040
Grafana.

02:18:15.090 --> 02:18:21.540
Now so logging wise if I do a login. So I can try to use.

02:18:23.180 --> 02:18:28.790
Elk stack. So technically Elk is nothing but elastic

02:18:28.790 --> 02:18:31.650
logstash and Kibana. This is what it is full form wise

02:18:31.650 --> 02:18:36.510
right. Or maybe I can use a open telemetry. Open

02:18:41.380 --> 02:18:46.160
open telemetry and yeah. So trace tracing wise if I could

02:18:46.160 --> 02:18:51.540
trace some of the logs tracing wise I can try to use. I can

02:18:51.540 --> 02:18:54.740
try to use basically Jagger. There are multiple option again

02:18:54.740 --> 02:19:01.590
available for this one but Jagger or maybe Jipkin. I can try

02:19:01.590 --> 02:19:06.790
to use it. Yeah. So this are the tech stack guys which you

02:19:06.790 --> 02:19:09.590
should know that every layer which take a stack in general

02:19:09.590 --> 02:19:13.490
you were trying to use because people will ask you a

02:19:13.490 --> 02:19:15.770
question. Right. People will ask you a question that okay

02:19:15.770 --> 02:19:18.990
fine for this purposes. What was the tech stack that you

02:19:18.990 --> 02:19:21.950
have used and what are the alternative. Right. What are the

02:19:21.950 --> 02:19:25.410
alternative. So if you have used this one why not this that

02:19:25.410 --> 02:19:28.610
that kind of a question will be asked multiple times. If you

02:19:28.610 --> 02:19:30.750
are going to join as a lead. If you are going to join as an

02:19:30.750 --> 02:19:33.910
architect and you should know a 10 other option for

02:19:33.910 --> 02:19:37.150
everything because in the market if I'll talk about

02:19:37.150 --> 02:19:40.310
especially today 2025 right for everything. There are 10

02:19:40.310 --> 02:19:44.130
other options available in the market. Yeah security wise

02:19:44.130 --> 02:19:47.150
you can try to use SSO by default. Right. So key clock is

02:19:47.150 --> 02:19:49.590
something octa is something and try to use if you're using a

02:19:49.590 --> 02:19:51.910
juice. There is something called as Azure ad right

02:19:51.910 --> 02:19:54.570
encryption wise. You can try to use a vault which is

02:19:54.570 --> 02:19:58.170
available in a WGCP Azure or KMS services which is available

02:19:58.170 --> 02:20:00.730
on it was Azure and GCP. So these are the things that you

02:20:00.730 --> 02:20:03.530
can try to use it for authentication and encryption wise.

02:20:04.070 --> 02:20:13.190
Yeah simple now so fine. This is this now

02:20:16.680 --> 02:20:20.960
let's talk about a team structure by the way. Yeah. So what

02:20:20.960 --> 02:20:23.480
like a kind of a team which will be involved in this one

02:20:23.480 --> 02:20:26.320
then I can say we are able to cover this one. So

02:20:26.320 --> 02:20:28.600
architecture layer cost layer I have covered architecture

02:20:28.600 --> 02:20:31.640
layer. So like a general architecture layer plus tech

02:20:31.640 --> 02:20:34.900
architecture layer. I have already covered cost. I think

02:20:34.900 --> 02:20:38.540
estimated cost I have given to you. Now let's talk about the

02:20:38.540 --> 02:20:42.260
team structure that what will be the team and where you will

02:20:42.260 --> 02:20:45.180
fit in by the way night. What will be your day to day tasks.

02:20:45.280 --> 02:20:48.100
So this is the place from where you will be able to derive

02:20:48.100 --> 02:20:54.800
it. So let's talk about a team over here. So obviously like

02:20:54.800 --> 02:20:57.440
the layer that we have already created. So for every layer

02:20:57.440 --> 02:21:00.040
there will be a team and again over here. So I have broken

02:21:00.040 --> 02:21:02.700
down my layers into a couple of more things like level 1

02:21:02.700 --> 02:21:06.780
level 2. So for every like places there will be you can put

02:21:06.780 --> 02:21:10.240
to two members right and then combine this four members is

02:21:10.240 --> 02:21:12.700
equal to one lead and then like a two lead is equal to one

02:21:12.700 --> 02:21:15.720
manager and then two managers is equal to one director. This

02:21:15.720 --> 02:21:18.780
is generally like we try to do a lump sum calculation right

02:21:18.780 --> 02:21:23.000
team wise again. It's not a thumb rule that every time I

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:26.340
should go and then I should use the same thumb rule to

02:21:26.340 --> 02:21:29.900
estimate the team. But yeah in general. So this is the

02:21:29.900 --> 02:21:34.120
hierarchy that we will be able to get. So here if I talk

02:21:34.120 --> 02:21:35.980
about a team team

02:21:48.270 --> 02:21:51.930
structure right. So first of all there will be a core team.

02:21:53.390 --> 02:21:56.570
Who will come in a place now core team wise. So there will

02:21:56.570 --> 02:21:58.770
be a product manager

02:22:02.800 --> 02:22:06.260
right. There will be a solution architect.

02:22:12.810 --> 02:22:16.270
There will be a tech lead

02:22:18.540 --> 02:22:23.240
for a different different things right. So for like RAG and

02:22:23.240 --> 02:22:25.440
all those things there will be different tech lead for front

02:22:25.440 --> 02:22:27.860
end back end there will be different tech lead. It's like

02:22:27.860 --> 02:22:36.740
many. So here multi stack wise right in a startups obviously

02:22:36.740 --> 02:22:38.940
there will be one. Maybe there will be no tech lead. There

02:22:38.940 --> 02:22:40.680
will be no solution architect. There will be no like a

02:22:40.680 --> 02:22:43.360
product manager a bunch of junior developer and then founder

02:22:43.360 --> 02:22:46.840
work together right in a startup culture. But yeah so in

02:22:46.840 --> 02:22:49.440
general in MNC and progress companies you will find this

02:22:49.440 --> 02:22:54.020
kind of a structure by the way fine. Now inside a team you

02:22:54.020 --> 02:22:58.120
will be able to find out like a different different. Again

02:22:58.120 --> 02:23:01.280
inside this you will be able to find a different pod. So

02:23:01.280 --> 02:23:04.360
let's suppose if for this project if I had to create the pod

02:23:04.360 --> 02:23:08.580
so pod means a bunch of team member. Yeah bunch of team

02:23:08.580 --> 02:23:10.880
member. So there will be layer wise pod.

02:23:15.650 --> 02:23:18.230
So there will be ingestion pod ingestion was my first layer

02:23:18.230 --> 02:23:22.390
right. There will be my retrieval pod

02:23:24.570 --> 02:23:29.830
not SD pod just a name I would say. So every company like

02:23:29.830 --> 02:23:32.850
try to call it in a different way. It's my way of calling

02:23:32.850 --> 02:23:38.370
it. So app and integration wise integration

02:23:40.610 --> 02:23:44.330
pod will be there. Then a platform and security pod will be

02:23:44.330 --> 02:23:44.550
there.

02:23:50.550 --> 02:23:54.610
Security pod many many like managers and many directors they

02:23:54.610 --> 02:23:56.930
try to give a different different name to their team. Even I

02:23:56.930 --> 02:23:59.730
have given a different different name based on maybe a star

02:23:59.730 --> 02:24:03.010
based on maybe a river or maybe places. But yeah in general

02:24:03.010 --> 02:24:09.290
it's a pod and then there will be a Q analytics pod. So

02:24:09.290 --> 02:24:14.520
testing basically. QA and analytics

02:24:18.800 --> 02:24:24.520
pod. Yeah. So as a gen AI engineer you will be a part of

02:24:24.520 --> 02:24:26.580
this one. You will be a part of this one. Maybe you will be

02:24:26.580 --> 02:24:28.820
a part of this one. You will be a part of this one or maybe

02:24:28.820 --> 02:24:32.400
you will be a part of last pod as well. So or maybe you will

02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:36.280
be like hovering over like all of these pod sometime here

02:24:36.280 --> 02:24:38.980
sometime there with a different different work. But yeah you

02:24:38.980 --> 02:24:42.680
will be a part of any of this pod as a lead. You can lead

02:24:42.680 --> 02:24:45.300
one team or maybe one pod or maybe multiple pod. Manager

02:24:45.300 --> 02:24:48.200
means all pod will come in. Under you director means again

02:24:48.200 --> 02:24:51.460
multiple managers with multiple such kind of a product will

02:24:51.460 --> 02:24:54.620
comes under one director. So this is how things happens. So

02:24:54.620 --> 02:24:59.940
if I'll have to create the hierarchy so here let's suppose I

02:24:59.940 --> 02:25:03.760
have a team member pod basically right. So you can be a part

02:25:03.760 --> 02:25:07.900
of any of this pod. So let's suppose I have a four pod

02:25:07.900 --> 02:25:19.380
right. Pod one. Pod two. Pod three. Pod four. So lead one

02:25:19.380 --> 02:25:26.720
can manage one or two pod it depends lead one and then maybe

02:25:26.720 --> 02:25:31.520
lead two. Again I'm just like creating the simple structure

02:25:31.520 --> 02:25:34.860
and then there is a three leads let's suppose right lead

02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:40.980
three. And then there are like a manager on top of this

02:25:40.980 --> 02:25:42.100
technical

02:25:44.910 --> 02:25:48.690
manager right. So manager one or architect even you can say

02:25:48.690 --> 02:25:49.850
architect

02:25:53.500 --> 02:25:56.960
or manager. And then there will be like manager technical

02:25:56.960 --> 02:25:59.380
one and then there will be in a product based companies you

02:25:59.380 --> 02:26:04.000
will find out technical manager. And then maybe architect or

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:07.280
director. They will be reporting to this one. So maybe this

02:26:07.280 --> 02:26:11.020
hierarchy this will go even longer. So as the organization

02:26:11.020 --> 02:26:14.880
structure will change or it will be like big. But yeah in

02:26:14.880 --> 02:26:16.920
general you will be able to find out these many layers.

02:26:18.020 --> 02:26:22.340
Generally layers will be more actually. But yeah in a

02:26:22.340 --> 02:26:26.160
startup. So maybe only one bottom layer you will be able to

02:26:26.160 --> 02:26:30.360
find out right. In maybe MNCs this many layers in a product.

02:26:30.520 --> 02:26:33.180
So where the work is just to build a robust and solid

02:26:33.180 --> 02:26:36.060
product. So maybe more layers you will find out over there.

02:26:37.120 --> 02:26:41.320
Now so here the estimated timeline for

02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:50.450
this project at least with this team capacity. So in one pod

02:26:50.450 --> 02:26:54.010
let's suppose I'm trying to keep like a three member three

02:26:54.010 --> 02:26:56.790
member three member three member. So three three three three

02:26:56.790 --> 02:26:59.730
three and then lead one two three. So three lead two manager

02:26:59.730 --> 02:27:03.950
one architect. So one and plus two three plus three six plus

02:27:03.950 --> 02:27:07.890
basically this twelve. So six plus twelve is equal to 18. So

02:27:07.890 --> 02:27:12.110
the total team configuration which I have done is 18 member.

02:27:13.830 --> 02:27:17.510
18 member as of now right. Apart from the stakeholders and

02:27:17.510 --> 02:27:19.970
HR and all those things I'm not considering that. Those are

02:27:19.970 --> 02:27:22.770
like I'm just talking about a team member for this

02:27:22.770 --> 02:27:25.250
particular project. There are in total 18 team member. Now

02:27:25.250 --> 02:27:28.370
if 18 team member is working in this hierarchy the hierarchy

02:27:28.370 --> 02:27:31.630
which I have designed. So what will be the phases. So let's

02:27:31.630 --> 02:27:34.410
suppose we have divided this entire project into six phases

02:27:34.410 --> 02:27:37.950
because even that estimation you have to give. You can't

02:27:37.950 --> 02:27:41.030
like start building a project without any timelines right.

02:27:41.170 --> 02:27:44.910
And timelines must be given beforehand itself. So timeline

02:27:44.910 --> 02:27:50.110
is six months. Let's suppose right. So you can break down

02:27:50.110 --> 02:27:53.850
into a phase basically. So phase one then two then three

02:27:53.850 --> 02:27:59.330
then four then five and then six right. So in like a phase

02:27:59.330 --> 02:28:03.190
number one and every phase. Every phase four weeks.

02:28:07.680 --> 02:28:10.380
Every phase four weeks right means tend to be one month

02:28:10.380 --> 02:28:14.520
right. And maybe you can say 20 to 22 working days because

02:28:14.520 --> 02:28:16.980
we'll be having Saturday Sunday leave right. So we have to

02:28:16.980 --> 02:28:19.100
consider even that kind of estimation. So when we are trying

02:28:19.100 --> 02:28:22.880
to talk about like the entire execution and planning of the

02:28:22.880 --> 02:28:26.820
timeline right. So 22 days these may team members some will

02:28:26.820 --> 02:28:29.840
go for the leave and lot of things. Like variable we have to

02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:32.060
consider. But yeah we do consider all those things as well

02:28:32.060 --> 02:28:35.820
so that we can try to estimate the total budget because we

02:28:35.820 --> 02:28:39.380
never start a project without a budgeting before like budget

02:28:39.380 --> 02:28:42.560
during the execution or during the project creation and

02:28:42.560 --> 02:28:45.740
budgeting even after the creation for maintenance. And then

02:28:45.740 --> 02:28:48.100
because let's suppose if I'm building this project for my

02:28:48.100 --> 02:28:51.960
client. So obviously when I'm giving a quotation right. I

02:28:51.960 --> 02:28:54.080
have to give that and before that I have to consider this

02:28:54.080 --> 02:28:56.180
one. For example I have built many projects. I have worked

02:28:56.180 --> 02:28:59.800
for many clients. So majorly my job. Actually starts with

02:28:59.800 --> 02:29:02.700
this one the calculation part like how much time it is going

02:29:02.700 --> 02:29:05.000
to do. What is the feature that we are going to develop how

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.400
much time it is going to take what kind of a people will

02:29:07.400 --> 02:29:09.580
come over here. What will be their salary what will be their

02:29:09.580 --> 02:29:13.120
like a per hour charges many many like a variables we used

02:29:13.120 --> 02:29:15.460
to consider. So I have like a big big template I have with

02:29:15.460 --> 02:29:19.100
me in Excel sheet and then I used to put up those data all

02:29:19.100 --> 02:29:22.980
those variables and then we used to do the calculation. And

02:29:22.980 --> 02:29:25.000
it's like a variable calculation for all the clients and

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:29.320
based on that we try to give the quotation and timelines. So

02:29:29.320 --> 02:29:32.780
yeah four week per phase will run for six like a month

02:29:32.780 --> 02:29:35.620
tentatively and then we can claim that okay fine so we can

02:29:35.620 --> 02:29:38.940
go for the deployment plus we try to keep a delta delta

02:29:38.940 --> 02:29:41.860
means like three four week of delta. We can try to keep

02:29:41.860 --> 02:29:46.120
because of maybe some like a bottleneck there could be a

02:29:46.120 --> 02:29:49.300
delay right there could be a delay and then on the six week.

02:29:49.440 --> 02:29:51.900
So we are going to deliver all of these phases. So we have

02:29:51.900 --> 02:29:54.020
already written this phases right. So we can try to deliver

02:29:54.020 --> 02:29:57.260
these phases or maybe we can work on the panel. So this is

02:29:57.260 --> 02:30:00.180
all about this project guys. So hope all of you are able to

02:30:00.180 --> 02:30:03.040
understand from the architecture level what problem we are

02:30:03.040 --> 02:30:07.640
trying to solve and you know team structure and then even a

02:30:07.640 --> 02:30:11.840
cost structure. Now I think whenever you're going for the

02:30:11.840 --> 02:30:14.340
interview you will be able to talk about it that what

02:30:14.340 --> 02:30:17.380
project we were trying to like do what the problem that we

02:30:17.380 --> 02:30:20.780
were trying to solve. What was my team structure where I fit

02:30:20.780 --> 02:30:24.300
in in which pod what we were trying to like a build and how

02:30:24.300 --> 02:30:27.220
it was developing or helping my clients or maybe my customer

02:30:27.220 --> 02:30:30.420
my internal team or my. Company everything right.

02:30:34.420 --> 02:30:39.280
Yes everyone. Yeah. So that's it from my side by the way

02:30:39.280 --> 02:30:44.100
guys for this project. Yeah. So now I'm going to open up a

02:30:44.100 --> 02:30:46.160
question and answering and if you have any kind of a

02:30:46.160 --> 02:30:48.940
question. So please raise your hand once I will clear all

02:30:48.940 --> 02:30:51.740
the questions then I'll close the discussion.

02:31:00.260 --> 02:31:03.280
Okay. So any question I'm open for any kind of a question by

02:31:03.280 --> 02:31:06.760
the way. Yeah. Go ahead. I said this is better. Yeah. Go

02:31:06.760 --> 02:31:10.100
ahead please. Yeah. Yes. I like it. Very very useful

02:31:10.100 --> 02:31:14.360
teaching lecture today sir. Thank you. I like a lot many

02:31:14.360 --> 02:31:17.300
concepts in terms of architecture wise like when very

02:31:17.300 --> 02:31:21.320
broader perspective you taught and things like initially as

02:31:21.320 --> 02:31:23.980
you told like just uploading the data to the vector DB and

02:31:23.980 --> 02:31:27.440
accessing it. It's not that simple like in the house you

02:31:27.440 --> 02:31:29.720
told him. I think now we are able to understand that it's

02:31:29.720 --> 02:31:33.360
not that simple right. So just uploading like data to

02:31:33.360 --> 02:31:36.560
somewhere. Yeah. Yes. Like this is completely an enterprise

02:31:36.560 --> 02:31:39.740
grade grade like dip complete deployment. End-to-end

02:31:39.740 --> 02:31:43.260
product. So so actually like a couple of days back like when

02:31:43.260 --> 02:31:46.500
like there is a cloud forum. I'm actually like I'm into the

02:31:46.500 --> 02:31:51.160
kubernetes like teams are currently so like yeah, like last

02:31:51.160 --> 02:31:54.840
week. There is a cloud forum every like a month or a couple

02:31:54.840 --> 02:31:57.000
of months like there will be a cloud from meeting that will

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.860
be happening to share the updates or whatever the metrics

02:31:59.860 --> 02:32:02.340
they are done. What are the automation we implemented they

02:32:02.340 --> 02:32:05.200
will be sharing over there. So they are like they actually

02:32:05.200 --> 02:32:09.380
having a plans to like implement. They didn't have any

02:32:09.380 --> 02:32:12.140
complete road map or structure, but they wanted to leverage

02:32:12.140 --> 02:32:15.960
the DNA tools and just somehow they wanted to improve the

02:32:15.960 --> 02:32:19.920
architecture and enhance it. So like very like just a couple

02:32:19.920 --> 02:32:23.020
of days back. There was like it seems like the cloud head

02:32:23.020 --> 02:32:28.280
was there. He was asking like our like there are two teams

02:32:28.280 --> 02:32:30.940
like cloud engineering team in cloud engineering like two

02:32:30.940 --> 02:32:33.600
parts like we are dedicated to the cash cash is the

02:32:33.600 --> 02:32:36.740
kubernetes and the Azure services. So they were the cloud

02:32:36.740 --> 02:32:40.420
head. They were like he actually asked the people to just

02:32:40.420 --> 02:32:45.540
took you four of python people. So it didn't came to us but

02:32:45.540 --> 02:32:47.880
we had since we don't work on python. We only work on

02:32:47.880 --> 02:32:51.140
Jenkins pipelines and all so the thing is like when I got to

02:32:51.140 --> 02:32:54.480
know I was very disappointed. I was really working looking

02:32:54.480 --> 02:32:57.880
for an opportunity of this kind. So what I did is I just

02:32:57.880 --> 02:33:01.540
pinged him directly even though I don't know about what is

02:33:01.540 --> 02:33:06.440
rag and what is an MCB server and all. Okay. I just pinged

02:33:06.440 --> 02:33:09.000
him and said like whatever the work that is if you are

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:13.320
planning to any give any work or like any future works comes

02:33:13.320 --> 02:33:15.900
on. Just I'm really interested to work on on these things.

02:33:16.180 --> 02:33:19.960
So just a couple of days back you just showing the rag

02:33:19.960 --> 02:33:24.360
implementation part. So like when I pinged him that's what

02:33:24.360 --> 02:33:27.120
he told what he told you like. So initially you start with

02:33:27.120 --> 02:33:32.120
like how to develop an agent and like focus on agent. That's

02:33:32.120 --> 02:33:35.880
what he told and connecting that agent to the MCB server. So

02:33:35.880 --> 02:33:39.820
yeah, like when you explain all these things that can be

02:33:39.820 --> 02:33:41.900
done learning that can be done in like a half an hour. I

02:33:41.900 --> 02:33:48.280
would say or one hour max to max. Yes, what I did is like

02:33:48.280 --> 02:33:51.200
just committed like I thought okay later on learn these

02:33:51.200 --> 02:33:54.840
things. Okay, so like I was parallel when you're like

02:33:54.840 --> 02:33:57.640
explaining all these things I was searching because I was in

02:33:57.640 --> 02:34:01.360
the AKS team. So how like chroma DB since you told I mean

02:34:01.360 --> 02:34:04.820
stream like I mean explain the front-end through manually.

02:34:04.820 --> 02:34:09.360
And chroma DB just creating the sample account and all I was

02:34:09.360 --> 02:34:12.500
searching in my AKS way. How can I implement it in like how

02:34:12.500 --> 02:34:15.140
can I pull the docker image and deploy it as a deployment

02:34:15.140 --> 02:34:19.020
and with streamlit as a front-end. How can I connect that I

02:34:19.020 --> 02:34:21.740
was searching all these things. Yeah, so that kind of a

02:34:21.740 --> 02:34:23.560
project I have already discussed multiple times. Maybe you

02:34:23.560 --> 02:34:26.220
don't have to search me just go through the one of the

02:34:26.220 --> 02:34:28.980
classes which I have already delivered and even code is

02:34:28.980 --> 02:34:31.620
available. So it can be done and then that will be like a

02:34:31.620 --> 02:34:35.380
good starting point for you. Yes. Yes. So like. In order to

02:34:35.380 --> 02:34:38.440
scale it to an enterprise level like and one more hurdle is

02:34:38.440 --> 02:34:42.980
like I don't know whether how many like standard if not

02:34:42.980 --> 02:34:45.900
sure. Maybe when the R&D cluster that I have maybe I can

02:34:45.900 --> 02:34:50.180
pull image and I can spin up and run the chroma DB. But

02:34:50.180 --> 02:34:53.960
yeah, in terms of standardization whether what they did is

02:34:53.960 --> 02:34:57.540
like they are having them and it seems like they did

02:34:57.540 --> 02:35:03.520
developed an over like kind of open-air wrapper and so but

02:35:03.520 --> 02:35:06.560
only. That need to be used I hope but in terms of using open

02:35:06.560 --> 02:35:10.180
-air tools that open-source tool that's again broader

02:35:10.180 --> 02:35:14.840
discussion. So yeah, this is a starting points of the sort.

02:35:16.340 --> 02:35:18.880
Okay. Okay. I hope you have you are enjoying this class by

02:35:18.880 --> 02:35:21.700
the way. Very much. Very much. Yeah. And what about what

02:35:21.700 --> 02:35:24.060
about others guys? So are you enjoying or not? Not enjoying

02:35:24.060 --> 02:35:27.160
just like opened up a laptop watching as a movie and then

02:35:27.160 --> 02:35:35.090
okay fine. So yeah in a chat. Okay. Sorry. He's saying this

02:35:35.090 --> 02:35:35.250
is.

02:35:38.990 --> 02:35:42.330
So when you explain all these things that are like I mean in

02:35:42.330 --> 02:35:45.390
terms of layers and tools and costing wise. So yeah, I

02:35:45.390 --> 02:35:49.010
thought like maybe I once said did this in this week. I'm

02:35:49.010 --> 02:35:51.990
planning to deploy that chroma DB and just have a sample

02:35:51.990 --> 02:35:56.270
records uploaded and just show a sample prototype bot kind

02:35:56.270 --> 02:36:00.070
of thing. So and then maybe just noting all these jotting

02:36:00.070 --> 02:36:03.330
all these points. Okay, if you are planning and allocating

02:36:03.330 --> 02:36:07.130
budget. So this is maybe. Enterprise grader graded project.

02:36:07.250 --> 02:36:10.890
That's what I wanted to planning to show. Yeah. Yes. Yeah.

02:36:11.050 --> 02:36:17.490
Okay. Thank you. Thanks. Nice. Abhijit Abhijit. Yes. Please

02:36:17.490 --> 02:36:22.790
go ahead. Has been so yeah. So thing is like as you said

02:36:22.790 --> 02:36:28.710
just a few minutes back like apart from streamlit like it's

02:36:28.710 --> 02:36:32.790
not production grade. Okay. So what context you are saying

02:36:32.790 --> 02:36:36.470
because reason why I'm asking because. In my organization we

02:36:36.470 --> 02:36:41.450
have a lot of app is in it's in our shiny. Okay, okay. Sign

02:36:41.450 --> 02:36:45.830
up basically. Yes, I need. Yeah. So the worst library I

02:36:45.830 --> 02:36:48.930
would say for building at least a UI again sign here. I've

02:36:48.930 --> 02:36:52.550
used it when like I've used I think like six seven years

02:36:52.550 --> 02:36:57.210
back. I've been using it. Okay. Okay. So it's a and it's a

02:36:57.210 --> 02:37:00.790
worst one by the way. Okay, like but like last three three

02:37:00.790 --> 02:37:04.410
four years here. I'm on so developing shiny app. Okay. So I

02:37:04.410 --> 02:37:08.430
think you should leave it my honest my honest advice to you.

02:37:09.650 --> 02:37:14.630
So well Django or whatever the other things you said. I

02:37:14.630 --> 02:37:16.910
think yeah, go ahead with the react react or next. I would

02:37:16.910 --> 02:37:19.050
say more stack like for a front end. So go ahead with the

02:37:19.050 --> 02:37:21.790
react on it because see whenever you are building some

02:37:21.790 --> 02:37:24.270
interface right, especially a user interface, right? It

02:37:24.270 --> 02:37:27.950
should be very much flexible a feature-driven aesthetic and

02:37:27.950 --> 02:37:32.150
plus like a color combination ease of use right all these

02:37:32.150 --> 02:37:34.630
things are pretty much important. You will not be able to

02:37:34.630 --> 02:37:37.310
get a flexibility with respect to maybe a signee or with

02:37:37.310 --> 02:37:40.570
respect to a streamlint or graduate, right? These are just

02:37:40.570 --> 02:37:43.550
for the prototyping that okay fine. So this is the basic

02:37:43.550 --> 02:37:46.330
then there is a button. There is a tab like that. That's

02:37:46.330 --> 02:37:49.510
fine. But if I'm building something which can be used by

02:37:49.510 --> 02:37:52.590
thousands or ten thousands of user right so user experience

02:37:52.590 --> 02:37:55.470
literally matters and at the end of the day actually lose

02:37:55.470 --> 02:37:57.610
the difference matters. Maybe your one of two feature is not

02:37:57.610 --> 02:38:00.370
working in a back-end. That's cool. That's fine. But if your

02:38:00.370 --> 02:38:02.950
user experience is good, believe me, you will be able to get

02:38:02.950 --> 02:38:05.170
more money. You will be able to sell it with a higher price,

02:38:05.330 --> 02:38:08.970
right? So for any client you are developing it. I'd never

02:38:08.970 --> 02:38:11.010
suggest anyone to like go and say it because your client

02:38:11.010 --> 02:38:12.890
will be blank, right? Your client is not technical. That's

02:38:12.890 --> 02:38:15.230
the reason they're coming to you, right? And you should

02:38:15.230 --> 02:38:17.190
never suggest like something which is outdated and something

02:38:17.190 --> 02:38:20.330
which is not going to, you know, yield them better result or

02:38:20.330 --> 02:38:22.890
better outcome in terms of money because see this is your

02:38:22.890 --> 02:38:26.650
like a again job to make sure that they are getting the best

02:38:26.650 --> 02:38:32.010
like value out of it. So value wise like signee are is worse

02:38:32.010 --> 02:38:34.930
even streamlit is good. Somehow better than signee. I would

02:38:34.930 --> 02:38:38.330
say much better than signee. I would say right. Gradu is

02:38:38.330 --> 02:38:41.490
again worst in terms of like a python UI and I never even

02:38:41.490 --> 02:38:43.610
suggest that to use it in a production. I just say there's a

02:38:43.610 --> 02:38:47.510
go ahead and use in react react on next. Okay, understood.

02:38:47.670 --> 02:38:52.090
Got it. Okay. So yeah, we'll do that then. Yeah. Yeah.

02:38:52.210 --> 02:38:55.670
That's all. Yeah. Thank you. Rajini, go ahead with your

02:38:55.670 --> 02:39:01.030
question, please. Yeah. Rajini then Santosh can go to the

02:39:01.030 --> 02:39:04.530
question then once can go with the question. Then Kasi can

02:39:04.530 --> 02:39:07.390
go it. Yeah, anyone can go to the question. Yeah, I'm okay.

02:39:07.510 --> 02:39:10.290
I'll take it. Yeah, go ahead. Please. Yeah, go ahead.

02:39:10.310 --> 02:39:16.780
Please. Hi, sir. Good evening. Yeah. I am and today is my

02:39:16.780 --> 02:39:21.080
first class. Okay, so you have not joined the last one. No,

02:39:21.140 --> 02:39:23.920
sir. This is my first class today. Only I have signed in.

02:39:24.180 --> 02:39:28.240
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, fine. So basically I have some

02:39:28.240 --> 02:39:32.420
knowledge of the generative. So this is the lecture that you

02:39:32.420 --> 02:39:35.580
today taught me was very informative, but some of the

02:39:35.580 --> 02:39:38.960
concepts were very high level to me. So actually I was

02:39:38.960 --> 02:39:41.180
actually I was talking about high level. I have not even

02:39:41.180 --> 02:39:43.620
discussed low level here. Low level. I should discuss in my

02:39:43.620 --> 02:39:47.280
practical lectures. Yeah. So that's what I'm asking. Like

02:39:47.280 --> 02:39:50.460
should I first go and watch the previous generative

02:39:50.460 --> 02:39:54.440
elections and then come to see once this this is basically

02:39:54.440 --> 02:39:57.120
this is a batch for a interview preparation, right? So

02:39:57.120 --> 02:40:00.600
obviously I'll talk about high level. I'll not go in a low

02:40:00.600 --> 02:40:03.940
level or in very low level, right? But yeah, if you are

02:40:03.940 --> 02:40:06.040
expecting something. Like that, then come to my Saturday,

02:40:06.080 --> 02:40:08.820
Sunday class, right? Our generative certification boot camp

02:40:08.820 --> 02:40:12.300
because over there I literally go on a very very low level

02:40:12.300 --> 02:40:15.300
literally without like even expecting anything from you that

02:40:15.300 --> 02:40:19.280
like you should know this or that every batch moto is

02:40:19.280 --> 02:40:22.760
different, right? So this batch is to prepare you for an

02:40:22.760 --> 02:40:25.280
interview, which is a last stage, obviously. So I'm assuming

02:40:25.280 --> 02:40:27.980
that you must be aware about little bit of things and if

02:40:27.980 --> 02:40:29.460
you're not aware about something then you will go and

02:40:29.460 --> 02:40:32.160
explore, right? For example, maybe like you said you are not

02:40:32.160 --> 02:40:33.920
able to understand couple of things over here. Maybe some

02:40:33.920 --> 02:40:36.400
words which I have written and maybe you are not able to

02:40:36.400 --> 02:40:38.240
understand that that's cool. That's okay completely fine,

02:40:38.380 --> 02:40:42.220
right? That was expected by the way from this batch at least

02:40:42.220 --> 02:40:45.520
so you will go and search but if you have expectation that

02:40:45.520 --> 02:40:48.520
no I should like learn everything from the very scratch then

02:40:48.520 --> 02:40:51.300
yeah, you are welcome to my certification boot camp

02:40:51.300 --> 02:40:53.300
generative certification boot camp, which is already also

02:40:53.300 --> 02:40:56.760
running in a parallel. Yes, sir. I know on Saturday, Sunday.

02:40:57.120 --> 02:41:00.600
Yeah, Saturday, Sunday busy 9 a.m. IST. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

02:41:00.660 --> 02:41:05.960
You know, yesterday I had a class. For that. Okay, just a

02:41:05.960 --> 02:41:08.840
small doubt. You explained something about re-ranking. So

02:41:08.840 --> 02:41:12.180
can you explain what is it? So in a layman way if I'll talk

02:41:12.180 --> 02:41:14.380
about the re-ranking so see let's suppose I'm trying to do a

02:41:14.380 --> 02:41:17.220
top care retrieval, right? So top care retrieval based on

02:41:17.220 --> 02:41:19.720
the distances. It is trying to tell me that's cool. That's

02:41:19.720 --> 02:41:23.440
completely fine. But I should sometime not just focus on the

02:41:23.440 --> 02:41:25.720
distances. So I should also focus on the context with

02:41:25.720 --> 02:41:29.340
respect the question, right? Yes. In that case. Generally,

02:41:29.380 --> 02:41:33.600
we try to use another layer of the LLM again, it's a LLM. So

02:41:33.600 --> 02:41:36.460
suppose if I'm saying Cohera I'm going to use or like any

02:41:36.460 --> 02:41:38.860
other re-ranker from a hugging face if I'm going to use so

02:41:38.860 --> 02:41:41.780
it's a LLM. But yeah, so it is based on the context. It is

02:41:41.780 --> 02:41:44.500
going to rearrange the entire output. Once again, that's

02:41:44.500 --> 02:41:48.480
called as re-ranking. Okay. So based on the context of kind

02:41:48.480 --> 02:41:52.020
of reshuffling from the Reshuffling exactly. Yeah. Yeah,

02:41:52.080 --> 02:41:54.960
reshuffling. Arranging the same output in our like a

02:41:54.960 --> 02:41:59.700
different order. Okay. Okay, sir. Thank you. Yeah, thanks.

02:41:59.780 --> 02:42:02.680
Any other question guys? Go ahead all I'm open for all the

02:42:02.680 --> 02:42:05.400
questions. Yeah, I have a question. So then so yes on those

02:42:05.400 --> 02:42:08.000
please. Go ahead. Yeah. Thank you so much for social

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:11.680
recently. I mean, I had an opportunity to give an interview

02:42:11.680 --> 02:42:14.860
for a MNC. And as of now, I'm working in a startup since

02:42:14.860 --> 02:42:17.820
past three and a half years. I got an opportunity on January

02:42:17.820 --> 02:42:20.160
applied for it was a manager role. I have an extensive

02:42:20.160 --> 02:42:24.420
experience of 17 years. So I applied for that one. Then I

02:42:24.420 --> 02:42:28.740
wanted to highlight the gaps. So you mean they even though

02:42:28.740 --> 02:42:31.140
lot of implementation of practical implementation we did

02:42:31.140 --> 02:42:34.200
obviously we won't be able to cover all the aspects of

02:42:34.200 --> 02:42:37.500
generative AI, but it appeared like that. The industry is

02:42:37.500 --> 02:42:41.440
not interested. They were only asking the checkpoints. And

02:42:41.440 --> 02:42:43.920
the good thing is that when I came to us continue the course

02:42:43.920 --> 02:42:46.640
all the checkpoints were covered at your course energy. I

02:42:46.640 --> 02:42:49.100
mean, it was literally like picked up from whatever topic

02:42:49.100 --> 02:42:51.860
you're saying. I wanted to understand that. Is it like I

02:42:51.860 --> 02:42:54.420
know that I'm in the right path, but I'm glad for that. I

02:42:54.420 --> 02:42:56.360
joined the class as well and you helped me previously as

02:42:56.360 --> 02:42:58.300
well. Long time back. I had a consideration with you as

02:42:58.300 --> 02:43:01.200
well. This is good news. Is it like a general thing which is

02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:03.260
happening in the industry? Have you come across such an

02:43:03.260 --> 02:43:06.840
instance? Yeah. See, it's actually general thing. I would

02:43:06.840 --> 02:43:10.780
say and sometime like even we have observed that your

02:43:10.780 --> 02:43:14.400
interviewer and interview is from like a you on itself and

02:43:14.400 --> 02:43:17.400
it happens very frequently. Believe me, it happens very

02:43:17.400 --> 02:43:19.740
frequently. Even it happened a lot even in my previous

02:43:19.740 --> 02:43:22.540
organization. So when I was like founded iron, right? So in

02:43:22.540 --> 02:43:24.460
that company it happened a lot and even you don't it has

02:43:24.460 --> 02:43:26.780
started happening, although it's been like eight to ten

02:43:26.780 --> 02:43:29.840
months only, right? So we have a number of a student so far.

02:43:30.820 --> 02:43:35.040
I have started getting that kind of a news. So you will get

02:43:35.040 --> 02:43:37.300
more and more news. So where let's suppose you are going to

02:43:37.300 --> 02:43:39.000
join the company. Obviously, you are going to do someone

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:42.580
right as a manager and there is a very high possibility that

02:43:42.580 --> 02:43:47.420
you will be black from your own, right? It's a very common

02:43:47.420 --> 02:43:49.660
trend and basically both are coming from the same DNA.

02:43:49.820 --> 02:43:51.760
Right, right, right. Obviously, they will ask the similar

02:43:51.760 --> 02:43:53.800
kind of a question because they will be having somewhere

02:43:53.800 --> 02:43:56.400
like similar kind of a thought process. Right, right, right.

02:43:56.620 --> 02:44:01.220
Yeah. So miserly in MNCs and startup, you will find this

02:44:01.220 --> 02:44:05.100
this one more frequently in a product. So there are very few

02:44:05.100 --> 02:44:09.160
people from our side. I'm like trying hard, you know, to get

02:44:09.160 --> 02:44:11.000
that kind of a student who can crack up product based

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:14.380
companies because that does not depends on me, right?

02:44:14.440 --> 02:44:18.320
Depends on the students. Ultimately, students, you are the

02:44:18.320 --> 02:44:22.480
one who will go and give an interview. Yeah, yeah. So maybe

02:44:22.480 --> 02:44:24.740
because of affordability, they don't even join. They go and

02:44:24.740 --> 02:44:29.940
pay two lakh rupees. They think that with 5000 rupees, I'll

02:44:29.940 --> 02:44:33.520
maybe not get enough. So that's a mindset. Right. This is

02:44:33.520 --> 02:44:36.380
what people think. I mean, there are quite a few friends

02:44:36.380 --> 02:44:39.380
which I have posed for your courses even now and even before

02:44:39.380 --> 02:44:42.220
as well, they were obviously tempted towards going for a

02:44:42.220 --> 02:44:44.460
lakh rupees or two lakh rupees course where they promised so

02:44:44.460 --> 02:44:47.540
many things. But it wouldn't happen. They think that they

02:44:47.540 --> 02:44:50.440
will get more. But technically, the thing is that at the end

02:44:50.440 --> 02:44:53.800
of the day, it depends upon the mentor. Right. Course is all

02:44:53.800 --> 02:44:56.760
about mentor who is who is like a teaching. Right. So this

02:44:56.760 --> 02:45:00.000
is because it's not we are selling the course. It's like

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:03.440
always we are selling the mentors. It's a human. We are

02:45:03.440 --> 02:45:08.700
renting it. So, yeah, I think just to answer your question.

02:45:08.820 --> 02:45:12.380
Yeah, it's pretty much common that I think. Thank you. Thank

02:45:12.380 --> 02:45:14.220
you so much for the insight. OK, I'll wait for it. Thanks.

02:45:14.400 --> 02:45:18.560
Thanks. Yeah. Thank you. Take care. OK, the question is for

02:45:18.560 --> 02:45:23.340
me. Yeah, I got it. Good. Good. OK, you are here, sir. OK, I

02:45:23.340 --> 02:45:26.220
think you're going to a different system. Then I can see

02:45:26.220 --> 02:45:31.400
like different name. Was there really. Yeah, I mean, you've

02:45:31.400 --> 02:45:37.740
been 25. So I don't know. I can. That's my machine. OK, OK,

02:45:37.800 --> 02:45:42.120
OK. Yeah, the question today is very interesting lecture

02:45:42.120 --> 02:45:47.740
today. OK, and it provides a very good summary. OK, OK. So

02:45:47.740 --> 02:45:53.540
it summarizes as an architect. What are all the things that

02:45:53.540 --> 02:45:57.260
supposed to be doing? Now I have done almost almost

02:45:57.260 --> 02:46:02.900
everything in a piecemeal. OK. OK, but this provides very

02:46:02.900 --> 02:46:06.620
good summary. Now, I have got a few questions regarding you

02:46:06.620 --> 02:46:10.400
were talking about streamlit, streamlit is for a demo

02:46:10.400 --> 02:46:15.460
purpose. Yeah, prototyping and for real professional. We

02:46:15.460 --> 02:46:20.800
need to react and react to anything. Any JS based like a

02:46:20.800 --> 02:46:24.800
modern UI framework. Yeah, yeah. Actually, I was a full

02:46:24.800 --> 02:46:30.540
stack architect for my previous SIGNA healthcare project and

02:46:30.540 --> 02:46:36.240
we use this react and node.js there. So I designed the whole

02:46:36.240 --> 02:46:39.720
of this frontend that how they are. It should be visualized

02:46:39.720 --> 02:46:45.960
by the clients. Now, see, you said react and next.js. But

02:46:45.960 --> 02:46:50.720
where does this node.js stand? Node.js is actually for back

02:46:50.720 --> 02:46:53.000
end. So, for example, here we are using Python, right? For

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.900
writing a back end for APIs and deployment because there

02:46:55.900 --> 02:46:57.780
will be back end layer. There will be front end layer. So

02:46:57.780 --> 02:47:02.160
node.js, node is for back end actually. Node.js is for back

02:47:02.160 --> 02:47:04.380
end, right? Yeah. So it will be alternative of the Python.

02:47:04.580 --> 02:47:08.300
You're using Python over here. So you can use node for that.

02:47:10.200 --> 02:47:14.260
And then what is node.js? That is a framework. Basically, JS

02:47:14.260 --> 02:47:17.300
is nothing but JavaScript, plain JavaScript. So next.js,

02:47:17.440 --> 02:47:19.840
node.js, typescript.js, all these things are basically

02:47:19.840 --> 02:47:22.340
written in a programming language called as JavaScript.

02:47:22.560 --> 02:47:25.180
JavaScript is a programming language, right? Not Java,

02:47:25.280 --> 02:47:28.000
JavaScript, by the way. So all of this. The JavaScript-based

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:31.680
framework will come with the extension of .js. But again,

02:47:31.740 --> 02:47:34.120
inside that, we have a multiple framework. For example, if

02:47:34.120 --> 02:47:36.760
I'm using a typescript, if I'm using a next.js, if I'm using

02:47:36.760 --> 02:47:39.940
a react.js or maybe if I'm using a react-native, all these

02:47:39.940 --> 02:47:42.860
things have been used for a web or mobile interface, UI

02:47:42.860 --> 02:47:46.920
creation, right? And every web or mobile will require a back

02:47:46.920 --> 02:47:49.720
end, basically, which will interact with the server, which

02:47:49.720 --> 02:47:52.120
will try to execute the actual function. Right? Actual

02:47:52.120 --> 02:47:54.380
function. For example, in this case, it will go to the

02:47:54.380 --> 02:47:56.880
database, try to extract the vector, try to extract the

02:47:56.880 --> 02:47:58.840
chunk, and then it will send to the LLM. So all these things

02:47:58.840 --> 02:48:00.760
will be done in a back end, right? Not on a UI interface.

02:48:01.080 --> 02:48:03.940
Everything will happen on the server. So over there, we can

02:48:03.940 --> 02:48:07.840
try to use our node.js kind of things. If I'm like writing

02:48:07.840 --> 02:48:12.000
everything into a .js, right? Otherwise, so my choice will

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.800
be if I'm a data scientist or data engineer. So in that

02:48:14.800 --> 02:48:17.440
case, my choice will be Java or maybe Python. So here in

02:48:17.440 --> 02:48:21.280
this one, Python. So node.js is technically an alternative

02:48:21.280 --> 02:48:26.880
of Python. Okay. If you are going out with JS stack only.

02:48:30.180 --> 02:48:33.900
Anil is asking, any UI frontend courses we have in Euron?

02:48:33.980 --> 02:48:37.040
Yeah, we do have. So I don't know whether you have seen that

02:48:37.040 --> 02:48:40.760
or not. So many people were asking me for that. So one

02:48:40.760 --> 02:48:45.480
course is going to start this month itself by Ajay. So Ajay

02:48:45.480 --> 02:48:47.980
is a very good mentor. And he's again like a working mentor,

02:48:48.060 --> 02:48:50.960
by the way, not just a mentor. He is developing things. So

02:48:50.960 --> 02:48:53.300
this full stack development is going to come. So over there,

02:48:53.320 --> 02:48:56.140
you will be able to find out all this JS, node.js, next.js,

02:48:56.260 --> 02:48:58.720
everything. So this one's complete morn, right? Complete

02:48:58.720 --> 02:49:01.820
morn we are trying to cover back and frontend both. So those

02:49:01.820 --> 02:49:04.420
who would like to learn, come to this class. He's a very

02:49:04.420 --> 02:49:07.040
good mentor, right? And anyone, any of your friends and

02:49:07.040 --> 02:49:09.420
family, if they would like to learn. So maybe they can come

02:49:09.420 --> 02:49:12.640
over here and he will like teach you everything in a step by

02:49:12.640 --> 02:49:15.480
step manner. It's going to start from 20th September. It's a

02:49:15.480 --> 02:49:17.940
weekend batch, by the way. Yeah, Saturday, Sunday. And like

02:49:17.940 --> 02:49:20.600
I used to do a doubt clearing, even he will do a doubt

02:49:20.600 --> 02:49:23.060
clearing and same manner. Same manner he will take the

02:49:23.060 --> 02:49:25.840
classes. So, yes, sir, you are saying something. Yeah, I

02:49:25.840 --> 02:49:29.400
think I'm able to answer your question, but I have. I'm not

02:49:29.400 --> 02:49:34.620
done yet. Okay. Yeah. No, no, please go ahead. Yes. So there

02:49:34.620 --> 02:49:37.740
is another piece with this is tailwind. Is that for CSS?

02:49:39.320 --> 02:49:42.000
Tailwind for CSS, basically. So CSS is nothing but kind of a

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:46.520
colorful cloth. Yeah. Okay. Colorful cloth on top of your

02:49:46.520 --> 02:49:52.320
website. Okay. So suppose if I have to convert my streamlet

02:49:52.320 --> 02:49:59.180
into this reaction. And node.js or max.js along with

02:49:59.180 --> 02:50:04.820
tailwind. So how much is involved in that? The thing is that

02:50:04.820 --> 02:50:07.440
everything starts from the scratch because both are

02:50:07.440 --> 02:50:09.640
different things. Now, if you have a small application and

02:50:09.640 --> 02:50:11.680
if you have to convert something into the equivalent one,

02:50:11.800 --> 02:50:14.900
just do the vibe coding, just upload your stream into like

02:50:14.900 --> 02:50:18.220
app and then use cursor and then say that, okay, convert

02:50:18.220 --> 02:50:22.860
this entire things by using more. Okay. I think that's a

02:50:22.860 --> 02:50:25.400
good idea. I can start from somewhere. That will be done in

02:50:25.400 --> 02:50:27.520
half an hour. So that will be done in half an hour. Let not

02:50:27.520 --> 02:50:31.440
more than like 30 minutes of time. Oh, good. Good. Yeah. I

02:50:31.440 --> 02:50:34.000
have another question. Remember, we were talking about

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:38.660
vision language models. Which one? Which one? Vision

02:50:38.660 --> 02:50:41.960
language model. Remember? Yeah. Vision or multimodal. You

02:50:41.960 --> 02:50:45.840
can say. Yeah. Or maybe a language model. Yes. Yeah. So have

02:50:45.840 --> 02:50:49.500
you been able to prepare something on that? No, sir. I used

02:50:49.500 --> 02:50:52.100
to forget a lot. Like I have so many other works as well.

02:50:52.140 --> 02:50:54.880
Right. So whatever is. Because first of all, I have to

02:50:54.880 --> 02:50:56.760
provide the courses. If I'm not providing something in

02:50:56.760 --> 02:51:00.260
courses, then people will start complaining me. Because you

02:51:00.260 --> 02:51:04.500
said that you'll do that. And and I reminded you last time.

02:51:04.600 --> 02:51:08.740
But no, I'll do it once. I'll get the time. Right. So yeah,

02:51:08.820 --> 02:51:09.780
I'll do it.

02:51:13.040 --> 02:51:17.100
Now, can you do me a favor? If you have to search a cloud,

02:51:17.440 --> 02:51:20.940
can you Google it? Because I don't have anybody. I don't

02:51:20.940 --> 02:51:24.060
want to Google my place. My computer. You see a cloud,

02:51:24.260 --> 02:51:30.600
right? Yes. 80. P-L-O-U-D. 80. It's the same though. .co by

02:51:30.600 --> 02:51:35.560
the way. But so at all. But but it is not going by site in.

02:51:35.740 --> 02:51:40.320
My city of the loudest one was it's not able to run by the

02:51:40.320 --> 02:51:45.660
way. So that's not about today. And then I could provide me

02:51:45.660 --> 02:51:49.100
the source from your team. And you said that you will

02:51:49.100 --> 02:51:53.020
provide it. I'll just check with my team availability. so

02:51:53.020 --> 02:51:57.280
once they will be available i'll do it yeah okay yeah yeah

02:51:57.280 --> 02:52:00.120
thank you very much okay so thank you so much yeah thanks

02:52:00.120 --> 02:52:08.620
yeah go ahead please next one yeah go ahead please um one

02:52:08.620 --> 02:52:14.660
more framework by the way not himanshu himanshu is my

02:52:14.660 --> 02:52:16.080
maternal brother's name by the way

02:52:21.460 --> 02:52:28.200
one of my manager is uh himanshu that's why he's oh but yeah

02:52:28.200 --> 02:52:30.520
your mentor name is nanshu it's i think it's clearly visible

02:52:30.520 --> 02:52:36.960
even on zoom okay yeah please go to the question yeah yes uh

02:52:36.960 --> 02:52:41.300
there's a react and there's angular right so uh can you give

02:52:41.300 --> 02:52:44.940
me a bit more light which one should we use angular is quite

02:52:44.940 --> 02:52:46.060
old people i mean it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's

02:52:46.060 --> 02:52:46.920
it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's not against angular

02:52:46.920 --> 02:52:49.780
people are using it but yeah react is like having more

02:52:49.780 --> 02:52:53.000
flexibility modern framework updated one and more developer

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.540
friendly but you can go ahead with angular react anything

02:52:55.540 --> 02:52:59.460
your wish you will be able to build all these things easily

02:52:59.460 --> 02:53:03.540
okay so in any uh i mean performance or any other

02:53:03.540 --> 02:53:07.480
differences in this too in terms of ease of development i

02:53:07.480 --> 02:53:11.140
would say react is more easy angular will be better tough

02:53:11.140 --> 02:53:14.920
but again it depends upon the you know contribution coming

02:53:14.920 --> 02:53:18.180
from the open source community uh i think react is getting

02:53:18.180 --> 02:53:21.780
more contribution as of now uh but yeah you can choose any

02:53:21.780 --> 02:53:24.980
of these you will be able to develop it and again with the

02:53:24.980 --> 02:53:28.980
help of ai so it's now easy very very easy okay so uh second

02:53:28.980 --> 02:53:32.580
question is so we are having some uh so many vector dv right

02:53:32.580 --> 02:53:37.880
so uh which one to choose uh so many so many vector dv yeah

02:53:37.880 --> 02:53:41.880
yeah yeah yeah so which one to choose and and also if we

02:53:41.880 --> 02:53:51.160
include the um um graph dv so um then which one is better to

02:53:51.160 --> 02:53:55.920
choose based on the performance is graph wise my first and

02:53:55.920 --> 02:53:59.520
last choice will be neo4j all the time it's one of the best

02:53:59.520 --> 02:54:01.940
in the market in terms of even cost service and like

02:54:01.940 --> 02:54:04.960
flexibility latency everything everything and scaling so

02:54:04.960 --> 02:54:08.080
neo4j will be my first choice in terms of only graph dv if

02:54:08.080 --> 02:54:10.980
it is required in my project now if i'll talk about a vector

02:54:10.980 --> 02:54:13.940
dv and which one i should choose so my first category will

02:54:13.940 --> 02:54:16.040
be so are we going ahead with the like a vector dv data kind

02:54:16.040 --> 02:54:16.840
of thing so i'll talk about that in detail a self-hosting or

02:54:16.840 --> 02:54:20.240
are we going with a managed hosting right so that will be my

02:54:20.240 --> 02:54:22.820
first like criteria to select if i'm going out with the self

02:54:22.820 --> 02:54:25.780
-hosting maybe i can go out with the like a chroma db or

02:54:25.780 --> 02:54:28.680
maybe a facebook assimilation search that's that's my like a

02:54:28.680 --> 02:54:35.220
very first things to like you know do basically right and if

02:54:35.220 --> 02:54:37.700
i'm going ahead with the managed hosting then in that case i

02:54:37.700 --> 02:54:40.760
have like a pinecone i have a waviot i have a quadrant i

02:54:40.760 --> 02:54:44.160
have even mongodb now right and many people are using it

02:54:44.160 --> 02:54:47.300
even i have been using it in my company the current one by

02:54:47.300 --> 02:54:51.880
the way right so this is how i can select so which which one

02:54:51.880 --> 02:54:55.320
i'm looking for so self-hosting or maybe a managed one okay

02:54:55.320 --> 02:55:00.460
okay so so and and the third one is uh uh there are aws

02:55:00.460 --> 02:55:03.880
azure and the gcp right so based on which i will choose

02:55:03.880 --> 02:55:09.080
which cloud oh it's based on the industry so majorly you

02:55:09.080 --> 02:55:11.200
will not be having multiple options because if you are a big

02:55:11.200 --> 02:55:13.780
company by default you will be having tie up with some cloud

02:55:13.780 --> 02:55:16.480
provider and that is that will not be under your control

02:55:16.480 --> 02:55:19.840
basically your manager director and you know the tie-up team

02:55:19.840 --> 02:55:21.940
like they used to control those things if you have a big

02:55:21.940 --> 02:55:25.120
company if you are the small company so again if you are the

02:55:25.120 --> 02:55:28.520
startup in general startup always prefer to go with the aws

02:55:28.520 --> 02:55:32.100
okay the reason is very simple once again because it's easy

02:55:32.100 --> 02:55:35.180
to get a people who understand aws right there are so many

02:55:35.180 --> 02:55:38.180
people basically who understand aws so easy to get it plus

02:55:38.180 --> 02:55:41.200
their services are pretty much flexible it was is the best

02:55:41.200 --> 02:55:45.500
the most of the market belongs to a cloud market uh but yeah

02:55:45.500 --> 02:55:48.040
if you are part of mncs or if you are part of product based

02:55:48.040 --> 02:55:50.940
companies you don't decide your actual management decide

02:55:50.940 --> 02:55:54.160
your cxo layers decide basically okay okay and if they have

02:55:54.160 --> 02:55:57.280
already chosen azure uh as a partner you can't do anything

02:55:57.280 --> 02:56:01.460
like you have to go out with azure okay so if i have the

02:56:01.460 --> 02:56:05.080
chances to uh select initially right so uh for the customer

02:56:05.080 --> 02:56:08.840
uh my suggestion is aws you will be able to get like a you

02:56:08.840 --> 02:56:14.320
know people basically see users wise i will say uh users and

02:56:14.320 --> 02:56:17.820
service wise uh no one is less no one is more you will be

02:56:17.820 --> 02:56:21.000
able to get all the services everywhere in aws in azure in

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:24.040
jcp right so you will be able to get all the services

02:56:24.040 --> 02:56:27.840
literally all the services that you are looking for so like

02:56:27.840 --> 02:56:30.120
there is no question that okay fine i'll get something here

02:56:30.120 --> 02:56:34.220
and something not here uh so like then you will face another

02:56:34.220 --> 02:56:37.400
problem that how to use it so who is going to use it so

02:56:37.400 --> 02:56:39.960
people problem basically and in terms of people so you

02:56:43.460 --> 02:56:47.020
are there but yeah compared to it a little less so so um uh

02:56:47.020 --> 02:56:51.620
currently opening eye is uh supported by uh aws and now

02:56:51.620 --> 02:56:57.680
azure right azure actually yes yes yeah okay uh is that a

02:56:57.680 --> 02:57:01.420
criteria for me to select aws if i'm going to use the open

02:57:01.420 --> 02:57:05.860
ai uh no not like that because they will not they they

02:57:05.860 --> 02:57:07.600
completely understand that if you know one cloud platform

02:57:07.600 --> 02:57:11.560
you know all basically so if you know like one single one

02:57:11.560 --> 02:57:14.800
maybe at your aws gcp seem simply means that you know all

02:57:14.800 --> 02:57:19.680
the cloud platform okay but thank you yeah yeah thanks okay

02:57:19.680 --> 02:57:23.660
next question please uh hello sir question yeah yeah cause

02:57:23.660 --> 02:57:26.580
you go ahead please uh thank you first of all so much for

02:57:26.580 --> 02:57:29.920
this because i could totally relate with this uh uh project

02:57:29.920 --> 02:57:34.180
since i have been working a similar kind of uh project which

02:57:34.180 --> 02:57:37.840
was initiated with by my ceo last year around november okay

02:57:37.840 --> 02:57:41.100
okay and how long how long it went for actually so it's

02:57:41.100 --> 02:57:45.140
still going on sorry enhancement or i don't think that like

02:57:45.140 --> 02:57:49.180
it's a grounder from scratch so my question was we built

02:57:49.180 --> 02:57:52.220
from scratch there were other stakeholders directors who

02:57:52.220 --> 02:57:55.880
were like outsourced or something like that okay and for a

02:57:55.880 --> 02:58:00.500
back burner for some time but meanwhile i build a poc uh

02:58:00.500 --> 02:58:04.500
small poc but similar kind of thing like uh one was like the

02:58:04.500 --> 02:58:07.340
access control with the different project admin project

02:58:07.340 --> 02:58:11.980
department kind of thing and the other layer was uh not not

02:58:11.980 --> 02:58:16.140
with the connectors but at the basically uh two kinds of uh

02:58:16.140 --> 02:58:23.160
four kind of uh documents uh pdf txt excellent csv so two

02:58:23.160 --> 02:58:27.580
unstructured and two structured kind of uh thing and then i

02:58:27.580 --> 02:58:31.780
built a poc uh produced it also but again there are some

02:58:31.780 --> 02:58:35.820
discussion this might again trigger this year maybe so uh

02:58:35.820 --> 02:58:42.060
i'm still working on the poc uh basically a couple of

02:58:42.060 --> 02:58:46.980
questions that i have is while building this uh the the poc

02:58:46.980 --> 02:58:49.760
like let's suppose since they were there are multiple

02:58:49.760 --> 02:58:53.520
departments there might be uh legal structured documents

02:58:53.520 --> 02:58:57.280
research unstructured documents or marketing unstructured

02:58:57.280 --> 02:59:00.260
documents but there is some or people in the organization

02:59:00.260 --> 02:59:03.560
let's suppose the ceo or higher up in the hierarchy who

02:59:03.560 --> 02:59:10.020
might want to see uh like the vectorized data for different

02:59:10.020 --> 02:59:13.440
uh clusters like not these won't be let's suppose for a

02:59:13.460 --> 02:59:17.060
marketing i can maintain a single cluster for all the

02:59:17.060 --> 02:59:21.700
marketing documents but for someone like a ceo i have to

02:59:21.700 --> 02:59:26.000
kind of club these things so the problem uh the problem that

02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:29.820
i was trying to uh what i was facing but then i figured it

02:59:29.820 --> 02:59:34.660
out was uh conflicting facts in different documents then uh

02:59:34.660 --> 02:59:39.180
i figured that out actually nothing much i had to do but my

02:59:39.180 --> 02:59:44.420
problem was in terms of the frequency of um setting up the

02:59:44.420 --> 02:59:48.760
pipeline so that the cost can be optimized in uh in that so

02:59:48.760 --> 02:59:52.840
uh as i i would probably come with a more pinpointed

02:59:52.840 --> 02:59:57.880
question in this and how to uh probably uh you know optimize

02:59:57.880 --> 03:00:01.780
with airflow i actually wanted to airflow with the current

03:00:01.780 --> 03:00:05.060
pipeline i have used there is no effort like simple python

03:00:05.060 --> 03:00:08.860
etl only i have used so that there i was facing a problem

03:00:08.860 --> 03:00:12.380
the other problem that i was facing and not facing but i am

03:00:12.380 --> 03:00:16.700
like like i have this question from the starting like since

03:00:16.700 --> 03:00:21.060
data for example relational or csv or mysql kind of data

03:00:21.060 --> 03:00:26.000
can't be put in the rag we have to probably build some as

03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:29.960
far as my understanding i think uh in either there are two

03:00:29.960 --> 03:00:33.960
ways to handle it either in the structured data we might

03:00:33.960 --> 03:00:39.660
have to include columns in which we probably define those

03:00:39.660 --> 03:00:43.800
columns what they are or probably through the in the

03:00:43.800 --> 03:00:47.360
question or at the in the metadata we might have to handle

03:00:47.360 --> 03:00:53.540
what those tables and each of these uh columns uh means so

03:00:53.540 --> 03:00:56.660
those are the two ways or there are other ways also in which

03:00:56.660 --> 03:00:59.820
how do we uh my question in summary is how do we vectorize a

03:00:59.820 --> 03:01:04.280
structured uh data like relational database like nowadays

03:01:04.280 --> 03:01:07.340
even vectorization wise if i'll talk about so many like uh

03:01:07.340 --> 03:01:11.680
you know vendors have started providing the vector component

03:01:11.680 --> 03:01:15.680
of your structured data that is a part number one uh part

03:01:15.680 --> 03:01:18.620
number two is the way you are vectorizing your unstructured

03:01:18.620 --> 03:01:21.080
data in the similar manner you can go ahead and next uh like

03:01:21.080 --> 03:01:25.600
you know vectorize it possible right uh third approach is

03:01:25.600 --> 03:01:29.740
that that i will not even vectorize it now maybe not not i

03:01:29.740 --> 03:01:32.640
will not even try to vectorize it maybe as a dense vector

03:01:32.640 --> 03:01:36.440
right i'll go ahead with a sparse approach basically and

03:01:36.440 --> 03:01:38.740
then because it's already a structured data so basically i

03:01:38.740 --> 03:01:41.380
can try to do a keyword mapping and then so that is my third

03:01:41.380 --> 03:01:45.300
approach the fourth approach is uh maybe i'll try to use uh

03:01:45.300 --> 03:01:49.460
something like a open search uh like to do a matching and

03:01:49.460 --> 03:01:52.260
searching right so these are the multiple ways i can try to

03:01:52.260 --> 03:01:56.300
use for a structured data but yeah i can even go ahead with

03:01:56.300 --> 03:01:59.220
the unstructured way that's completely fine so i'll try to

03:01:59.220 --> 03:02:01.580
explore what you said the way that i have used is basically

03:02:01.580 --> 03:02:06.600
uh fixing the prompt or like like when i'm chatting with the

03:02:06.600 --> 03:02:12.080
unstructured data i'm also enabling uh another window text

03:02:12.080 --> 03:02:16.740
window in which uh details of that table can be given by the

03:02:16.740 --> 03:02:19.520
user but that's not this is what i have discussed i think in

03:02:19.520 --> 03:02:22.540
my last like yesterday's uh yesterday i think there was same

03:02:22.540 --> 03:02:25.620
similar kind of a question from someone and i have shown

03:02:25.620 --> 03:02:27.580
them applications i have already discussed one application

03:02:27.580 --> 03:02:30.280
in my previous slide badges so where uh you are

03:02:30.280 --> 03:02:33.040
communicating with your sql system right but with the llms

03:02:33.040 --> 03:02:35.200
with the natural language processing so with the help of

03:02:35.200 --> 03:02:37.560
llms you are communicating so let's suppose if i have to

03:02:37.560 --> 03:02:40.600
retrieve something from a structured table and i don't want

03:02:40.600 --> 03:02:43.320
to write a sql query see there are two aspects of it right

03:02:43.320 --> 03:02:48.320
one where like you have to write a sql query and you have to

03:02:48.320 --> 03:02:51.000
extract the data now that is something of filtration right

03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:54.820
now when we are talking about a rag kind of a system so we

03:02:54.820 --> 03:02:59.380
are not worried about a filtration mostly we are worried

03:02:59.380 --> 03:03:04.160
about the uh basically i can say a matching matching of a

03:03:04.160 --> 03:03:08.040
data with respect to the query but again the other aspect is

03:03:08.040 --> 03:03:11.400
if you are talking about a sql system uh and if i'm using a

03:03:11.400 --> 03:03:15.180
llm so anyhow it is going to take my query it is going to

03:03:15.180 --> 03:03:19.440
convert my query to the equivalent sql query right and then

03:03:19.440 --> 03:03:21.820
eventually it will be able to retrieve the data so it is as

03:03:21.820 --> 03:03:26.060
good as like uh you know without keeping any structured data

03:03:26.060 --> 03:03:28.700
into a vector i can directly like uh write this application

03:03:28.700 --> 03:03:32.300
and that application i've already discussed sure so then

03:03:32.300 --> 03:03:36.060
i'll look into the playlist yeah so i have a last question

03:03:36.060 --> 03:03:41.280
um that came up last year was basically so uh in an

03:03:41.280 --> 03:03:44.100
organization we are using apache superset as a bi tool okay

03:03:44.100 --> 03:03:48.060
what uh the other expectation that came up was can we have

03:03:48.060 --> 03:03:50.960
some kind of a chat app which can chat directly with the bi

03:03:50.960 --> 03:03:56.140
tool so that is so i was actually going through the superset

03:03:56.140 --> 03:04:00.240
documentation like their proper documentation uh they are

03:04:00.240 --> 03:04:05.180
still building on like building on that that uh feature in

03:04:05.180 --> 03:04:09.760
in their new build but it's not ready so but for tableau and

03:04:09.760 --> 03:04:11.660
for power bi they have already released it they have already

03:04:11.660 --> 03:04:14.720
yep i think power bi already have power bi already have and

03:04:14.720 --> 03:04:17.100
even tableau already have so recently i was following

03:04:17.100 --> 03:04:20.600
tableau news uh they're like a release uh basically and i

03:04:20.600 --> 03:04:24.000
got to know that even tableau has released this one okay uh

03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:27.400
so i was thinking like uh since purchase was it is a open

03:04:27.400 --> 03:04:32.220
source if you have any idea do they have any kind of thing

03:04:32.220 --> 03:04:40.120
or can we build on top of like some kind of chat app you can

03:04:40.120 --> 03:04:43.060
you can you can chat up so you're saying that you would like

03:04:43.060 --> 03:04:45.820
to build a independent chat app which will which will yeah

03:04:45.820 --> 03:04:48.900
yeah yeah so there will be two components i was sorry sorry

03:04:48.900 --> 03:04:52.520
to interrupt like one is basically the um visualization and

03:04:52.520 --> 03:04:56.560
one will be the numeric so will there be any vision models

03:04:56.560 --> 03:04:59.280
also involved in that no no no vision model will not be

03:04:59.280 --> 03:05:01.360
involved see you are just trying to plot the graph right

03:05:01.360 --> 03:05:03.860
after understanding the data means after understanding that

03:05:03.860 --> 03:05:06.840
your x y x and y coordinate technically this is what you do

03:05:06.840 --> 03:05:10.380
in a power bi right so vision power bi tableau or like any

03:05:10.380 --> 03:05:12.840
other dashboarding tool so technically vision model is not

03:05:12.840 --> 03:05:15.880
required over there a simple chat completion model is going

03:05:15.880 --> 03:05:18.480
to understand and then parallel to this so you can try to

03:05:18.480 --> 03:05:22.240
maybe attach uh like any kind of a graph library for example

03:05:22.240 --> 03:05:25.540
you can try to attach maybe a matplotlib cufflinks seaborne

03:05:25.540 --> 03:05:28.900
or maybe any other like a graph plotting library and it will

03:05:28.900 --> 03:05:31.680
it will work so just you have to i think i have shown this

03:05:31.680 --> 03:05:34.680
graph things multiple times in many projects basically so

03:05:34.680 --> 03:05:38.180
they're like yeah sorry sir to interrupt so uh it's not

03:05:38.180 --> 03:05:41.540
about generating the graph it's about inferencing from the

03:05:41.540 --> 03:05:44.340
graph i mean uh what i'm saying is let's let's suppose uh

03:05:44.340 --> 03:05:48.200
there is uh inferencing from the ground there are a

03:05:48.200 --> 03:05:51.440
dashboard already there multiple dashboards there is

03:05:51.440 --> 03:05:55.700
visualization there is a proper table also so for that do we

03:05:55.700 --> 03:05:59.940
need uh i mean for that do we need a vision model or yeah so

03:05:59.940 --> 03:06:02.640
if you are if you are see there will be two approach to the

03:06:02.640 --> 03:06:05.520
same problem for approach number one i have a graph in front

03:06:05.520 --> 03:06:09.120
of me and then someone should be standing on graph and

03:06:09.120 --> 03:06:12.400
explain it to me right maybe i'll explain to me means i can

03:06:12.400 --> 03:06:14.220
ask a question and then they should be able to give me the

03:06:14.220 --> 03:06:17.340
answer right so you can try to use basically you can just

03:06:17.340 --> 03:06:20.720
log into a google ai studio and then from a google studio so

03:06:20.720 --> 03:06:23.080
they are giving you a feature and you will be able to share

03:06:23.080 --> 03:06:25.460
a screen it can understand everything on your screen

03:06:25.460 --> 03:06:28.120
everything is literally everything on your screen it will be

03:06:28.120 --> 03:06:31.440
able to understand even uh you know the oven that we have

03:06:31.440 --> 03:06:34.700
created right so only which is a interactive bot system

03:06:34.700 --> 03:06:37.820
which will be able to take your interview so we have removed

03:06:37.820 --> 03:06:41.060
that particular feature but we have added previously but

03:06:41.060 --> 03:06:44.120
later we have removed it so basically anyone can share the

03:06:44.120 --> 03:06:47.260
screen and anything which is available on your screen it

03:06:47.260 --> 03:06:50.160
will be able to understand and you can ask any question

03:06:50.160 --> 03:06:54.160
about that solution number one right so go to google studio

03:06:54.160 --> 03:06:57.540
and then from there try to like integrate gemini flash it

03:06:57.540 --> 03:07:01.760
will be able to work solution number two right so this is

03:07:01.760 --> 03:07:04.140
the direct solution approach and it is it is going to work

03:07:04.140 --> 03:07:06.180
for everything on your screen everything means literally

03:07:06.180 --> 03:07:08.160
everything doesn't matter whether you have a graph numbers

03:07:08.160 --> 03:07:11.540
or a excel sheet or maybe something else is opened up it

03:07:11.540 --> 03:07:14.400
will it can give an answer so it's like a all-in-one

03:07:14.400 --> 03:07:17.380
solution for this one second approach could be if i'm

03:07:17.380 --> 03:07:19.960
looking for a specific to this tool see you are generating a

03:07:19.960 --> 03:07:25.000
graph and obviously uh like a graph is uh technically will

03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:27.680
be generated from a numbers from a data set that you have

03:07:27.680 --> 03:07:32.580
configured right so give an access of the llm right give an

03:07:32.580 --> 03:07:35.520
access of this data to an llms and then ask a question

03:07:35.520 --> 03:07:40.580
that's what i was i was also trying actually rather than

03:07:40.580 --> 03:07:43.940
using a sure thank you but but you can use it you can use

03:07:43.940 --> 03:07:46.500
you can try gemini it's literally beautiful so the first

03:07:46.500 --> 03:07:50.620
option that you said like the gemini flash so is so uh the

03:07:50.620 --> 03:07:56.000
comparable uh uh like the corresponding model for uh like

03:07:56.000 --> 03:08:00.760
from the browser is it like the browser used for uh um or

03:08:00.760 --> 03:08:03.780
the operator used for strategy but is it the same or no yeah

03:08:03.780 --> 03:08:06.300
so let me let me show you that i think my screen is visible

03:08:06.300 --> 03:08:11.080
right yes let me show you that part right gemini no so this

03:08:11.080 --> 03:08:16.620
this i i have account basically which is a paid account i

03:08:16.620 --> 03:08:25.640
think this is not a paid account stream yeah now see this is

03:08:25.640 --> 03:08:27.620
there is an option called a stream option right inside

03:08:27.620 --> 03:08:30.420
google ai studio now this provides you a share screen option

03:08:30.420 --> 03:08:33.380
so let's suppose i think my screen is i'm sharing this

03:08:33.380 --> 03:08:36.260
screen right so let's suppose i'm going to share some

03:08:36.260 --> 03:08:37.060
different screen

03:08:39.820 --> 03:08:39.960
and then i'll share it on my screen and i'm sharing it here

03:08:39.960 --> 03:08:39.960
this one and i'm sharing an option here on my screen here by

03:08:39.960 --> 03:08:40.580
the way this is just because you may be able to access my

03:08:40.580 --> 03:08:43.200
speech it will be able to access my screen see as you can

03:08:43.200 --> 03:08:48.960
see over here allow this time and uh tell me what you see

03:08:48.960 --> 03:08:52.380
right i can now see this screen is visible this is this i

03:08:52.380 --> 03:08:55.060
have three screens i have sharing my other screen right and

03:08:55.060 --> 03:08:58.100
the screen that you are able to see the ai studio screen and

03:08:58.100 --> 03:09:01.040
uh here so i have just shared it and i'm asking and they are

03:09:01.040 --> 03:09:03.820
providing you api so this is this technically this kind of a

03:09:03.820 --> 03:09:06.600
stream we are using even inside ownie great great sure so

03:09:06.600 --> 03:09:09.800
thank you i i'll try to explore the apis for the other

03:09:09.800 --> 03:09:12.460
screen so stream is live and you can ask any question you

03:09:12.460 --> 03:09:16.620
can see it is able to all this time write this that i see a

03:09:16.620 --> 03:09:19.580
web page with this title if there is a graph and it's very

03:09:19.580 --> 03:09:22.500
accurate believe me it's very much accurate and it's kind of

03:09:22.500 --> 03:09:26.600
a conversational system that they are giving you so if you

03:09:26.600 --> 03:09:29.940
are looking for like a solution like immediately then i'll

03:09:29.940 --> 03:09:32.400
say go just go ahead with this one and integrate its api

03:09:32.400 --> 03:09:36.680
sure yeah but even with the api access they're like a

03:09:36.680 --> 03:09:40.200
providing stream services it's a little bit costly but yeah

03:09:40.200 --> 03:09:42.820
i think it's very useful for like this kind of use cases

03:09:42.820 --> 03:09:47.100
yeah i'll just prepare a poc so yeah yeah yeah thank you so

03:09:47.100 --> 03:09:52.120
much okay thanks yeah okay any other question guys uh

03:09:54.080 --> 03:09:58.280
yes sir so basically uh thank you for the four-year session

03:09:58.280 --> 03:10:01.720
it's very it's very deep and very high level just like for a

03:10:01.720 --> 03:10:05.860
student like us like for transitioning so it is very much

03:10:05.860 --> 03:10:09.740
high level because right now uh i'm following your lectures

03:10:09.740 --> 03:10:13.460
for the fine tuning uh with janaya you have teach so i have

03:10:13.460 --> 03:10:18.360
reached till uh chroma db and uh and pine cone installation

03:10:18.360 --> 03:10:20.760
and configuration everything i'm following all this and

03:10:20.760 --> 03:10:25.320
whatever issue i'm facing i'm using yuri to resolve it but

03:10:25.320 --> 03:10:30.520
this level of details which you explained and as we are only

03:10:30.520 --> 03:10:35.360
following the lectures so and how we will get all the

03:10:35.360 --> 03:10:38.620
details practically because in interview is theory it's okay

03:10:38.880 --> 03:10:43.540
but when they cross question why this and why this not and

03:10:43.540 --> 03:10:47.860
being as a student we only using the field flexi or

03:10:47.860 --> 03:10:51.420
something and we don't have a production or like enterprise

03:10:51.420 --> 03:10:56.380
knowledge such kind of thing so you will be you will be able

03:10:56.380 --> 03:10:58.820
to get it with experience you will be able to get it with

03:10:58.820 --> 03:11:01.000
time and you will be able to get it with little bit of

03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:07.560
investment all of these things together simple okay okay uh

03:11:08.880 --> 03:11:12.020
but some next question is like i'm planning to like uh i

03:11:12.020 --> 03:11:15.920
have a one use case like for from my own like i'm uh part of

03:11:15.920 --> 03:11:20.740
one like ngo so what they are doing whenever any person is

03:11:20.740 --> 03:11:24.820
doing some kind of donation they have uh slip paint on on

03:11:24.820 --> 03:11:28.900
like on paper they have few like name the area area code

03:11:28.900 --> 03:11:34.280
mobile number and the person who is managing that area so

03:11:34.280 --> 03:11:37.260
what they are they every time every month they have to

03:11:37.260 --> 03:11:38.860
collect and they have to put private enfinities because when

03:11:38.860 --> 03:11:42.420
the they have the manually in an excel sheet okay what i am

03:11:42.420 --> 03:11:46.740
thinking if i will like if someone keeps uploading that

03:11:46.740 --> 03:11:53.420
image and through ocr we will read it and we will upload

03:11:53.420 --> 03:11:59.880
directly in excel and in in those columns which are same as

03:11:59.880 --> 03:12:05.520
on the slip so i i i like i check with the like uri i got

03:12:05.520 --> 03:12:10.000
that like to use ocr and tesseract for image to for it

03:12:10.000 --> 03:12:14.100
because generally the slips are in hindi and or like english

03:12:14.100 --> 03:12:18.020
so this i'm like doing it so can i use any kind of general

03:12:18.020 --> 03:12:20.960
kind of thing like like if i implement the same thing in

03:12:20.960 --> 03:12:24.220
vector using vector why do you need why do you need a vector

03:12:24.220 --> 03:12:27.340
i mean like what is the use of vector over here i'm just

03:12:27.340 --> 03:12:31.660
thinking if i enhance this no like for what purposes like if

03:12:31.660 --> 03:12:35.200
someone is going to ask a question then maybe like with llms

03:12:35.200 --> 03:12:37.680
if you have to integrate then you can introduce a vector

03:12:37.680 --> 03:12:40.180
over there otherwise if you just have to like a requirement

03:12:40.180 --> 03:12:42.340
to store it and maintain the excel sheet then i don't think

03:12:42.340 --> 03:12:44.760
that vector is required over there it will not like do over

03:12:44.760 --> 03:12:49.880
engineering it's like like a normal python application to do

03:12:49.880 --> 03:12:53.780
simple maybe if you have to go for a next level of

03:12:53.780 --> 03:12:56.460
automation so you can do one thing you can try to create

03:12:56.460 --> 03:13:00.680
maybe a init inflow right so where like anyone can send a

03:13:00.680 --> 03:13:04.100
you know ocr to a whatsapp number right and then

03:13:04.100 --> 03:13:05.660
automatically it will do the what's up number right and then

03:13:05.660 --> 03:13:05.660
automatically it will do the what's up number right and then

03:13:05.660 --> 03:13:07.540
automatically it will do the what's up number right and then

03:13:07.540 --> 03:13:07.720
automatically it will do the ocr automatically means it will

03:13:07.720 --> 03:13:10.080
watch the whatsapp automatically it will do the ocr

03:13:10.080 --> 03:13:12.680
automatically it will upload into the excel sheet so no

03:13:12.680 --> 03:13:15.040
manual intervention everything into an automated and people

03:13:15.040 --> 03:13:18.040
just have to or your vendor just have to send one single

03:13:18.040 --> 03:13:20.360
message over the whatsapp that's it because all of us are

03:13:20.360 --> 03:13:22.540
connected over the whatsapp right so maybe this will be the

03:13:22.540 --> 03:13:26.300
good enhancement in your project and good automation and so

03:13:26.300 --> 03:13:29.420
how i will handle the duplication part because sometimes uh

03:13:29.420 --> 03:13:32.360
to any any how you are maintaining excel seat right so in

03:13:32.360 --> 03:13:35.300
excel sheet uh basically duplication part maintaining is

03:13:35.300 --> 03:13:35.660
very easy so you have to do the duplication part maintaining

03:13:35.660 --> 03:13:37.180
is very easy so you have to do the duplication part

03:13:37.180 --> 03:13:38.820
maintaining is very easy duplication is pretty much easy in

03:13:38.820 --> 03:13:41.800
excel sheet right it's just a filter you have to apply like

03:13:41.800 --> 03:13:45.820
yeah like one duplication is the same name other duplication

03:13:45.820 --> 03:13:50.080
is one person submitted the amount on 5th of march the same

03:13:50.080 --> 03:13:55.140
person updated higher amount on 10th of march so i need that

03:13:55.140 --> 03:13:59.540
updated amount depending upon the latest date so these

03:13:59.540 --> 03:14:03.900
things also be handling in a logic right now with the help

03:14:03.900 --> 03:14:05.800
of llms you can do it so you don't have to handle it in a

03:14:05.800 --> 03:14:08.900
logic but basically what you can do send your pdf or upload

03:14:08.900 --> 03:14:12.100
your data in a like any llms even you can upload that in a

03:14:12.100 --> 03:14:15.400
yuri take a sample one upload the document in yuri and then

03:14:15.400 --> 03:14:19.680
ask it it will do it automatically okay if you take the

03:14:19.680 --> 03:14:24.400
latest timestamp yeah yeah one one way is like uh like uh

03:14:24.400 --> 03:14:27.840
yeah one way is to you know uh one way to handle this one is

03:14:27.840 --> 03:14:31.880
basically sending uh writing a logic right other way is to

03:14:31.880 --> 03:14:37.080
just go to your chat system any llms okay in that way i can

03:14:37.080 --> 03:14:41.180
enhance it yes yes yes sure sir thank you for your solution

03:14:41.180 --> 03:14:48.340
sir thank you thanks okay yeah one more question is uh just

03:14:48.340 --> 03:14:53.940
today you also mentioned this um multi-model pdf right so uh

03:14:53.940 --> 03:14:57.840
actually in my work uh we are having a legal document so

03:14:57.840 --> 03:15:01.600
it's a large multiple documents which have a multi-model

03:15:01.600 --> 03:15:06.780
with the text image tables right then uh what is your

03:15:06.780 --> 03:15:13.720
suggestions to uh take this um use those pdfs rag is not

03:15:13.720 --> 03:15:17.540
enough right for that what are the other rag is enough i

03:15:17.540 --> 03:15:20.040
would say rag is fine if even if you have like multiple

03:15:20.040 --> 03:15:22.460
things over there just have to you know whenever you're

03:15:22.460 --> 03:15:24.720
doing an embedding so you have to use a multi-model and

03:15:24.720 --> 03:15:27.580
again whenever you are trying to send something to the llms

03:15:27.580 --> 03:15:29.920
you have to use like a multi-model a powerful one basically

03:15:29.920 --> 03:15:33.660
which can understand images and text and like tables yeah so

03:15:33.660 --> 03:15:34.640
how will chunk it then

03:15:38.500 --> 03:15:42.180
yeah so basically you have to like strategize in a different

03:15:42.180 --> 03:15:45.220
way that if if i'm like observing or if i'm getting maybe

03:15:45.220 --> 03:15:48.280
images let's go ahead with this flow this is what i have

03:15:48.280 --> 03:15:50.700
discussed right so whenever you are trying to get a

03:15:50.700 --> 03:15:53.880
different kind of a data in a different format so you have

03:15:53.880 --> 03:15:56.500
to create a different parallel pipeline that okay this data

03:15:56.500 --> 03:15:58.640
will go with this approach this data will go with this

03:15:58.640 --> 03:16:01.080
approach it's not like you will just follow the same

03:16:01.080 --> 03:16:04.880
approach like thousand size of chucking 200 of overlap no so

03:16:04.880 --> 03:16:07.980
same same rule uh you can't like uh you should not implement

03:16:07.980 --> 03:16:11.500
so so so then before that you have to split that text

03:16:11.500 --> 03:16:14.500
separately you may separately yes yeah you have to explain

03:16:14.500 --> 03:16:19.620
it yes yeah yeah yeah yeah uh one this is one approach but

03:16:19.620 --> 03:16:22.300
second is can we use the vision transformer kind of where

03:16:22.300 --> 03:16:26.100
everything can be taken as it is what are your suggestions

03:16:26.100 --> 03:16:30.540
and uh what are the uh good uh model to take on or approach

03:16:30.540 --> 03:16:34.680
vision see technically a vision transformer will do the that

03:16:34.680 --> 03:16:38.640
same thing but yeah uh if i'm talking about like uh you know

03:16:38.640 --> 03:16:41.740
uh just a vision transformer so in that case i don't have to

03:16:41.740 --> 03:16:44.200
even go ahead with the rag means vector db will be minus

03:16:44.200 --> 03:16:48.680
there right so i can directly upload my document inside the

03:16:48.680 --> 03:16:50.920
vision transformer and i can start chatting with it just

03:16:50.920 --> 03:16:53.360
like i chat with like a chat gpt with the regular documents

03:16:53.360 --> 03:16:57.040
and i will be able to get the answer so in that case no

03:16:57.040 --> 03:17:01.860
question of building rag but again but if i have a thousands

03:17:01.860 --> 03:17:03.000
of documents

03:17:05.660 --> 03:17:09.000
again you will be stuck so again your vision transformers so

03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:11.880
you have to you can use the vision transformer as an api

03:17:11.880 --> 03:17:16.060
that will be a better option basically that wherever you are

03:17:16.060 --> 03:17:19.480
getting this kind of a result just like a create your own

03:17:19.480 --> 03:17:22.800
chat interface and use a vision transformer with your api

03:17:24.600 --> 03:17:28.000
that that will be the solution one of the solution and okay

03:17:28.000 --> 03:17:31.740
then we'll store it uh store it anywhere that's fine you can

03:17:31.740 --> 03:17:34.540
store it into s3 directly no need to use even a vector db

03:17:34.540 --> 03:17:39.660
why to use a vector db uses three uses means store it as a

03:17:39.660 --> 03:17:43.240
plain file don't don't like a chuck it basically but

03:17:43.240 --> 03:17:48.740
searching how it will do that that in vector it is small do

03:17:48.740 --> 03:17:53.040
the but with file name I can do the searching with a keyword

03:17:53.040 --> 03:17:56.540
batch but think only if a million documents right each

03:17:56.540 --> 03:18:02.640
document says thousand pages so is the searching is

03:18:02.640 --> 03:18:07.400
efficient here no not at all so then in that cases what is

03:18:07.400 --> 03:18:12.500
the best approach then vector again vector or maybe the

03:18:12.500 --> 03:18:16.480
vector plus vision go with the hybrid then yeah okay okay

03:18:16.480 --> 03:18:18.900
means vector is going to help you out in terms of finding

03:18:18.900 --> 03:18:22.160
out the see vector is going to so you can again by forget

03:18:22.160 --> 03:18:24.260
the approach so vector approach is going to help you out to

03:18:24.260 --> 03:18:26.880
identify the document because whenever you are bringing a

03:18:26.880 --> 03:18:29.440
document you are bringing even citation right so citation

03:18:29.440 --> 03:18:32.220
means it is telling you anyhow sources that okay fine so in

03:18:32.220 --> 03:18:34.600
this document let's suppose I have a millions of document so

03:18:34.600 --> 03:18:36.920
this citation will tell you with the help of vector match

03:18:36.920 --> 03:18:40.100
that okay out of million this is the document yes agree

03:18:41.000 --> 03:18:44.040
right so now you know out of million document so this is the

03:18:44.040 --> 03:18:46.480
document where I have a information which I am looking for

03:18:46.480 --> 03:18:49.780
right and now you will be able to pull out those document

03:18:49.780 --> 03:18:54.440
easily and pass that into a vision transformer one of the

03:18:54.440 --> 03:18:58.440
approach I think it's the best one which will be able to

03:18:58.440 --> 03:19:01.460
balance your like a million document search operation and

03:19:01.460 --> 03:19:03.780
even inside a document it will be able to search the content

03:19:03.780 --> 03:19:10.300
right okay yeah plus there is another possibility edge case

03:19:10.300 --> 03:19:13.300
wise that one document will be having thousands of pages but

03:19:13.300 --> 03:19:15.680
let's suppose I don't want to pass thousands of pages even

03:19:15.680 --> 03:19:17.340
with the vision transformer right because it will be a

03:19:17.340 --> 03:19:20.940
costless approach so I know from the citation whenever I am

03:19:20.940 --> 03:19:23.140
going to do a vector search that okay in which page in which

03:19:23.140 --> 03:19:25.500
section it is available right so I will just try to pass

03:19:25.500 --> 03:19:28.480
that page to my vision transformer so again it will be like

03:19:28.480 --> 03:19:31.700
a optimized approach I can't pass like a thousand page

03:19:31.700 --> 03:19:35.320
document to the vision transformer every time right yeah so

03:19:35.320 --> 03:19:38.420
this is again like another level of optimization you can do

03:19:39.380 --> 03:19:43.320
okay thank you let me to implement those things and I maybe

03:19:43.320 --> 03:19:48.220
take your help yeah anytime yeah thank you thank you yes

03:19:48.220 --> 03:19:54.220
yeah yeah I have six questions yeah yeah go ahead be patient

03:19:54.220 --> 03:19:59.480
with me first question in the interview this thing is asked

03:19:59.480 --> 03:20:06.360
that how to your project yeah yeah okay okay so I am very

03:20:06.360 --> 03:20:11.180
confused I mean of course story telling preparation but how

03:20:11.180 --> 03:20:16.740
did you design this project is there any way we can today

03:20:16.740 --> 03:20:21.340
what we saw basically this was the project design what does

03:20:21.340 --> 03:20:24.660
project design mean problem statement first of all someone

03:20:24.660 --> 03:20:26.880
will give you a project basically based on the problem

03:20:26.880 --> 03:20:28.880
statement he will say okay this is the problem solve it

03:20:28.880 --> 03:20:32.040
right and then back and forth back and forth back and forth

03:20:32.040 --> 03:20:35.700
what will you do you will ask many questions his solution so

03:20:35.700 --> 03:20:37.700
what we were doing today layer by layer what we were doing

03:20:37.700 --> 03:20:40.540
that your team what will be the team formation basically

03:20:41.440 --> 03:20:44.380
cost allocation how will it be and when the project will be

03:20:44.380 --> 03:20:47.460
in actual so that layer by layer layer by layer how will the

03:20:47.460 --> 03:20:50.180
project run and what components will come inside it so we

03:20:50.180 --> 03:20:53.020
saw the components inside we also saw the alternative of the

03:20:53.020 --> 03:20:56.340
component so we were studying that today what I mean in this

03:20:56.340 --> 03:20:59.080
I was not able to get the question like design because this

03:20:59.080 --> 03:21:03.480
is called design mean it is more important to explain sir

03:21:03.480 --> 03:21:10.480
compared to the details now when I am saying that I have

03:21:10.480 --> 03:21:13.500
designed this project like this we have used these

03:21:13.500 --> 03:21:20.300
technologies in this so my confusion is that how can I like

03:21:20.300 --> 03:21:24.600
what is my best approach to describe the design of the

03:21:24.600 --> 03:21:29.560
project I can I can yes the description which starts with

03:21:29.560 --> 03:21:32.080
your problem statement that we were facing this problem

03:21:32.080 --> 03:21:35.640
there were so many teams there was so much document again

03:21:35.640 --> 03:21:39.500
and again we had to raise support ticket where again the

03:21:39.500 --> 03:21:44.380
time was more plus 30-40% effort it always goes into it plus

03:21:44.380 --> 03:21:46.580
there will be like a legal compliance there is a fear of

03:21:46.580 --> 03:21:51.240
coming later so such a big organization so many employees so

03:21:51.240 --> 03:21:55.160
many documents so many million documents so much size and

03:21:55.160 --> 03:21:58.600
this was a problem that we were facing on a daily basis we

03:21:58.600 --> 03:22:00.240
were doing the same work over and over again solution was

03:22:00.240 --> 03:22:02.220
already available but we didn't know that solution is

03:22:02.220 --> 03:22:04.640
already available patents and research papers were already

03:22:04.640 --> 03:22:07.520
available but we didn't know so this was the problem right I

03:22:07.520 --> 03:22:08.980
think this discussion didn't start with the problem

03:22:08.980 --> 03:22:12.440
statement after that now there are so many teams so many

03:22:12.440 --> 03:22:15.420
data points data source so it was written here see

03:22:15.420 --> 03:22:18.720
sharepoint google drive one drive s3 bucket azure sql no sql

03:22:18.720 --> 03:22:21.700
right and then there will be types if there are so many

03:22:21.700 --> 03:22:26.220
sources then in pdf form doc form ppt txt vtt audio right

03:22:26.220 --> 03:22:30.300
what were the edge cases in it then this is what we read

03:22:30.300 --> 03:22:34.060
today from problem statement to what's next then what's next

03:22:34.060 --> 03:22:36.480
what's next then what's next and then till final solution

03:22:36.480 --> 03:22:40.340
building that now dev test prod is here and then when dev

03:22:40.340 --> 03:22:43.220
test prod is here then now it comes to cost how much will be

03:22:43.220 --> 03:22:45.620
the cost if the project goes live right so we have done cost

03:22:45.620 --> 03:22:49.400
calculation here on it after that when we calculate cost

03:22:49.400 --> 03:22:54.160
then here it comes that now the layer you have made which

03:22:54.160 --> 03:22:57.280
was the upper layer now what are the alternatives in that

03:22:57.280 --> 03:23:00.420
layer as a technology that you you will only use one or you

03:23:00.420 --> 03:23:02.540
will use kafka you will use kinesis you will not use both

03:23:02.540 --> 03:23:05.720
actually but as an architect because here there are a lot of

03:23:05.720 --> 03:23:06.760
seniors in your batch

03:23:11.140 --> 03:23:13.420
so alternative you should know as an architect you will not

03:23:13.420 --> 03:23:16.120
just say no we will use kafka you will ask the person in

03:23:16.120 --> 03:23:20.340
front why no I know kafka you can't say like this ok so

03:23:20.340 --> 03:23:22.600
basically there was like a trade off and then I have chosen

03:23:22.600 --> 03:23:24.880
kafka simple now trade off anything can happen you have to

03:23:24.880 --> 03:23:28.960
convince there so this is called design so what is not

03:23:29.540 --> 03:23:32.080
understood we don't understand no sir I will see it once

03:23:32.080 --> 03:23:36.640
more exactly everything is told till team that what will be

03:23:36.640 --> 03:23:38.940
your core team so your product manager level solution

03:23:38.940 --> 03:23:42.680
architect tech lead then your pods pods means working team

03:23:42.680 --> 03:23:46.380
ok how many pods that is also told here what will be its

03:23:46.380 --> 03:23:48.540
hierarchy that is also told here what will be the

03:23:48.540 --> 03:23:51.480
development phase or what will be the deployment phase now

03:23:51.480 --> 03:23:53.660
estimation wise of this project you will tell that it will

03:23:53.660 --> 03:23:56.540
go in 6 phases one phase will be of 4 weeks we also said

03:23:56.540 --> 03:23:59.920
delta you will take delta for 3-4 weeks so in this which

03:23:59.920 --> 03:24:03.260
story was missing you tell which can be asked in the

03:24:03.260 --> 03:24:08.120
interview and may be not discussed here what is the story I

03:24:08.120 --> 03:24:13.080
have to make the story properly all the stories are made

03:24:13.080 --> 03:24:16.520
already already here already here story is ok all the

03:24:16.520 --> 03:24:19.980
stories are end to end and any story you start from problem

03:24:19.980 --> 03:24:24.100
statement go to solution to team then to benefit ok what is

03:24:24.100 --> 03:24:26.820
the benefit what did the organization get from our project

03:24:26.820 --> 03:24:30.200
and then you tell your role and support that where do you

03:24:30.200 --> 03:24:33.480
belong in which pod so you have to tell what was your

03:24:33.480 --> 03:24:36.520
responsibility today if you are an architect then you will

03:24:36.520 --> 03:24:40.480
justify ok this whole project was going on in me ok but

03:24:40.480 --> 03:24:42.420
let's suppose you are a developer then where you will be

03:24:42.420 --> 03:24:46.720
basically you will be in a pod ok here we wrote pod ok if

03:24:46.720 --> 03:24:48.980
you are a developer then you will not be in the whole

03:24:48.980 --> 03:24:54.540
scenario you will be somewhere in a pod right 1,2,3,4

03:24:54.540 --> 03:24:57.000
whatever the pod you will fall in that pod if you are a

03:24:57.000 --> 03:24:59.340
senior developer then may be you will use 2 pods or you will

03:24:59.340 --> 03:25:02.320
be part of 2 pods right so it is written here if you are a

03:25:02.320 --> 03:25:05.180
manager if you are an architect if you are a tech lead then

03:25:05.180 --> 03:25:08.740
what will happen ok so all because team structure is like

03:25:08.740 --> 03:25:15.100
this only ok sir I will come back to this my next question

03:25:15.100 --> 03:25:20.980
is how do you manage sensitive data which is going out of

03:25:20.980 --> 03:25:24.740
your own traumatic system and one of the techniques we will

03:25:24.740 --> 03:25:28.920
not let it go first because if it is going out it simply

03:25:28.920 --> 03:25:34.200
means that it is like it is compromised ok so what are the

03:25:34.200 --> 03:25:37.300
strategies you have implemented to ensure that that is not

03:25:37.300 --> 03:25:40.340
going out so basically here we have already told you that

03:25:40.340 --> 03:25:43.900
whenever you are using LLM then we have already written this

03:25:43.900 --> 03:25:47.840
thing here and for a long time we had also discussed it two

03:25:47.840 --> 03:25:50.900
approaches of such thing right see here if you will use LLM

03:25:50.900 --> 03:25:55.100
then you will use LLM API wise right approach number 1 and

03:25:55.100 --> 03:25:57.780
second we have written here open source we have made a video

03:25:57.780 --> 03:26:01.720
of this how you will productionize data so here open source

03:26:01.720 --> 03:26:04.780
now in this approach data will be compromised what will

03:26:04.780 --> 03:26:08.100
happen in this data will not be compromised ok because LLM

03:26:08.100 --> 03:26:10.320
is such a thing from where you will interact at this level

03:26:10.320 --> 03:26:13.740
then again embedding wise we had told you here ok what will

03:26:13.740 --> 03:26:16.160
you do during embedding either you will use API means you

03:26:16.160 --> 03:26:18.680
are sending data to another system sending to another or

03:26:18.680 --> 03:26:22.560
what will you do here local ok you will configure local here

03:26:22.560 --> 03:26:24.900
for which again thousands of models are available in the

03:26:24.900 --> 03:26:26.880
hanging phase so what will happen in this case now it will

03:26:26.880 --> 03:26:28.340
not be compromised these are the two points which will

03:26:28.340 --> 03:26:34.200
compromise sir but guardrails can be implemented somewhere

03:26:34.200 --> 03:26:38.560
sorry guardrails guardrails guardrails guardrails guardrails

03:26:38.560 --> 03:26:41.420
will be implemented everywhere guardrails is what guardrails

03:26:41.420 --> 03:26:43.240
is not a technology guardrails is a common term we say

03:26:43.240 --> 03:26:46.560
security is equal to guardrails ok so guardrails obviously

03:26:46.560 --> 03:26:49.000
you will implement everywhere wherever so guardrails will

03:26:49.000 --> 03:26:51.420
come in every layer and every layer has its own guardrails

03:26:54.360 --> 03:26:58.900
they talk in term of how much accurate retrieval are we

03:26:58.900 --> 03:26:59.960
doing where the retrieval is

03:27:06.420 --> 03:27:13.160
once the project is delivered Now I am asking How did you

03:27:13.160 --> 03:27:17.740
get the matrix How much cost you saved from this project yes

03:27:17.740 --> 03:27:23.740
again So now my cost is this much, again with 10,000, 1,000

03:27:23.740 --> 03:27:26.280
and 100 people, so let's suppose if we are saying that we

03:27:26.280 --> 03:27:29.060
are developing for 1000 people, my team size was this, we

03:27:29.060 --> 03:27:31.640
were developing for this, so basically this is my cost, so

03:27:31.640 --> 03:27:36.760
technically 3,601 rupees is a cost for me, now if we convert

03:27:36.760 --> 03:27:39.700
it to iron, if we take 80 rupees, which is still going on

03:27:39.700 --> 03:27:43.800
88, so if we take 4,000 dollars, then it will be less than 3

03:27:43.800 --> 03:27:44.320
,20,000,

03:27:47.740 --> 03:27:52.820
now if you have a support team to manage a team of 1000

03:27:52.820 --> 03:27:54.380
people, then there will be at least 10 people in the support

03:27:54.380 --> 03:27:58.140
team, if we talk about the salary of 10 people on an

03:27:58.140 --> 03:28:02.640
average, then there will also be a support lead, a support

03:28:02.640 --> 03:28:04.920
manager, everyone will be there, and there can be a team of

03:28:04.920 --> 03:28:07.460
10 people for 1000 people, there will be a lot of teams in

03:28:07.460 --> 03:28:10.360
the support team, so here let's say 20 people, manager,

03:28:10.580 --> 03:28:12.660
director, support director, support manager, and by

03:28:12.660 --> 03:28:14.300
combining everyone else, and manually all this will be done,

03:28:14.820 --> 03:28:21.480
then this cost will be surpassed, right, this cost is saved

03:28:21.480 --> 03:28:24.040
here, second, this is an internal project, let's suppose you

03:28:24.040 --> 03:28:26.160
are developing an internal project like this, let's suppose

03:28:26.160 --> 03:28:28.200
you are doing it for a client, if you sell this solution

03:28:28.200 --> 03:28:33.240
like this, if you sell this solution like this, then you

03:28:33.240 --> 03:28:35.040
have sold it to 10 people, then you have already made

03:28:35.040 --> 03:28:38.480
millions here, this is what the company does, right, okay,

03:28:38.580 --> 03:28:43.120
so the question is about what technique you have used, what

03:28:43.120 --> 03:28:45.600
matrix you have used, so that you can save so much

03:28:45.600 --> 03:28:52.500
percentage, so to answer this question probably is what you

03:28:52.500 --> 03:28:55.420
explained, that this is what was the cost and this is what,

03:28:55.500 --> 03:28:59.900
employee versus, if it is an internal product, right, if it

03:28:59.900 --> 03:29:02.100
is an internal product, if it is an external product, if we

03:29:02.100 --> 03:29:05.340
are selling someone this one as a product, so in that case

03:29:05.340 --> 03:29:08.660
obviously my quotes will come in the middle, that okay, for

03:29:08.660 --> 03:29:13.580
tier 1, if my expenses are coming here, let's suppose this

03:29:13.580 --> 03:29:16.640
much, sorry, this much, right, so maybe I will try to like

03:29:16.640 --> 03:29:19.040
do a 10x and then I will try to sell it to you for 100

03:29:19.040 --> 03:29:22.540
people, again in 1000 people, we will sell it for 10x, if

03:29:22.540 --> 03:29:25.160
you are a big organization, then we will sell it for 10 or

03:29:25.160 --> 03:29:29.220
5, that will be my benefit, so again I can see this as a

03:29:29.220 --> 03:29:33.880
service product, I can see as a product basically. Okay, so

03:29:33.880 --> 03:29:38.340
next is like few serious questions, which is compared to

03:29:38.340 --> 03:29:43.120
like is learning JNI makes sense when everything is going to

03:29:43.120 --> 03:29:44.700
be taken over by agents, is there any way that we can use

03:29:44.700 --> 03:29:49.560
JNI in the coming future? JNI, actually agentic AI is a part

03:29:49.560 --> 03:29:52.580
of generative AI, generative AI is an umbrella, it comes

03:29:52.580 --> 03:29:58.420
with RG, it comes with agentic AI, it comes with MCP,

03:29:58.560 --> 03:30:02.980
generative AI is a common term by the way, for example, in

03:30:02.980 --> 03:30:05.980
data science, what comes in data science, stats, machine

03:30:05.980 --> 03:30:08.820
learning, deep learning, computer vision, NLP, and now

03:30:08.820 --> 03:30:12.680
generative AI is also called in data science or in AI, so in

03:30:12.680 --> 03:30:15.980
generative AI, again like, YouTube creates a lot of

03:30:15.980 --> 03:30:18.160
confusion, I think you must have created confusion from

03:30:18.160 --> 03:30:20.760
there only, I know, I know, the source of confusion,

03:30:21.360 --> 03:30:24.180
generative AI is a common term, there is no technology by

03:30:24.180 --> 03:30:27.460
the way, okay, wherever we have used LLM, it is called as

03:30:27.460 --> 03:30:32.000
generative AI, right, so wherever we have used LLM, then

03:30:32.000 --> 03:30:35.060
what do you do as an agent, you use LLM there, right? Yes.

03:30:35.720 --> 03:30:39.880
Do you use LLM in MCP also? Yes. Are you using LLM in RAG

03:30:39.880 --> 03:30:44.480
also? Yes, we are using LLM everywhere. Is it possible? Yes,

03:30:44.480 --> 03:30:45.720
we have used LLM in all the parts of generative AI, so

03:30:45.720 --> 03:30:49.460
generative AI is an umbrella basically. Okay. Don't watch

03:30:49.460 --> 03:30:52.460
YouTube video comparatively, the biggest problem, the

03:30:52.460 --> 03:30:56.660
biggest source of destruction is the youth, right? This is

03:30:56.660 --> 03:30:59.260
it, it is a fake influence. It doesn't increase anything, it

03:30:59.260 --> 03:31:02.320
brings out a new word from itself. And then we have to come

03:31:02.320 --> 03:31:07.320
to the teacher and explain. I sat in as a blank slate, yes,

03:31:07.460 --> 03:31:11.040
so the person who is blank, first he will mislead YouTube,

03:31:11.040 --> 03:31:13.500
then only he will understand what is actually there. Yes.

03:31:14.700 --> 03:31:17.240
But okay, if you do a little work, you will understand it.

03:31:18.880 --> 03:31:21.860
My last question is, sir, are any MCP courses available?

03:31:22.360 --> 03:31:26.060
Because MCP is put everywhere. MCP is already available. I

03:31:26.060 --> 03:31:28.700
think we did MCP four months ago. You go and search once. I

03:31:28.700 --> 03:31:31.740
think, let's suppose we search. MCP is already available.

03:31:32.580 --> 03:31:35.100
MCP is being discussed in this as well. Basically, what is

03:31:35.100 --> 03:31:36.940
going on in your generative AI, it is being discussed in

03:31:36.940 --> 03:31:39.560
that. Yes, it is happening in that as well. And MCP master

03:31:39.560 --> 03:31:42.460
is fully available already. See. And that too with 10

03:31:42.460 --> 03:31:46.580
projects. With 10 projects. Our recording is in it. Okay.

03:31:46.640 --> 03:31:51.200
Okay, sir. I will look into it. Sir, one last question. What

03:31:51.200 --> 03:31:53.940
is the future of ML, sir? Like machine learning. Of course,

03:31:53.960 --> 03:31:58.080
once all the LLMs will be made. Yes. They will be trained.

03:31:58.340 --> 03:32:01.220
After that, how many jobs will ML engineers have? I was

03:32:01.220 --> 03:32:04.020
thinking that ML engineers. No, no, no. See, see. This is

03:32:04.020 --> 03:32:06.040
wrong. And the voice that is being spread in the market.

03:32:06.300 --> 03:32:09.080
See. AI. Look, earlier there was Google. Earlier there was

03:32:09.080 --> 03:32:11.640
Stack Overflow. Earlier we used to have documentation. Books

03:32:11.640 --> 03:32:14.320
used to happen earlier too. Okay. What you are seeing today

03:32:14.320 --> 03:32:18.460
is nothing new. Yes. The ease of use has changed. Earlier we

03:32:18.460 --> 03:32:20.140
used to open the book and read it. Then we started reading

03:32:20.140 --> 03:32:23.280
it in the tablet. Oil came. Okay. Then we started reading

03:32:23.280 --> 03:32:24.980
the book in the tablet. So, the need for hard copy of the

03:32:24.980 --> 03:32:28.680
book is over. Many people are hard copy lovers, including

03:32:28.680 --> 03:32:32.760
me. Okay. So, that evolution happened from there. Again, if

03:32:32.760 --> 03:32:34.840
we talk about today, then if we talk about phase chemistry,

03:32:35.020 --> 03:32:38.920
mathematics or programming, we start from there. If we talk

03:32:38.920 --> 03:32:41.060
about architecture, we always start from there. We start

03:32:41.060 --> 03:32:44.240
from there. So, machine learning, statistics, programming is

03:32:44.240 --> 03:32:48.680
that base. If you want to excel in life, then why not use

03:32:48.680 --> 03:32:51.700
AI. Because AI cannot do everything. It is just a better

03:32:51.700 --> 03:32:54.120
helper. Generally, people think that AI will write

03:32:54.120 --> 03:32:56.560
everything. Tell me one product, one single product that has

03:32:56.560 --> 03:32:58.380
been made till now in the whole world. We are talking about

03:32:58.380 --> 03:33:00.980
AI since the last three years. Almost. Tell me one single

03:33:00.980 --> 03:33:04.220
product that AI has made. AI is managing that. Not even a

03:33:04.220 --> 03:33:06.420
single one you will be able to name. Which is running in the

03:33:06.420 --> 03:33:09.860
production. So, AI is basically a helper. And it is not like

03:33:09.860 --> 03:33:12.520
AI is helping us in any way. No, we already had helpers. We

03:33:12.520 --> 03:33:15.400
had documentation, we had google search, we had stack

03:33:15.400 --> 03:33:19.060
overflow, we had books, we had research papers. Now what did

03:33:19.060 --> 03:33:23.360
AI do? It made access easier. This is what you are able to

03:33:23.360 --> 03:33:26.880
access. You are able to access the code in snippet. If you

03:33:26.880 --> 03:33:29.180
are giving him a requirement, he is able to write it, you

03:33:29.180 --> 03:33:30.640
are giving him a legal document, he is able to read it and

03:33:30.640 --> 03:33:33.500
summarize it so that you don't have to go there. So your

03:33:33.500 --> 03:33:37.980
life has become easy. AI has done that much. It is not that

03:33:37.980 --> 03:33:40.560
AI has removed all the pain and suffering of your life.

03:33:41.080 --> 03:33:45.080
Never. And it will never be able to do it. Believe me. And

03:33:45.080 --> 03:33:48.580
that's why as a human, I always suggest that when you are

03:33:48.580 --> 03:33:51.440
starting, start from the ABCD. You won't learn to speak

03:33:51.440 --> 03:33:54.580
English unless and until you don't know like ABCD. And if

03:33:54.580 --> 03:33:57.600
you don't know how to speak Hindi, then you won't know. So

03:33:57.600 --> 03:34:00.180
that machine learning, that python, that statistics is

03:34:00.180 --> 03:34:03.400
basically that unit. Which you will always learn. It should

03:34:03.400 --> 03:34:07.200
come and it will always be relevant. We have been talking

03:34:07.200 --> 03:34:11.060
about AI for the last 8-10 years. And the machine learning

03:34:11.060 --> 03:34:13.780
that was developed in the 1960s, 1970s. The maximum

03:34:13.780 --> 03:34:16.640
algorithm was developed in that time. In the 1980s also. The

03:34:16.640 --> 03:34:18.700
same old algorithms are still relevant today. And we are

03:34:18.700 --> 03:34:23.560
still using it in a production system. Obviously with the

03:34:23.560 --> 03:34:25.940
new technology, with the new trend and new tools, we have

03:34:25.940 --> 03:34:29.740
integrated it. So basically AI will be a helper. It will

03:34:29.740 --> 03:34:32.380
become a better and better helper obviously. The work that

03:34:32.380 --> 03:34:33.080
you have done 10-12 years ago. It would have taken 10-12

03:34:33.080 --> 03:34:36.480
hours to do. It will probably be done faster. Right now it

03:34:36.480 --> 03:34:38.380
is done in an hour. It will probably be done in a minute.

03:34:40.120 --> 03:34:43.080
But at the end of the day, to build anything new, you need a

03:34:43.080 --> 03:34:48.360
human. Okay. So I mean, of course, this is the last of the

03:34:48.360 --> 03:34:52.540
last. From an interview perspective, for Agente AI, Makhnu

03:34:52.540 --> 03:34:57.840
or Jain AI, by any chance, are we using any of the design

03:34:57.840 --> 03:35:01.260
patterns available in the industry? Design patterns

03:35:01.260 --> 03:35:03.580
obviously. Or would we even need to? Yes. You can learn from

03:35:03.580 --> 03:35:06.260
this. The design pattern is not like that. The design

03:35:06.260 --> 03:35:11.820
pattern that you study. It is product based. Okay. This is

03:35:11.820 --> 03:35:14.840
good. Thank you so much. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Okay.

03:35:14.840 --> 03:35:16.960
Rajesh, this is a question for me. From where you learned

03:35:16.960 --> 03:35:21.180
all this technology? Who is your mentor? My approach is very

03:35:21.180 --> 03:35:25.140
simple. Since beginning. Since last 10-11 years. Build it.

03:35:25.520 --> 03:35:31.020
Simple. Because that is the best way to learn anything. Just

03:35:31.020 --> 03:35:32.440
build it. That's the reason. So I always use it. I always

03:35:32.440 --> 03:35:35.780
keep a tech team with me. Very, very close to me. Right.

03:35:35.840 --> 03:35:38.560
Very close to my heart. And we keep on building and

03:35:38.560 --> 03:35:42.120
experimenting multiple products internally. Sometime we

03:35:42.120 --> 03:35:44.520
release it, which you see on your own or other companies.

03:35:44.660 --> 03:35:47.480
And most of the time we don't even release it. We just like

03:35:47.480 --> 03:35:51.140
to do it for fun. I love doing like experimentation. So

03:35:51.140 --> 03:35:56.100
that's my source of learning. Okay. So any other question

03:35:56.100 --> 03:36:03.160
guys? So you can just go ahead if you have any. Yeah. Any

03:36:03.160 --> 03:36:04.220
question? Okay.

03:36:07.780 --> 03:36:09.880
So I think guys we are done with the question. Hope this

03:36:09.880 --> 03:36:13.060
discussion was a fruitful one. You know it's worth. Thank

03:36:13.060 --> 03:36:15.620
you so much Rajesh. Thank you so much. Yeah. So hope this

03:36:15.620 --> 03:36:19.900
entire discussion was good and amazing. Tomorrow again we'll

03:36:19.900 --> 03:36:21.640
try to continue with the same discussion but with the

03:36:21.640 --> 03:36:24.600
different project. Not the same project. So we'll explain

03:36:24.600 --> 03:36:27.800
you the architectural like you know the complete flow of the

03:36:27.800 --> 03:36:30.240
another project, another problem statement I'm going to take

03:36:30.240 --> 03:36:33.300
which will be altogether different. It is not going to be

03:36:33.300 --> 03:36:37.960
same as like today. So today like. Tomorrow. Today's session

03:36:37.960 --> 03:36:39.900
was interesting. Even tomorrow's session will be very

03:36:39.900 --> 03:36:43.180
interesting. Believe me. Right. So it is going to be like

03:36:43.180 --> 03:36:46.560
eye opening session for all of us by the way. Even tomorrow.

03:36:46.920 --> 03:36:48.760
So with that guys thank you so much. Take care. Good night

03:36:48.760 --> 03:36:51.560
and see you again tomorrow. Same time 7 p.m. IST. Thank you

03:36:51.560 --> 03:36:52.540
so much everyone. Take care.
