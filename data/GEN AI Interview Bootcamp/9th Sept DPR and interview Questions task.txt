WEBVTT

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.940
okay so good evening everyone i think i'm audible and

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.360
visible to all of you yes uh please confirm in the chat if

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.680
i'm audible and visible to all of you good

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.730
evening good evening everyone okay

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.040
so let's start today's discussion guys today i'm going to

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:19.140
give you a huge task which you have to complete uh some of

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.780
the tasks today and some of the tasks you have to complete

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.700
maybe like a tomorrow and you have to send those tasks

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.960
inside a group so that i can try to evaluate your task and

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.520
then we will do a another level of discussion so shall we

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:39.200
start guys everyone yep i think people are not that active

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.400
in a chat i know it's tuesday maybe it's a working day for

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:48.440
all of you but class is also important i believe yes okay so

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.180
i believe my screen is visible to all of you so basically

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:56.520
guys uh today i'm going to give you two tasks so one task is

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:01.300
a dpr related task basically so i have created i think my

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.720
screen is visible to all of you so the very first task which

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:10.480
i have created for all of you is called as dpr so first of

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.540
all whenever you will go for an interview so two things is

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:17.160
important one is a storytelling of a project and second

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.760
obviously a interview question and answer so obviously i'm

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.240
going to discuss interview question and answer in very depth

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:28.040
and detail and i'm going to give my version of an answer for

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.460
all of the questions so obviously it's not just you who are

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.980
supposed to prepare something but yeah so i'm going to give

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.420
you all the answers and you have to you know mimic those

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:40.680
answers uh in your own way but before starting ahead with

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:45.120
the interview questions back to back uh two things right two

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.180
things the very first thing is a detailed project report

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:52.040
that you have to prepare so i have already discussed a three

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:57.000
project one was a rag one was basically a fine tuning of an

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.120
llms basically for a three chat completion or streaming and

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.420
one was basically a fine tuning of a model with respect to

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:07.120
embeddings and a re-ranking and i have already shared a two

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.480
code base with all of you those code bases are already

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.200
available inside your dashboard so that code base is already

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.920
uploaded inside your dashboard yesterday itself now what you

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.280
have to do and this task i want you to complete today itself

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:24.900
no procrastination no delay with discipline today itself you

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:30.360
have to complete this particular task that you have to write

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:34.380
something inside your resume maybe as a fresher maybe as a

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.140
working professional but yeah you have to write something

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.180
inside your resume a project basically and then you have to

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.300
prepare an explanation of that particular project and

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.640
believe me this is a strategy which has worked in last like

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.100
a seven to eight year and it is going to work for all of us

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.180
even today right uh this is a new template which i have

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.820
created by the way uh for a dpr i have added a couple of

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.680
more things uh inside this one so detailed project report

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.300
why i'm asking you to create this one so that when you will

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.200
start writing each and everything this is just a template

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.440
right so for example if you will start writing this project

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.100
title then what was your role what was a duration of this

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.380
project what was a team structure with respect to a project

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.780
which i have already discussed inside your batch what was a

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:23.460
technology that you have used basically and a link so maybe

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:27.240
a github link maybe a live demo or anything that you have or

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.660
maybe you are going to prepare impact that this project is

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.700
going to create so each and everything you have to write it

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.880
down at least for three projects so basically this is a

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:42.380
template but you have to create three dpr at minimum a

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:46.260
project which you are going to mention inside your resume so

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.720
this is basically a cover block and then you have to write

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.900
an executive summary of that particular project context and

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:57.100
a business goal what you have built basically what was your

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.700
role sense possibility key technical approach uh impact or

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.240
maybe a key performance indicator which is technically a

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:07.720
kpis which you have created scale and reliability how you

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.440
were able to achieve what was a cost which was involved or

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.320
latency which was involved or delay basically which was

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.500
involved and how you have improved that and what is our next

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:22.540
feature that you or your entire team has planned for a

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:26.000
particular project that you are going to develop maybe in an

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.340
upcoming month or maybe in an upcoming quarter basically

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:33.100
right then uh business contest problem statement and contest

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:36.700
so what was the actual problem in very very detail and what

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:40.300
was the actual objective of that particular project what was

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.280
uh like a constraint that you have faced with respect to

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.300
this particular project means a hurdles basically that you

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.080
have faced with respect to this project uh user and a

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:52.320
stakeholder so who was a primary stakeholder maybe you were

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.880
the primary stakeholder as a manager maybe as a project

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.960
manager or maybe as a director or like uh who was a

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.300
stakeholder if you were working as a developer over there so

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:05.080
each and everything you have to write over there inside this

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.440
particular section and then what was a functional

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:12.420
requirement what was a non-functional requirement what was a

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.900
key performance indicator i have just given couple of things

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:18.180
over here just for your reference what was a compliance and

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:22.160
security that you have handled or you have this what was

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.300
your approach in terms of handling a compliance and security

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.420
for that particular project that you are going to write then

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.400
uh with respect to our data so what was your data source

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.720
maybe one two or maybe 100 how you have handled it what was

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.460
a volume of the data that you were handling what was a

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:40.840
schema or maybe a type of the data maybe a structure maybe

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.240
unstructured so you have to mention about those things in

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.540
very very detail and then obviously what kind of a treatment

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.280
of a data that you have done because obviously you are going

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.820
to work in a gen ai project or in data science project and

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.060
everything starts with the data i believe we have already

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:59.400
talked about it right so what was a data governance that you

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.420
have implemented and then architecture diagram so what was a

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:07.380
solution architecture that you have designed in a group uh

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:11.560
today itself so someone has uh not someone i would say so

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:16.380
let me open it up so asit has basically like a shared one of

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:20.980
his like a linkedin post so where he has based on the

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.640
discussion based on our initial discussion so he has

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.760
designed this entire layer layer by layer layer by layer so

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.880
based on the very first project he has designed it so i want

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.400
you to design this kind of architecture or architecture that

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.300
i have already discussed layer by layer layer by layer layer

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.180
by layer so that you will be able to refer and even you all

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.980
will be able to share with each and everyone so architecture

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:46.260
is very much important that you have to design with respect

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:50.460
to your particular project so starting from a client ui this

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:53.780
is just a example which i have given by the way so

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:56.160
everything is going to start from the client side so

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.540
basically maybe a mobile application maybe a web application

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.720
maybe some sort of interfaces right and then how this entire

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:07.200
project has been built and then why this particular design

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:11.300
why not something else right so because basically there will

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.880
be a lot of alternative for everything you will be able to

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.200
find out now in a market not just one right so even if i

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.360
talk about like a building an api so there are so many

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.400
frameworks right so why you have chosen that framework for

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.060
example if i'm talking about a model itself there are n

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.680
number of models that we can tune that we can develop that

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.900
we can use it for our reg application but why this

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:34.760
particular model why not other because people are going to

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.340
ask you this question yeah people are going to put up this

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:40.240
question in front of you that why this what was a reason

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.400
behind choosing only this one this particular vector

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.400
database this particular framework this particular

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.560
programming languages everything people are going to ask you

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.140
or let's suppose if you are hosting some of the services so

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.880
again for hosting there are multiple platform and in every

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.800
platform there are multiple way to host it right in a

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:01.320
serverless mode or just by using a dedicated server so and

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.520
there are a lot of like a services you all are going to use

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:07.340
so whenever you are trying to design it so why right and

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:10.400
again so you should be aware about two or three alternative

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.860
of each and every component not just like a one single

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:16.420
component because when people will start asking you a

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.440
question you will not be able to answer if you are not aware

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:24.080
about two or three at minimum alternative then uh detailed

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.480
design component then what was the pipeline that you have

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.420
built by the way what was the basic logic that you have

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.960
built and for a serving basically for a hosting so what kind

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.580
of like hosting that you were using how data was uh

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:38.900
transmitting from that one and then implementation timeline

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.360
so i have already created a table a beautiful table for all

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.200
of you so timeline the start and who was the owner and what

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.860
was the key note basically and then experimentation and

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.980
result so whenever you are going to build some model or

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:55.280
maybe any kind of rag pipeline or any kind of agents if you

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.540
are going to use so obviously we always try to evaluate and

00:15:58.540 --> 00:15:59.900
then we are going to evaluate it's not like we will just

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.640
dump it inside the production because it's working for me no

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.960
not like that so what was a matrix b and this matrix

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.380
actually depends upon i've just given you the sample

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:13.840
matrices over here but it actually depends upon the use case

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.360
that you are going to solve so you have to write a matrix

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:21.500
with respect to the particular use cases and then what was a

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:25.200
ops pipeline that you have built because everywhere there

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:30.080
will be an ops ml ops devops but technically it's ops i just

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.440
consider everything as a ops so i don't categorize like

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.380
something as a ml ops or lmops it's just ops because at the

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.160
end of the day almost a similar kind of a pipeline of funnel

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.600
we are going to build and then risk and mitigation so data

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:48.880
drift or maybe a limit of from the vendor so this is a data

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.980
leak and cost spike then alternative consideration so option

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.600
a versus b versus c because whenever we design the

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.340
architecture it's not like we just go we do a lot of

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:02.320
discussion so like i said even above right so for every

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.580
component there should be option a primary option option b

00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:08.660
and option c whatever component that you are going to

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:12.260
include inside your project so for everything you should

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.940
know that what is the alternative if you are not aware about

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.840
it like i said you will not be able to answer majority of

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:23.000
the question and then if you have a demo so try to attach

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.200
those screen sort maybe you can try to attach a screenshot

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.960
which uh i have the project which i have shared with all of

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.880
you uh for that itself it's completely fine just to start

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:35.240
with what was a lesson that you have learned and what was

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:40.240
your next roadmap and then api contract schema infra these

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:45.700
things so these are the things that you have to do it by the

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:50.760
way right and then you have to write the entire story one by

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:56.000
one one by one one by one so this is a dpr and i want you to

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.900
write this story today itself and send it to me send it

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.520
inside the group and as soon as you will start sending those

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.860
things i will start evaluating it and i will start giving

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.640
you a feedback or if some modification is required i'll do

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.300
it from my side or maybe i'll ask you to do it simple as

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:14.120
simple as that but believe me this dpr like i said so it has

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:18.760
worked every time and once you will start writing it right

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:22.040
maybe you can take a help of like a chat gpt yuri whatever

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:26.240
you want that's completely fine but while writing this dpr

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.540
believe me you will be doing a lot of work and you will be

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:28.560
able to write it and you will be able to write it in a lot

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.880
of brainstorming right you will be looking for a lot of

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.800
different different kind of alternative and this is

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.020
something which is required right this is something which is

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:41.440
required and this is going to build a solid story for your

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.540
entire project believe me when you will start writing each

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:48.380
and every line you will get stuck at so many points right

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:52.740
and this is the whole purpose behind creating this dpr so

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:56.340
that you will not get stuck or you should not get stuck when

00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:01.040
you are going for a real time interview making sense to all

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.200
of us guys yes yeah

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.280
in a chat please so

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:14.650
can i expect a dpr 3 dpr from everyone or from most of you

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:17.650
today itself maybe by tonight maybe by late night maybe by

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:21.090
late morning it's completely fine because this is once in a

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:25.010
lifetime and believe me it always worked always means

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:29.110
literally always worked and for we all know right we all

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:31.710
know that whenever we are going for an interview obviously

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:32.570
people are going to be going for an interview and we are

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:32.970
going to be going for an interview and we are going to start

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:37.290
my interview with my work so tell me something about

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:40.150
yourself and then tell me something about your project and

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:43.430
then they will start asking you a cross question based on

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:47.130
the design the diagram the flow the story that you are going

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:51.690
to talk about inside your interview so if you don't want to

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:55.290
get stuck in that interview in that case you have to prepare

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:58.430
this dpr and this is not going to help you out for this

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.910
interview even if you are going to attend an interview after

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:04.690
one year or two year believe me the same dpr is going to

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:09.070
help you out in terms of preparing this end-to-end yes yeah

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:11.530
it should be in an industry domain we are currently working

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:14.870
exactly yeah let's suppose i'm working into a sales i'm

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:17.310
working into a marketing i'm working into a supply chain i'm

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:19.330
working into a finance i'm working into a healthcare

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:22.990
industry right in whatever industry you are working because

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:26.370
obviously uh that that you can't like remove from your

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:28.710
resume right obviously you will go for an interview and

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:32.990
you'll say that that okay my domain was x y g so based on

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:36.670
your domain because see technology is going to be same only

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:40.130
domain is going to change and as per domain your problem

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:43.470
statement is going to change and so the component some of

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:46.370
the component of this technology is going to change so with

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:51.270
respect to your domain right whatever domain you are coming

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:54.130
from so with respect to your domain you can try to write

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:58.390
down this entire project if you are not able to figure out a

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:02.970
domain in that case write a product based dpr product based

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.450
dpr means i was building a product simple so which can serve

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:10.610
maybe a entire like a sales entire sales industry or maybe

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:13.570
entire like a healthcare industry so again domain will come

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:17.870
into a picture but in a product based approach so if you are

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:20.790
working for some sort of a client in that case service based

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:25.890
approach but ultimately you have to write the story yeah so

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:29.350
can i expect again i'm asking question guys i think some of

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:30.410
you are going to be able to answer this question right so

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:33.890
can i expect this dpr by tonight yeah

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:42.310
i have created a small one but not that much good prepare

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:45.130
this one so believe me no one will be able to cross this

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:48.390
line believe me in an interview no one means literally no

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:51.390
one no one will be able to cross this line with respect to

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:55.410
project again with respect to a project if you have this dpr

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:59.250
with you and if you have written this dpr at least once in

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:02.510
your lifetime so i'm expecting three dpr and those three

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:04.950
projects right those three projects you have to mention

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:08.990
inside your resume as simple as that so whatever like for

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:11.690
whatever project you are writing a dpr exactly same project

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:15.310
because everywhere so i have given you a time timeline sheet

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:17.670
as well right that okay when we have started this project

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:20.450
and what when it has ended who was the owner each and

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:23.370
everything so exact same thing you are going to mention

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:27.790
inside your resume as simple as that so let me send this dpr

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:30.110
inside your group yeah

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:39.410
so again i will be uploading this inside our dashboard as

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:40.290
well so once i'm going to upload this dpr i'm going to

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:40.590
upload this dpr as well so once i'm going to upload the

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:42.830
recording but that will take maybe like a couple of hours

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:46.290
because the recording will not be available immediately so

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:49.370
keeping that in mind it's available here inside your group

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:54.250
itself so this is a task number one i want you to do it on

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:59.790
priority zero now second task as i'm going to start with the

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:03.390
interview questions right and i will be taking these

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:06.030
questions and then i will be giving you the answer and

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:08.450
believe me so here the question which i have prepared so

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:12.970
it's not just a an answer the question which i have prepared

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:16.610
again from a business side from architecture side from a

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:20.070
stakeholder side from a team side from everywhere this

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:23.550
question has been prepared plus i have also included lots of

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:26.770
scenario based question as well because many people are

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:28.890
going to ask you they are going to give you a scenario and

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:31.350
they will say that okay how you will design this entire

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:34.250
solution how you will design this entire system so many

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:37.230
people are going to ask you a scenario based question as

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:40.410
well now keeping that in a mind in mind that i have prepared

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:43.550
200 set of the question not 200 actually i have like a

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:48.670
another 10 set so approximately in that set i have 95 96

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:52.610
question around 95 96 question with respect to hr round with

00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:55.570
respect to managerial round and all and some like

00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:59.510
architecture like around as well so before i will start

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:04.270
giving an answer and you will just like a watch me giving an

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:08.590
answer because many of you may have like a forgotten this

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:13.450
some of this small small things uh where like uh you you

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:16.450
have to like go for the revision so before i will start

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:22.530
ahead with this answer right you have to prepare your own

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:26.370
version take a help from any ai system i don't care that's

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:30.150
completely fine with me uh but yeah so you have to prepare

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:35.330
your own version first you have to go through one by one

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:39.010
each and every question first and then when i'm going to

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:42.170
give you an answer obviously you will be able to ask me a

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:45.450
cross question this is what i want right because if i'll

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:49.410
start answering or all of these questions directly maybe you

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:51.950
will not be able to ask me a cross questions because many

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:54.550
concepts maybe you are not aware about or maybe you have

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:57.810
forgotten which is pretty much important for a revision and

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:03.110
again for any position believe me starting from a junior

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:06.770
label till a senior label or architect i would say no one

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:10.310
will be able to cross this line again with respect to a

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:13.790
interview question this is more than enough so interview

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:17.750
questions plus dpr these two combos are more than enough to

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:23.610
crack any interview in any company for any label so here

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:27.430
from tomorrow onwards so i have given you 200 question and

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:30.730
you will be having around uh five days i would say wednesday

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:33.130
thursday friday saturday and sunday so in total you will be

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:37.510
having five days so maybe every day just try to prepare 40

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:41.470
question to 50 question yeah take a help of ai and again dig

00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:44.830
deeper why this why not this one in in that way right so

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:48.670
just try to prepare your answer i'm not looking for uh your

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:51.590
solution by the way i have my own solution i have my own

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:55.670
version of this entire like answers of this entire questions

00:25:55.670 --> 00:26:00.230
so but yeah i just want you to do a revision first so that

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:02.690
whenever i will start discussing whenever i'll start giving

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:05.990
your answer you will be able to understand and you all will

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:09.250
be able to ask me a cross question back to back making sense

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:10.390
i'm

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:14.470
not having such project experience suggest me how i can

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:17.370
write a dpr so my uh i have already discussed a project

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:19.190
that's the reason so first of all i have i have discussed

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:21.970
the project and then i'm asking you to write a dpr i'm not

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:24.730
asking you to write a dpr straight away yeah so i have

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:28.010
already discussed three projects basically uh team structure

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:31.690
architecture components even cost i have discussed right

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:35.530
even pros and cons i have discussed over there so based on

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:40.590
that i'm asking you to write a dpr yes yeah so

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:47.570
with a 20-year experience obviously you will be going ahead

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:50.530
with the stakeholder stakeholder can be an architect

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:53.650
stakeholder can be a director the stakeholder can be a

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:57.470
manager yes oh that i can do exactly this is what i want

00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:59.950
guys that's the reason so first i have discussed i have not

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:02.670
asked you to write a dpr on day zero because i know we all

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:06.030
will go blank if i'm going to ask you to write a dpr so

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:09.610
whatever project that i have discussed just try to write it

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:13.610
down whatever domain you are working or you have already

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:16.630
worked recently right so maybe you have worked in a couple

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:19.670
of domain that's completely fine but let's go ahead with the

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:22.670
recent domain because your knowledge will be fresh with

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:26.250
respect to that recent domain and based on that write a dpr

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:30.350
send me inside a group let's have a discussion right for

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:34.730
this entire week and then i'll be talking about couple of

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:37.350
dprs so those who are going to write it down in a beautiful

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:41.490
manner i'll be talking about that yes making sense to all of

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:44.650
us are we going to complete this task guys so dpr today

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:50.090
again i wanted to do it today no delays and then from

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:53.090
tomorrow onwards 40 question 40 question 40 question 40

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:57.110
question so that on monday and tuesday so we can start

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:00.090
talking about these questions maybe i will be able to cover

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:03.890
40 50 questions because on an average one question is going

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:07.370
to take uh two to three minute of time right even in an

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:09.150
interview so people are going to give you two to three

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:11.850
minute of time to give an answer not more than that so i

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:15.270
will try to follow the exact same same fashion so one by one

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:17.590
one by one i'll pick the question i'll give the answer right

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:21.030
so i believe approximately in two hour which is like a 120

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:25.110
minute i will be able to discuss 40 to 45 questions so it is

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:29.330
going to take approximately four to five uh like a days for

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:34.530
me but before that you all will be ready if you don't have

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:37.730
any project experience in generative how to write a dpr in

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:40.610
that case that's the reason so i have discussed the project

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:44.730
right use the project which i have discussed and write a dpr

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:49.170
at least a start see this is where many of us like you know

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:53.010
uh get stuck so we don't start at least start do it wrong

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:55.110
it's completely fine no one is asking you to write it

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:57.210
perfectly it's completely fine that's the reason i'm here

00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:00.210
right so i'm going to vet it i'm going to validate each and

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:03.690

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:08.870
discuss with me that whether it's a right or whether it's a

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:12.210
wrong yeah do it wrong but do it right so i have discussed

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:15.030

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:24.230
interview and this is also going to help you out to align

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:28.270
your resume because that will be the entry point unless and

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:32.250
until your resume is not perfect system is not going to

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:35.750
select your resume and nowadays no human being is going to

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:38.570
select a resume it's a system right it's an applicant

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:42.070
tracking system which is going to parse your entire resume

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:47.410
so that is an entry point and you should be very much sure

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:51.490

not getting in the WhatsApp group, I mean like it is already

00:31:54.100 --> 00:32:01.660
available, let me show, so it is like here you have to go,

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:08.090
generative air interview right, this one, so inside your

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:14.150
dashboard, yes, introduction right, this is the chat

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:17.210
.whatsapp.com, I think you all are able to see it, click and

00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:20.870
then you will be able to get into a group immediately, yes,

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:26.350
it is already available, yes, Sumit go ahead. Hello sir,

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:29.010
just a quick question sir, just like as per the experience,

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:33.230
like what all we need to consider in a technological stack

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:35.890
to mention, it is like I have around 12 years of experience

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:39.830
in another domain, now we are switching, and like pressure

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:44.290
for the journey I think, so what point we have to consider

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:47.330
in our technology stacks and other things, so that, because

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:51.570
it will be depend upon. As per experience, it should be more

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:55.750
knowledge, but my experience is not relevant, so in that

00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:58.950
case how should we do it, so basically see the DPR that I

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:01.770
have given you, so it is basically a generic DPR template,

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:04.630
so where I am not considering any kind of experience, even

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:06.510
if you are fresher or even if you are like experienced

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:09.190
person, you have to write end to end, end to end means

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:10.890
literally end to end, you have to explore and you have to

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:13.510
write down each and everything. Now, so even if you have a

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:15.910
12 years of experience, this DPR is going to work and if you

00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:19.390
are a fresher. So, obviously, this DPR will be too much for

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:22.710
you, too much means like many things that you are not going

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:26.610
to do it, but still I want you to explore at least, yeah,

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:32.540
okay, start

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:38.320
writing it, first of all, start writing it, because I know

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:41.880
like many of you are like will get stuck in between and you

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:44.420
will not be able to get the answer and this is the point

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:48.000
where like you will be able to get some sort of idea that

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.320
okay, I think I should ask this question, right. So, start

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:58.710
doing it first. Yeah, sorry, go ahead, please. Yes, sir,

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:03.470
good evening. Sir, am I audible now? Yeah, you are audible.

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:09.270
Sir, I was saying that you did your homework and whatever

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:13.170
you prepared from yourself, it was a great experience. Sir,

00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:15.310
I think your voice is getting cut in between. Speak a little

00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:20.830
louder or like it is not clear. Actually, sir, this is the

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:22.810
problem. Now, I am going to ask you. Yes, sir, is it alright

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:27.090
now? It is a little bit alright but then your voice is

00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:30.070
getting cracked in between. I am disconnecting the phone.

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:38.770
Sir, is it alright now? Yes, it is perfect now. Sir, I am

00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:43.110
saying that you have told the experience and I have done it

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:47.050
also and anyhow, there is a lot of difficulty in this. I am

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:50.790
saying that if there are some companies like BGV, if our

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:55.450
interviews went well, we will give some tasks, some things

00:34:55.450 --> 00:34:56.410
like this, then we will talk to you. round wise round wise

00:34:56.410 --> 00:35:00.190
so that too went well but in the last round when they do BGB

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:04.870
background application there will be chances that if

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:10.270
relevant experience no in BGB only your employment check is

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:12.370
done with the previous company because BGB does not directly

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:16.010
do the company it is a third party vendor like I have a lot

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:19.470
of BGB till now right and even current employees also have

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:23.170
BGB so there the question that is asked the third party

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:27.250
company only asks 3-4 lines of question that this person was

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:31.510
working from this day to this day or not so this much BGB is

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:34.470
asked that much verification is done plus if you have some

00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:38.610
added feedback then you tell ok so don't worry about these

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:41.250
things in which project you were working in which technology

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:45.870
you were working basically in which team you were working

00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:49.610
all this is not disclosed anywhere in BGB and neither the

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:54.390
question is asked and start up is not done no start up I

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:56.910
have accepted it means the well-established start-up does it

00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:00.090
apart from that like because BGB is also money right for

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:03.250
each person and like because this is third-party

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:05.870
verification in third-party verification obviously company

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:08.670
has to onboard them and they have to pay them based on like

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:14.390
per verification but if any company is doing BGB then there

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:18.210
ever your tech stack about your team about your client about

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:22.350
your project never discloses just this much is asked that

00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:25.790
this person was working in this company or not it was not

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:30.310
like he left and ran or absconded just this much is asked

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:32.850
there are no questions apart from this so don't worry year

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:37.710
of experience and all relevant suppose we applied somewhere

00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:41.830
four years experience or five years experience is asked so

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:45.650
is there anything related to this no no no nothing there is

00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:49.450
no technology verification believe me that you your total

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:52.410
industry experience is counted so let's suppose you have

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:55.250
worked in four companies right so that four companies will

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:58.370
go to BGV basically and many companies do this that only the

00:36:58.370 --> 00:37:01.630
previous company get verification with them because if four

00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:04.950
are doing then there also it takes into four cost right so

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:07.970
in that case only your previous company will get

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:11.530
verification and if four are also happening if you have

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:14.550
worked then only you will write there but yes what work is

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:20.610
done that is never disclosed never thank you sir yes yeah so

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:23.810
I am saying just companies share a checklist duration pay

00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:27.490
slip issue document that's it yes exactly yeah so no one is

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:29.990
going to talk about your project your clients your like a

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:32.970
technology stack let's suppose you have been working into

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:36.830
maybe sales right and then you are applying for a machine

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:39.930
learning engineer so no one is going to ask you like what

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:43.310
was like a profile that you had sir that too depends

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:50.350
interview exactly BGV is just a formality that is management

00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:51.170
type formality

00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:57.890
that's just a procedure that every company try to follow

00:37:57.890 --> 00:38:00.490
that if we are onboard someone then that person should not

00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:06.670
be left and run away or he did wrong company or he blew the

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:11.490
code base and left so if you haven't all this then in that

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:17.010
case I don't think you should be worried about these things

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:23.530
sir this is another case if I did small startup and if I

00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:30.010
show it like this that if do founder obviously if I founder

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:34.610
then obviously it won't a good impact no no it does actually

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:38.330
it does a lot of companies a lot of teams founders because

00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:43.750
startup it's not like every startup is going to be

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:48.630
successful right its ratio is 99 to 1 all the time I will

00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:51.930
not even say 99 to 1 it's like out of 1000 100 startup

00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:56.310
that's the ratio so and we all are aware about it but yeah

00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:59.770
so if you have done a startup if you were a founder if you

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:02.630
have worked for your startup maybe like for 1 year 6 month

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:06.050
or whatever right so basically people will try to consider

00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:12.010
as a positive point that there was that did startup right he

00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:17.230
tried something so obviously a person who is only doing a

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:22.490
and a person who did a startup so obviously the person did a

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:26.990
startup will have a lot of knowledge so many teams have

00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:29.250
managers they

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:39.230
always appreciate it basically if you ask about obviously it

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:44.770
is not related to so how can you introduce AI you will

00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:51.550
introduce AI AI you, you can introduce agriculture what was

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:57.010
the problem sir actually he used to work in TCS his

00:39:57.010 --> 00:40:02.810
experience was 15 years to 20 years so I discussed with him

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:07.570
he said do this show startup that

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:20.490
you mentioned it proudly if you were the founder it's fine

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:23.830
what's wrong in that what's wrong in trying what's wrong in

00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:33.650
that in that BGV like BGV then come to you verify it yes

00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:39.130
simple yes and many companies will appreciate it like

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:42.010
believe me many teams are going to appreciate it yes sir yes

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:46.330
sir PK is saying trust yourself last 20 years I did it

00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:51.190
several times yes obviously we all did it right PF and bank

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:53.710
statement yeah maybe they are going to ask you for the last

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:58.510
three months of salary slip sometime right sometime they are

00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:02.250
going to ask you and maybe like a bank statement that salary

00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:07.730
slip and bank statement match or not yes sir my side is over

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:11.290
you can come okay yeah Ranjit sir I think you have a

00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:18.130
question please yeah actually I hmm in my case for example

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:26.410
for example I for the for about two years okay I am I was

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:29.450
out of work okay let us say because I was retired or

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:34.810
whatever and I opened my own start startup company and so

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:39.450
that means I can put all my experience into that anyhow you

00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:44.930
are not going to apply for the job right? well believe me I

00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:49.490
will okay okay so in that case yes like see like any anyone

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:52.990
is going to onboard you as a mentor by the way right anyhow

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:55.370
your position will be very very different your position is

00:41:55.370 --> 00:42:00.330
not going to be like a regular one basically so yeah like

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:03.930
you can so sir like I will suggest you if you are literally

00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:07.670
willing to work so maybe try to like you know represent

00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:12.570
yourself as a guide as a mentor in that manner so that you

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:15.830
know company will be able to like onboard you as in that way

00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:19.110
basically because many company does that yeah many company

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:21.290
does that actually especially if I talk about the startups

00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:23.990
right because startups majority of the founders will be like

00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:27.030
you know they will be having a very less experience in terms

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:29.350
of market in terms of technology in terms of client even

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:33.770
right obviously they are going to consider you as a like a

00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:37.990
reference who can come and fill in fill in those gaps so

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:42.510
basically as a as a consultant so that as an advisor to a

00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:46.470
company exactly as an advisor as a mentor yes and almost

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:49.530
almost every every startup like you know onboard some of the

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:55.330
mentors yeah yeah I mean that's what I I intend most of the

00:42:55.330 --> 00:43:00.270
time when I talk to the company I talk as an advisor yeah

00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:07.250
exactly and now the I used to lead TCS teams okay but that

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:13.150
was about maybe more than 10 11 years ago 2015 yeah means 10

00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:20.630
years ago so but then I left TCS because TCS was not obeying

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:26.690
the law of the land basically United States okay so so then

00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:31.090
but I have been getting lots of calls from TCS okay to lead

00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:31.990
their projects okay

00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:38.010
so as far as for them and it is their I believe rule that

00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:42.190
they don't hire people who worked for them before so do you

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:45.570
think I think I think that rule as far as I know because I

00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:48.290
am aware about these kind of rules so as far as I know I

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:50.310
think it will be applicable just for a couple of years if

00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:52.530
it's been 10 years more than one ticket I don't think that's

00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:57.190
it will be applicable even legally Really? Yeah. Generally

00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:59.150
this is what happens because everything comes with the

00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:01.490
tenure, right? Everything comes with the expiry date, even

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:04.270
these rules. And I think I'm well aware about these rules,

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:07.170
right? So maybe you can check that with the, like a

00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:09.550
compliance team or maybe with the legal or HR team, right?

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:13.270
Whoever will answer, but yeah, I think like after a couple

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:15.630
of years and max to max for three to five years, they try to

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:20.130
put up some sort of, you know, these kinds of regulations. I

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:24.390
mean, it's, it's interesting with this TCS, what happened

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:29.230
was like, I had a call from the government of the United

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:34.710
States for this, for my green card, from green card. Yes.

00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:38.330
Yeah. Yeah. For the green card. But this TCS will not issue

00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:43.030
the job letter. Did they say we can, we can issue the job

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:45.490
letter, we are working, but we will not write the salary.

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:51.950
Okay. Okay. And the government needed this salary, okay,

00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:55.670
that how much they are paying me, but they, but they

00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:59.030
refused. They said, no, we will not write the salary. But

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:04.410
then they, then I involved the vice-president of a bank

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:11.750
where I was working for them. And TCS did one month for me,

00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:15.510
basically I went back and forth with their lawyers. But then

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:17.670
when I complained to the bank where I was working for them,

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:17.970
they said, no, we just going to hire so many lawyers. And

00:45:17.970 --> 00:45:17.970
then I ended up leaving the company because your bank

00:45:17.970 --> 00:45:21.290
manager is leading them and, and the bank VP said, okay,

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:24.870
give me five minutes. Hmm. And, and, and it gets about

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:30.270
within one hour, I got the job letter from from TCS because

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:33.150
he called both of my boss of my boss of our boss basically

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:41.050
said that, yeah, I mean, and then when they go the letter, I

00:45:41.050 --> 00:45:45.630
left the company the next day because they didn't follow the

00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:48.970
law of the land. That was very trusting. yeah that happens

00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:53.010
this kind of happens all the time in a company yeah but I

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:57.530
love your projects the way you teach and I would provide the

00:45:57.530 --> 00:46:00.810
information also just believe me if anyone is going to

00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:03.330
follow whatever task which I am giving and whatever I am

00:46:03.330 --> 00:46:06.590
teaching right no one can stop you from any job role and if

00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:08.770
you are not doing it then obviously no one can help you at

00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:13.650
the same point of time so actually I will be looking for

00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:18.030
what not basically money main thing it is more for to keep

00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:23.870
myself busy and active so that's very important then there

00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:30.030
are many companies who can onboard you yeah and because I

00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:36.050
write programs on daily basis believe me I write lots of

00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:43.490
code myself also and I am all the time working on my so many

00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:47.330
different projects that I have I have got so many ideas and

00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:54.570
I want work on one believe me one is going to work it's more

00:46:54.570 --> 00:47:00.830
than enough yeah so question from thank you sir I am very

00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:05.770
much confused I should be targeting I worked on more than so

00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:10.590
PK if you can I think you are on like unmute by the way yeah

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:13.950
we can talk so basically see you have worked in 15

00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:16.590
technology or 20 technology don't try to mention remove each

00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:18.890
and everything because obviously if you have like a 20 year

00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:21.310
of experience so you must have worked in a very very old one

00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:26.390
legacy and then must be to our latest one and it sometime we

00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:30.130
feel proud right that mention everything but the ATS system

00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:32.490
which is going to select your resume or the person who will

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:35.430
be looking into your resume they will get confused they are

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:38.130
looking for something which is relevant to their job

00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:40.750
description right because they are there trying to fill up

00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:45.070
that particular position so my sincere advice to everyone

00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:48.310
that it's completely fine you have worked into XYG you know

00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:51.310
hundreds of technology that's completely fine right but from

00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:56.370
an interview perspective try to confuse your interviewer or

00:47:56.370 --> 00:48:00.590
your HR as less as possible because if you are going to

00:48:00.590 --> 00:48:03.050
mention more it simply means that that you are confusing

00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:07.950
more and especially you are confusing more to an ATS system

00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:11.090
right there is a very high chance that no human will look

00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:13.490
into your resume for the very first time it's a system which

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:15.490
will look into the resume and if system is not there then

00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:15.510
you are not going to be able to do anything and if the

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:18.130
system is looking into the resume it is not going to accept

00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:21.190
it by the way it is not going to appreciate those like a

00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:25.110
legacy technologies so just a sincere advice PK ji for you

00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:29.190
right so that you know remove everything just mention our

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:31.490
latest 3 to 4 and say that okay fine I have 20 years of

00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:37.750
experience crisp precise sort sir should I put 20 or 10 no

00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:41.250
no no you put 20 see if you have 20 years of experience then

00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:44.070
obviously put 20 okay there should not be any shortcoming in

00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:45.490
that it should also be a full double suck but that doesn't

00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:49.210
mean write a full project of 20 years you should not have a

00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:52.170
resume of 20 pages and it should not be about 4-5 pages make

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:55.070
it crisp look I have 20 years of experience that is

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:59.150
completely fine in a recent like last 3 to 4 year I have

00:48:59.150 --> 00:49:02.130
been walking into this like cutting edge technology and I am

00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:04.430
eligible for this position you have to prove only this much

00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:09.170
in your resume TechStack are you going to forward any of

00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:13.850
those it should be completely latest Data science AI ML NLP

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:15.770
games and graphics analysisrée data revision, generative AI

00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:18.610
and all the tech stack that comes in it, some tech stack

00:49:18.610 --> 00:49:21.110
from a database side, some tech stack from a cloud side you

00:49:21.110 --> 00:49:23.810
have to mention, some tech stack from an agent side you have

00:49:23.810 --> 00:49:26.030
to mention, some tech stack from a vector side you have to

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:28.470
mention, some tech stack you have to mention from an LLM

00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:33.470
side and a models. That's it. And the last tech stack, the

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:35.430
last 10 years one, you don't have to put that. Absolutely.

00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:39.030
If it is not relevant or legacy, you don't have to put that

00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:45.990
at all because the system will stop your resume. Okay. Yeah.

00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:50.990
Makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. So Jatin is saying I'm having 10

00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:52.790
years experience. I was able to make a transition four years

00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:54.490
back in data science because of Ironman. Okay. That's

00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:56.590
amazing. Yeah. I know you Jatin by the way. Yeah. I think we

00:49:56.590 --> 00:49:59.050
are connected. How should I make my resume? First six years

00:49:59.050 --> 00:50:03.550
was Informatics developer. So when Jatin, when you are

00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:05.630
trying to make a resume now, right with the 10 years of

00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:09.370
experience. So in that case, try to convert four to five

00:50:09.370 --> 00:50:11.150
years of experience. You already have a data science

00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:13.750
experience. Right. So again, data, generative AI is nothing.

00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:16.370
So basically it's just an addition on top of it. So just try

00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:18.830
to showcase that since last like a one, one and a half year.

00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:21.130
So I've been working into Gen AI based project and

00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:23.250
technically in a data science, you have been working into

00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:26.370
data science. I think it will be very much easy for you. And

00:50:26.370 --> 00:50:30.750
it is just a, you know, uh, again, same thing you have to do

00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:35.070
that you have done like four years back. Yeah. Senior, mid

00:50:35.070 --> 00:50:37.510
-senior, principal. PK ji aapke liye toh principal hi hoga.

00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:47.290
I mean senior hoga aapke liye. Okay. Thank you. Okay. So if

00:50:47.290 --> 00:50:50.270
there is no question for me today, so I will be waiting

00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:56.590
inside a group and guys on a very, very serious note, do

00:50:56.590 --> 00:51:00.990
this, right? If you are serious about a next switch, it

00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:03.210
doesn't matter. Maybe you are, you are trying to do a switch

00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:05.790
maybe after six months. It's okay. Right. It's completely

00:51:05.790 --> 00:51:11.030
fine. But do these things now because many of us just keep

00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:13.590
on doing a procrastination. I'll do it tomorrow. I'll do it

00:51:13.590 --> 00:51:15.290
tomorrow. I'll do it tomorrow. And believe me, there is no

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:18.970
tomorrow. Everything is today. Right. So do it. And then

00:51:18.970 --> 00:51:24.990
like, uh, send it to me. I will be able to verify if you are

00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:27.610
not sending. So obviously you will not be able to get a

00:51:27.610 --> 00:51:30.590
feedback from my side. So obviously you will not be able to

00:51:30.590 --> 00:51:34.530
make any kind of a connection. Yeah. I think solves iconic.

00:51:36.610 --> 00:51:41.730
Go ahead with the question. Yeah. So my question is that I

00:51:41.730 --> 00:51:47.210
read. I recently joined a company. So where I, I have been

00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:50.630
joined as software developer. So the tech stack is.net and

00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:55.730
the backend is C-sharp with the SQL server. So I'm very much

00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:59.190
confused between C-sharp and Python, like where to start

00:51:59.190 --> 00:52:02.410
with. And because I'm very much interested on the JNI side

00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:06.810
rather than on C-sharp. And even like a majority of

00:52:06.810 --> 00:52:09.690
companies will be looking for a Python in some of the JD,

00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:12.010
you will be able to see that there is a, you know,

00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:14.890
programmatically. You can try to mention C-sharp or you can

00:52:14.890 --> 00:52:17.670
try to mention other framework, but yeah, majority will be

00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:19.910
interested in a Python. So you are aware about Python or

00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:25.210
you're completely like a blank about Python. I'm aware about

00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:28.390
the Python. Like I'm clear with the fundamentals. Then,

00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:30.930
then, then go ahead with it. But yeah, please try to mention

00:52:30.930 --> 00:52:35.190
Python. No other like, uh, programming languages. But C

00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:38.410
-sharp is very new to me and my day to day work involves C

00:52:38.410 --> 00:52:42.070
-sharp. So how can I switch in between C-sharp and Python on

00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:45.430
my day to day? Like I want to enhance my Python skills very

00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:49.830
much in depth so that I can build Work on three to four

00:52:49.830 --> 00:52:53.030
project. Python will be done because again, Python is one of

00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:55.190
the easiest language. Easier than C-sharp I would say.

00:52:55.290 --> 00:52:58.110
Right. Very much easier than I think you are already aware

00:52:58.110 --> 00:53:01.130
about. Right. So just start working on three to four

00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:03.810
projects. But yeah, first of all, complete this DPR. For

00:53:03.810 --> 00:53:05.330
that, you don't have to write the code. You have to write

00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:10.510
some lines. Yeah. I think that will be the starting point.

00:53:11.550 --> 00:53:15.710
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So yeah. Yeah. Nagendra, go ahead.

00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:25.680
Yeah, I should, I should. Yeah. I, I, I, uh, yeah, go ahead

00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:25.900
please.

00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:36.580
Uh, sorry, Nagendra, I think. Yeah, uh, actually, uh, I'm

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:40.460
from the business and list background. Um, I do know Python.

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:45.960
Um, I'm working on the XL report from the, um, and much not,

00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:50.520
not ever. I do know Python and from the statistics

00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:57.080
background, I have joined this Generate AI program and

00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:01.240
looking into these videos, how can I transform this into

00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:07.840
Generate AI, even I have placed my resume into the Nauka

00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:13.360
reporter and I'm not getting calls, even my current

00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:17.620
organization's notice period is three months, so due to

00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:21.180
that, might be that one of the reason I am unable to get the

00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:24.820
calls. Yeah, yeah, yeah, there is a huge possibility, so

00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:26.880
because you have recently joined a previous organization,

00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:29.820
right, so maybe system and again, there is a possibility

00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:33.400
that your resume is not aligned, so first of all, like write

00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:37.160
this one, yeah, work on this task, then let's talk about the

00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:42.340
next, yeah, one thing at a time, fine, just do it and again,

00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:45.100
if you have a question that what I will write. Write the

00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:50.140
exact same thing which I have discussed, simple, for now,

00:54:50.260 --> 00:55:05.120
yeah, okay, yeah, Mithun please go ahead. Yeah, I think your

00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:08.940
voice is not audible properly, maybe you can check your mic.

00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:16.600
Yeah, better, little better. Yeah, okay, so basically, I'm

00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:19.880
having four years of experience, so previously I was working

00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:23.060
on the computer vision field, so in the last two years, I'm

00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:26.240
not working due to some issue, I have to take the career

00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:30.000
break, how can I justify that one, and recently I've started

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.720
the generative AI. Okay, okay. Yeah, that's my question.

00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:37.180
Sorry, can you repeat it once again? Yeah, so how can I

00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:41.000
justify my two years of gap, and recently I've started the

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.120
generative AI. So I'm looking for a transition from the

00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:46.700
computer vision to generative AI. That's okay, computer

00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:48.340
vision and generative AI is not a big deal, it's not a

00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:51.440
transition, it's a next step. So anyone who is working into

00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:53.320
any of these fields like machine learning, deep learning,

00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:56.420
computer vision, NLP, generative AI is not a transition

00:55:56.420 --> 00:56:00.920
basically, it's just like going for like a next job, that's

00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:03.960
it. It's going to be like a normal job switch, this is how

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:07.300
people are going to see it. Okay, so basically, how can I

00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:10.920
justify the two year gap, or career gap? Two year of career

00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:13.880
gap you had? So like, you have a recent gap or you have a

00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:17.180
gap before joining this current company? No, actually not

00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:21.340
working anywhere right now. Okay since last two year? Yeah,

00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:23.660
since last two year. So you must be involved into something,

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:30.620
right? Not technically as involved, mostly ideal. Okay,

00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:32.900
okay, then it will be difficult.

00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:40.720
Okay, any suggestion from your side? Suggestion wise, you

00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:43.180
have to manage this two year because it will be tough for

00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:46.740
you. To you know, explain somehow you have to like, you

00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:51.140
know, you have to build a story, maybe you are not well,

00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:55.580
maybe you are taking care of maybe your like, parental

00:56:55.580 --> 00:57:02.440
things, or maybe like, as you are very young, so something,

00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:04.540
something like that you have to mention otherwise, like

00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:09.820
people, people will like, not allow you to join the company.

00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:17.480
So Okay. Okay. So, Go for the startups, right? Startups and

00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:19.380
say that, okay, fine. So I was working into my some of my

00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:21.680
personal product, the other part of which I was trying, it

00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:24.740
has not worked. And I tried a lot, I was able to get a

00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:27.020
couple of customers. And all those things I was doing a

00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:29.100
freelancing, freelancing is one of the best justification

00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:32.800
that you can do. Even I'm going to say for the freelancing,

00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:35.220
will they ask for the projects and the clients? No, no, no.

00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:38.260
So because in case of freelancing, they can't do a BGV, they

00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:42.740
can't do the verification. No one does that. Okay, great.

00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:44.660
So, I understand. So I had experience with the freelancing,

00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:46.940
one project I've done with the freelancing, so I can mention

00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:49.660
that one. Exactly. Yeah. So just try to mention that because

00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:52.360
there won't be any kind of a BGV for freelancing. Plus, you

00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:54.900
can say that, okay, I was working into some of my, I was

00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:57.540
trying simple, say that I was trying to build some of my

00:57:57.540 --> 00:57:59.800
product, I was working day and night for that. And

00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:03.960
parallelly, so I had some sort of a concern at my home, with

00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:07.360
respect to my parents, because my parents are old, and they

00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:10.380
need my attention. See at the end of the day, it's just a

00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:13.640
story, which you're going to sell, right? So try to like,

00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:16.340
you know, frame the story that, okay, my parents were old,

00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:20.840
and I had to take care of them, and they were going through

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:23.860
some bad phases. So I was with them, and parallelly, I was

00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:27.080
trying to build my own startup, where I have done my time

00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:29.540
and money investment, everything, plus I have even done a

00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:32.120
freelancing. So in that bit, two year gap, you will be able

00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:37.160
to fill, but that story should look genuine. Genuine. So

00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:40.940
yeah, so just just try to, you know, re-iterate or rehearse

00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:42.760
those, that story again, because, again and again and again,

00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:46.940
at least like 10 times, before going for an interview. Yeah,

00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:52.000
got it. Thank you. Yeah. Sir ke paas har marji ki dava hai,

00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:55.300
storytelling top notch. Story kahaan hi bichti hai, duniya

00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:57.640
mein. You are going to sell the story, right? Interview is

00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:00.640
all about selling a story, selling yourself, right? So

00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:02.940
basically, everyone is supposed to be a salesman at the end

00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:05.420
of the day. And whenever you go and give an interview, you

00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:08.100
sell, right? Whenever I'm coming inside the class, I'm

00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:10.720
talking about topic, I used to sell my classes. Whenever I

00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:14.640
go for an investment, right? Whenever I'm raising a fund, I

00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:17.540
used to sell the story of my company, right? We all sell

00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:20.460
actually, we all sell. So technically, we all are salesmen,

00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:22.560
doesn't matter in which domain you are working, by the way.

00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:29.760
Right? Just if I say that I was making more money than full

00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:32.860
time job in a freelancing, so never felt working in the, and

00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:36.180
PK, if someone is going to give this answer, right? Your HR

00:59:36.180 --> 00:59:38.680
or anyone who is like, or your interview will feel offended,

00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:42.000
they will never hire you. So don't try to offend them.

00:59:44.790 --> 00:59:50.030
Okay. Yeah. Okay, fine, guys. So I'll be just waiting for

00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:52.990
you to write a DPR, start working on that on a serious note.

00:59:53.090 --> 00:59:55.370
And it's just once in a lifetime that you have to do right

00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:57.950
so that you can chillax for next couple of years. With that,

00:59:57.970 --> 01:00:00.290
thank you so much, everyone. Take care and see you again

01:00:00.290 --> 01:00:05.270
next Monday. But I have given you a task before coming to my

01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:09.030
class, look into each and every question which I have shared

01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:13.450
a 200 question, right? I have shared. Revise it. Come to the

01:00:13.450 --> 01:00:15.950
class. And then come back. And then discuss it with me when

01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:18.310
I'm going to give an answer for that particular question.

01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:22.330
Ask me a cross question as much as you can. I'm leaving it

01:00:22.330 --> 01:00:25.870
up to you, right? So you will be able to ask more question

01:00:25.870 --> 01:00:28.870
if you have done if you have done your homework. And if you

01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:30.950
have, if you're not going to do your homework, then

01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:32.850
obviously you will not be able to ask me a cross question,

01:00:32.970 --> 01:00:36.350
right? So be ready for like a cross question and then be

01:00:36.350 --> 01:00:38.650
ready for my answer with that thing. So how to handle career

01:00:38.650 --> 01:00:41.310
transition, but working with the ML for last two years. So

01:00:41.310 --> 01:00:43.470
those who are working into machine learning, deep learning,

01:00:43.550 --> 01:00:46.470
computer vision, all those things. You are technically not

01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:50.350
doing a transition. You are just switching a job. It's not

01:00:50.350 --> 01:00:53.330
called as transition, by the way. Yeah. So don't worry. You

01:00:53.330 --> 01:00:56.910
don't have to build some separate story. Sell the same story

01:00:56.910 --> 01:01:01.310
that the story that you are leaving as of now. Yeah. Fine.

01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:03.810
With that, thank you so much. If you have any kind of

01:01:03.810 --> 01:01:07.790
questions which needs my attention, put it inside the group.

01:01:07.890 --> 01:01:10.490
Yeah. Put it inside the group. Tag me. I'll try my best to

01:01:10.490 --> 01:01:13.210
give an answer inside the group itself. So thank you so

01:01:13.210 --> 01:01:15.410
much, everyone. Take care. Bye. See you again next Monday.
