WEBVTT

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.070
okay so hi everyone i think i'm audible and visible to all

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.090
of you so please bring my chat if i'm audible and visible

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.490
and then we are going to start our discussion so basically

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.030
we have discussed till 95th number question i believe and

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.270
today i'll start giving an answer from 96th number question

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.910
my version of answer obviously and i'm assuming that you all

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.270
are preparing your version of your answer so you are like

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.010
taking a help of maybe an ai gpt or maybe a yuri and then

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.410
you are preparing your own answer but yeah so i'll discuss

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.730
about mine so fine let's start let's start with the

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.030
discussion someone

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.180
is pinging in a group i don't get a link of interview

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.240
bootcamp it's in a dashboard by the way so okay

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.120
so let me share my screen and

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.470
let's start talking about a generative vi interview question

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:14.850
and its answer so yesterday in my previous discussion so i

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.970
discussed till this particular point 95th number question

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.350
now let's start talking about a question from here so one by

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.250
one basically i will try to give an answer from my side and

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.290
if you have any kind of a question from your side so yeah

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.110
feel free to ask those question in a chat chat is already

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.030
open for all of us so here a question says that that how do

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.030
you answer a question from your side so yeah feel free to

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.630
ask those question in a chat how do you implement a multi

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.750
-agent system with a generative ai now so whenever someone

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.070
is asking uh like this kind of a question that how do you

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.850
implement a multi-end system with the generative ai so

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.490
obviously i have to give a use cases that okay i was like

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.030
trying to solve this particular problem or that particular

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.170
problem and this is a place where i have used a multi-agent

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.910
and let's suppose if i have not used a multi-agent in any

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.070
places so in that case maybe i can just give a theory or a i

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.290
can talk about the story or analogy around it that okay so

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.910
this is how we can try to build a multi-agent system now

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.830
first of all what is a multi-agent system i believe we have

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.450
already seen that in our live classes as well for a

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.190
generative certification uh this week so we discussed about

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.910
a crew ai right and we were trying to solve a resume ats

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.910
resume problem inside our class we have built a small

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.670
application so where it will be able to take a resume as an

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.090
input it will be able to take a job description as an input

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.010
and a job title as an input and then it will try to parse

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.530
your entire resume it will try to spot all the main points

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.470
so whether it's your like a email id or maybe a linkedin id

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.630
maybe a github id or maybe about the project duration of the

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.530
project your skill set everything it will try to spot one by

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.990
one one by one as per the instruction which i have given to

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:00.770
my llm and then it will try to rephrase or rewrite the

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:05.250
entire resume as per the job description so basically it's

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.970
kind of a reverse ordering or reverse engineering that we

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.530
were trying to do that okay take my resume align it with the

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.290
job description and then it was giving me a tuned final

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:18.950
version of my resume content apart from that so it was also

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:24.250
trying to give me basically my i would say a a ATS score

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:28.250
right ATS score so in a real manner the way system any

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.490
system is going to calculate the ATS score in the similar

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.950
manner right in the similar manner basically it was giving

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:39.850
me a ATS score now to read or to parse this entire resume to

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:45.350
generate a new content for a resume and even to you know

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.690
align this resume with a job description and to basically

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:54.970
give a ATS score of a new content or a new resume content

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:58.870
with respect to a job description so we have used agents at

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.150
different different agents so one was doing like one task

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.070
other was doing other tasks or like third was doing third

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:09.530
tasks so likewise we have used four in total agents which we

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.150
have built inside a crew ai right this is something that we

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:16.110
have done and even in stuedium i have shown you that if you

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:19.130
have to build it without writing a single line of a code how

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:23.610
you can do it basically so that there was a use cases right

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:25.850
so basically that was So whenever I have to give an answer

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.270
of this question, so obviously I'll talk about one of the

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:30.990
use case that okay, this was the use case I was like

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:35.850
building it and it was my need of an hour at that point of

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.930
time to use a multiple agents. I have used this particular

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:42.570
framework for that particular agent. For some of the agent I

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:46.410
have give some tool access basically for some of the agent

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:50.610
it was like a just a simple LLM instruction which was given

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:53.850
to those agent and then I have built the multi agent system.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.890
So how you will be able to implement obviously by using some

00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:00.250
of the orchestration framework. Maybe you can say a crew AI,

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:03.250
maybe you can say autogen, autogen is even very, very

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:07.150
powerful nowadays and even like autogen provides you a

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:11.630
flexibility just like a crew AI that you can do just a drag

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.910
and drop and then you will be able to build an agent, you

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.890
can build a tool inside the agent, everything, everything. I

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.790
believe next week I'm going to discuss about the autogen in

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:23.830
a practical manner and that tool. So without writing much of

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:27.150
code, yeah, autogen also provide you even inside the UI

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.290
interface, autogen also provides you like modify the code

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:33.650
base just like a crew AI by the way. Yeah, just like a crew

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.310
AI which I'm going to show you in a practical manner. But

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:38.810
yeah, I can try to use a crew AI, I can try to use autogen,

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.030
I can try to use n8n, I can try to use a Langraph, I can try

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.170
to use a Langchain, I can try to use a Lama indexes.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.770
Likewise there are so many different, different kind of a

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:50.470
like a framework which is available. So where and every

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:53.930
frameworks is providing me to build. An independent agent so

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:57.290
that agent one agent can pass a data or one agent can talk

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:00.710
and communicate to other one. So this is how I will end up

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:03.370
building it. If I have to give the answer that okay, I have

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.990
like I was trying to solve this use case and in this use

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.530
case, obviously I have used this main number of agents for a

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:14.130
different different kind of purposes, right? So it is if it

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:17.130
is possible, can you explain one more example other than a

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:22.510
resume AI for a multi agent? Okay. So resume AI. Okay. So

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:24.950
this is what I have discussed in my previous class, right?

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:27.630
Anyone remembers what I have discussed in previous to

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:31.670
previous class with respect to a land graph? Yeah. Because

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:35.250
just before crew AI, what was the like a project or what was

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:40.290
the use case which I have discussed? Anyone anyone who can

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:50.370
remember? Yeah, yes. Okay. So Shari is saying document

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:53.810
extraction. Okay. So in document extraction. So what, what

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:56.230
we have done by the way, so what, what, what kind of a use

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:57.270
case we have seen over there?

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.010
Yes. Any idea?

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.340
So basically we have extracted an invoice and it's sorted

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.720
into a sequel light, right? This is something that we have

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:24.440
done now. Can I say that even when I was using a land graph

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.840
framework, I have used a multiple agent over there. Yeah.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.900
Multiple agent. And then like, uh, basically we have created

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.860
a multiple node if you remember from that particular use

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.240
case, which I have discussed right before this review. Let's

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:41.000
resume AI and we have created basically a multiple nodes.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.280
Technically that node was behaving like an agent. Some of

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.820
the agent was having a tool access tool means a function

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:52.560
access and uh, it was reading out my invoices. It was trying

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:56.520
to call a easy OCR. It was trying to extract a data out of

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.740
it. It was trying to, uh, you know, refine those data. And

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:02.220
then finally it was trying to ingest my data into a

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:06.820
databases, right? So again, that is one of the multi agent

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:10.100
systems. So it doesn't matter what the task in a today's

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:14.080
world you are going to automate, right? Uh, it is going to

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.980
be, uh, in case of agent TKI, it is going to be a multi

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:21.140
agent system. Doesn't matter which task you are going to

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:25.020
solve. For example, if I'm like, uh, trying to build a

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:29.020
system, so which is going to work for me as a marketing

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.900
campaign manager, right? Again one of the example, other

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:35.940
example, let's, uh, let's talk about it with respect to a

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.080
marketing. Again, marketing is something which all the

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.540
company does. Now when we have to do a marketing, so we have

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.640
to do a multiple task. First of all, our research that what

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.820
our competitors are doing, what is a unique USP of my

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:53.820
product is in which market I will be able to fit my product.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.720
What should be the ideal pricing for my, uh, like a market

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:02.180
who will be my basically, uh, like a target user, right?

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.720
Whom I should target maybe between 16 year to 18 year. Maybe

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:10.060
18 years. 24 year, 24 year, 35 year in which demography I

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:14.040
have to run my ad, right? So these are something that we

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.540
have to do a research again, just on our research side

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.360
itself. We can try to create a multiple agent, so which will

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.600
try to do a pinpointed research for one of the topic. Now

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.540
once the research is done, then we used to go for the

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.280
content creation, right? Because obviously when we are

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.240
saying marketing, so marketing is all about content, right?

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.360
So obviously content and then distribution. So you have to

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.960
create a content. Maybe you have to create a carousel. Maybe

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.280
you have to, again, carousel means a different, different

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.080
dimension comes into a picture. Maybe you will go and you

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.860
will try to create, uh, I would say, uh, ad video. Maybe you

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.340
will go and suit the ad video nowadays, even people are able

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:52.120
to create it with respect to the AI. Uh, so you will create

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.420
an ad video. Maybe you are going to run an offline marketing

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:58.540
campaign. That's also possible, right? So maybe a pamphlet

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.860
distribution, maybe a hoarding and posters and all those

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.240
things you are going to do, which companies does. But yeah.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.740
Majority of like, uh, nowadays happens. So on our, our

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.460
digital, uh, platform. So basically there will be a

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.200
collateral, which some, which some team is going to create.

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.360
Now agents can create a collateral agents can even do the

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.860
comparison between the collaterals. Even if someone is going

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:19.220
to create manually and care, keeping into a drive that,

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.660
okay, this is going to work. This is not going to work as

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.940
per my past experience, everything it is going to summarize

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:27.560
it. Then there will be a next agent who will keep on

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.600
scheduling it because, uh, like, and who will start

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.920
allocating or at least who will start suggesting you the

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.080
budget. So again, in a, in a, in a, in a, in a, in a, in a,

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:35.320
in a, in a, in a, in a, in a, in a, in a, in a, in a, in a,

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.700
in a, in a, in a, in a, every layer is starting from, our

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.780
planning and research to our collateral creation till an

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:43.020
execution. And then finally there will be a report gathering

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.920
that will be our multiple agent just in one single layer

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.080
itself. We can try to deploy a multiple agents over there.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.660
So again, in a marketing, marketing, which is a common use

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.220
cases for all of us. Same thing happens even in case of our

00:14:56.220 --> 00:15:00.560
sales, right? So whether we are trying to do a, like a one

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.480
-to-one calling, so obviously nowadays there are multiple

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:07.160
agents. or multiple like AI agents you must be able to see

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.960
you must have received a lot of calls right nowadays or

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.040
obviously in last like a five to six months so where machine

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.120
is giving you a call and looks like in a very first unless

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.540
and until you are not listening to the conversation

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:23.000
carefully it looks like that machine is able to talk to you

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.020
just like a human being right its tone its sentiment

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.140
everything is almost like a human being so again in case of

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:33.100
a sales obviously we are going to deploy a multiple agent

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.600
there will be a talk like there will be a agent who can

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.640
speak who can like understand who can like a talk to you in

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:41.540
a real time but even before that so there will be an agent

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:44.000
who will churn the data because let's suppose if I'm

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.320
generating a lead a lakhs and lakhs of lead I'm generating

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.320
on a daily basis as per my budget as per my marketing

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:53.240
campaign so obviously I have to churn those lead I have to

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.740
decide that okay fine so when I'm supposed to call I it's

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:59.340
not like if let's suppose someone from a USA has filled a

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:02.340
form so I'm going to give a call in a Indian time obviously

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:05.800
I know that it is they are not going to pick up right or

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.180
maybe someone has asked for the follow-up call maybe someone

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:11.720
has dueled a call with me so my agent is supposed to remind

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.860
and it is supposed to give a call if someone is looking for

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:18.320
maybe someone to talk to my senior so again there will be a

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.940
multiple agent which will be deployed so technically

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:25.220
whenever we talk about an agent TKI it's always about our

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:29.040
multiple agents one agent will not be able to do things and

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:32.420
again so this is how we have been writing even a code

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:35.220
modular fashion so again in case of our agents so with the

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.100
help of this multi agent we try to technically achieve a

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.980
modularity hope it's making sense and it's a enough a number

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:46.500
of example for all of you yeah so whenever we talk about

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.860
agent actually we talk about our multiple agents not just

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:55.540
one by the way yeah in any system even with the small use

00:16:55.540 --> 00:17:01.000
cases okay now so next question says that that what is the

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.020
approach for building a autonomous agent okay now first of

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.640
all what is the autonomous agent we know about agents by the

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.460
way right we discussed a lot and we have even built a lot

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:12.220
even in our live classes we have built a lot a lot of agent

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:16.620
by using a lot of framework so basically autonomous agent is

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:20.780
basically like a kind of agent which will try to take some

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.640
sort of a decision automatically right which will try to

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:27.780
take out like things automatically so obviously if I am

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:30.820
going to create a system so with a very very clear objective

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:33.680
and if I am going to give an access right for example

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:37.060
nowadays what happens so many people are creating a tool or

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:39.560
many organizations are creating a tool so which will be able

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.820
to book a flight ticket for you right which will be able to

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.800
plan your vacation which will be able to basically do some

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.900
sort of a shopping you must have seen that right maybe on a

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.820
popxlity even popxlity is building that so basically many

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.820
one many people are building a browser agent right so which

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.680
will be able to spin the browser in the server not in your

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.580
local and basically that browser will be able to do a lot of

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:05.640
things for you even chat gpt has or open ai have revealed

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.040
that one so they have even a browser agent I don't know

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.420
whether you have tried that or not but yeah I think I have

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.720
already created a video when it was released it's available

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:16.640
on your own platform so basically many people are working

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.420
for a browser agent right now what this browser agent does

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.240
let's suppose I have given some instruction that okay book a

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.020
ticket for me in this location from this location to this

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.160
location this is a date this is a timing yeah so it will go

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.420
it will try to search all the website it will try to find

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:34.080
the cheapest one for me and maybe if I'm looking for a

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.360
business class or maybe a first class it will try to find

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.540
those things and then eventually it will try to book the

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.220
ticket and to book the ticket obviously it should know that

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:44.320
my information right because whenever we are booking a

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.200
ticket obviously system will ask you for a couple of

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.080
information right that what is your name what is the email

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.940
id or date of birth email id phone number all of these

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:55.960
information right it is going to ask you if if I'm like

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.500
trying to travel internationally so obviously it is going to

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:04.480
ask me it is going to ask now so we have to give those

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:07.680
detail to the agent basically apart from that so obviously

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.400
we have to give a credit card or debit card access to my

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.800
agents right to my agents then only it will be able to make

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.320
a payment otherwise what what agent will do no one can do

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:19.120
anything right so autonomous agent is something so which

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.320
will be able to like take instruction from you right if you

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:25.800
said that okay fine wake me up every day six o'clock fine it

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.640
will be having your alarm

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.020
book a calendar for me for this event so go to my mail and

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.140
then check all my mails and like try to filter out all the

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.540
important like things which I have to do and the schedule um

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:44.040
like a meeting with me it can be done right it can be done

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.060
automatically it can be done uh like a do a grocery shopping

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:51.100
for me it will be done basically right but to do it you have

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.620
to provide all the access basically you have to provide

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:56.020
maybe a bib search access to this one you have to provide an

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:58.120
API access database access your credit card access

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.280
everything right everything and then system will be able to

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.700
take its own decision and it will be able to like basically

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:09.860
do the task so auto GPT is one of the example there is

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:12.660
something called as baby AGI right artificial generators

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:16.620
baby AGI which is like a famous autonomous agentic AI

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:19.380
framework or agents framework so you can try to use any of

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:22.040
this framework so ultimately it is going to take its brain

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:25.580
and brain is going to be LLM so LLM may be like open a LLM

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:28.340
or cloudy or anything any elements a best one you can try to

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:31.380
give and then it will be able to do some sort of a task for

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.660
you and that is something called as autonomous agent but

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.520
yeah uh security is a major concern for now so if you are

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.920
going to give a credit card access yeah you don't know like

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.040
what kind of a decision it is going to make unless it is not

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.800
robust it's not properly tested on all the use cases right

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.100
uh but yeah so I think uh very soon this is going to be a

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.300
reality uh just like we use uh iPhone and we say Siri uh

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:56.340
like a put alarm for like a four o'clock 4 a.m uh Siri is

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:56.840
good with that

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:06.340
uh as a AI not AI by the way I have only used Siri maybe as

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.880
a like AI apart from that there is nothing in iPhone I

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.500
believe right in terms of AI even in the recent release so

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.640
they just have a Siri and I think Siri uh was there like

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:20.220
even like before uh the age of era of AI so just like a Siri

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.720
so the way she is very good she is very good with the

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.520
calendar booking uh sorry she's very good with the alarm

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:29.180
clock set uh setting by the way uh so maybe in the similar

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:33.580
manner you will be using uh like uh this AI autonomous agent

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:36.440
but yeah people are building it people are doing it maybe

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:40.300
you can try this out with the pop xlity publicity have that

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:44.580
agentic browser uh they have they have like a done that they

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:47.000
have even released it for the public and even you can try to

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.240
try this out into a open AI auto GPT so but yeah you have to

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:56.120
give all the access unless I did uh access so it will not be

00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:02.080
able to work all the tasks by AI then what about us what

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:06.100
about about a job sir okay let me tell me one thing right uh

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.720
in a childhood right uh we we all were living into a small

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.600
town even I belong from a very very small town in India

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:16.700
right a very very small town and uh we used to go for like

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:21.140
you know uh daily grocery shopping right we go out and then

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:26.820
we buy a vegetable and uh like you know uh basically uh we

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:29.760
we used to buy all the groceries and everything on a regular

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.820
basis yeah maybe once or twice in a month we used to go

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:36.680
outside right uh barely we go out for a food and something

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:41.060
right uh but nowadays right if you're living in a Metro City

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:43.760
or not in the Metro City in India even in tier 2 theater

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.460
cities now it's available so now we have a blanket right

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:50.620
blanket chapter a lot of like a provider a lot of like a you

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:54.160
know vendors so who can deliver our things at your household

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.900
now we are not going out uh for buying a vegetable on a

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.200
daily basis right which was our routine task uh in a

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:05.500
childhood like for most of us it was a routine task for us

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.940
10 or 20 years back but now we are not doing it right now we

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.980
are like just opening up our gemato or maybe a blanket maybe

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:15.980
a jepto or such kind of application and yes in 10 minutes 20

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:18.660
or maybe half an hour right or maybe other day so we are

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:21.540
able to get or we are able to receive even to buy something

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.860
so we used to go out but now we have a Amazon we have

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:27.520
flipkart even available in a rural area of India right so we

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:33.720
are not going outside yeah so when there will be an agent

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.640
who will be able to book a flight ticket it will be able to

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:40.140
book uh maybe a meeting or manage a meeting it's not like we

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:44.720
will be out of the job right so basically we have seen that

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:49.540
that when this entire distillation happened or it's still

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:52.500
happening so obviously it's trying to provide an opportunity

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.900
opportunity for our people so obviously AI will be able to

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.760
book a ticket for you I will be able to book a gym slot for

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:03.380
you let's suppose but you say I will be able to make your

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:07.380
gym payment but you have to go and you have to like uh do

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:12.600
your gym basically right so so technically it's not about

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:17.680
like a AI who is going to do a job on behalf of us it is

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:22.260
technically helping me out to be 10x productive just just

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:26.660
imagine right when there was uh no computer or let's suppose

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:29.700
we had a computer even 10 years back right we had a computer

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:34.240
but it right we were not able to run a heavy application

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:37.640
over there life was completely slow even in the age of

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.200
Google right maybe life was slow because we used to go

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.220
through our documentation we used to go through a stack

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:48.080
overflow then AI came into a picture right chat GPT in 2022

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.220
I think made of 2022 uh since last like a two two and a half

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:54.260
year three year let's suppose right yeah I came into a

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:57.680
picture so technically it's it's making our life faster it's

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:04.160
taking making our life easier yeah so yes it is going to

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.860
take your job there is no doubt about it it is taking your

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:11.040
job if you are not able to upgrade yourself if you are

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:16.380
living in a same era 10 year or like five year back era if

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.960
you are not upgrading yourself if you think that that I will

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:23.160
learn only one skill and then on that skill I will be able

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:28.380
to survive from for an entire life obviously AI will take

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:31.680
your not AI will take your job right your colleague will

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.940
take your job your neighbor will take your job your

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:36.900
bachelor's will take your job very simple yeah

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.120
so if you are not able to learn if you will keep on making

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:45.860
an excuse that where to learn how to learn what to learn

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:48.020
instead of actually learning and instead of actually

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:51.080
building which is which I see as a very very common

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:54.200
phenomena in almost all of you believe me yeah this is

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:58.460
consider that as a this has a constructive feedback so not

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:02.600
in other way basically so I have seen many people right very

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.500
few people come to me and say that I have built this right

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.240
can you can you please help me out you know to build 10 more

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.860
things in this one right there are very few people who come

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:14.160
to me by saying this statement many people come to me and

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:18.040
say that how I can build a startup like you how I can

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:21.460
generate a money like you right how you were able to

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.740
generate or like you were able to get a funding in your

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:27.020
previous startup that we in an early stage how you were able

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:31.080
to sell that on this valuation or people come and say that

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:34.360
how you are able to learn right how you keep yourself

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:39.380
updated I mean like see I can give you a motivational answer

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:44.080
for every how right but the reality is the fact is

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:48.160
everything is happening because I'm doing it that's only

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:51.680
reality nothing has happened overnight nothing has happened

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.660
automatically right you have to sit you have to work even

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:58.340
today like I'm working right I'm working even people are not

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:00.900
I can see like many people are not able to join the classes

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.040
but still it's my responsibility I know that I have to go

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.960
into a lab to deliver the class because my job to do it

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:10.240
right so I can't say no I can't say how I will go and give

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:16.100
the class so simple thing is if you are having such kind of

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:21.260
a mindset that you will just ask a question on how but if

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:23.920
you will not build it and then you will ask the question

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:28.080
then obviously AI not AI forget about AI let's let's imagine

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.480
that AI is nowhere right still you will lose your job

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:38.440
getting a job because of Blinkit and zepto many general

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:42.500
stores are closed see the thing is that that before

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:46.420
calculator we used to do all the calculation on pen and

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:50.980
paper right so yes uh you can you can say that we were

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:53.880
selling uh so paper seller was selling a lot of papers right

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:57.980
because there was a demand and everyone every CA or we can

00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:00.520
say everyone was doing a calculation on those pen and papers

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:03.520
right uh then calculator came into picture then computer

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:07.900
came into a picture so obviously paper seller can't come and

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:12.220
say that no my sales has decreased see world is evolving

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:15.480
this is how a we as a human being is so if you are giving

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:18.920
this analogy that because of this uh like something has been

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:22.560
closed or something got disrupted then the simple thing is

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:26.940
that that we would have never evolved ourselves uh from uh

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:32.200
main men who were living in a cave right we were not

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:36.740
supposed to evolve at all if you are giving this logic and

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:41.240
obviously this is uh because see obviously even even from

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:45.720
your yours and again so and if this is your mindset then why

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:49.240
you are thinking about a hike why do you complain that uh

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:53.380
company is not giving me 10 hike 20 hike why you keep on

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.220
complaining that I'm not able to learn why you're

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:56.700
complaining that market is not giving you opportunity

00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:02.980
somewhere uh down uh like deep inside you even you are

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:04.680
expecting uh some kind of uh you are expecting uh some kind

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:08.240
of uh some kind of of evolution in yourself right yeah

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:16.760
so when it comes to us uh so we we are all happy when

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:19.100
something happens to our neighborhood then we start

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:22.760
complaining right I I think we should not like keep this

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.920
kind of a mindset we all should keep a progressive mindset a

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.560
struggle of the mindset I would say right and believe me

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.920
things happens now coming to the next question otherwise I

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.480
will keep on talking about this topic for next two three

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:38.520
hours uh how do you implement a tool calling in uh tool

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:41.000
calling in language model now what is what is tool by the

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.020
way so tool is nothing but a function for example so if I

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:47.380
have written a function that search website because LLM will

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:51.500
not be able to search right LLMs are basically a simple

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:55.220
model which has been trained till a particular date yeah

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:58.920
till a particular date so LM will not be able to go and do a

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:02.400
website search LLM will not be able to go and do a check of

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:07.440
weather or maybe like uh you know uh I would say it will not

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:11.200
be able to access my credit card or my calendar or my Google

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.820
account or my website or my Amazon website or Amazon login

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:18.540
right so I have to write a function I have to authorize I

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:21.900
have to give an access now that will that is a function

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:26.380
function will become a tool once I am going to wrap it up

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:30.980
with my agents right with my agents basically so that so

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:33.740
there will be an agent so agent will decide automatically

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:37.720
that okay if there is a task do a web search you pick this

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:41.740
tool if there is a task to access my credit card okay pick

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:45.020
this tool so this is how we try to so tools are technically

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:48.260
nothing but a function a piece of function that we have been

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:51.420
writing since a many many years since the evolution of a

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:55.620
computer right and we try to like give an access to a LLM so

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:59.620
that out of thousands of function or thousands of access LLM

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:01.580
can decide that which one to choose in what kind of a

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:06.540
situation which we have already done now what are the best

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:10.900
practice for a function calling okay uh so a function

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:15.080
calling see so basically uh with respect to agentic AI a

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.380
function calling is bit different as we have already

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:20.240
discussed and we have also seen a lot of use cases in our

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:26.020
classes that LMS is trying to call my function right so LM

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:28.780
is trying to take a decision that which function now let's

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:31.640
suppose if I'm trying to build if I have written a function

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:35.440
uh for a website search right web search or Google search

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.320
right answer per API integration I have done for that one

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.120
now if I have named that function right website search

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:45.460
function maybe as a credit card function if I have named

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:48.960
that function in a wrong manner if I have not given a clear

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:52.060
description that what you are doing means what that function

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:56.320
is doing in a doc string right if I have not given a very

00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:00.340
very clear instruction if I have not validated it's like a

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:03.360
inputs which which we are doing it by using a pidentic by

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:07.820
the way nowadays right in that is your LLM will not be able

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:11.980
to understand right so the best practice when you are trying

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:15.300
to do a function calling is always try to make sure that

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:18.420
your function name should be pretty much clear align with

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:21.760
the task it will be it must be having a very good

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:25.020
description of the function so that my LM will be able to

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:28.500
access and my LM will be able to understand it right it must

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:31.600
be able to validate the input for example pidentic now

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.460
pidentic 2 is running right in a market currently so

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:38.980
pidentic right and then there should be a fall back that if

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:43.500
this function fails then what to do basically right so this

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.520
is how you are supposed to practice these are the best

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:49.700
practices for a function calling in a agents it's because

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:52.480
this this function calling will be little bit different as

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.600
compared to the regular function because in the kind of

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:58.380
regular function we call it right so we write it that okay

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:01.500
call this one now call that one now but here your LLM is

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:04.680
trying to access so you have to be very very with respect to

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:08.280
LLMs otherwise system will make a mistake all the time or

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:12.560
you can say in other word hallucinate. Now so another

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:15.180
question is hundred number question how do you implement a

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.880
memory management in a agents. So if you have any kind of a

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:20.780
question put me in a chat guys put your question in a chat

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:24.160
not me in a chat yeah your question in a chat by the way.

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.540
I believe my screen is visible right I am sharing my screen

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.060
yeah fine

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:41.190
and hope all of you are able to understand my definition and

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:43.530
my answer basically and this is how you should go and you

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:47.570
should give an answer inside interview. How do you implement

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:51.010
a memory management? So we all know that there can be a

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:54.330
different type of memory management that we can do with

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:57.250
respect to any orchestrator framework agentic orchestrator

00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:59.870
framework. So what are those framework? Langchain, Lama

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:04.710
indexes, auto gen or gen a sorry auto gen init and then like

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:07.950
crew AI all such kind of a framework right I can try to use

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:11.530
to create a agent. Now I have even shown you in my land

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:13.930
graph class that there can be a multiple different different

00:34:13.930 --> 00:34:17.570
kind of a memory which which exist even a crew a class I

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:19.950
have shown you that part right by showing you crew a page

00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:23.330
itself I remember. So I have shown you that there can be a

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:25.850
different type of memory there can be a kind of a memory

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:29.670
where it stores everything right there can be a memory which

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:33.990
stores a window basically like top last 15 or 20 or whatever

00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:37.570
we are going to configure a window size right so like chunk

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:41.330
of it. But there can be a memory so which will summarize the

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:43.930
whole story and then store the summary only the summary

00:34:43.930 --> 00:34:47.770
right so of the whole data there can be a memory which will

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:51.090
just hold maybe some sort of an entity right so entity based

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:55.270
like a memory basically so place and like a person name it

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:59.130
will try to only memorize entity based like a memory. So

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:04.070
these are the memory like which exist basically right so

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:07.210
basically which exist and whenever we are trying to create.

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:12.270
Any agentic system or any chat system even like when you try

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:14.790
to chat with the chat GPT or even with the URI when you are

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:18.850
chatting there is a memory it remembers about you basically

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:21.710
it memorize about you so that it will be able to understand

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:24.170
your past context your current context and it will try to

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:26.890
give you a better and better answer right it will try to

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:29.170
give you a better and better answer even all this like a

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:32.230
chat system that we are using across the globe all the

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:34.690
famous one everywhere you will be able to find out the

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:36.890
memory management and it's not tough. We have seen that

00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:39.230
right. We have already seen that in LandGraph technically we

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:42.470
have written a code for that one that this agent will be

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:45.190
having basically a windowing memory access this agent will

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:48.710
be having a buffer memory access summary memory access so

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:50.890
this is something that we have already done as an

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:55.650
implementation so you can try to like you know build this

00:35:55.650 --> 00:36:00.190
kind of a memory and so by this you will be able to do a

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:05.250
memory management plus if you have to like maybe a store.

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:09.070
Very huge amount of things. So in that case you can try to

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:12.050
even call a vector database and vector database you can try

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:16.590
to use it for a memory and if you are using for like using

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:20.030
something in us inside a memory which can respond very very

00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:23.530
fast in that case simple go ahead with in memory in memory

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:27.010
means Redis Redis as a service or Redis as a database you

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:29.190
can try to use it so where it stores each and everything

00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:31.730
inside a cache memory and it's going to be very very fast in

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:34.190
a production grid application obviously I always advise

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:38.190
everyone to use Redis on a server side right Redis on a

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:41.850
server side so this is how we can try to basically implement

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:46.750
a memory management now so what is the approach of building

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:49.310
a reasoning agent so first of all we have to understand that

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:52.410
what is a reasoning agent you must have seen that recently

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:55.430
when you chat with chat GPT and for the very first time you

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:58.490
must have seen with respect to a deep seek R1 so when deep

00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:01.330
seek R1 has been launched in a market so it said that okay I

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:04.150
can do a better reasoning reasoning means what reasoning

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:07.430
means a chain of thought you can say. Right chain of thought

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:10.270
what is the meaning of chain of thought that okay you gave

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:13.990
me the problem right so in in other word in other way if I

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:18.830
have to explain you so basically like a lawyer right so a

00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:21.750
lawyer so let's suppose a lawyer is trying to prove his case

00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:27.010
that okay my like you know client is not guilty basically so

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:30.710
he will he will start breaking down all the incident step by

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:33.510
step he will start giving a reason he will start connecting

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:37.310
all the events for that particular day. Okay just to prove

00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:40.930
that his client is right in the similar manner what your

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:45.250
agent does so it will not go and generate an output in one

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:48.590
single sort what it will do it will try to like you know see

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:52.210
a queue create a queue of series of questions based on your

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:55.590
questions that okay we'll do this investigate this then do

00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:57.550
this then do this then do this then do this so reasoning

00:37:57.550 --> 00:38:01.330
basically or you can say chain of thought C O T by the way

00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:04.470
right chain of thought prompting. So basically in this way

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:07.550
you will be able to. Okay. Be able to give me the better

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:09.670
result then it will summarize and then it will be able to

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:12.690
give me the final answer. So if you can expect that it will

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:16.330
it will give me the reasonably better answer as compared to

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:19.930
one sort answer and this is something called as a reasoning

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:24.170
agent. So where ever. So in Landgraf yeah you can try to

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:27.290
create a reasoning node. It's it's possible. Right. So

00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:29.710
instead of creating a reactive node you can try to create a

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:34.490
reasoning node as well. Model wise if I'll say so deep seek

00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:37.150
R1 is the best example. This is where this got a popularity

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:41.790
for the very first time in a market now. So next question

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:45.290
says that that how do you implement up implement planning in

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:49.250
a agent. Okay. So what is what is a planning basically. So

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:53.590
planning means nothing but like a chain or cities like break

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:57.350
the goals into a steps and execute each and every steps.

00:38:57.630 --> 00:39:01.410
Right. So basically this is something that we try to do.

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:06.070
Yeah. Yeah. So agent will do something for which we have

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:08.730
given an instruction and obviously it will be having a

00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:12.250
limitation. Right. So what we do if you have seen that that

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:15.150
whenever we create agents we try to say that okay fine. So

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:18.390
you are this agent you are a system agent or you are

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:21.630
assistant agent or you are basically professor you are

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:24.310
basically this particular like a task doer something like

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:27.670
that we try to define and then we say that that okay. So

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:30.430
whenever something will come to you. So step number one do

00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:33.910
this step number to do this. Do this. Give me an output in

00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:37.550
this format. And this is something called as planning. Now

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:40.410
agent agent will try to take this planning and then it will

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:44.370
try to perform the exact same operation on whatever task we

00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:47.030
are going to configure it. So that is something called as

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:49.850
planning which eventually we try to do it. So we try to

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:52.810
break it down in a different different steps and then we say

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:57.370
that okay execute each and every steps and whether we are

00:39:57.370 --> 00:40:02.270
going to create a agent inside maybe like a land chain land

00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:06.270
graph. Lama indexes autogen anywhere. Now what are the

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:09.650
consideration for a agent communication means how agent can

00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:12.090
talk to each other. This is what it means. Right. So

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:15.930
basically agent will be able to talk to each other and that

00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:19.730
depends upon the orchestrator like a framework. Right. And

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:24.170
the back story that we are going to build and which agent we

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:27.310
are going to call in what manner maybe into a hierarchical

00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:31.090
manner or maybe into a series sequential manner. Right. Or

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:34.950
parallel manner. So depends upon that agent will be able to

00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:39.090
communicate and it will try to pass its input and output to

00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:41.650
the next one. Depends how we are going to do that

00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:44.050
configuration and you must have seen that that everywhere

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:46.210
whether we are using a crew whether you are using a land

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:48.910
graph. So in case of a land graph it will be node and then

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:52.090
ages through ages it will try to derive the relation between

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:55.030
one agent to another agent. Right. That okay I'll give this

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:57.590
output and this will go into two or three or four or just

00:40:57.590 --> 00:41:00.570
one. Technically like a graph structure. And it is going to

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:03.670
work on that one crew. Same thing. Right. So crew provide

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:07.150
you maybe a serialized approach or try to provide you even a

00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:09.710
hierarchical approach just like a land graph. So you can you

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:12.570
can try to build a crew means a team and then team is going

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:15.490
to work in that particular manner. And technically

00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:18.410
communication means transferring a data from one to another

00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:21.950
one. So all of this orchestrator framework is going to

00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:27.710
perform this operation. Now how do you implement the agent

00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:31.990
coordination. So whenever we have to like a design agent

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:35.330
cognitive coordination just we try to follow the

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:39.290
implementation given by orchestrator framework and based on

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:42.290
that we try to coordinate between the agent for land graph.

00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:44.390
Yeah. Whatever kind of a graph that we are going to design

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:47.590
it will try to work on that part. Now so it's not very

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:50.370
different from the previous question by the way. What is the

00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:55.830
approach for building a multi model agent. Okay. So let's

00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:59.030
suppose. Um. I'm trying to build a system. Right. I'm trying

00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:03.430
to build a system which will be able to like understand my

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:08.130
text which will be able to understand my images and which

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:11.530
will be able to understand even my voice. Yeah. Which will

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:15.550
be able to understand my voice for example Avani kind of a

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:17.930
system we are designing right. Avani kind of a system we are

00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:21.370
designing so where we can go we can do a conversation. It

00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:24.010
can understand my resume. It can generate some sort of text

00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:28.490
out of it. Uh. Maybe I have added some image capability as

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:31.030
well where I can share my screen. It will take a screenshot

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:35.290
and then it will be able to even observe my entire screen.

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:39.090
Right. Image understanding. Now so to implement such kind of

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:41.710
a system Avani kind of a system with a image capability

00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:46.450
let's suppose one model is not going to be sufficient.

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:49.050
Right. One model is not going to be sufficient. So maybe I

00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:51.850
need a multiple different different model for example maybe

00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:56.550
for chat I need some text based model. Uh. Like to process

00:42:56.550 --> 00:43:00.910
our images I need some vision based model obviously. To

00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:04.290
understand speech or to convert speech to text and text to

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:07.650
speech I need audio audio kind of a model or maybe some

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:10.830
other library. So this is where this multi model comes into

00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:13.790
a picture. Right. You can you can just try to give example

00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:16.810
of this one that okay so there is Avani and we have been

00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:19.870
using that and again in every like most of the cases

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:22.670
nowadays most of the complex cases obviously you will have

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:26.670
to like take a multi model system. So if I will talk about a

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:29.390
text so obviously I can talk about a Gemini I can talk about

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:33.490
a GPT I can talk about the cloud or sonnet any series which

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:36.790
can behave like a brain for just for the text. Now if I am

00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:42.490
talking about a vision so here for a vision model right so

00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:45.010
we can we can go ahead with the specific one or even

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:49.210
nowadays GPT is having a vision capability it can understand

00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:53.450
your image as well as it can understand like it can generate

00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:58.070
a image. So both can be done. Now for maybe a speech to text

00:43:58.070 --> 00:44:01.110
right if I if I am having a conversation system like Avani

00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:03.810
then I can try to use a whisper whisper from open AI once

00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:08.550
again and if I have to maybe like convert my text into a

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:12.250
speech which Avani used to say so in that case maybe I can

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:15.750
try to use a model from a 11 labs or even from a open AI a

00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:18.830
TTS model a text to speech model. So a speech to text text

00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:21.690
to a speech a vision model a text based model all of these

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:26.890
models are required. So only my agent will be able to call a

00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:32.230
respective model for a respective use cases right. So that

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:35.550
you know it will be able to like just communicate with me

00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:38.830
just like Avani Avani is able to do it. So technically that

00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:43.010
is a multi model agentic system you can you can say and yeah

00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:45.430
across industry we are doing it. So wherever this kind of a

00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:48.010
system is required obviously you have to call the multi

00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:51.710
model agent system. Question number 106. How do you

00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:56.690
implement agent learning and adjustment? Okay so how agent

00:44:56.690 --> 00:45:00.730
learns from anything? So obviously if I have to like

00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:05.850
learning an adoption I think we are already aware about this

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:08.510
one. So we are already aware about the fine tuning by the

00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:11.690
way. So fine tuning is one of the way again inside the fine

00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:13.690
tuning we have a multiple approaches I have already

00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:17.610
discussed about it. Then there is something called as again

00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:23.930
today Asit has I believe send me one beautiful you know.

00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:33.370
LinkedIn I can say like a complete write up let me show it

00:45:33.370 --> 00:45:36.510
to you as we are talking about a fine tuning. So he has

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:41.860
documented that in my in morning so I was just like going

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:47.180
through it yeah. So he has created a very good blog as you

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:50.880
can see. So what is for like a fine tuning and then what and

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:54.080
all types of the fine tuning you will be able to find out.

00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:56.800
So fine tuning techniques. So basically. So basically if we

00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:59.580
will find tuning or preferred inside preferred there will be

00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:03.920
Laura and Cora then prefix adapter RHF DPO DPO is also same

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:07.520
as a like RLHF which I have already discussed. So it's a

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:09.860
good read. Maybe you can you can just go through it and he

00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:15.700
has done some sort of a you know deep investigation like

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:18.140
what is the GPU hour in general which is required data

00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:21.860
gathering. So maybe it's a good read for all of you. So this

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:26.740
is how we keep on doing a learning and adoption. From a new

00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:30.160
data right. So this is where and again I think we have

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:33.660
already answered to this question multiple times. Let me

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:37.280
share this link with all of you. Yeah I believe he has

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:39.460
shared in some of the groups as well. Maybe not in your

00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:43.220
group or maybe I don't remember but yeah he pinged me so and

00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:45.900
I was like going through it. So I liked it basically the

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:47.260
kind of a detail he has mentioned.

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:53.980
Then implementation learning and adaption. Okay. Now what

00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:56.880
are the best practices for agent evaluation. That depends.

00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:59.800
It depends upon the task that we have in our hand and the

00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:02.560
kind of things that we are trying to solve. In general we

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:07.100
try to test accuracy reliability and speed. And again so to

00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:12.120
test right to test basically there is a framework which is

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:15.000
available in a market. Let me show you some of the framework

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.160
for testing these models. So there is something called as

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:24.380
like this one true lens is one of the framework. So true

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:27.520
lens is one of the framework. Basically this framework helps

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:31.240
you out in terms of evaluating a model apart from that. So

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:34.700
there is a other framework called as deep evolve and this is

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:37.280
also helping you out in terms of evaluating the entire

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:41.600
basically like the LLM evaluation framework. So if you have

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:46.520
like to do a evaluation of your LLMs. So like LLM that you

00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:49.160
are trying to train. So maybe you can try to go ahead with

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:52.840
this one. So agentic matrixes, REG matrixes. So deep evolve

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:55.280
and true lens. These are the two framework. Remember.

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:57.060
Remember it guys. Some of the framework you should remember

00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:59.980
because people may ask you a question that okay so how do

00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:03.940
you like evaluate it. So can't say just like okay I was like

00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:06.560
relying on accuracy and reliability. Then people will ask

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:09.080
you next question that how you were testing accuracy. Simply

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:11.080
say that okay I was using this framework and this framework

00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:12.660
provides you everything. Believe me they provide you

00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:15.740
everything right. They provide you each and everything

00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:19.100
evaluate, test, iterate and test. So these are the framework

00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:22.620
true lens and deep evolve framework which I remember

00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:26.640
basically you can try to use it. For evaluating your LLMs

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:31.020
basically. Now so next question says that what is the next

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:36.700
question? Agent evaluation fine. How do you implement a

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:40.440
agent safety mechanism? So how do you implement a agent

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:43.980
safety mechanism? Now for agent safety mechanism there is

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:48.180
something called as guardrails. I R D R A I L S guardrails

00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:52.340
AI. So guardrails is not just a concept. Many of us know

00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:56.020
these things as a concept. But yeah. There is also a

00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:59.100
framework you will be able to find out called as guardrails

00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:04.520
AI and basically what it does. So it will try to provide you

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:09.520
can say just like we do a child proofing right for maybe a

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:13.520
newborn kids in our home. So we try to you know seal back

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:18.140
all the corners. We try to you know install some sort of a

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:22.660
form or something. So in the similar manner there is

00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:25.240
something there is a platform called as guardrails AI. And

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:31.100
now basically it is going to like give you in each and

00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:34.180
everything I would say like each and everything where you

00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:37.280
will be able to like you know guardrails your entire

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:40.900
generative AI or agent TKI framework or you can guardrail

00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:45.140
your entire LLMs basically. So guardrails means guardrail on

00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:48.940
output obviously rate limit monitoring access control for a

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:51.760
tool. All of these things comes under the guardrails and

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:55.160
this is what it provides. So toxic language. Financed. Data

00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:59.440
wise. Competitor mentions. Positive tone. Data leak. Source

00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:01.920
of truth. Everything everything it is going to provide you.

00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:04.600
This is what they are claiming by the way. Obviously

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:07.620
everyone is building day by day better and better

00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:11.140
application but yeah. So this is like a picture of this

00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:15.860
guardrail. Apart from this guardrail AI there is also called

00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:18.380
as Nemo. There are so many platform but yeah these are the

00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:20.980
popular one. Guardrail AI is one of the popular one. And

00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:23.420
then there is something called as Nemo guardrails right. We

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:27.660
can try to use this one as well. So almost like a similar to

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:31.160
it's from Nvidia by the way right. So similar to this

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:35.380
guardrails AI so you can try to use this one. Yeah. We can

00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:40.600
try to use either of these things basically. So Nemo from

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:43.240
Nvidia guardrails simplify scalable AI guardrails

00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:47.520
orchestration for safeguarding a agent TKI application. So

00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:49.280
if you are not able to understand anything then simply say

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:52.800
that okay I was using a Nemo. Simple. Right. It's easy to

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.980
use with the popular development framework. Langchain Lama

00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:57.760
indexes along with the growing ecosystem of AI system. So

00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:00.200
even if you have like a saying that okay fine I have used

00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:02.600
Langchain or Lama indexes or any kind of these frameworks

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:05.160
right you can simply say that okay as a guardrails I was

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:08.280
using Nvidia Nemo and I have built the entire application.

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:12.620
So it's just one like a layer right. One layer on top of it

00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:15.480
and maybe you can try to read out this one a little bit more

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:18.780
that AI guardrails orchestrator to keep LLM application

00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:24.160
secure and on track. Simple. So what it does. So maybe you

00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:27.180
can try to like look into this middle picture by the way the

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:30.160
content moderation off topic detection RG enforcement

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:34.860
hallucination like a real auditors jailbreak detection and

00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:38.640
PII detection. So this is what this guardrails is doing and

00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:41.000
technically this is what is required. Right. This is

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.260
technically what is required. So this will sit in between

00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:46.320
your applications basically as you can see these guardrails

00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:49.080
and everything through will go through whatever query that

00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:51.880
user is sending everything will go through this particular

00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:55.860
small user. Unit. Right. Particular small unit. So you can.

00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:58.840
And again it's very easy to use and configure. Right. So

00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:01.280
maybe you can try to just check the example configuration

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:04.820
for this one for like input moderation output moderation

00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:07.500
preventing off topic question. They have given you the

00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:11.400
implementation. Like I said it's very very easy. Right. It's

00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:15.040
very very easy. So just one or two line of addition of your

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:18.360
code and they have given you like. So as we all understand

00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:22.240
the code part right agent part we all know how to build an

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:26.740
agent. By the way. So just read out like something out of

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:29.420
this and then you will be able to understand the entire

00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:33.160
guardrail part. So Nemo or maybe a guardrail AI is something

00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:36.020
that you can try to use it and people generally ask a

00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:38.780
question. Right. People generally ask a question that what

00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:41.120
kind of a guardrail frameworks or what kind of a guardrail

00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:43.920
that you have implemented. And this is something which is

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:48.200
new and a hot topic for an interviewer. Right. Because

00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:50.200
everyone knows that that we are building things we are

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:54.820
building agents we are using elements. But everyone is just

00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:57.300
worried and concerned about the output about the safety

00:52:57.300 --> 00:53:00.840
about the security. Right. So this question is somewhere the

00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:06.500
must question for any interviewer. So it was not also

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:10.080
guardrails. Yes. Almost all cloud platform is providing you

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:12.220
but these are the specific library which has been just

00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:15.300
designed for that particular purposes like where there are

00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:17.780
hundreds of libraries now you will be able to find out I'm

00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:20.120
just talking about a couple of frameworks and the famous

00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:23.740
one. That's it. Right. So basically you can even try to do a

00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:26.800
guardrails by using correct authorization. That is also a

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:29.780
way of guardrailing your entire tools or maybe a functions

00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:33.660
that we have been doing since ages I believe. Right. Since I

00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:36.640
age like since the time when we have started doing a

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:39.320
software development I think we are doing it. I am role.

00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:43.520
Right. So I am role is again one of the way by which you try

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:47.640
to control the access or unauthorized access. So these are

00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:50.380
also comes under the guardrail itself. But if I talk about a

00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:53.900
specific to some agentic AI or LMS so this also will come

00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:57.000
into picture. But that doesn't mean that your I am your auth

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.900
will not come into picture. That will also complement now

00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:04.500
the next question. What is the next question. So what is the

00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:09.580
approach for building a explainable agent. Yeah. What is the

00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:12.400
meaning of explainable agent by the way. So just focus on

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:16.520
this word keyword explainable agent. Right. So basically

00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:21.060
when we go to a doctor. And for a diagnosis of some disease.

00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:26.100
So doctor a good doctor not a bad one by the way I have seen

00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:29.240
good or bad both. So good doctor right. So good doctor will

00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:32.580
try to give you a medicine plus he or she will try to even

00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:35.900
explain you right. In a in a better way in a layman way that

00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:41.200
OK why I'm giving you this particular medicine and like what

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:46.400
is the disease that you have what was the possible cause if

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:49.860
all if it is already defined. In a medical science. Right.

00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:52.420
If that phenomenon has already been captured in a medical

00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:56.020
science. So why this has happened and then why why I'm

00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:58.000
giving you this treatment and why I'm recommending you for

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.080
this operation that operation. So basically the doctor

00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:03.840
explains everything right explain everything to its

00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:08.500
basically like to its patient right. In the similar manner

00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:12.380
right. And that too in a very plain why I'm giving example

00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:15.420
of a doctor because obviously me as a patient I will not be

00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:18.280
able to understand those medical terms. It's very complex

00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:22.000
for me. Right. And for most of us it's very complex I think

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.220
for 99.9 percent of us it's very complex. I was not a very

00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:28.160
good biology student and even though I was a very good one I

00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:30.840
will not be able to understand something sometimes that they

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:35.360
technically use internally right. During their diagnosis or

00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:38.660
during the learning phase. So basically what they will do

00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:41.640
they will try to explain it to me in a layman way so that I

00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:44.340
will be able to understand that OK this is something which I

00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:47.600
am facing this was the reason. Maybe I should stop this stop

00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:50.940
that or maybe I should go for this treatment in a similar

00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:55.340
manner. Right. In a similar manner you can you can basically

00:55:55.340 --> 00:56:00.020
like ask a creative agent right agent you can just give

00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:03.060
instruction that OK whenever some question will come to you

00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:05.860
do one thing. First of all try to break down those questions

00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:09.740
in as many possible states as possible. Then try to

00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:13.460
understand a user user from its user's past history then try

00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:16.600
to collect our data. About this question about a user.

00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:21.340
Right. Then try to produce some sort of answer now. So in

00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:25.700
this way obviously like a system will. So if I'm going to

00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:28.220
create this kind of agent and if I'm deployed with the chat

00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:33.080
system obviously it will give me a lot better answer as

00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:36.300
compared to direct generative answer. Right. Which which any

00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:39.980
system is generating by the way. So this is called as

00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:43.140
explainable agent and technically whenever we create our

00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:45.920
agents obviously. We try to like a give a breakdown of the

00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:50.220
steps and then we say that OK fine so just like give it and

00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:52.600
then we try to give you an evidence to the agent or maybe

00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:55.180
some sort of example to the agents. This is called as

00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:59.220
explainable. Nothing this is something that we practice on a

00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:01.980
regular basis. Nothing new. How do you implement agent

00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:06.400
debugging and monitoring. OK. So agent debugging and

00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:11.440
monitoring. So first of all if I have to do a monitoring I

00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:14.840
will for a lang system. So I will try to use a lang smith

00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:17.400
for that lang graph especially for lang graph I will be

00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:21.000
using lang smith for lang chain I will be using maybe a lang

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:24.460
serve right for like a monitoring. I can try to use even

00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:28.820
open telemetry for a monitoring. Now if I have to basically

00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:32.540
like a log technically I have to log each and everything

00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:36.820
right latencies errors like input output replies everything

00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:40.980
I have to log. So maybe I will be using like Prometheus and

00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:43.980
Grafana for dashboarding and logging by the way. And just

00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:46.760
for a error logging so I will end up using a Sentry. These

00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:49.640
are the standard tool that we try to use it right. So which

00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:52.140
helps me out in terms of logging each and everything

00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:54.920
monitoring each and everything I use as consumptions input

00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:59.160
output latency and then eventually it will help me out in

00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:02.620
terms of even debugging if there will be some error comes

00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:07.060
into a picture in future basically. So this is how we can

00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:11.340
try to implement debugging and monitoring. Now moving to the

00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:14.700
next section. Architecture and design question hope till

00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:21.270
this point it's clear yeah I think I think we are doing a

00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:26.820
good discussion like what do you think guys like it's it's

00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:29.980
like a revision of everything and it's like we are we are

00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:33.080
trying to call multiple things again and again and again. So

00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:38.540
kind of summary right kind of summary and I believe that was

00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:41.660
the whole objective of this particular these lectures

00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:44.760
interview lectures by the way. Right. So we can come

00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:47.820
together and then we can try to you know recall those

00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:51.480
concept in a storytelling way because this is what we'll do

00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:55.920
we'll go to interview and we'll do that right. So everything

00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:58.120
should be on our fingertips by the way amazing discussion

00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:01.300
yeah we are covering a lot of grounds yeah and some new

00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:06.100
terms again some new terms as per the questions right. Yes

00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:08.020
mostly covered in the live classes obviously in live

00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:10.520
classes. So we don't go in a question answer way in live

00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:15.240
classes we generally go in a implementation. Right. But

00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:19.620
yeah. So this is something by which you just recall those

00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:23.020
things because what what happens right. So in live classes

00:59:23.020 --> 00:59:26.060
let's suppose I'm discussing something and maybe there will

00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:29.200
be some sort of a loophole in between some concepts but here

00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:33.120
so we are again trying to you know summarize we are trying

00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:37.660
to connect things so this will build a good memory for all

00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:43.640
of us. Now next question is architecture and. I. I. I would

00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:45.960
have cleared my last week interview if I had gone through

00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:49.280
these questions. Technically I have given you this questions

00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:52.300
10 not 10 days back now I think it's a 12 days back right

00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:55.980
and technically I have asked all of you right and even when

00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:58.720
I was giving you this when I have shared this entire seat

00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:01.460
with all of you I simply said that that believe me no one

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:04.320
will cross this limit means no one will cross this limit and

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:06.420
even today I'm telling you that no one will cross this limit

01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:12.900
right and I asked you that OK create a resume create a DPR.

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:15.700
Detailed project report based on the project discussion that

01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:18.360
I have done in a beginning the architectural discussion of

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:22.380
the use cases right build your DPR send it to me I'll review

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:25.120
it and then go for the interview then you will be ready and

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:28.940
then prepare these questions right and if you have not done

01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:30.260
that then I'm not at a fault.

01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:38.820
Sir I think these days you are launching courses mostly on

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:43.880
Agenia yeah because it's in a demand right see we have to

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:46.560
run this as a company obviously we have to generate a

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:50.840
revenue and otherwise survival will be difficult for me and

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:54.200
my team so yeah and people are looking for a generative AI

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:58.400
more and more so obviously I have to fulfill the gap I have

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.180
to fulfill the demand so

01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:05.300
that's the reason but not just generative AI I think AIML

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:08.360
batch I'm going to start from next week right I don't know

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:10.900
many of you are aware about it or not but yeah so basically

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:15.180
those who would like to learn AIML or maybe do a revision so

01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:18.480
maybe you can come to this batch AIML masters which I'm

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.120
going to launch for you.

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:40.420
So if you

01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:43.580
have a time or maybe if you would like to revise or maybe if

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:46.540
your neighbor or your friends are looking for something like

01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:50.240
this maybe go ahead with this one and yeah second one is for

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.980
a kids basically so I have decided that I'll go and I'll try

01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:57.120
to teach to my young generation as well so there is a young

01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:01.600
Indian on for grade 6 till 12 so this is going to start I

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:05.740
believe from 4th of October right so next to next week by

01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:08.880
the way so maybe like a children's can join this particular

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:11.920
batch and they can enjoy at least they can they can learn

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:15.240
something about AI that's the whole intention I don't have

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:18.440
an intention to you know they will be able to build

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:20.660
something. Okay. I have already mentioned that in a syllabus

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:25.280
part but I just want them to be aware about the AI that okay

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:30.060
how AI works and then what is the actual capability of an AI

01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:31.120
thank

01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:36.820
you always LLM ops interview progression I mean like don't

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:39.780
start demanding for everything first of all complete

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:43.660
something which which is like in your hand so when I say I'm

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:45.960
launching this that right then people will say this this

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:48.880
this launch this launch that I mean like you want you need

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:53.780
only one job right. In one role in one domain then why you

01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:56.740
are looking for everything first complete one complete your

01:02:56.740 --> 01:03:00.640
target and then like look for something different I know

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:02.940
because you will not be able to take a load of multiple

01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:07.480
batches or like multiple learnings or multiple tracks so

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:11.960
just follow one track at a time complete it get some sort of

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:16.240
outcome and then jump into the next otherwise you will keep

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:19.000
on jumping and you will keep on complaining to yourself that

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.380
I was not able to do that. Don't do it one thing at a time

01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:29.240
only your brain is a single threaded system even though if

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:32.740
you think that you are a multitasker but you are not this is

01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:37.600
how human brain has been designed otherwise

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:43.030
you will become a computer and you will lose all your human

01:03:43.030 --> 01:03:48.930
properties okay moving next that was just a joke can

01:03:53.310 --> 01:03:55.730
you chalk out the plan which course if you're complete

01:03:55.730 --> 01:03:59.010
beginner. Right in a AI ML complete beginner you don't know

01:03:59.010 --> 01:04:01.510
anything about AI you don't know anything about the

01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:05.490
programming then simple start with AI ML or start with my

01:04:05.490 --> 01:04:09.430
FSDS full data science batch that is also available or start

01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:12.370
with any of my python batches or maybe Ramindra is also

01:04:12.370 --> 01:04:14.430
taking python so you can start with python batches because

01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:17.730
python is an important one then second obviously like stats

01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:20.190
then machine learning deep learning go with that track

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:25.190
basically if you are trying to jump directly into a

01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:28.110
generative AI then again you can start with Python after

01:04:28.110 --> 01:04:31.610
that skip all the parts don't no need to know about like

01:04:31.610 --> 01:04:33.450
machine learning deep learning all those things directly

01:04:33.450 --> 01:04:39.670
jump into my generative AI boot camp simple your statement

01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:45.360
is becoming quotes okay so yeah maybe you can use it for a

01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:51.960
social media post sometime now let's talk about Salyug move

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:56.400
ahead or we are done so we have discussed 15 questions by

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:57.700
the way for today. Okay.

01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:11.120
So design

01:05:15.730 --> 01:05:19.710
a multi-model JNI system that processes text image and audio

01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:23.670
I believe we have already taken this question even in past

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:28.210
right multi like a agent system so here it's a multi-model

01:05:28.210 --> 01:05:31.550
previously it was a multi-agent system which can like you

01:05:31.550 --> 01:05:36.990
know take a feed from the multiple system right so basically

01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:41.530
again we'll try to here it's clearly mentioned that text

01:05:41.530 --> 01:05:44.290
image and audio. So obviously if I'm talking about a text so

01:05:44.290 --> 01:05:47.750
maybe I can think about a GPT-40 or maybe cloud at 3.0 if

01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:50.330
I'm talking about a vision so in that case I can try to use

01:05:50.330 --> 01:05:55.270
a model called as a clip blip or maybe a JNI provision model

01:05:55.270 --> 01:05:58.530
I can try to use if I'm talking about the images audio wise

01:05:58.530 --> 01:06:01.630
so speech model wise I can try to use a speech model from

01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:06.710
maybe a whisper API speech to text and from 11 labs as I

01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:08.570
have already mentioned the previous example or previous

01:06:08.570 --> 01:06:11.310
answer 11 labs is something that I can try to use for text

01:06:11.310 --> 01:06:14.790
to speech. So speech to text whisper and from text to speech

01:06:14.790 --> 01:06:17.810
11 labs I can try to use and then on top of this one

01:06:17.810 --> 01:06:20.390
orchestration framework wise I can try to use langchain,

01:06:20.410 --> 01:06:23.230
langrap, init and crew AI anything that I want right these

01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:25.650
are the orchestration framework which will like club

01:06:25.650 --> 01:06:31.550
everything together. Let's discuss till 120 okay so 120 let

01:06:31.550 --> 01:06:35.630
me finish this entire things like till 130 then yeah till

01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:38.330
130 I'll finish this entire section so that we can start

01:06:38.330 --> 01:06:41.270
with the okay so next section is basically about a

01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:42.170
leadership section. So next section is basically about a

01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:43.570
leadership section. These are this is not a technical one

01:06:43.570 --> 01:06:47.510
this is like kind of a non-tech question basically yeah so

01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:53.050
let me like a close it till 130 for today okay how do you

01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:56.410
architect a generic system for a enterprise deployment fine

01:06:56.410 --> 01:07:00.450
so I think study I have discussed seven to eight layers so

01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:03.210
technically that layer will come into a picture so whenever

01:07:03.210 --> 01:07:06.650
we talk about a generative AI system for a enterprise

01:07:06.650 --> 01:07:10.130
deployment so just remember that particular part which I

01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:12.630
have already discussed in very very detail I believe. I

01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:15.870
think that system is still open yeah so there will be entry

01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:19.510
point API gateway orchestrator custom model retriever maybe

01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:23.410
catching maybe safety observability and data or event hub

01:07:23.410 --> 01:07:26.470
right so these layers that I have discussed yesterday that

01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:29.910
was with respect to the enterprise application and the

01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:33.550
project and the layers which I have already discussed in a

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:37.970
beginning again that was for a enterprise deployment so just

01:07:37.970 --> 01:07:42.530
go ahead with that. Now. So what is the idea? approach for

01:07:42.530 --> 01:07:45.510
building a generic system with the microservices first of

01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:47.730
all those who are not aware about this term called as

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:50.910
microservice let me explain you that part see microservices

01:07:50.910 --> 01:07:54.110
are basically a style in layman way it's basically a style

01:07:54.110 --> 01:07:58.830
style means what so instead of building a multiple feature

01:07:58.830 --> 01:08:03.450
all together in a single code base right what i can do i can

01:08:03.450 --> 01:08:08.150
try to separate a code base for like a small small feature

01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:11.630
that is something called as microservices right that is

01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:15.470
something called as microservices so that i will be able to

01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:19.370
scale a particular service as per the need i will be able to

01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:23.350
modify each and every services as per the need and then i

01:08:23.350 --> 01:08:25.430
can i can do anything with respect to a particular services

01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:29.890
for example i'll tell you one thing in terms of any website

01:08:29.890 --> 01:08:32.370
that you are able to see any portal that you are able to see

01:08:32.370 --> 01:08:35.590
so let's suppose i'm designing a entire lms portal for

01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:38.550
example your own portal so what i will do i'll just try to

01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:42.470
like build it in a microservice you as a microservice mode

01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:47.230
basically right so where there will be a separate code base

01:08:47.230 --> 01:08:50.090
or there will be a separate solution just for the login and

01:08:50.090 --> 01:08:53.830
authorization there will be a separate code base just for my

01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:56.630
so basically plug and play kind of a model right so for

01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:59.530
login just for the login there will be a separate code base

01:08:59.530 --> 01:09:02.390
just for playing a video there will be a separate code base

01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:04.790
just for sending a notification separate service itself

01:09:04.790 --> 01:09:07.330
separate code base itself right a separate service separate

01:09:07.330 --> 01:09:09.790
application i'll try to build there will be a separate

01:09:09.790 --> 01:09:14.430
services for my resume ai separate services just to

01:09:14.430 --> 01:09:16.730
implement a uri again inside uri there can be multiple

01:09:16.730 --> 01:09:20.970
services so when i try to build a system in this way right

01:09:20.970 --> 01:09:25.410
when i try to detach all the major services uh so i used to

01:09:25.410 --> 01:09:28.270
get a lot of flexibility flexibility in terms of improving

01:09:28.270 --> 01:09:32.530
the features flexibility in terms of basically uh scaling it

01:09:32.530 --> 01:09:36.870
so let's suppose if one of the service needs a lot of

01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:40.130
compute or maybe a lot of bandwidth i can try to provide i

01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:43.410
don't have to like scale the entire system so i just have to

01:09:43.410 --> 01:09:46.690
scale one small services out of this one so these are the

01:09:46.690 --> 01:09:49.310
advantages obviously i will be able to get it in case of a

01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:54.330
micro service mode of development and obviously it will be

01:09:54.330 --> 01:09:58.630
more manageable right more manageable in this particular way

01:09:58.630 --> 01:10:01.890
anyone can come they can try to like read out they can check

01:10:01.890 --> 01:10:04.330
like what is the input what is the output and then they will

01:10:04.330 --> 01:10:07.590
be able to do some sort of a modification now similarly so

01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:11.410
when we are trying to build a generative ai system system

01:10:11.410 --> 01:10:16.210
right so obviously we are going to use some sort of a text

01:10:16.210 --> 01:10:19.810
generation image generation embedding services some sort of

01:10:19.810 --> 01:10:22.190
a reg services we are going to take some sort of a

01:10:22.190 --> 01:10:25.570
moderation services so what we can do is that that we can

01:10:25.570 --> 01:10:28.930
try to build all of the services in a independent mode yeah

01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:32.570
independent mode independently and one service i can try to

01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:35.390
expose to the other service via api or via rest i would say

01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:38.830
right or maybe a gprc call i can try to uh like you know

01:10:38.830 --> 01:10:41.590
expose to the other service and then i can say that okay

01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:45.970
fine so my like entire things is micro service like uh it's

01:10:45.970 --> 01:10:48.950
it's been built as a micro services otherwise it will be

01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:52.850
monolithic by the way means everything all together right

01:10:52.850 --> 01:10:57.050
one big application uh together so generally when we try to

01:10:57.050 --> 01:10:59.770
build mvps we try to don't we don't follow these micro

01:10:59.770 --> 01:11:02.470
services when you are literally building a very very big

01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:05.570
application right that you know that okay fine so it will go

01:11:05.570 --> 01:11:08.190
for the very uh biggest scale and we are building for next

01:11:08.190 --> 01:11:11.670
one generation or maybe one decade then obviously you should

01:11:11.670 --> 01:11:13.610
go and you should follow the micro service architecture

01:11:13.610 --> 01:11:17.430
generally we do it uh with respect to all the big product

01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:21.910
now next one so how do you design a generic system for a

01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:25.950
edge deployment what is the meaning of edge deployment so

01:11:25.950 --> 01:11:30.150
deploying this lm models on edge devices for example uh

01:11:30.150 --> 01:11:35.550
coral right gold coral uh jetson nano again like uh nvidia

01:11:35.550 --> 01:11:38.970
is having a multiple series and jetson nano jvr a lot of

01:11:38.970 --> 01:11:42.630
series nvidia keep on launching now raspberry pi or maybe

01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:46.570
your android or ios mobile devices so if you have to deploy

01:11:46.570 --> 01:11:50.710
those models so basically you can't deploy the raw model or

01:11:50.710 --> 01:11:53.870
the original models right you have to quantize those models

01:11:53.870 --> 01:11:56.610
or maybe you have to build a model with the help of

01:11:56.610 --> 01:12:00.330
digitalization right where you will try to reduce a size

01:12:00.330 --> 01:12:04.010
because your system can process those models there is a

01:12:04.010 --> 01:12:07.150
possibility but your mobile devices or your edge devices

01:12:07.150 --> 01:12:10.670
will be having a very very limited compute right maybe 1gb

01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:14.990
of a ram right so on that kind of a compute if you have to

01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:19.050
execute it you can't go and like you know dump those model

01:12:19.050 --> 01:12:22.710
as it is so quantization right quantization is something

01:12:22.710 --> 01:12:25.350
that we try to do or distillation is something that we try

01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:28.450
to do so that my model can run on a jetson nano kind of a

01:12:28.450 --> 01:12:31.070
devices raspberry pi kind of devices or coral kind of

01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:34.930
devices or on my mobile or on my like android is kind of a

01:12:34.930 --> 01:12:38.670
mobile right so the tech stack that we try to use in general

01:12:38.670 --> 01:12:41.910
is onx runtime we can use there is something called as

01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:47.170
tensor RT so that is also a tech stack for like a building

01:12:47.170 --> 01:12:50.090
something or deploying something on a edge devices there is

01:12:50.090 --> 01:12:52.630
something called as hugging face we already know right but

01:12:52.630 --> 01:12:55.790
there is something called as hugging face optimum right

01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:58.530
hugging face optimum if you go and search so again that

01:12:58.530 --> 01:13:01.330
provides you a flexibility in terms of deploying or in terms

01:13:01.330 --> 01:13:05.370
of building this quantize or the slice model basically and

01:13:05.370 --> 01:13:08.330
with the help of that we do it and we we do it a lot by the

01:13:08.330 --> 01:13:12.010
way yeah we do it a lot even I'm doing it since very very

01:13:12.010 --> 01:13:15.810
long time like not just a LLM basically so I think since

01:13:15.810 --> 01:13:17.650
last seven to eight years so we are doing a lot of

01:13:17.650 --> 01:13:20.510
deployment with respect to like you know our vision models

01:13:20.510 --> 01:13:23.910
because even vision models will be very very high and the

01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:27.630
inferencing will be very much costly in terms of compute so

01:13:27.630 --> 01:13:30.330
we have been like building such kind of a solution since

01:13:30.330 --> 01:13:35.050
seven to eight year I would say yeah we what are the

01:13:35.050 --> 01:13:38.630
consideration for building a gen ai system in a cloud okay

01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:43.030
so I think cost wise it should be optimized it should go for

01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:46.190
the auto scale if I'm talking about the cloud a security

01:13:46.190 --> 01:13:50.690
group basically means I am I have to control that serverless

01:13:50.690 --> 01:13:53.850
option for a light task so all these things we have to think

01:13:53.850 --> 01:13:56.510
whenever we are thinking about the any kind of a generic

01:13:56.510 --> 01:14:00.370
system on the cloud so cloud wise I believe AWS provides

01:14:00.370 --> 01:14:03.550
provides you that kind of a solution for example AWS

01:14:03.550 --> 01:14:08.330
SageMaker right GCP vortex AI Azure ML Lambda services all

01:14:08.330 --> 01:14:12.510
of these cloud services are providing services for the same

01:14:12.510 --> 01:14:16.870
thing now how do you architect a generic system for a real

01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:19.710
time application I believe I have already given an answer

01:14:19.710 --> 01:14:23.650
with respect to a project right so obviously it should be

01:14:23.650 --> 01:14:27.110
like a work with a very low latency it should like it should

01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:31.010
be cheap basically it should be like always work with the

01:14:31.010 --> 01:14:35.010
async processing so yeah this is how we do it and I think I

01:14:35.010 --> 01:14:38.370
talked about a vllm not just talk about it we have even used

01:14:38.370 --> 01:14:42.430
a vllm and we have hosted our own view right that is one of

01:14:42.430 --> 01:14:47.550
the example but yeah those those are just a small part the

01:14:47.550 --> 01:14:50.850
big part was the project that we have discussed in the

01:14:50.850 --> 01:14:53.750
beginning what is the approach for building a generic system

01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:57.350
with the high availability okay so if we have we are

01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:59.890
building some sort of a system which should be available uh

01:14:59.890 --> 01:15:03.910
like a hospital by the way 24 by 7 to us so in that case

01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:07.350
obviously we have to productionize it with a multi-node

01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:10.390
system so we will not take just one or two machine it should

01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:13.670
be a cluster on which we have to deploy plus we have to add

01:15:13.670 --> 01:15:17.370
a load balancer over there right plus we have to basically

01:15:17.370 --> 01:15:20.430
like uh you know configure it for a automatic failover that

01:15:20.430 --> 01:15:24.250
if there will be a failover then what system should do right

01:15:24.250 --> 01:15:27.990
and keeping that in our mind so we can try to take nginx

01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:30.910
envoy which I have discussed yesterday as well uh Kubernetes

01:15:30.910 --> 01:15:35.250
services I can try to consider consider or maybe like a aws

01:15:35.250 --> 01:15:39.710
ecr acs kind of services I can try to consider for this high

01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:43.330
availability but simply means that that host it on a multi

01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:47.230
-node right that to you know multi-reasons basically and if

01:15:47.230 --> 01:15:50.150
you are doing it then you are able to design like a system

01:15:50.150 --> 01:15:54.610
with a high availability now how do you design a generic

01:15:54.610 --> 01:15:58.890
system for a global deployment yeah global deployment for a

01:15:58.890 --> 01:16:01.150
global deployment obviously multi-reason this is the meaning

01:16:01.150 --> 01:16:04.290
of a global right so data centers should be across a

01:16:04.290 --> 01:16:06.590
different different region so if I'm like serving European

01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:07.710
reason USA reason

01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:13.130
available my data centers should be available in all the

01:16:13.130 --> 01:16:16.510
regions that is one uh second one is basically a studio

01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:18.990
implementation right so maybe cloudflare studio

01:16:18.990 --> 01:16:21.470
implementation i'll go ahead with uh content delivery

01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:24.890
network which will make my like a system fast localization

01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:27.770
right localization localization means basically whenever

01:16:27.770 --> 01:16:31.610
some traffic is coming so a local server so basically it

01:16:31.610 --> 01:16:34.550
will be able to identify the geolocation of the service or

01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:37.910
the of the hit or maybe of the traffic and then it will

01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:43.790
route the like a request to a local one not to some other uh

01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:47.950
reason so localization of the entire services we can try to

01:16:47.950 --> 01:16:50.890
implement in this way we can do a global deployment i

01:16:50.890 --> 01:16:53.010
believe nothing new we have already discussed it it's a

01:16:53.010 --> 01:16:56.810
repeated kind of a question what are the considerations for

01:16:56.810 --> 01:17:00.270
building geni system with the compliances okay so compliance

01:17:00.270 --> 01:17:04.370
means obviously uh kind of a legal note right so let's

01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:05.410
suppose if i'm trying to build a jni system with compliance

01:17:05.410 --> 01:17:05.410
right so i have a jni system with compliance right so i have

01:17:05.410 --> 01:17:08.750
a build something for a europe gdpr will be applicable right

01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:12.270
because european region follow gdpr strictly if i'm building

01:17:12.270 --> 01:17:15.410
something for a health care then hippa will come into a

01:17:15.410 --> 01:17:18.810
picture for a health care basically right so gdpr generally

01:17:18.810 --> 01:17:22.130
for a europe and hippa so whatever clauses that they have

01:17:22.130 --> 01:17:24.370
mentioned i have to follow that right for example they have

01:17:24.370 --> 01:17:26.190
mentioned that their data should be available in their

01:17:26.190 --> 01:17:29.490
region only so obviously i should not host any server so

01:17:29.490 --> 01:17:33.390
which should be out of that reason because it is going to

01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:37.010
breach a legal law of that particular land if i'm selling

01:17:37.010 --> 01:17:40.770
some services in that particular region and that is

01:17:40.770 --> 01:17:44.130
something that you will be able to find out in aws azure and

01:17:44.130 --> 01:17:47.530
everything is configurable by the way right so as per the

01:17:47.530 --> 01:17:51.170
law everything can configure it in whatever like a like a

01:17:51.170 --> 01:17:53.630
services that you are using maybe a cloud services you are

01:17:53.630 --> 01:17:57.410
using you will be able to configure it as simple as that now

01:17:57.410 --> 01:17:59.530
how do you architect a jna application for a multi-reason

01:17:59.530 --> 01:18:03.350
deployment i don't have to architect much here right i don't

01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:07.750
have to basically architect like many things over here

01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:12.230
because if i'm using a ek services it handles automatically

01:18:12.230 --> 01:18:17.250
right aws global accelerator it handles automatically so it

01:18:17.250 --> 01:18:19.810
will be i just have to do a configuration so basically a

01:18:19.810 --> 01:18:24.070
configuration for a geo routing so i will try to like my

01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:26.270
system will try to understand that okay fine from where

01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:28.990
traffic is coming and it will try to send to the nearest

01:18:28.990 --> 01:18:29.830
possible server so i will try to send to the nearest

01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:31.850
possible server right it will send that request to the

01:18:31.850 --> 01:18:36.750
nearest possible server as simple as that and again so i

01:18:36.750 --> 01:18:39.170
have to configure from my site so i should keep all my

01:18:39.170 --> 01:18:42.610
databases in sync right all my model weights and everything

01:18:42.610 --> 01:18:46.950
in sync so that everyone should be able to get uh like in a

01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:49.750
in a zero downtime so everyone should be able to see the

01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:52.050
exact same thing the services which i'm selling in one

01:18:52.050 --> 01:18:54.730
region or maybe into the other region this is the only thing

01:18:54.730 --> 01:18:57.610
which i have to handle apart from that this is a kind of a

01:18:57.610 --> 01:19:00.310
configuration just one click configuration nowadays it's not

01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:03.110
a big headache for any one of us what is the approach for

01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:06.370
building a jni system with the data governance okay so what

01:19:06.370 --> 01:19:08.810
is the meaning of data governance first of all uh we have to

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:12.010
understand that right so it's just like a if i'll talk about

01:19:12.010 --> 01:19:16.010
data governance technically it's like a like a owning a

01:19:16.010 --> 01:19:19.290
library or maybe maintaining a library so i should always

01:19:19.290 --> 01:19:24.030
know that uh who owns what kind of a book what book who owns

01:19:24.030 --> 01:19:27.310
who have taken or who have borrowed which book who is

01:19:27.310 --> 01:19:29.690
reading what kind of a books in library this is what happens

01:19:29.850 --> 01:19:32.350
we go to library we borrow the books we go to library we

01:19:32.350 --> 01:19:35.790
read the books right uh so basically this is something

01:19:35.790 --> 01:19:39.490
called as a data governance so where uh we should always uh

01:19:39.490 --> 01:19:43.430
like understand that who should have what kind of a data

01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:45.890
access everyone should not have all kind of a data access

01:19:45.890 --> 01:19:49.650
right not neither a model not even a human being everyone

01:19:49.650 --> 01:19:52.710
should not have all the function access right so basically

01:19:52.710 --> 01:19:56.750
we try to define a role based things and uh yeah so we

01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:59.810
should always also track that on where data is coming and

01:19:59.810 --> 01:19:59.830
then we should always understand that what kind of a data

01:19:59.830 --> 01:20:02.410
access right are we breaching the trust or are we reaching

01:20:02.410 --> 01:20:05.290
breaching the law of the land right so are we doing

01:20:05.290 --> 01:20:07.410
something with the data which we were not supposed to i

01:20:07.410 --> 01:20:10.330
believe yesterday uh we talked about the story a lot right

01:20:10.330 --> 01:20:13.650
data governance story so in this way you will be able to

01:20:13.650 --> 01:20:16.550
manage it basically a data governance so it's it's more like

01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:19.150
a like i have already mentioned yesterday that it's more

01:20:19.150 --> 01:20:23.830
like an intention right so basically it comes from the

01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:26.810
intention and then you just like uh tune your system

01:20:26.810 --> 01:20:31.250
accordingly uh basically so this is something called as data

01:20:31.250 --> 01:20:33.590
governance now there is something called as how do you

01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:37.610
design a generic system uh for audit and compliances okay so

01:20:37.610 --> 01:20:41.850
basically we try to like uh you know configure a log system

01:20:41.850 --> 01:20:45.230
so maybe a splunk maybe a data dog maybe elastic stack so

01:20:45.230 --> 01:20:49.550
elk we try to like uh attach to it and uh we will keep on

01:20:49.550 --> 01:20:52.610
like uh getting the dashboards we will keep on getting our

01:20:52.610 --> 01:20:55.610
flags we will keep on getting the alerts and then based on

01:20:55.610 --> 01:20:59.110
that we try to audit and we try to maintain the compliances

01:20:59.110 --> 01:21:03.510
yeah okay now so what are the consideration for building a

01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:08.510
generative ai system with security okay so basically like uh

01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:11.510
we talked about the guardrails yeah we talked about the

01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:13.170
guardrails so there is something called as guardrails ai

01:21:13.170 --> 01:21:16.070
there is something called as nemo guardrails from nvidia we

01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:19.230
have already discussed uh a iam comes into a picture and

01:21:19.230 --> 01:21:22.450
access management comes into a picture uh vault for managing

01:21:22.450 --> 01:21:25.650
the secrets even adobe is providing your vault right our

01:21:25.650 --> 01:21:29.550
other system is also providing your walls so this is how i

01:21:29.550 --> 01:21:32.430
will try to implement so combination of this is going to

01:21:32.430 --> 01:21:35.650
give me the security right so generative system with the

01:21:35.650 --> 01:21:38.290
security so basically the very first part which i will do

01:21:38.290 --> 01:21:41.350
with the data is encrypt everything yesterday i talked about

01:21:41.350 --> 01:21:44.130
it right so encrypt everything when data is moving from one

01:21:44.130 --> 01:21:46.290
system to other system or client side to server side server

01:21:46.290 --> 01:21:49.710
side to client side the way whatsapp is doing right so we

01:21:49.710 --> 01:21:51.770
should control each and everything with the help of role

01:21:51.770 --> 01:21:54.270
-based access everyone should not have every kind of access

01:21:54.270 --> 01:21:57.630
it should be a role-based right so protect against the

01:21:57.630 --> 01:22:01.830
prompt injection right now guardrails obviously comes into a

01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:04.210
picture so which will come to by which you will be able to

01:22:04.210 --> 01:22:08.130
control even a tone even output even a input with respect to

01:22:08.130 --> 01:22:10.750
any kind of a generative ai application maybe agentic or

01:22:10.750 --> 01:22:15.290
maybe with respect to just a lms so this is how you can like

01:22:15.290 --> 01:22:19.310
implement a security and safety and by default this will

01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:21.790
come into picture and i think we talked about this one more

01:22:21.790 --> 01:22:25.890
than 20 times now about like guardrail security and safety

01:22:25.890 --> 01:22:31.210
about these terms now 124 number question says that that how

01:22:31.210 --> 01:22:35.130
do you architect a generative ai system for a privacy

01:22:35.130 --> 01:22:41.680
protection okay so basically privacy means personal data

01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:44.980
right personal data basically like a safe this is something

01:22:44.980 --> 01:22:49.380
called as like a privacy protection like i said it's it's

01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:53.940
more like an intention right then implementation so if

01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:57.240
company is intended to do it they will do it otherwise they

01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:58.920
will just like make an intention and then they will do it

01:22:58.920 --> 01:22:59.560
and then they will do it and then make a statement that we

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:02.460
are doing it but yeah it just depends upon them so it's more

01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:05.300
like an intention so you can say that yeah we were doing it

01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:07.660
so we were not storing any kind of our data which we were

01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:10.860
not authorized to this is the story you can build up but

01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:14.100
technically yeah it's an intention game what is the approach

01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:17.920
for building generative system with the ethical ai okay uh

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:25.400
again more more or less like a previous one right so

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:29.240
basically like a trans you should keep always a transparent

01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:33.720
you should always avoid the harmful input and output right

01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:37.760
so this by this you will be able to build the ethical ai how

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:41.920
do you design generic system for a bias uh mitigation it

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:45.220
should not be biased so basically to mitigate a bias the

01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:47.800
story will start from the data right if your data is biased

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:50.700
then obviously model response or model generation is going

01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:53.760
to be biased so it depends upon first a training data

01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:56.700
because that was the source of truth for any model that you

01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:59.460
are building right or any model that you are using So you

01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:03.060
should keep a heavy check on your data side. So your data

01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:05.380
should not be or it is not supposed to be biased at all.

01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:09.780
Then when system is giving an output, you should always use

01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:12.700
some re-ranking tool, maybe a Kohira, maybe some re-ranker

01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:17.060
model, right, to re-rank the entire output. And then always

01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:20.440
give a priority to the highest ranking one. So maybe this is

01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:23.740
how you will be able to mitigate the bias part inside the

01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:27.760
module. And then always RLHF, right. So human feedback loop

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:30.900
is important. Human check is important. Unless and until you

01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:36.380
are not 100% sure about this one. Now, so just to mitigate a

01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:39.200
bias, there are a couple of framework that you will be able

01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:42.740
to find out in this world. Basically, there is something

01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:47.380
called as a fair learn dot bias. So improve of fairness in a

01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:50.640
AI system. Technically, it does the same thing that I was

01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:54.220
talking about. But yeah, there is a framework for that one.

01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:57.480
So you can just do people install like a fair learn. And

01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:00.140
then follow along. Follow along with their documentation and

01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:05.200
then you can try to use it, right. So technically, it is

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:08.080
going to check the data demographic, this, that. And then

01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:12.340
there's going to bring a fairness into your data set. Even

01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:17.520
if you're not using these frameworks, it's okay, right. It's

01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:20.740
completely fine. It's completely okay. You can try to like,

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:24.600
you know, do the implementation even without this library.

01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:28.320
Because this is just a piece of like a simple wrapping.

01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:32.480
Wrapper code, yeah, or you can try to use some bias

01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:35.640
detection model as well, yeah, so there is something called

01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:38.340
as like some bias detection model, you will be able to find

01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:41.820
out on hugging face for some of the use cases for especially

01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:45.360
for like a textual information, textual data, you can you

01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:49.180
can try to find out, right. So, so basically, this is going

01:25:49.180 --> 01:25:53.140
to check bias and fairness in AI. So models are also

01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:56.420
available frameworks are also available, but pretty much

01:25:56.420 --> 01:25:58.020
it's the same thing that we're talking about.

01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:05.200
Okay, so now what are the consideration for building

01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:09.540
generative AI system with the fairness, okay, so fairness,

01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:15.260
basically, like, I can try to use maybe this

01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:20.440
one fair learn to bring a fairness, right. So fair learn is

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:22.780
an open source community driven project to help a data

01:26:22.780 --> 01:26:25.040
scientist to improve our fairness in AI system, learn about

01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:29.540
AI fairness, or guide use cases access and mitigate fairness

01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:34.260
issue using a Python toolkit, okay. So basically, like it

01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:37.700
will try to bring to basically like something inside your

01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:41.060
data set something inside your across system. So, which will

01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:44.440
try to, you know, represent everyone and which will give

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:50.000
kind of an equal opportunity to every one for like AI that

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.780
you are trying to build. This is what is like a fairness is

01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:56.060
it will not like a do a biasing is at all. So this library

01:26:56.060 --> 01:26:58.540
is also already available. Again, there are models which is

01:26:58.540 --> 01:27:00.820
available. So maybe you can try to explore for bringing a

01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:04.020
fairness into your system. Maybe be able to use스�

01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:10.260
to change your actual data for this versed app for good,

01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:14.820
right, because this

01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:20.300
process is very, very updated and you get a very very good

01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:24.900
sense of format.

01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:32.740
And also, well and conceptually,

01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:36.060
the second point should be the first one that how you have

01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:39.280
actually acquired the data because that's a big question for

01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:42.920
all of us right we all know that uh they have acquired like

01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:47.660
uh all kind of a data without any kind of a consent right

01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:52.640
but yeah that's a big question so they should also like if

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:55.260
they would like to bring up fairness and transparency which

01:27:55.260 --> 01:27:58.440
they will not no one will by the way right because they will

01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:01.520
get into a lot of trouble and they will have to pay back a

01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:04.920
lot of money uh which they can't and they shouldn't i think

01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:10.320
they should but yeah they will not do it uh so like how you

01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:12.860
have acquired the data i think that that's the very first uh

01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:16.120
kind of a transparency that people should uh bring that

01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:18.380
that's the meaning of transparency that how your system is

01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:20.860
actually working what kind of data you are storing what kind

01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:25.120
of data you have used to train your ai model right how much

01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:28.480
my personal data has been used because everyone will be

01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:31.520
having concern with respect to a personal data right so when

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:34.240
i'm chatting with your system you are saying that you are

01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:37.440
not storing uh let's suppose i have not given a consent but

01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:40.460
how much data you are storing how you are able to understand

01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:43.940
my one month old chat although i'm chatting with on regular

01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:47.100
basis where you are storing it even though if i have cleared

01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:49.600
my cache and all these questions right which will come

01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:55.120
around a transparency so if you are like uh it's it's more

01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:58.280
like explanatory things right that okay what you are doing

01:28:58.280 --> 01:29:01.940
explain it to me that comes with the transparency so many

01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:04.540
company does that for their client but yeah the big one will

01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:07.820
never do it because entire globe is their client and

01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:10.460
especially a b2c will not do it b2b obviously you will have

01:29:10.460 --> 01:29:14.040
to go and you have to be very very transparent uh with your

01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:20.160
clients now next one is like uh 129 what is the approach for

01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:23.060
building generative system with accountability i think

01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:28.400
transparency accountability i mean like same thing so

01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:34.140
uh basically like uh accountability means uh how we are

01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:37.200
tracking how we are changing the model or how we are

01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:39.260
worsening all of these things comes with the accountability

01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:42.480
similar kind of a question i think since last four to four

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:45.340
or five times we are getting how do you design a gen ai

01:29:45.340 --> 01:29:50.160
system for a human oversight okay so human oversight means

01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:53.720
uh basically a kind of a system uh where human will be in

01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:56.240
loop human will keep on watching it will keep on giving a

01:29:56.240 --> 01:30:00.380
feedback rlhf dpo is one of the example right so where we

01:30:00.380 --> 01:30:01.620
build a model but yeah so for example if you have a system

01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:01.640
where you have a system where you have a gen ai system where

01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:01.640
you have a gen ai system where you have a gen ai system

01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:03.680
where you have a gen ai system so we try to keep basically

01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:08.940
human in a loop basically right even if you will talk about

01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:12.040
a lang smith they they provide you this rlhf options and

01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:16.400
majority of this new age platforms for building this ai

01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:19.340
application or genetic application they are providing you

01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:22.100
human in loop kind of a solution so this is how you will try

01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:27.580
to keep your generic system uh for a human oversight yeah so

01:30:27.580 --> 01:30:30.840
that human will keep on watching and uh they will keep on

01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:36.120
giving a few feedback so this is uh it till 130 guys and

01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:39.360
maybe next class we can try to start what do you want shall

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:42.200
we conduct a classes on saturday sunday or shall we keep it

01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:47.440
on monday tuesday so what what is your suggestion because my

01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:49.780
slot is available for this saturday sunday that's the reason

01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:52.640
i'm asking if my slot is next to next it will not be

01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:55.940
available because next to next i have a badge for children

01:30:55.940 --> 01:31:00.160
so uh this slot will not be available also like uh saturday

01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:02.580
sunday slot will not be available so monday tuesday only

01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:06.180
okay monday tuesday yeah i think we'll take only two classes

01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:11.080
we'll take monday tuesday and the 70 questions are left most

01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:16.060
of the questions from 131 till this one and then in a later

01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:18.200
stage when i was going through a question yeah leadership

01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:21.300
question and all those things so these are basically like a

01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:27.200
leadership solution means non-tech question by the way yeah

01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:30.300
but it's important it's important to handle a couple of like

01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:34.160
or counter couple of questions in an interview so max to max

01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:38.500
two days it will take for me monday tuesday and if your

01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:42.260
resume if your dpr is ready keep on sending your resume keep

01:31:42.260 --> 01:31:44.740
on sending your dpr and if you are preparing an answer for

01:31:44.740 --> 01:31:47.640
this one so maybe you can keep on sending me that as well

01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:50.740
that i have prepared uh an answer for this 15 question or 20

01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:54.580
of like entire 150 questions in your own way in your own

01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:57.300
version you can take a help from like a ai i don't have an

01:31:57.300 --> 01:32:00.080
issue with that uh but yeah so when you are writing an

01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:01.600
answer a few days before or after your resume when you are

01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:03.800
writing an answer please make sure that you have like you

01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:10.300
know like written those answer by yourself. Then only you

01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:13.340
will learn and you will be able to remember otherwise I can

01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:15.600
just dump this entire question in a chat GPT it will

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:17.380
generate it copy and paste and I will prepare the

01:32:17.380 --> 01:32:21.060
documentation. I mean like I can do it in a hundreds way in

01:32:21.060 --> 01:32:25.280
just a five minute. So I don't want that kind of a solution

01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:28.060
I want a solution where you have applied your brain you have

01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:30.040
gone through each and every question wherever architecture

01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:32.440
is required mentioned it wherever code is required you have

01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:35.320
mentioned it wherever technology is required some framework

01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:38.220
is required you have mentioned it right wherever a story is

01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:41.340
required you have mentioned it in your own way right. So I

01:32:41.340 --> 01:32:43.540
am looking for that kind of a solution I am not looking for

01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:46.280
just a generated solution. So if you are sending me a

01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:49.720
generated solution on one single template I think it's of no

01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:54.040
use for me and even like it's of no use for you yeah you

01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:55.880
will not learn anything and you will not be able to remember

01:32:55.880 --> 01:32:58.740
anything. I am asking you to do it so that you will revise

01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:03.320
you will explore right. With the help of AI. Monday Tuesday

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:06.360
fine let's go ahead with Monday Tuesday then let's complete

01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:09.340
this batch on Monday Tuesday. Okay fine then Monday Tuesday

01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:12.060
I will not take class on Saturday Sunday for this batch. We

01:33:12.060 --> 01:33:15.200
have Python, DSA, Bootcamp, Generative AI. You will be

01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:17.900
having another 10 batches by the way and on Sunday Saturday

01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:21.100
itself. So you can't come and like you can't come and say

01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:25.000
that I have this batch or I have that batch right because

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:28.420
see mostly people will be available on Saturday and Sunday

01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:30.740
and they come for Saturday Saturday. Sunday batches so

01:33:30.740 --> 01:33:32.900
generally we have to launch those batches on Saturday Sunday

01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:36.060
itself. So we just have like those like a two days in our

01:33:36.060 --> 01:33:39.180
hand out of the entire week to launch any of these batches

01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:41.320
and people are demanding like a lot of batches. So obviously

01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:44.380
we have to bring those lot of batches obviously there will

01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:47.940
be an overlap. I can't keep all those batches like a

01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:51.600
separate and it's timing like a separate. You have to decide

01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:55.180
that which one you are going to join. I know all of you are

01:33:55.180 --> 01:34:01.010
not going to join all the batches yeah so for example like

01:34:01.010 --> 01:34:05.010
I'm going to launch this AIML right and then after that I'm

01:34:05.010 --> 01:34:07.170
going to launch again a Generative AI. Obviously it will

01:34:07.170 --> 01:34:10.290
overlap with some of the other batches which is running on

01:34:10.290 --> 01:34:13.690
the platform. So you can decide that which one you should

01:34:13.690 --> 01:34:17.710
join and then maybe you can join next time because you have

01:34:17.710 --> 01:34:21.090
a plus access so you can join next of next batches as well

01:34:21.090 --> 01:34:28.190
for the entire year. Okay fine then guys just like do

01:34:28.190 --> 01:34:31.310
something do something with respect to your something.

01:34:31.390 --> 01:34:34.170
Someone has pinged a lot of things you know oh

01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:43.560
these links someone has pinged okay Nvidia Nemo fine then I

01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:46.500
don't have to like maintain those links it's it's already

01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:51.060
there inside your group that's amazing bye Rajesh. Any

01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:54.180
discount for renewal I think you can talk to a team right

01:34:54.180 --> 01:34:57.200
for renewal we are planning to increase the price by October

01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:01.540
last. It's like we are not able to generate a profit that's

01:35:01.540 --> 01:35:05.560
the reason so if we are very affordable. And too many things

01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:08.060
we are giving but yeah maybe you can talk to team so they

01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:10.300
will be able to help you out in something. I don't discuss

01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:11.240
these things by the way.

01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:17.810
How your kids are doing they're doing great recently I think

01:35:17.810 --> 01:35:20.570
on 14th dust tenders back nine days back so they have

01:35:20.570 --> 01:35:23.210
completed their one year so they're doing amazing.

01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:31.220
One thousand dollar not not that much obviously I can't

01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:32.740
charge it will be a loot.

01:35:36.730 --> 01:35:41.710
Okay fine everyone. So let's meet. Okay. So for this batch

01:35:41.710 --> 01:35:46.250
so for this discussion one thirtieth question onwards will

01:35:46.250 --> 01:35:49.850
start discussing it in next Monday next Monday and Tuesday

01:35:49.850 --> 01:35:52.150
will discuss it will complete will close the batch by next

01:35:52.150 --> 01:35:56.330
Monday Tuesday. So please keep your you know DPR and regime

01:35:56.330 --> 01:35:59.510
at least ready by that time. Otherwise believe me you will

01:35:59.510 --> 01:36:04.390
be having a regret. You will you will always think that that

01:36:04.390 --> 01:36:08.910
I had a chance I had a time to do it but I was not able to

01:36:08.910 --> 01:36:12.890
do it. So I don't I just don't want you to like you know

01:36:12.890 --> 01:36:15.850
have a regret in a later stage that you have wasted your

01:36:15.850 --> 01:36:20.190
time because that will be a biggest regret of your life. So

01:36:20.190 --> 01:36:25.830
simple you have a time just to start complete it believe me

01:36:25.830 --> 01:36:28.750
it's just a five to six hour of a task but yeah one time

01:36:28.750 --> 01:36:33.230
task in a entire lifespan maybe for generative AI and close

01:36:33.230 --> 01:36:35.770
it send it to me I'll review I'll give my feedback because

01:36:35.770 --> 01:36:38.230
whoever has sent it to me whoever have like a pinged me on

01:36:38.230 --> 01:36:41.130
my DM. Okay. I've already responded back with the resume and

01:36:41.130 --> 01:36:43.990
they have already rectified the things that I have asked for

01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:48.530
in the resume. So just do it simple. Don't keep this record

01:36:48.530 --> 01:36:50.630
for the very long time except

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.060
the LinkedIn request my request is already full. I can't

01:36:56.060 --> 01:36:58.960
because LinkedIn always gives you a limit of 30,000 it's

01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:03.360
like a already full long back except the LinkedIn request

01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:05.600
for who enrolled for your own plus I know I'm not selling

01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:08.600
that part with your own plus so that I have not mentioned by

01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:11.500
the way that I'll accept a LinkedIn request. I mentioned

01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:15.580
that I'll teach you so I'll teach you simple that that's

01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:19.540
that's not a feature. So basically jokes are the part but

01:37:19.540 --> 01:37:24.260
yeah so 30,000 is a limit that you can like accept in one

01:37:24.260 --> 01:37:27.280
LinkedIn account that was full I think two three years back

01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:32.080
itself. So I'm not able to accept any new request I have to

01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:34.640
remove someone then only I can like you know accept someone.

01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:41.260
So again people feel bad if I'm removing someone. Okay. Fine

01:37:41.260 --> 01:37:43.980
guys. Thank you so much. Take care and see you again next

01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:46.280
Monday and Tuesday for this particular discussion. Like I

01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:48.280
said next week we are closing the discussion for this match.

01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:50.500
Thank you. Take care everyone. Have a great day night ahead

01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:56.800

there. Thank you.
