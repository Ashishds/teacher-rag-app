WEBVTT

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.280
Okay, so hi everyone, good evening. I think we should wait

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.020
for some time.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.040
Okay, so I think I'm audible and visible to all of you,

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.580
right guys? So if you can say yes inside a chat, that will

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.040
be considered as a confirmation from all of you. Okay, so

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.400
people are saying yes, fine, thank you. And I believe all of

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.000
you are able to see everyone's chat. So let's start with the

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.300
class guys. So yesterday we had an induction session, so

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.080
where I was talking about a Euron platform. And I talked

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.600
about basically BAS, that what we are going to discuss and

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.020
what we are not going to discuss. Now in today's session, so

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.860
one by one, section by section. So let's try to talk about

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.880
the things that we have mentioned inside the syllabus. So

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.120
the very first part which I'm going to discuss in today's

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.080
class is going to be different roles and responsibilities.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.080
Then I'll be talking about expectation, that what kind of

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.860
expectation interviewer will be having. And what kind of a

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.160
preparation. What kind of a preparation that you are

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.280
supposed to do, at least mentally you must be aligned with

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.340
those kind of a preparation. And then I'll be talking about

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.240
even a LinkedIn. I'll be talking about even a resume and

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.720
I'll be talking about a GitHub. So all of these things. And

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.500
then, so this is the, this is something which I'm going to

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.880
discuss in a very first hour. And then in a next, like a

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.880
second hour, basically, I'm going to talk about one detail,

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.220
a project discussion in terms of storytelling. That, uh,

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.720
like, I'm going to take one example. So I have already

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.820
prepared one example for all of you for this particular

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.260
class. So where, uh, this example is related to our customer

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.140
support, which is by default a part of any organization. So

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.700
whether I'm talking about maybe a real estate client or

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.200
maybe a like a hospitals or maybe a colleges, maybe any

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.320
government institution. So everywhere we have our customer

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.040
support or maybe a financial institution, right? So

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.660
everywhere we will be having a customer support agents and

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.040
I'll be talking about a complete project architecture flow.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.060
It's HLD, it's LLD, it's wireframing each and everything,

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.400
right? Each and everything and a technology behind it, that

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.760
how we are using a generative AI, how we are using a LMS,

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.300
basically how we are using our agents in a back end, how we

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.180
are using a concept of RG in a back end to solve that

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.140
problem. So many things, many things we are going to discuss

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.100
in my today's class. So shall we start guys? Yeah.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.180
Okay. So let's get started. So one by one, one by one. So

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.200
let's start talking about all of these things. Yeah.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.670
So let me, let me share my screen by the way. And I believe

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.450
my screen is visible to all of you.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:08.130
Okay. So first come first guys. So here, whenever you're

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.950
trying to prepare for a generative AI interview or

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.750
generative AI job, so there is a possibility that you are

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:18.070
coming from a complete non generative AI background. That's

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.970
a very first possibility. The second possibility is that,

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.730
that maybe you are working, you know, you are working as a

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.410
researcher, you are working as an engineer, you are working

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:29.570
as a maybe ML engineer, maybe as a ML ops engineer, or maybe

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.410
as a product manager. And then you are trying to jump into a

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:37.130
generative AI role after learning maybe LLMs or RAG or

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:41.710
agentic AI and all of these things. So let's, let's try to

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:45.610
like understand that how this journey is going to be and

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.730
what you are supposed to focus or what kind of expectation

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.550
industry will be having. So I'll be taking a couple of

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:53.710
examples in terms of, in terms of doing a career mapping and

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.270
then we'll try to explain you the exact same thing. And

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.450
then, like I said, so we'll come to a different, different

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:01.710
kind of companies wise interview. So for example, if I'm

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.430
preparing for a startup, then what should my approach, if

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.790
I'm trying to prepare for maybe a FANG kind of organization,

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:10.430
then what should be the approach? And if I'm trying to

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:14.290
prepare for a enterprise or MNCs, then what should be the

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:17.850
approach? Because interviews are not going to be same.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.910
Expectations are not going to be same. Every organization

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.130
will be having a different, different kind of expectation

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:27.210
from a candidate and that too as a label of a candidates are

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:29.790
going to change. So obviously this expectation will keep on

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:34.490
changing. So here let's suppose for example, if I'm working

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:37.390
as a researcher, I'm just taking an example, right? So I'm

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:42.130
just working as a researcher, let's suppose. Okay. Yeah. So

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:48.390
role mapping, role wise mapping.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.080
So let's suppose, right? The very first role in which, which

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.940
I'm working currently as a researcher researcher

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:06.140
and maybe I'm trying to do a couple of research into a field

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.940
of ML or maybe into a field of NLP or any other relevant

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.040
area. So where I'm just trying to do a research and then if

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:17.200
I'm trying to get into a generative AI, then what will be

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.220
the expectation from our industry? Because as I'm working as

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:25.040
a researcher, so obviously I am not going to get into a

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.900
direct product building. So, obviously anyone who is

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:32.560
onboarding me, so they are onboarding me to do lots of

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.920
research in their existing tech stack or maybe the things

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.660
that they are trying to develop. So here, whenever you are

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:43.060
trying to go as a researcher, so the very first expectation

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:47.240
that company will be having from you is to be aware about

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.840
all the foundational model,

00:09:53.480 --> 00:10:00.260
foundational models or whatever model that we have, been

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:05.460
using in terms of LLMs or maybe a multimodal architecture or

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:09.290
maybe a diffusion model.

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:15.210
So company will be expecting that. Okay, so you must be

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.890
aware about this entire foundational model. Now, when I say

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:20.850
that you must be aware about the foundational model, it

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:23.670
doesn't mean that you must be aware about just a input and

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.790
the output that, okay, fine. So this is something that this

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:27.790
model is going to take as an input, or maybe this is the

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:30.530
context length or the size that it is going to consider. And

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:33.510
this is the output. No. So whenever I'm talking about a

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.190
foundational model, so, obviously you are supposed to be

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:40.710
aware about in depth end to end architecture, it's a

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:44.710
mathematical explanation or it's pros, it's cons, it's

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:48.330
comparison and it's benchmarking, which is again one of the

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:52.790
major important part. And whoever has released a model so

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:56.650
far everywhere, you will be able to find out all of these

00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:00.530
details. So if you are from a research background or if you

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:03.730
are willing to get into that, so please make sure that you

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.730
must be aware, aware about each and everything about a model

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:11.230
in terms of architecture. So like I said, architecture,

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.370
second, obviously, uh, features,

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:18.540
benchmarking,

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:28.540
comparison,

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:34.210
data set again plays an important role,

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.180
inferencing, right? So majority of things you must be aware

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.440
about, unless you are not aware about these things. So

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:49.280
obviously, uh, it will be difficult for you to give an

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.460
answer that people are going to ask you in an interview.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.120
Now, let's suppose if I'm trying to join some organization

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.880
as a researcher, then what will be my go to skills or what

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.880
should be this? What is the kind of a skill that I'm

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:06.340
supposed to acquire? So for a researcher, the very first

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:10.680
skill set that you must be having, uh, math. Now, when I

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.060
talk about a mathematics, so I'm not just talking about a

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.800
simple basic mathematics over here as a researcher, because

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.700
expectation will be very, very different. So here you are

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:22.040
supposed to be very, very good with a linear algebra. A

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:25.260
very, very good with a calculus or you should be very, very

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.680
good with respect to a probability and optimization. So all

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.900
of these things you are supposed to be aware about. So

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:36.240
probability linear algebra or I can say maybe a statistics,

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.040
right? So probability linear algebra, statistics, calculus,

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.640
all of these things you must be aware about. So again, not

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:47.060
just as a basic but in very, very depth in very, very

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:53.060
detailed and in terms of our framework, I would say so you

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:57.700
must be aware about a lang chain in a current situation or

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.020
maybe a lang graph or

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.920
maybe a llama indexes

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:11.990
autogen or any other kind of a framework which is available

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:15.250
in the market to build this kind of a agent apart from these

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:18.790
things guys apart from the foundational model now so apart

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:22.110
from this even you must be aware about a pie torch kind of a

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:26.150
framework or maybe you can say a tensorflow kind

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.860
of a framework. Or maybe you should be aware about a jacks a

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:35.460
framework. So these are the framework which you must be

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.740
aware about. And when people are saying that these are the

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.440
framework you must be aware about, it simply means that that

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.320
you must be very good with respect to a python programming

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.320
language because all of these frameworks has been built on

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.920
top of python programming language. So those who is having a

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.780
question that whether I'm supposed to know about the

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:53.760
programming obviously yes, because without programming you

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.440
will not be able to use any of these framework and python is

00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:00.100
one of the simplest programming language. That, any one of

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.920
us can use to do the task to do the job. So mathematics is

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.880
one of the requirement framework is another requirement your

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.700
foundational model research is going to be another

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:15.160
requirement by the way and then obviously you must have

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.780
published some sort of papers now if I'll talk about a

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:22.440
career path so in general if you are going to join some

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.840
company as a fresher so you will be joining that company as

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:36.810
a research research in turn. And then maybe as a research

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:38.190
scientist

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.860
or maybe you will be joining as a principal scientist.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:53.860
So these are the flow in general you will be able to find

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:57.060
out as per the number of year of experience you are holding

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:00.740
inside the industry or inside of research. So you may be

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.840
joining as a research in turn you may be joining as a

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.140
research scientist or you may be going to join as a

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.940
principal scientist. So these are the role in general. In

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:12.320
general you will be able to find out in majority of a

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.420
company now so you can ask me a question that okay majority

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.480
of us are not coming from the research background. So why

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.320
you are talking about a research I know there are very small

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.800
portion of the people who will be opting for this one. So

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.940
that's a reason I have just discussed enough first and then

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:31.580
now I'll be talking about people who are coming from an

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.740
engineering background because I know majority of my crowd

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.120
or majority of this people majority of the people in this

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.300
entire world will be coming from engineering background.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:38.360
Because I know majority of my crowd or majority of the

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:38.700
people in this entire world will be coming from engineering

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.000
background. be coming from an engineering background, maybe

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.120
not from a ML engineering background or AI engineering

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.320
background, but maybe from some of the engineering

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:50.960
background, many of us are going to come. So I believe this

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.040
research part is clear, the researcher part is clear. So if

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.960
I would like to join some of the organization as a

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:59.380
researcher, this is one of the part, this is one of the flow

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:03.640
that you can try to follow, which is going to take a lot of

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:08.260
hard work, a lot of research, a lot of mathematics, a lot of

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.940
core philosophy, you are supposed to be aware about, right?

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:15.120
You are supposed to be aware about and majority of time you

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:19.080
will not end up developing a system. So which will be used

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:23.100
by thousands of people or maybe millions of people. Majorly

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:26.040
you will be working on a breakthroughs that, okay, fine. So

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.220
this is a model which I have built or these are the

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:31.060
frameworks which I have built and which is going to solve

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.740
this particular particular kind of a task. So majorly you

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.980
will be working on a breakthroughs and a complete

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:40.380
mathematical and research oriented task on a day to day

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:45.860
basis. Now the second one or a second funnel I can say, so

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:49.820
where majority of us will be able to align ourself is called

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:54.060
as engineering, right? So majority of us are going to join

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:57.040
as an engineer, maybe as a fresher, maybe as a dropout,

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:00.600
maybe as a mid-level experienced people, maybe as a lead,

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:04.420
maybe as an architect, but yeah, that's a story for majority

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:09.300
of us or majority of engineers. So let's talk about that

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.800
particular track and let's try to understand that what will

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.680
be the expectation, what I'm supposed to learn, what I'm not

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.480
supposed to learn each and everything. Yeah. Fine guys,

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:23.820
everyone, yeah. Any link to learn PyTorch, you can try to

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:27.620
explore PyTorch by using a PyTorch documentation or if you

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:31.020
are already aware about up like a TensorFlow, by the way, or

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:34.160
Keras, you will be able to understand a PyTorch. This is how

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:39.640
easy it is. Yeah. This is how easy it is. Improve your

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:44.700
handwriting. Yeah. It's, it's little bad by the way. Okay.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.080
Keras, I'm aware. Yes. So if you're aware about Keras, then

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:52.600
it's completely fine. Yeah. Okay. Now, so let's talk about a

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.940
second track by the way. So second track is basically

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:57.460
engineering

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:06.310
track. Like I said, majority of us are aware about or

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:08.850
majority of us will be able to fall in inside this

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:13.950
particular track, engineering track, by the way. So maybe

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:18.250
like I said that we are coming from like a complete fresher

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:21.910
background or maybe we are coming from a dropout background.

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:24.950
Maybe we have some sort of experience, three to four years

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:27.910
of experience in the industry. As an engineer, I have been

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:30.710
developing maybe some of the ML models or maybe I was

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.470
working into a ML ops or maybe I was using just a simple

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:37.290
plain Python. Right. Right. And then if I'm trying to jump

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:42.030
into a generative AI industry, then what will be the

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:45.910
expectation? What I'm supposed to know and what I'm not

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:49.850
supposed to know and what will be my career path in general.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:54.830
So see guys, as an engineer, generally when we join an

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:59.590
organization, so it's not our job to do our research in

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:04.710
general. It's not our job to build a model from scratch. And

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:07.710
many people, right, many people think that, OK, if I'm going

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:10.350
to join a generative AI industry, then maybe I will end up

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.710
doing some sort of a fine tuning of the model or maybe I

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:16.930
will end up building some of the model from the scratch or

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:20.830
maybe I will end up developing some new framework. But yes,

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:24.470
it's not it's not like that. Things are not going to happen

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:27.470
in this particular way because in your organization, if I

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:30.610
talk about a mid-sized organization, there will be a team of

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:33.250
the researcher, there will be maybe like a couple of

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:37.370
researchers. Which will be available in your team. And they

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:42.330
are going to do such kind of a task. But sometime what

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:45.310
happens is that that as an engineer, you have to give some

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:48.430
sort of a support even to a researcher because researchers

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:52.530
core roles and responsibilities is going to develop or do a

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:56.610
benchmarking of the model or to prepare the entire skeleton

00:19:56.610 --> 00:20:00.910
for a model training or maybe for a model fine tuning based

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:04.710
on the task or based on the data set, which is which is

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:08.450
there in your hand. So as an engineer, you will be working

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:12.050
on building that funnel, basically that particular pipeline.

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:15.810
So where the entire story is going to start from a data

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:19.430
ingestion. And then once we will be having a data, then

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:22.470
obviously your research team is going to select a particular

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:24.790
model based on the task that you are going to solve, because

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:28.710
every time it's not like you will just use one single model.

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:31.170
So for every different different kind of a task that we try

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:33.990
to solve, we are going to have a different different kind of

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:37.310
a model as per the benchmarking. Or maybe your team is or

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:41.230
your research team is trying to build one of their model to

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:45.290
do that. So they need a complete flow, a complete funnel of

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:49.470
data. Now when I say data, right, so obviously majority of

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:53.570
times we will be acquiring a data from our internet, our

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:58.170
open source data. There is a possibility that you have data

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:01.930
from your own organization and maybe not in a particular

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:04.730
format. That model is looking for. But yeah, you have a data

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:08.550
from the organization. Maybe you are trying to scrap some

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:11.610
sort of a data. Maybe through some APIs you are trying to

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:15.310
pull a data. Maybe your data set is available into a S3

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:17.970
bucket or maybe Azure blobs or maybe in some other

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:22.970
databases. So there is a possibility that your data will be

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:26.510
available into a multiple different different different

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:30.490
different system. Right. Now to build a model. Let's suppose

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:34.930
if I'm trying to train a model. If I'm trying to train a

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:38.390
model. So obviously I have to provide a data, not just a raw

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:41.450
data by the way, because every training is going to be

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:43.970
different. It's not going to be the same. So when I say

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:46.770
that, okay, you have to provide a data. So you have to do a

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:50.310
lot before sending a data to the model. So basically you

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:54.230
have to do a lot of refinement. You have to do a lot of data

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:58.470
alignment. You have to extract a lot of like a unstructured

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:01.710
data. Or you can say. maybe like kind of a data which is a

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:06.370
complete scrap for me. So generally we try to work on a ETL

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:09.770
pipeline, so extract, transform or load kind of a pipeline.

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:13.850
There is a possibility that you are doing a streaming of the

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:16.790
data, there is a possibility that you are receiving a data

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:19.910
into a batch mode from a source number one, source number

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:22.590
two, source number three or maybe a multiple sources, right.

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:25.290
So in general, whenever we talk about a data, so obviously

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:28.530
we talk about multiple sources. So some data coming from

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:32.050
maybe a S3 bucket, some data may be coming through an API,

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:38.320
some data may be coming from a scrapping, some data is

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:42.040
coming from a blob, Azure blob, some data is coming from

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.480
maybe some of the databases, there are N number databases

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:49.280
which exist, maybe some data is coming from like some of the

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:53.680
file system, file system, maybe some data is coming from

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.560
some of the sensors, there is an infinite number of

00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:00.380
possibility in terms of a data. So obviously we have to

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:04.480
extract all of these data as per my need. I have to build a

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:10.720
complete ETL pipeline over here and then I have to prepare a

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.920
data which is been required by a model and which will be

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:18.020
dictated by whom, which will be dictated by in general these

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.580
guys, right. So these guys are going to tell you that okay

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:22.980
fine, so I am looking for this kind of a data set basically

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:26.500
and this should be the final format of the data because I am

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.740
going to train this particular model or that particular

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.080
model from the scratch or maybe I am going to like just do a

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:36.760
fine tuning of the model and give me or prepare the entire

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:40.820
pipeline for me. So as an engineer obviously you are going

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:44.560
to write this entire pipeline, right. You are going to write

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:48.000
this entire pipeline or you can say you can try to use some

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.340
of the tools and ETL tools and then you are going to

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:55.520
configure this entire pipeline so that continuously anyone

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.400
and everyone will be able to connect these two data. able to

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:01.860
get a required data for doing a model building, as simple as

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:05.440
that. Not just this one, so obviously you are going to, so

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:09.100
whenever we are talking about a model training, so obviously

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:12.300
along with this researcher, again, so model training is only

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.840
one of the tasks. Now there are like hundreds of different

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.540
kind of a task which exist, but yeah, let us talk about just

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:20.660
a model training as of now. So here let us suppose if

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.860
researcher has written some sort of a script in terms of

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:26.080
doing a model training. So obviously you are going to help

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.720
them out in terms of fine tuning those entire script or

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.720
maybe like running those script on a high computation system

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.460
or maybe on a distributed system. So where I will be having

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:39.940
a H100 kind of a or A100 kind of a GPUs, right? So again,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.260
this will be done by whom? So this will be done by the

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:46.060
engineering team, means end to end setup of this pipeline,

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:50.860
execution of a model training script, everything will be

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:53.260
done by the engineering team as per the instruction, which

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:56.680
we are going to receive from my research team, right? From

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.760
my research team, because they are more into a mathematics.

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.940
They are more into the architecture. They are more into,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.580
they will be more into a fine tuning. They will be more into

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:08.880
the optimization and engineering team will be more into the

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.080
execution. So this is how this entire like things are going

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:16.720
to work in terms of designing the new model. Now once it

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.720
will be done, so obviously the researcher team are going to

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.960
do a benchmarking. Once my model will be ready, which is

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.200
very important. This is one of the heavy and one of the

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.960
costliest process across an organization for any

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.400
organization who is trying to do a fine tuning of the model.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:35.080
So my research teams are going to do a benchmarking and once

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.920
that benchmarking will be done and once they are going to

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.820
give a go ahead that, okay, fine. So this model is ready and

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:45.640
we have already tested those models. Then what engineering

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:49.140
team is going to do? So my engineering team is going to do a

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:53.040
inferencing by the way. Yeah. So inferencing. So they are

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:57.160
going to host these model. Basically they are going to hold

00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.600
this model on a high available environment or a high

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:04.080
computational environment. So from where end user will be

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.860
able to do the inferencing. But again, right again, that

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:12.320
depends upon the task that what was a purpose of the model

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.980
and what was the business use case of the model. For

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:19.320
example, if I'm trying to build maybe a UD kind of a system,

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:22.040
so where anyone can come and anyone will be able to chat

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.840
with that model. Right. Anyone can come in and you can chat

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:29.020
with that model. So obviously I have to host this kind of a

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:35.060
model on maybe H 100 or a 100 kind of a system. So on these

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.920
kind of a system I have to hold this particular model if my

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:42.280
model size is maybe like a 10 GB, 20 GB and then if 10,000

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:45.900
users are going to hit maybe in a one single minute or maybe

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:49.140
hundreds of users going to hit my model in maybe a

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:52.580
particular second. So in that case I have to host it. Now

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:56.220
hosting itself is a critical job, right? Hosting itself is a

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.480
critical job and researchers team are not going to do it.

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:00.640
Their work will be done till this particular point that,

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.720
okay, fine. So I have built the model. I have done the

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:06.400
benchmarking. Now model is yours. And from there onwards

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:10.580
engineering team is going to host the model. Again, like I

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:12.880
said, so hosting itself is going to be a critical task

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:16.240
because at this point of time you have to talk about even a

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.820
data security. You have to talk about the governance. You

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:22.300
have to talk about even like a user input. Right. So when

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:23.900
you are going to consider, you have to talk about even

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:26.640
inferencing. Now when I say inferencing, right? So I don't

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:30.480
know whether you have seen this or not, but whenever you are

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.860
going to query a model, for example, we have a URI API,

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:38.280
right? Just try to hit a URI API and try to observe a

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:41.180
response. And again, so don't try to ask a simple plain

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:45.980
question. Say that, that give me a formula for maybe a chain

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:48.640
rule, right? Give me a formula for a chain rule and then

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:52.300
just try to observe the output, the kind of output. What is

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:56.080
going to give you like the raw output I'm talking about. So

00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:00.700
model, the kind of like output that we are able to see even

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:04.260
with respect to a URI or even with respect to a chat GPT,

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:07.040
even with respect to the Puppet Slitty or any other

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:09.500
inference, any other inferencing platform, all of these

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:12.100
platforms are basically a model inferencing platform by the

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:16.080
way, right? So whenever you are going to hit a model and

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:19.720
whenever you will try to observe the output, the raw output,

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:23.200
believe me, it's going to be almost. Most of the time it is

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.840
going to be a non-human readable format, especially in case

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:31.120
of formulas and the table, right? So formulas and the table,

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.900
you will be able to find out that, yes, I'm able to get the

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:37.760
output, but I'm not able to read those output. And this is

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:41.200
where again, inferencing comes into a picture and lot of

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:45.240
things goes over there, not just one or two, a lot of things

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.540
and not just a hundred, I would say, but more than a

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:52.280
thousands of edge cases we used to handle. There is a lot.

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.380
There is a lot in itself because model is what it just a

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:56.920
generative one, right? It is going to generate a data. It is

00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:00.280
going to generate some data in a sequence, but the way you

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:04.200
have to showcase to the user that depends upon your complete

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.900
engineering part, or you have to write a complete script by

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:11.640
handling each and every kind of edge cases. Then only your

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:16.140
user will be able to see a proper response in a proper

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:20.140
format. Otherwise your user will not be able to say it. Yes.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.560
Making sense guys. Yeah.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:29.320
Yes. So you can, you can even experiment these things now.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.180
So you have a UD API access, right? Just try to hit the UD

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:34.460
API access and as a quotient, so whenever you're trying to

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:37.320
hit the API as a quotient, just try to ask that, okay, fine.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.020
So give me the explanation or in depth explanation about a

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:43.960
chain rule or maybe this binomial theorem. Just explain me

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.800
the entire binomial theorem by giving me the complete

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:50.820
formula, a step by step manner, right? And then try to

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:53.700
observe the output and you will be amazed. You will say

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.760
that, okay, fine. I'm not able to understand the output. You

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.780
will get the output for sure, right? But still you will not

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:00.960
be able to understand those output. You will not be able to

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.120
do the interpretation of those output. And that's pretty

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.140
much common with every model inferencing. And that is

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:09.480
something that we use to handle from our end. That is not

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:13.760
being handled by a model, any models, by the way, any

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:17.640
models. So that is a reason, uh, like, uh, there are very

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:21.100
few organizations or who is able to create a kind of a

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:25.340
inferencing platform. Uh, which, uh. Well, everyone can use

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:28.780
it, right? So again, uh, one of this platform, uh, like, uh,

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.960
I think we all are aware about a such kind of a plate forms,

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.100
which is available all across the globe. So hosting is one

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:38.980
of the part, uh, so hosting means, so we are trying to

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:41.820
deploy the hardware. We are trying to deploy a security

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:46.800
layer over here so that no one will be able to do any kind

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:52.100
of, uh, attack on top of my model, or I will be able to

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:55.020
control the complete output of the model. My model will be

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.200
secure at the end of the day, and it will be able to do a

00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:00.980
inferencing for all the user. Now, someone is asking me

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:04.300
that, uh, inferencing means a speed of the response. No,

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:06.820
that is something called as latency. That is not an

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:08.920
inference. Inferencing means giving an output. Let's suppose

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.300
if I'm asking a question that tell me about data science,

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:13.620
right? And model is giving me a response that data science

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.580
is X, Y, G. That is a inferencing by the way. So inferencing

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:19.160
means asking question and getting an output that's called as

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:22.240
inferencing by the way, in a technical term. So kind of

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:25.200
chat, right? We, we all do a lot of inferencing every day,

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:27.360
right? So when we chat with the model, so inferencing means

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:31.260
output and, uh, uh, with respect to the speed, it simply

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:34.920
means that, uh, latency, yeah. So here inferencing,

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:41.440
inferencing, yeah. So on an inferencing side, again,

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:44.600
engineering team has to handle a lot, lot means literally a

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:48.360
lot, right? Uh, again, if I'll talk about maybe, um,

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:54.600
inferencing and then like, uh, hosting and then adding, uh,

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:59.380
tools. Okay. Now, what is a meaning of a tool in terms of a

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:02.540
generative AI? So meaning of tool, I don't know whether you

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:05.600
have built it or not. And if you have not built any kind of

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.980
a tool, so you can maybe try to check my previous live

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:10.440
lecture. So where we have created so many different,

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.040
different kinds of tools in my life class itself, right? So

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:16.820
in a layman manner, a meaning of tool is what in terms of

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:19.780
generative AI, again, in terms of generative AI. So in a

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:23.840
layman way, a meaning of tool is nothing but a function. So

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:28.140
which will be able to. Uh, which will be executed by any

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:31.760
kind of LLMs or any, which will be accessible by any kind of

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:35.540
LLMs and which will be able to execute a particular task,

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:38.520
for example, right? For example, so let's suppose I have

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:41.260
written a function, right? And that function is going to

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:45.760
fetch each and every data, which is available in my

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:49.240
databases, my banking database, let's suppose, yeah, my

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.300
banking database, let's suppose. So I have written a

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:53.940
function, right? So if you, someone is going to come and

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:55.700
they're going to just ask that, okay, fine. So give me a

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:58.400
function. Give me a detail about, so obviously it is going

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.800
to like, uh, access my database and then it is going to get

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:05.360
all the information. So that function is technically called

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.500
as tool, right? That function is technically called as tool

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:13.540
in terms of a generative AI, because as a input, you are not

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:16.460
trying to pass the parameter in general, we try to pass X,

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:19.140
Y, and G parameter inside the function. What you are going

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:22.020
to do. So you are going to command it. You are going to

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:25.480
control it with the NLP, unnatural language, by the way.

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:28.000
Okay. So you are going to just like, uh, write a prompt and

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.900
based on the prompt, my system basically, or my agents

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:34.500
technically going to understand that, okay, fine. So this is

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.880
the tool that I have to use. So it will try to execute that

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:39.560
tool and that tool is going to bring a data for me. So

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:42.120
technically it's a function which is trying to execute

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.840
itself. So tool is nothing. So generally like, uh, people,

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:48.920
uh, feel overwhelmed when we start talking about a tool,

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.800
they say that, okay, fine. So maybe this is something

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:54.660
different, but no, it's not different. Like I said. So if

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:58.080
you have not built any kind of a tool so far, not an issue

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.760
at all. So maybe you can try to check out my previous

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:03.200
lecture where I have already created a multiple tool by

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.180
using a multiple different, different kind of a framework.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.380
And believe me within half an hour, practically it will be

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:11.640
clear to all of you because tool is something that we try to

00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:14.480
write on a daily basis. This just a function, right? Just a

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:18.380
function controlled by natural language controlled by LLMs

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:20.840
by the way. That's it, right? That's it. And people have

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:23.860
named that as a tool. And the tool calling. It should be

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:26.560
done automatically by a different, different agents that we

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:30.800
are going to configure. So here, so adding our tools, for

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:35.200
example, so let's suppose a MCP tool, I think many of us

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.180
have heard about MCP, right? Model context protocol tool

00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:41.440
that we try to add. So what, what this, this was trying to

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:45.100
do. So basically we have written a function and we have made

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:50.080
that as a MCPs means we have just exposed that tool to the

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.820
outer world. So let's suppose if I have written a tool which

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:57.100
can access my drugs. So let's suppose I have written a tool

00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:00.300
which can access my drugs. So let's suppose I have written a

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:01.900
tool which can access my drugs. So let's suppose I have

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:05.260
written a tool which can access my drugs. So let's suppose I

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:07.400
have written a tool which can access my drugs. So let's

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.220
suppose I have written a tool which can access my drugs. So

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:11.460
let's suppose I have written a tool which can access my

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:12.340
drugs. So let's suppose I have written a tool which can

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:12.500
access my drugs. So let's suppose I have written a tool

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:13.580
which can access my drugs. So let's suppose I have written a

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:14.660
tool which can access my drugs. So let's suppose I have

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:16.000
written a tool which can access my drugs. So let's suppose I

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.280
have written a tool which can access my drugs. So let's

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:20.440
suppose I have written a tool which can access my drugs. So

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:23.820
let's suppose I have written a tool which can access my

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:25.940
drugs. you were you will go and check so we have our

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:28.720
multiple tabs right so we have a web search tab we have a

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:31.440
image generation tab so when you are going to select web

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:35.080
search and when you try to chat with Yuri automatically it

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:37.760
will be able to understand that which model I am supposed to

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.900
call now which model I am supposed to call automatically it

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:43.640
will be able to understand when you select a image

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:46.340
generation automatically it will be able to understand that

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:48.800
okay fine so which tool I am supposed to call or which

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:51.780
function I am supposed to call in for image generation and

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:54.540
eventually it will try to or which model right because this

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:58.640
is how we have we all have configured it so here adding a

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:02.140
lots of tools again that will be a part of an engineering

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:05.600
team and that depends upon the use cases which i am going to

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:09.320
solve or in an environment where i am going to productionize

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:13.820
my entire system right uh securing this entire platform

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.380
obviously a roles and responsibility of a gene team

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:18.720
maintenance again roles and responsibility of the

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:22.940
engineering team uh qa like a qa basically so again roles

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:26.520
and responsibility of a engineering team so all of these

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:30.180
places the engineering team will be involved and that too

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:35.000
right that too i have just talked about only one use case a

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.300
model building right a model building or maybe fine tuning

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:43.460
just one single use case i have talked about likewise there

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:46.820
are thousands of use cases which exist across all the

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:49.280
organization but why i'm talking about this one in a very

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:53.560
first place because nowadays right nowadays so see uh

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:57.720
accessing an lms is not a big deal we all have apis and we

00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:00.620
all have a lot of open source model right lot of open source

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:04.000
model and even recently chat gpt have released a oss 20

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.500
billion parameter and oss 120 billion parameter model so

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:11.760
accessing a model is not a big deal even a big one even a

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:17.520
good one right but but majority of time so when you try to

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:21.560
deploy your model right or when you try to productionize it

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:26.140
so everyone is worried about a privacy of the data because

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:28.640
they don't want to share their data and again that's a valid

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.420
like a point right so they don't want to share a data with

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:34.740
like a because even if like a open air is going to say that

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.820
okay fine i'm not going to take your data i'm not going to

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:40.920
use your data but still uh trust is very less right you

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.440
should not go and trust blindly and keeping that in mind so

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.680
every other organization is trying to fine-tune their model

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:50.620
based on their own data set or they are trying to host a

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:54.900
model in their own inferencing environment every big

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:57.600
organization every big means literally every big

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.540
organization you will be able to find out nowadays they are

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:07.100
using internally their own model for inferencing and every

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:09.520
organization is now even allowing every all of their

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:13.000
employees to use a charge pretty kind of a system but uh

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.760
many many big organization or you can say a fortune 500

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:19.180
organization so they're not allowing a chat gpt interface of

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:21.680
public security interface directly so what they're doing is

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.260
that that they are trying to host a model in their own

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:26.660
environment so that they will be having their own control so

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:30.000
that their employee will not end up sharing the proprietary

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.480
data with a open world but still they will be able to

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:38.220
leverage the capacity of llms everywhere same situation you

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:42.380
all will be able to find out so model deployment is again

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:47.420
one of the big tasks or you can say one of the tasks

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:51.460
everyone nowadays is looking for and there is a very high

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:55.780
possibility that people may ask you about this entire end-to

00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:00.040
-end deployment end-to-end fine tuning or maybe training a

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:04.040
model from the very very scratch now if i'll talk about a

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:06.300
fine tuning or training obviously the story is going to

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:09.900
start from a data ingestion and then it is going to end till

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:13.360
uh inferencing hosting adding a tools or maybe adding a

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:16.540
security layer and then qna maintenance monitoring

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:21.060
scalability again comes into a picture right uh and then

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:24.840
like a and again in between so building a ops pipeline a

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:28.580
cicd kind of a pipeline uh so that you will be able to ship

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:31.260
your code or you will be able to ship the entire things as

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:34.560
soon as possible ship the entire feature as soon as possible

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:38.500
so this is one of the major area of the research now this is

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:40.400
just the overview which i'm trying to give you by the way

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:45.600
i'm not going into a detail as of now uh so here just try to

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.720
do a research just try to do a research around what so

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:53.280
around model building

00:39:55.870 --> 00:40:05.020
from scratch part number one uh then obviously uh model

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:06.560
building model

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:12.640
not building i will say fine tuning fine

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:18.680
tuning for a task

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:23.960
or deploying

00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:29.450
free

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:43.600
trained model in private environment yeah for doing a

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:48.960
inferencing so this is one of the tasks that you all can

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:52.860
mention inside your resume that is a this is a generic one

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:55.600
right doesn't matter like from which organization you are

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:59.000
coming from or maybe in which segment you are working so i

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.880
have discussed about this particular use cases so that you

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.420
all will be able to dig deeper

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:11.340
and then you all will be able to mention this project inside

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:14.680
your resume saying that that okay so i have been working

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:18.220
into this project maybe for a six to eight month right or

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:20.680
maybe still i'm working in this project as a maintenance

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:24.400
engineer as a sre maybe a site reliability engineer or maybe

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:28.440
as a lead i can go and i can try to claim that uh yeah so

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.520
one of my team because there is a lead so maybe there will

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:34.220
be a multiple team or maybe a single team so one of my team

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:36.260
is trying to work on this or maybe as a maintenance engineer

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:36.260
i can go and i can try to claim that yeah so one of my team

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.520
as an architect you can try to even write this particular

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:42.740
project inside your resume right inside your resume because

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:45.420
people keep on asking me a question that tell me some

00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:48.440
project which i will be able to mention this is one of the

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:51.260
project that you all can mention and just try to showcase a

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:53.700
collaboration with the research team that okay fine i have

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:56.140
been like collaborating with the research team to perform

00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:59.380
this particular operation or to perform this particular task

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:04.400
but before that prepare a complete story unless and until

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:08.140
you are not going to prepare the complete story it will

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:12.400
create a bottleneck right it will create a bottleneck uh by

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:15.120
the way and again so i have already mentioned uh in my

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:17.600
entire syllabus that i'm going to talk about uh system

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:20.720
design and architecture so either you are going to prepare

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.980
the story or just wait for that class where i'm going to

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:26.900
discuss about this entire architecture diagram as of now i'm

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:29.160
just talking about the overview and i'm just talking about

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:32.980
the like things that we try to develop in a generic manner

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:34.700
is it making sense guys yeah

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:44.640
yeah so even with the ulama so previously we have built our

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:47.560
own uh ui interface and then like i said so there is a lot

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:49.200
of problem that we are facing with respect to our

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:53.060
inferencing a lot of use edge cases and the problem that we

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:55.980
have faced is that that we are giving you a multi-model

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:58.360
access for example we are giving you a lama series we are

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:00.620
giving you a gemini series model access we are giving you a

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:03.720
deep six series model access we are giving you a gpt series

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.360
model access the problem with all of these different

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:07.800
different series is that their inferencing is not going to

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:08.880
be the same but the inferencing is different so let's

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.680
suppose if i have written a logic to do a inferencing of any

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:15.260
mathematical formula for gpt series that doesn't mean that

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:17.840
it will work for a lama series that doesn't mean that it

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:19.920
will work for a gemini series that doesn't mean that it will

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:22.760
work for a mistral series right so that was a problem that

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:26.360
we have been facing a lot and my user technically you guys

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:29.740
students right so they were facing an issue uh with respect

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:32.880
to this edge cases so keeping that in mind so we have two

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:38.260
version of basically a uri ui so one with the ui basically

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:42.800
and uh the second one is uh technically a ui interface and

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:45.800
inferencing that we have written in-house uh with with our

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:49.260
with our team member so where uh we were like trying to

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:51.520
handle a lot of edge cases but yeah because of the time

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:53.460
turns we have decided that okay fine let's go ahead with the

00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:56.540
open web ui again the problem with the open web ui is that

00:43:56.540 --> 00:44:00.560
that uh it's a like uh it comes under a restricted licensing

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:04.580
so restricted licensing means uh you can't you can't remove

00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:07.200
their like a branding you can't remove their logo so if you

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.900
have to remove their branding if you have to remove their

00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:12.680
logo so obviously you have to pay them right so they have

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:14.460
their business team and you have to connect with them and

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:16.880
you have to pay them that is the reason so as of now in a

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:20.820
uri uh ui you are able to see a ulama web ui with the same

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:24.880
logo open web ui so a lot of like i said so there are like a

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:27.940
lot of variations which comes in between okay

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:46.880
so let me see some of the question if i have so

00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:06.990
can you also discuss the duration of every stage we will

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:09.150
come to that point as of now i'm just trying to give you the

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:12.350
overview so that it will create a line in your brain uh and

00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:15.110
then we'll talk about uh these things in a detail when i've

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:16.810
been talking about the entire architecture

00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:23.430
aws azure gcp how much we can trust our data store and

00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:26.650
deploy in a production environment see uh for azure aws and

00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:30.150
gcp they are going to give you a complete uh I would say

00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:32.730
like a rack or maybe they're going to give you a complete

00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:36.910
machine so obviously uh they are not going to share your

00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:39.890
data with anyone so they are just an infra provider right so

00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:42.190
for example they are going to give you just a complete

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:44.690
system the kind of a system that you're looking for cpu gpus

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:48.350
or maybe a databases so in terms of a data breach I don't

00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:50.350
think that you will be able to find out a data bridge with

00:45:50.350 --> 00:45:52.890
respect to these platforms but yeah if you are sharing your

00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:56.150
data set with the inferencing with the lms provider then yes

00:45:56.150 --> 00:46:02.770
there is a chance okay fine yuri

00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:07.830
api is also connected with the open web ui model are

00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:13.510
installed so see just for the ui we are using open web ui

00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:18.370
just for the ui uh model configuration wise we are not using

00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:22.810
anything from open web ui so like we are using basically a

00:46:22.810 --> 00:46:25.950
proprietary model for example a chat GPT so we are calling a

00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:29.990
chat GPT API directly and along with that so we are using a

00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:32.990
lot of open source model for example a Gemini series model

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:36.150
or the deep six series model or maybe a like a mystery

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:40.330
series model so all of these models has been hosted on our

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:43.830
platform and then we have exposed those model as an API so

00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:47.470
that you all will be able to do the inferencing because on

00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:50.310
our platform you will be able to find out a combination of a

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:53.950
proprietary model and a combination of a open source model

00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:56.970
so whatever open source model that we are using it's hosted

00:46:56.970 --> 00:46:59.710
on our platform whatever proprietary model that we are using

00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:03.390
so we are calling a direct API for that one because we don't

00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:06.790
have that model access right so this models are not an open

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:11.010
source model for us okay so this is something that in

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:15.870
general you are going to do so just uh instruction for all

00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:20.830
of you do a research do a research on all of these three

00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:23.890
points and then I'm going to give you this as a task by the

00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:27.070
way because uh next Monday we'll be having a class right and

00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:29.850
next Monday so we are going to discuss a lot lot in terms of

00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:32.950
a system design lot in terms of the architecture lot in

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:35.830
terms of the execution by the way right that to multiple

00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:38.290
projects so I have already mentioned six projects so six

00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:41.170
different different different kind of use cases so then I'll

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:43.950
be talking about these things in a detail but in between as

00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:47.590
you are preparing for the interview right as you are doing

00:47:47.590 --> 00:47:52.150
the interview try to do a as much research as possible from

00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:55.930
every perspective with respect to these three use cases that

00:47:55.930 --> 00:48:00.650
how in general we try to build a model from the scratch so

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:03.050
you have to pick a particular task and again when I say

00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:05.190
models there can be a different different kind of a models

00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:09.110
right there can be a model uh which is going to take image

00:48:09.110 --> 00:48:11.630
as an input and then I will be able to do inferencing

00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:15.990
there's there will be a model which may take just as a

00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:19.590
simple like a conversational input and then it is going to

00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:24.070
give me the output there will be a model so which can try to

00:48:24.070 --> 00:48:27.250
do the embeddings right so even we have a lot of model for

00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:29.810
the embeddings so that will be a different task based on

00:48:29.810 --> 00:48:33.530
that uh try to again like do a research and then come come

00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:39.490
inside the class next Monday now so here as an engineer uh

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:42.070
so what an all like a tech stack that I'm supposed to be

00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:45.250
aware about so whenever I'm going to go for the interview so

00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:49.210
as an engineer obviously you are supposed to be very very

00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:51.930
good with a programming take

00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:57.920
a stack wise you

00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:04.320
are supposed to be very good with respect to a program when

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:09.080
I say programming obviously Python will be one of my

00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:15.060
favorite programming language uh second one is obviously uh

00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:21.620
APIs so when I say API so maybe you can try to choose a fast

00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:27.570
API because majority of time you will be end up creating an

00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:30.370
API or maybe you will end up consuming an API a different

00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:33.790
kind of API and again this API part is not a big deal it's

00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:36.690
just a one or two hour it takes to learn it if you are not

00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:39.950
aware about it go into my previous class uh generative AI

00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:43.150
which is not a previous one so the ongoing one last week

00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:45.350
itself not last week last last week I have discussed about

00:49:45.350 --> 00:49:48.450
the API and that in a practical manner and I have even given

00:49:48.450 --> 00:49:52.970
you a task uh the third thing as an engineer you are

00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:55.830
supposed to be aware about is a database now when I say

00:49:56.270 --> 00:50:00.550
database so database can fall under a sequel category can

00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:05.830
fall under a no sequel category or can fall under a vector

00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:09.390
DB right so these are the different different kind of

00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:13.190
databases that we have been using across the entire tech

00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:16.610
stack sequel means a complete table based database right so

00:50:16.610 --> 00:50:18.830
where we try to create the schema there will be a column

00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:23.190
names and then we try to like a keep a record row by row no

00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:26.250
sequel majority of time we try to store a database so we try

00:50:26.250 --> 00:50:28.490
to store a database data as a document right as a document

00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:31.610
so you can say a JSON file kind of a format in which we try

00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:34.550
to store our data or maybe in a graph format we try to store

00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:39.130
a data so if I talk about a sequel database right so Oracle

00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:43.210
provides you a sequel database right so we have a my sequel

00:50:43.210 --> 00:50:47.690
we have a msql we have a db2 we have a postgresql so all of

00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:50.430
these databases falls under sequel system now if I talk

00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:54.410
about a no sequel system so we have a MongoDB we have

00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:58.670
Cassandra we have HBase we have Neo4j likewise we have

00:50:58.670 --> 00:51:02.410
influx DB so likewise we have a multiple no sequel databases

00:51:02.410 --> 00:51:06.430
where we try to store data into a document format and again

00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:10.150
a vector database is a new one in a market not that new I

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:13.650
would say but yeah since last one two years so almost every

00:51:13.650 --> 00:51:18.210
applications are consuming these vector databases so MongoDB

00:51:18.210 --> 00:51:21.410
is also providing a vector database feature by the way it's

00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:23.750
a little bit expensive but yeah they are also providing it

00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:26.710
apart from that so you will be able to find out a Facebook

00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:30.030
ai similarity search kind of a database you will be able to

00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:33.270
find out a chroma DB you will be able to find out a pinecone

00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:36.310
you will be able to find out quadrant so likewise there are

00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:39.750
again a multiple databases you will be able to find out in

00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:44.830
terms of a vector DB which has been used widely so wherever

00:51:44.830 --> 00:51:48.550
your private data comes into a picture so whenever you are

00:51:48.550 --> 00:51:51.630
trying to build a enterprise grade application but with the

00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:56.270
private data set right the data that you don't want to be

00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:59.310
like exposed to the outer world and you don't want to even

00:51:59.310 --> 00:52:02.050
do fine tuning of the model with your entire data set

00:52:02.050 --> 00:52:05.310
because maybe your data set is a incremental data set right

00:52:05.310 --> 00:52:08.290
incremental data set where you are trying to add something

00:52:08.290 --> 00:52:12.350
new on a regular basis so at that point of a time vector DB

00:52:12.350 --> 00:52:15.670
will come into a picture and I believe we all are aware

00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:21.610
about it a super base is not a like a super basis of managed

00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:25.190
DB or managed interface they have provided you right uh

00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:29.130
basically you can go you can try to like a configure it you

00:52:29.130 --> 00:52:31.670
can expose that as an API and then you can consume it on a

00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:35.370
like a front-end side so it's kind of a managed one right

00:52:35.370 --> 00:52:39.590
it's kind of a managed one so yeah baby at pinecone chroma

00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:42.350
DB Facebook as similarity search these are the databases

00:52:42.350 --> 00:52:46.510
which will fall under a vector DB but as a engineer you are

00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:49.710
supposed to be aware about it if you are not aware about it

00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:57.030
you will get stuck for sure making sense guys yeah yes so

00:52:57.710 --> 00:53:01.910
stack wise now now so as a gen AI engineer again I am just

00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:04.670
trying to focus on a gen AI part guys only a gen AI part

00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:08.250
right only a gen AI part because this entire series or the

00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:11.750
entire lecture is all about a gen AI interview not about the

00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:14.110
ml interview not about the deal interview not about the CV

00:53:14.110 --> 00:53:17.030
vision or a data science or AI interview right just a

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:21.270
generative AI interview fine so let's focus on that part uh

00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:24.790
okay so database is fine API is fine programming is

00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:28.750
obviously like a you non-negotiable right so you can't say

00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:31.310
that I don't know programming otherwise people will not even

00:53:31.310 --> 00:53:35.490
take your interview uh the fourth part is a framework

00:53:35.490 --> 00:53:36.750
framework

00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:45.400
so nowadays there are multiple uh no code you can say or low

00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:49.240
code or code base framework which is available in a market

00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:54.780
to build an agents to integrate a tools to automate the

00:53:54.780 --> 00:54:00.040
entire process now what are the like a major framework I

00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:03.140
believe we all are aware about the name right so we have a

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:12.900
lang chain right we have a lang graph we have llama

00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:24.440
index we have basically autogen we have a small agent we

00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:29.740
have n8n kind of a framework so likewise we have so many

00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:31.520
different different kind of frameworks which is available

00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:35.300
into the market right we have all these frameworks so these

00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:37.760
are nothing but people have created a wrapper they have

00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:42.520
created a library on top of the existing framework uh and

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:45.720
they they are just like giving you a full flexibility where

00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:49.020
you will be able to create a tools uh you will be able to

00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:52.360
create a agent in no time right in no time and you will be

00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:55.840
able to integrate with any of the lms because every agent

00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:59.360
every tools requires lm access without that it will be a

00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:02.120
simple normal function right simple normal function so

00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:04.520
obviously you have to give the LMAX it doesn't matter which

00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:07.860
taxes you are giving as for the task but yeah and these

00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:11.820
frameworks has been designed for that right so you are

00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:16.800
supposed to be aware about these frameworks lang chain lang

00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:20.140
graph lama indexes autogen init and all kind of frameworks

00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:24.100
you are supposed to be aware of and believe me if you are

00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:26.640
aware about one framework just one let's suppose i'm aware

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:29.860
about lang chain right i'm not aware about like a lama index

00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:33.100
lama index lang graphs and all those things i'm just aware

00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:36.480
about a lang chain end-to-end right end-to-end i'm aware

00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:39.820
about lang chain when you will start studying a lang graph

00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:42.200
when you will start studying a lama indexes you will not

00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:46.420
find it very different and it will be like a very easy to go

00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:49.680
kind of implementation you all will be able to undo it right

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:53.700
because the core philosophy right the core philosophy is

00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:57.660
actually same it's not different right it's not different

00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:02.300
definitions are exactly same the only like difference is

00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:03.080
that you will be able to do the same thing right so if you

00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:03.740
are aware about a lang chain and you are able to find out in

00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:06.940
terms of a functionalities function calling basically so

00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:09.180
basically these frameworks has been delivered by a different

00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:12.420
organization so they have given their own name but the core

00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:15.840
philosophy like i have mentioned so it's not like you are

00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:19.780
going to learn same thing four times no learn one and then

00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:23.040
implement it into a forex manner this is how these things

00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:25.960
are going to work at least for a lang chain lang graph lama

00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:29.960
indexes and this auto autogen right and majority of like a

00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:32.000
programming based framework you will be able to find out

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.320
that core philosophies are going to work and so to be

00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:37.880
exactly same. It's not different at all. Now, uh, in eight N

00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:41.240
right, this is again one of the another framework which is

00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:44.740
getting a lot of popularity into a market and this framework

00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:48.400
is not a programming based or you can say a low code. So

00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:51.340
they are giving you some flexibility in terms of writing a

00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:54.000
script, but yeah, so it's a low code or you can say a no

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.480
code platform. So where you can try to drag and drop all of

00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:01.580
these tool, you can just do the integration and then you

00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:04.440
will be able to automate the entire task. So in it and is

00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:07.600
giving you that kind of a, or such kind of a flexibility by

00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:10.600
the way. Yeah. Such kind of a flexibility by the way. So

00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:14.360
these are the frameworks by default you are supposed to be

00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:18.140
aware about if you are preparing for the generative AI

00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:22.560
interview as simple as that. Without this, I don't think

00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:25.540
that you should go for a interview by the way, if you're not

00:57:25.540 --> 00:57:27.880
aware about this, then you should not go for the interview.

00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:31.920
Now, so framework is completely fine. Uh, in terms of a tech

00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:36.040
stack, the fifth part that you are supposed to be aware

00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:41.220
about is called as ops part O P S operational part

00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:45.200
operational apartments. So, uh, obviously deployment, uh,

00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:48.740
scalability, uh, Kubernetes, Dockers kind of a things, or

00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:52.520
maybe a Prometheus Grafana. So all of these things you are

00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:54.860
supposed to be aware about because you're not just going to

00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:57.040
build the application and run those application into a local

00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:00.220
system, right? In your laptop. So obviously you have to

00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:01.820
bring those system into a production. So you have to bring

00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:01.980
those system into a production. So you have to bring those

00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:03.400
system into a production. So where end user will be able to

00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:06.020
use it. For example, uh, I was talking about the same thing

00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:08.700
right here, that this is what you will be doing, hosting,

00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:11.080
inferencing, all those things, right? Hosting inferencing,

00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:13.260
adding a tools. So obviously I'm talking about the

00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:15.280
production system now to bring anything into a production

00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:18.680
system, ops is required without ops. You will not be able to

00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:21.700
bring anything into a production. So operational part wise,

00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:25.180
you are supposed to be aware about a Docker. You are

00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:27.300
supposed to be aware of the Kubernetes. You are supposed to

00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:30.020
have it about a CI CD pipeline, a continuous integration

00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:35.540
pipeline for a generative AI system. These things are

00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:39.060
important, right? These things are important observability

00:58:39.060 --> 00:58:42.160
tool or prompt monitoring tool. All of these things are

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:47.940
important. So here, uh, maybe ML ops, or you can say

00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:51.840
nowadays people have started calling even LLM ops as LLMs

00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:54.780
are getting like a lot of popularity. So LLM ops, uh,

00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:58.420
infrastructure, right? Infrastructure cloud, or I can say

00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:01.820
cloud, not all the services, because cloud, we'll talk about

00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:03.320
that in a minute, but we'll be having like more than, uh,

00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:05.860
270 plus services. So you are not supposed to aware about

00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:09.940
all this 270 plus services, just a relevant one, right? Just

00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:13.320
a relevant one, uh, which, which all of you are going to use

00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:16.520
it. So almost every, uh, everything around, uh, Kubernetes

00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:19.440
or Dockers, or you can say a CI CD, you are supposed to be

00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:21.540
aware about the rest is completely fine. So you are not

00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:23.760
supposed to aware about all the services which is available

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:28.460
on Azure, uh, GCP, or, uh, uh, like AWS, but yeah. So bare

00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:31.260
minimum require this, this will be the expectation by

00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:36.740
default. From an engineer where majority of you are going to

00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:39.240
work as a lead, as an architect, maybe as a junior engineer,

00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:42.360
maybe as a mid-level senior engineer depends, right? Maybe

00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:45.920
as a SRE site reliability engineer in some of the

00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:53.280
organization. So this is, this is guys, the must and the

00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:57.880
minimum one. Now the sixth part is model

01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:07.030
architecture understanding.

01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:14.920
Uh, it's good to have by the way, right? Because, uh, yeah.

01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:17.740
So let's suppose if I'm going to join, uh, if I'm going to

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:21.520
give an interview as a senior engineer, so people may ask me

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.900
a question that can you please try to explain me the

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:27.700
architecture behind a GPD five, GPD four, or maybe just a

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:30.940
plane, a GPT? Uh, can you please try to explain me like, uh,

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:33.100
what is the difference between encoder and decoder

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:36.840
architecture? Can you please try to explain me like, uh, uh,

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:39.860
how, uh, whenever I'm going to do a prompting, so how it

01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:42.540
goes inside the model, how it goes through an encoder

01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:43.000
architecture, how it goes inside the model, how it goes

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:43.360
through an encoder architecture, right? architecture and

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:46.380
then pass through a decoder architecture and then I will be

01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:50.140
able to get the answer. So obviously around a model

01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:54.020
architecture, people are going to ask you a question. So you

01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:57.320
are supposed to be aware about the architecture of this

01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:01.320
entire thing. If you are not aware about it, I already have

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:04.480
a lecture. So I have already given a lecture. So please try

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:07.300
to follow along with that lecture. And I have already

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:10.320
discussed about a research paper called as attention is all

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:13.480
you need, which is, which was a mother of all the elements

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:16.240
that you are able to see where encoder and decoder

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:19.080
architecture comes into a picture. So that is, that is going

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:21.680
to help you out a lot. That is going to help you out a lot

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:25.200
in terms of understanding the entire things. So model

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:29.820
architecture understanding is again the must, right? The

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:35.520
must plus like we have hundreds of models, right? So at

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:39.460
least you must be aware about 10 to 12 model that, okay,

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:41.500
fine. So this is the model. Which has been used for this

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:43.820
purpose. This is the context length. This is the output

01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:47.080
because when you still talk about these things, right? So

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.920
you sounds very technical, right? When, when you say, but

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:52.360
when you talk about these like a tech terms in front of an

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:54.760
interviewer, then interviewer will start taking an interest

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:57.140
that, okay, fine. So this is the person who is aware about

01:01:57.140 --> 01:02:00.420
things, right? So this, this person is already like he has

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:02.820
gone through this entire things and he has done some sort of

01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:05.080
implementation or maybe he's aware about this particular

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:10.980
things. So, so again, model architecture. Okay. This is one

01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:15.240
of the important thing that you all should explore as a

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:19.020
generative AI engineer along with this entire thing. Is it

01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:22.980
making sense guys? To all of us? Fine. So I believe we are

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:29.600
clear with respect to our tech stack. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Now.

01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:33.740
So role wise, let's suppose I'm doing a preparation, right?

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.980
So me, so role wise I will be able to get a role of junior

01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:40.660
engineer as a fresher maybe, uh, maybe. I can join as a SD

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:44.540
one SD two depends upon the organization hierarchy and maybe

01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:48.560
I can join as a lead and I can join as a architect and as

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:53.000
your roles and responsibilities are going to increase depth

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.800
of all of these things you should keep on increasing because

01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:00.800
that kind of a question, uh, that is the kind of a question

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:04.720
that you can expect from your interviewer. Yeah. Model

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.580
building from the scratch you have taught in a generic.

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:10.520
Yeah. So one model, a one, one, a class I have taken. So

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:14.120
where, with respect to, uh, implementation and code and

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:18.160
inferencing and even in terms of preparing a data. So I have

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:21.020
already discussed, I've already discussed, uh, in my NLP

01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:25.060
class. So generative AI with NLP, uh, and agent TK, I think

01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:30.230
that was a bash name. So I've already talked about it as a

01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:33.350
lead, how many experience, how many experience we should so

01:03:33.350 --> 01:03:37.290
in AI at least see when you're trying to prepare your resume

01:03:37.290 --> 01:03:41.530
minimum two to three project. You are supposed to keep

01:03:41.530 --> 01:03:44.730
inside your resume, which should be pretty much relevant

01:03:44.730 --> 01:03:47.650
with respect to a job description. And that is going to

01:03:47.650 --> 01:03:52.570
increase a chance for at least a resume selection, right? At

01:03:52.570 --> 01:03:55.690
least like to get into a very first round. So at least two

01:03:55.690 --> 01:04:00.510
to three is a minimum. Okay. Now, so you can, can just go

01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:02.590
out and you can try to observe a different, different kind

01:04:02.590 --> 01:04:05.490
of a JDs, a job description, and you will be able to find

01:04:05.490 --> 01:04:08.930
out approximately all of these things around those JDs. So

01:04:08.930 --> 01:04:10.830
again, these are the stacks. This is the stack, which is

01:04:10.830 --> 01:04:16.390
coming from a JD itself now. So this is the, again, like a,

01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:19.450
a tech stack. And like I said, you will be joining as a

01:04:19.450 --> 01:04:23.090
junior engineer, maybe as a SD1, SD2, a staff engineer,

01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:26.710
maybe as a lead, maybe as a architect coming to the next

01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:30.790
part. So when I'm going to prepare for a interview, so

01:04:30.790 --> 01:04:34.030
again, there is a chances that I will end up preparing for a

01:04:34.030 --> 01:04:35.850
startup startups,

01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:43.010
right? One of the category. Okay. One of the category is

01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:48.850
maybe a MNC, right, or enterprise, enterprise like a based

01:04:48.850 --> 01:04:54.110
company. And the another one is FANG or nowadays people used

01:04:54.110 --> 01:04:58.050
to call as a META, right? So FANG, META kind of a companies.

01:04:58.250 --> 01:05:03.090
Now if I'm preparing for a, let's suppose the startups. So

01:05:03.090 --> 01:05:06.630
in general, in an interview, as for the, as far as interview

01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:09.830
is concerned, interview in a startups are going to be

01:05:09.830 --> 01:05:14.070
interesting, right? So interesting. Sometimes it will be a

01:05:14.070 --> 01:05:17.270
little bit chaotic, sometimes it will be like a

01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:21.330
unstructured. So every kind of a scenario you will be able

01:05:21.330 --> 01:05:24.530
to find out while giving an interview for a startup. Some

01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:27.130
startups are going to pay you well, some startups are going

01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:30.130
to negotiate a lot because they will be having a budget

01:05:30.130 --> 01:05:32.310
constraint. Maybe they are just trying to start. They have

01:05:32.310 --> 01:05:35.250
not raised the funding, a lot of X, Y, G factor you will be

01:05:35.250 --> 01:05:38.090
able to find out. But what I always believe is that, that

01:05:38.090 --> 01:05:40.870
once in a lifetime, we all have to work with at least one

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:43.910
startup, right? At least one startup. So that we can go

01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:47.530
through all of those features because see there is a

01:05:47.530 --> 01:05:49.810
disadvantage, but again, there is an advantage. The

01:05:49.810 --> 01:05:53.370
advantage is very simple. So startup is the only like a

01:05:53.370 --> 01:05:57.330
place where you will be able to see everything from a

01:05:57.330 --> 01:06:00.650
scratch, right? Everything from a scratch. If I'll talk

01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:03.930
about MNCs, if I talk about the FANG kind of a companies. So

01:06:03.930 --> 01:06:07.150
over there, not all the time I would say, right? So if

01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:08.990
you're lucky, obviously you will be able to see everything

01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:12.250
from the scratch, but if you are lucky. Chances are very,

01:06:12.310 --> 01:06:16.230
very less if you're lucky, right? In majority of the cases,

01:06:16.330 --> 01:06:19.750
you will not be able to see things or you will not end up

01:06:20.270 --> 01:06:24.550
developing things from the scratch in terms of MNCs and FANG

01:06:24.550 --> 01:06:27.390
based companies and I believe most of us have a similar kind

01:06:27.390 --> 01:06:29.690
of experience, right? Most of us have a similar kind of

01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:32.010
experience who have worked into MNC or FANG. So at least

01:06:32.010 --> 01:06:34.930
once in a lifetime, we should explore an opportunity with a

01:06:34.930 --> 01:06:37.130
startup at least for eight to nine months because eight to

01:06:37.130 --> 01:06:39.490
nine months is going to teach you a lot that you will not be

01:06:39.490 --> 01:06:42.510
able to like get it. Maybe in four to five years in MNCs or

01:06:42.510 --> 01:06:44.670
maybe into a FANG and that is going to help you out for your

01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:48.510
entire life, right? Because when you try to develop a

01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:53.750
product from a scratch and you are working maybe as an

01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:55.970
architect, you are working as a lead, you are working as an

01:06:55.970 --> 01:07:00.130
engineer, doesn't matter, but you will be involved into each

01:07:00.130 --> 01:07:03.110
and every processes, right? Sometime even you will be

01:07:03.110 --> 01:07:05.810
involved with the end user. You will be getting a direct

01:07:05.810 --> 01:07:09.650
feedback, immediate feedback. You have to do a changes very

01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:14.270
fast, right? And you have to adopt the things in a fastest

01:07:14.270 --> 01:07:18.130
possible manner, right? So keeping that in a mind, a startup

01:07:18.130 --> 01:07:22.270
is one of the best place in terms of learning, in terms of

01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:24.770
compensation, in terms of salary, in terms of a stability,

01:07:25.010 --> 01:07:29.410
obviously with majority of startup, you will not be able to

01:07:29.410 --> 01:07:33.930
like maybe you will not be able to get it as simple as that,

01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:36.450
right? Because this is how the startup works. But yeah, they

01:07:36.450 --> 01:07:39.970
will teach you a lot. Lot means literally a lot. So if you

01:07:39.970 --> 01:07:42.870
are going to give an interview for a startup, so majority of

01:07:42.870 --> 01:07:46.590
time, these startups are following a hackathon style kind of

01:07:46.590 --> 01:07:49.650
a interview, hackathon kind of interview means. So let's

01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:53.490
suppose if I have applied, my resume got selected and yeah,

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:57.150
so they will give me a task. They will ask me that, okay,

01:07:57.190 --> 01:07:58.930
fine. So can you please try to build these things in two

01:07:58.930 --> 01:08:01.110
days or three days and then send me the entire code base,

01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:05.950
send me the entire explanation or maybe include or attach a

01:08:05.950 --> 01:08:08.730
complete readme file. Or try to like create the final case

01:08:08.730 --> 01:08:12.130
studies and then send it to me, right? So generally startups

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:16.830
are following a hackathon based approach in terms of hiring.

01:08:17.070 --> 01:08:20.350
So they will give you a task and obviously they will give

01:08:20.350 --> 01:08:23.150
you one, two days of time and they're going to ask you to

01:08:23.150 --> 01:08:25.970
submit the project and like you, so many people will be

01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:28.690
submitting a project. So obviously they are going to look

01:08:28.690 --> 01:08:32.770
into the project and then based on that project, the way you

01:08:32.770 --> 01:08:35.230
have developed it, the way you have built it, they are going

01:08:35.230 --> 01:08:38.750
to call for a call, the next round. So the very first

01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:40.910
filtration round is going to be hackathon kind of approach.

01:08:41.190 --> 01:08:43.630
So be ready for that. By the way, yeah, many startups

01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:48.190
follows the same thing. Whereas if I'll talk about MNCs,

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:52.350
right? So in terms of MNCs, they will be more structured,

01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:57.070
they will be more process oriented and they will be more

01:08:57.070 --> 01:09:00.630
like a flow oriented you can say. So they have a steps like,

01:09:00.690 --> 01:09:03.930
okay, fine, so filter out the resume and then like let's go

01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:06.490
for the round number one in round number one. So maybe they

01:09:06.490 --> 01:09:08.770
will just talk about your projects, which you have mentioned

01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:12.550
inside the resume. Technically a storytelling, right? Maybe

01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:15.190
in our next round. So they are going to talk about the

01:09:15.190 --> 01:09:18.510
architecture or system design understanding, maybe into a

01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:22.430
next round. So they are going to like talk about a

01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:25.830
managerial, take the managerial round, maybe into a next to

01:09:25.830 --> 01:09:28.110
next round. So they are going to just take a HR round,

01:09:28.170 --> 01:09:31.110
negotiate about the salary and then done, right? This is

01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:34.530
just a procedure that we try to follow in terms of MNCs. If

01:09:34.530 --> 01:09:36.730
I'll talk about a FANG, right? FANG kind of companies,

01:09:37.190 --> 01:09:41.670
doesn't matter, doesn't matter you are applying for which

01:09:41.670 --> 01:09:45.930
profile. If you are into a tech, you have to go through a

01:09:45.930 --> 01:09:49.470
DSA round, very simple, doesn't matter. You are going to

01:09:49.470 --> 01:09:55.030
apply for a gen AI engineer or maybe as a ML engineer or as

01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:57.830
a ops engineer, as a front end engineer, as a back end

01:09:57.830 --> 01:10:02.870
engineer, their filtration criteria is a DSA. Without that

01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:06.370
data structure. Data structure. What is DSA sir? Okay.

01:10:06.430 --> 01:10:10.730
That's amazing question. Data structure and algorithm. Yeah.

01:10:11.090 --> 01:10:14.730
DSA. So it doesn't matter which, for which profile you are

01:10:14.730 --> 01:10:19.490
going to apply, but yeah, DSA is the starting point because,

01:10:19.670 --> 01:10:26.110
no, it was not a roaster by the way. Okay. So DSA is going

01:10:26.110 --> 01:10:28.850
to be the starting point. So be ready for that. If you are

01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:31.690
targeting such kind of a companies, if you're targeting a

01:10:31.690 --> 01:10:34.750
FANG kind of a company or top product based. Not just FANG.

01:10:34.850 --> 01:10:37.410
So again, if I'll talk about Adobe kind of a companies,

01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:40.370
they, they comes under the same category. Right. And

01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:43.610
likewise, there are many more companies. So all the major

01:10:43.610 --> 01:10:46.350
product based companies, they are going to start their round

01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:50.790
with a DSA. And again, for a DSA, it's not like you should

01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:53.050
go and you should try to solve maybe a thousand, 2000

01:10:53.050 --> 01:10:57.890
question. No. 100, 120, 150 questions are more than enough

01:10:57.890 --> 01:11:00.730
because majority of the companies are going to ask you a

01:11:00.730 --> 01:11:02.910
question based on the pattern. Okay. So if you have solved

01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:06.890
120, 150 questions, right, uh, on all of those patterns,

01:11:07.090 --> 01:11:10.130
maybe a DFS, BFS, or maybe Dijkstra, Kruskal, all those

01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:12.810
graph algorithm, or maybe a search sorting and searching

01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:16.530
algorithms, it's, it's more than enough, right? It's more

01:11:16.530 --> 01:11:21.390
than enough. So DSA, but yeah, it is important. So once you

01:11:21.390 --> 01:11:24.710
will go through a DSA, right? Once you will go through a

01:11:24.710 --> 01:11:29.170
DSA, then obviously they will try to focus on a system

01:11:29.170 --> 01:11:33.130
design SD. Okay. System design. So where they will be

01:11:33.130 --> 01:11:36.090
talking about each and every component layer by layer, layer

01:11:36.090 --> 01:11:40.390
by layer. So starting from a low level to the high level and

01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:44.570
this system design or DSA round, the difficulties will

01:11:44.570 --> 01:11:49.010
change as your experience is going to change. Right? So

01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:51.630
obviously difficulties are not going to be same for a

01:11:51.630 --> 01:11:54.850
fresher and for a mid label and for a senior position, it's,

01:11:54.850 --> 01:11:56.370
it's going to be different, right? It's going to be

01:11:56.370 --> 01:12:00.430
different. And as you will like, uh, you will be senior. So

01:12:00.430 --> 01:12:03.590
obviously they will try to focus more and more on this side,

01:12:03.690 --> 01:12:06.670
system design side, right? Because this is pretty much

01:12:06.670 --> 01:12:09.430
important. This is pretty much crucial, uh, for those

01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:15.270
companies. So system design, then, then, then they are going

01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:17.590
to focus, let's suppose if I'm going to apply for a Genia

01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:21.070
engineer, right? So here hackathon style here are very

01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:24.150
process oriented and then resume style. They will just go

01:12:24.150 --> 01:12:27.390
with the flow of your resume in case in terms of MNCs, so

01:12:27.390 --> 01:12:29.970
they will not like, uh, try to explore anything extra. By

01:12:29.970 --> 01:12:32.210
the way, simple resume in every round, they will open up

01:12:32.210 --> 01:12:34.690
your resume and they will start like asking a question based

01:12:34.690 --> 01:12:37.850
on your resume as per their rounds in terms of Fang or

01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:41.650
purpose companies. So DSA and system design is a entry

01:12:41.650 --> 01:12:44.410
point, right? Without that, you will not be able to enter at

01:12:44.410 --> 01:12:46.970
all means literally at all, you will not be able to enter.

01:12:47.330 --> 01:12:52.230
And then they are going to focus on earth algorithm

01:12:52.230 --> 01:12:57.010
algorithm. Now when I say algorithm, so are we talking about

01:12:57.010 --> 01:13:00.810
a data algorithm? No. We are talking about basically a

01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:02.890
machine learning algorithm, we are talking about a deep

01:13:02.890 --> 01:13:05.650
learning algorithm, we are talking about a NLP algorithm. So

01:13:05.650 --> 01:13:13.870
here when I say algo, so ML, DL, NLP, CV. So these sections

01:13:13.870 --> 01:13:16.670
where we try to discuss about the core algorithm, for

01:13:16.670 --> 01:13:19.470
example, ML algorithm, right? So we talk about a linear

01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:22.610
regression, logistic regression, a decision tree, XG boost,

01:13:22.810 --> 01:13:28.090
random forest, PCAs, TSNEs, all of these things. You have to

01:13:28.090 --> 01:13:31.350
like. You have to be aware about if I'll talk about a deal.

01:13:31.530 --> 01:13:34.690
So obviously I must be aware about a complete a neural

01:13:34.690 --> 01:13:37.890
network. So when I say neural networks, obviously input

01:13:37.890 --> 01:13:43.430
layer, hidden layer or maybe optimizer, maybe like a loss

01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:46.950
functions, maybe. So any anything and everything which comes

01:13:46.950 --> 01:13:49.570
in between. If I'll talk about a NLP, so obviously I'll talk

01:13:49.570 --> 01:13:54.470
about the RNN, LSTM or GRUs, encoder, decoder or maybe one

01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:58.330
to one, one to many kind of a structure architecture. Okay.

01:13:58.350 --> 01:14:01.590
So transformer architecture, again, very much crucial. So

01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:03.970
all of these things I must be aware about. If I'll talk

01:14:03.970 --> 01:14:06.990
about a computer vision, so convolutional neural network

01:14:06.990 --> 01:14:10.710
inside that. So there are again multiple segment

01:14:10.710 --> 01:14:13.430
classification. There is a detection, there is a

01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:16.650
segmentation, there is object tracking. And again, inside

01:14:16.650 --> 01:14:19.890
that there are multiple algorithms. So I must be aware about

01:14:19.890 --> 01:14:23.770
all of these algorithm. Now you can say that, okay, fine. So

01:14:23.770 --> 01:14:25.890
I'm applying for a generative way. Then why I'm supposed to

01:14:25.890 --> 01:14:28.330
be aware about it? The reason is, I'm applying for a

01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:29.230
generative way. The reason is very simple. These are the

01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:34.690
building blocks of any AI system or any like a data science

01:14:34.690 --> 01:14:37.490
application that you are going to build and they will be

01:14:37.490 --> 01:14:40.890
expecting that you must be aware about all of these core

01:14:40.890 --> 01:14:45.790
fundamentals, right? Core fundamentals when you are going to

01:14:45.790 --> 01:14:49.230
apply for these companies. So they will not focus on the

01:14:49.230 --> 01:14:51.790
application that you have built. Yeah, they will focus on

01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:55.210
that. But yeah, in a fourth or fifth round till third round.

01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:59.450
So no, they will be talking about these algorithms. Then

01:14:59.450 --> 01:15:03.270
then so technically on third round till third round. So you

01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:05.710
will go through these things. Now once you are able to cross

01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:10.810
this one, then they will consider your resume means whatever

01:15:10.810 --> 01:15:13.570
project that you have mentioned inside your resume, they

01:15:13.570 --> 01:15:16.010
will start talking about that. That okay, fine. So tell me

01:15:16.010 --> 01:15:18.130
about this project. Tell me about that project. What was the

01:15:18.130 --> 01:15:21.150
design? What was the algorithm? What was the latency? What

01:15:21.150 --> 01:15:23.530
was the team structure? What was the day to day task? What

01:15:23.530 --> 01:15:26.370
was the difficulties that you have faced? So around this.

01:15:26.370 --> 01:15:29.490
They will start framing a question in this particular round.

01:15:29.710 --> 01:15:33.310
But yeah, so if I'll talk about these companies, so the

01:15:33.310 --> 01:15:37.530
interviewers will be very, very mature, right? Generally,

01:15:37.530 --> 01:15:41.050
you will be able to find out sometime that in MNCs and maybe

01:15:41.050 --> 01:15:43.790
in a startup. So interviewer will try to satisfy their ego,

01:15:43.890 --> 01:15:48.130
ego in terms of, you know, they will try to like ask a

01:15:48.130 --> 01:15:51.250
question or they will try to frame the question where they

01:15:51.250 --> 01:15:54.370
get stuck recently. So let's suppose I'm an interviewer, I'm

01:15:54.370 --> 01:15:57.730
working into some project. Right. Because every day we face

01:15:57.730 --> 01:16:00.110
a new challenges. And for sure, we get stuck in some of the

01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:04.530
things and in an interview. So I'll just go and ask the same

01:16:04.530 --> 01:16:08.010
question. Right. Or maybe I'll just try to prove myself

01:16:08.010 --> 01:16:11.130
that, okay, fine, I'm superior in terms of knowledge. But in

01:16:11.130 --> 01:16:14.450
case of a FANG or product based companies, majority of times

01:16:14.450 --> 01:16:17.530
or in 99.9% of times, you will not be able to find out this

01:16:17.530 --> 01:16:21.110
kind of a cases because they're very mature. And even they

01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:24.650
have an instruction from their department that you have to

01:16:24.650 --> 01:16:26.750
conduct an interview in this particular manner. Right. They

01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:30.190
will not try to test your memory at all. Right. In FANG or

01:16:30.190 --> 01:16:33.050
product based companies, they will try to test your logic

01:16:33.050 --> 01:16:37.590
building skills. Right. Means a complete human skills they

01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:40.110
are going to test, not a machine oriented skill, which is

01:16:40.110 --> 01:16:42.210
technically a memory. Right. They're not going to test your

01:16:42.210 --> 01:16:48.010
memory at all. So to crack these kinds of companies, the

01:16:48.010 --> 01:16:52.590
simple way is to work in a project because that is the only

01:16:52.590 --> 01:16:55.530
way by which you will be able to get a real time

01:16:55.530 --> 01:16:56.250
expectation.

01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:07.430
So you will be able to get some experience with it. A lot of

01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:07.630
things you have to work on yourself, like doing some basic

01:17:07.630 --> 01:17:07.630
work on yourself, getting That is also the same thing with

01:17:07.630 --> 01:17:12.250
FANGs. You have to work on your mindset. And FANGs are your

01:17:12.250 --> 01:17:15.750
best friend. And they will. And you can, they will take the

01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:16.690
work out and give it to you. They will give you the right

01:17:16.690 --> 01:17:17.290
information, but you have to do the right things. So you're

01:17:17.290 --> 01:17:20.030
going to have to approach the new market and. And also, I'm

01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:26.230
going to show you two things.

01:17:26.250 --> 01:17:29.690
softs and many other things many other perks in a startup a

01:17:29.690 --> 01:17:32.770
flexibility many more things right many more things but

01:17:32.770 --> 01:17:36.290
again not every every startup will be able to give you that

01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:40.230
right so maybe with the phases you will be able to achieve

01:17:40.230 --> 01:17:46.310
this one so yes there is a pros there is a cons everywhere

01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:50.210
in in terms of like packages in terms of interview in terms

01:17:50.210 --> 01:17:53.470
of our work culture in terms of our perks additional parks

01:17:53.470 --> 01:17:56.690
that are going to give it to you and according to your

01:17:56.690 --> 01:18:02.590
preparation so you can try to target either of this if you

01:18:02.590 --> 01:18:05.070
think that maybe I'm not prepared for this one it's

01:18:05.070 --> 01:18:08.350
completely fine go for this go for this at the end of the

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:13.030
day you have to secure a job and then once you are already

01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:18.130
working into a84 Keep on preparing because your upskilling

01:18:18.130 --> 01:18:21.690
is never and never going to stop and especially in the early

01:18:21.690 --> 01:18:24.890
stage of our business of getting Mucha age of ai now it's

01:18:24.890 --> 01:18:30.110
impossible to stop yourself from upskilling so today you are

01:18:30.110 --> 01:18:32.130
trying to do upskilling tomorrow you will do the same thing

01:18:32.130 --> 01:18:34.650
maybe on a new topic maybe on a new agenda but yeah you will

01:18:34.650 --> 01:18:39.970
have to keep on doing that thing uh fine guys yes yep

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:52.580
everyone is it clear so three different different kind of

01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:56.280
companies uh these are the tech stack by the way you are

01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:58.980
supposed to be aware about if you are not aware about this

01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:03.620
then uh you should prepare first and then go for the

01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:05.900
interview right you can take your time maybe three to four

01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:09.060
months of time and then uh you can can just like do the

01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:15.380
preparation fine now so here when i talk about generative ai

01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:18.540
so these are the core skill by the way like i said these are

01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:22.960
the core skill without this you will not be able to move as

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:27.940
simple as that right you will not be able to move along with

01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:31.860
this right along with this you are supposed to be aware

01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:35.300
about couple of more things to apply for a generative ai

01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:43.160
engineer so additional skills or i can say maybe a framework

01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:48.400
right framework so we have already talked about this model

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:51.620
architecture understanding and before that so i talked about

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:54.780
a model pipeline for a fine tuning from or maybe a model

01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:58.960
building so those are things are by default right those

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:03.160
things are by default but nowadays right people are even

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:06.900
expecting some of the complementary skills or you can say

01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:12.240
additional skills t-i-o-n l yeah additional skills or

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:16.320
complementary skills you can say so nowadays right let's

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:20.800
suppose i'm a person and i'm able to showcase a complete

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:27.040
product design product design for an ai for an ai if i'm

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:30.540
able to discuss about that right uh for example so let's

01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:34.600
suppose we are building a resume ai and if if i'm able to

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:38.000
you know uh wireframe wireframe means the complete like a

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.480
skeleton if i'm able to design that okay fine so this will

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:43.320
be the user flow so my user will come on this particular

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:45.660
page then they are going to click on this then they are

01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:48.240
going to upload the resume then i will be able to showcase

01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:52.520
like this this this kind of forms they can try to skip it

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:56.260
they can try to choose it so if i'm able to design a product

01:20:56.260 --> 01:20:57.140
design product design for an ai if i'm able to design that

01:20:57.140 --> 01:21:03.680
entire flow for a particular ai product for example we have

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:06.640
avani so obviously we have designed a flow for resume ai

01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:10.400
obviously we have designed the flow for a yuri api we have

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:13.320
designed the flow and you all will be able to observe a flow

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:18.160
with every click right because you you as a user will not be

01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:21.080
able to think about it right but when we are building those

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:24.640
product or you are going to build such kind of a product so

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:27.640
obviously you will be thinking about every click that okay

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:32.020
fine so from here to here uh how user will move basically or

01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:35.360
what action users are going to call can we try to optimize

01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:38.880
that number of clicks so let's suppose i'm asking user to do

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:42.020
a 10 clicks maybe i can i can try to maybe like ask user to

01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:45.200
do one single clicks recently i have done that so you you

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:51.060
must have observed that uh yesterday right so we have

01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:55.680
changed our design a little bit and we are like uh we have

01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:58.380
published a new design uh based on our like experience

01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:00.920
basically right based on our experience so we have changed

01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:03.700
our design a little bit and here you will be able to find

01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:06.920
out that we have introduced a new design that okay finance

01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:09.180
user can come over here they can search for the courses they

01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:12.240
will be able to access all the product line uh from here

01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:14.540
they will be able to see all the continuous learning from

01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:16.800
here directly they will be able to check all the live

01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:19.100
classes from here and they will be able to access all the

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:23.060
other feature from here so again these are the part of a

01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:26.600
product design or maybe building a business we need to be

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:26.600
able to think about the products and the customer experience

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:29.860
and whenever you are going to develop any kind of a product

01:22:29.860 --> 01:22:33.560
obviously someone is going to do that task someone is going

01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:37.460
to do that work right someone is going to do that work so it

01:22:37.460 --> 01:22:41.680
will be better right it will be better if you are aware

01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:45.520
about it if you are aware about it and if you go and claim

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:50.140
and you can say that okay uh so yeah i know i have done the

01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:53.000
product design i have designed the entire user flow for this

01:22:56.260 --> 01:23:00.180
startup industry yes we do that even we do that in our mncs

01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:03.700
because uh in mnc generally project is going to start with

01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:08.080
the mvps right a minimum viable product so a small product a

01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:10.680
small demo that you are going to give it to your client or

01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:15.380
maybe your stakeholders and at that point of a time so we as

01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:23.760
an engineer do each and every task yes yeah so yes ui ux is

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:26.260
becoming amazing sir if you explain your four or five

01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:29.940
feature step by step it's if you explain your four or five

01:23:29.940 --> 01:23:33.740
feature which feature i think i'm already explaining yeah so

01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:37.580
additional skill uh is this one uh which people are

01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:41.760
expecting nowadays because in a startup they are looking for

01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:45.220
a person so who can build and develop end-to-end each and

01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:49.200
everything because we are living in an era of ai right so if

01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:52.220
we have to even produce a system of a product ui interface a

01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:55.520
basic a minimalistic one for any product i can do it in a no

01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:59.240
time right we have a platform like a lovable from there we

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:03.360
will be able to generate it and so again we have a lot of

01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:06.080
platforms a lot of tools where i can go and i can do a vive

01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:10.380
coding right i can do a live coding so these are the skills

01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:13.000
guys right so these skills are additional skills and i

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
believe uh we we all should acquire that kind of first

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:21.140
skills as well this is one of the things right uh you must

01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:25.200
be aware about multiple models so vision based model a text

01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:29.960
based model or a audio based model those things are again

01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:33.480
the part of that tech stack the second one right second one

01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:36.580
and the most important one which is going to give you a

01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:41.280
compliment throughout your life and most of us try to ignore

01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:46.600
it and that is a storytelling storytelling

01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:59.900
or i can say a communication skill majority of us try to

01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:02.640
prepare for this interview majority of us try to you know

01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:08.200
solve a lot of dsa problems or maybe we try to build a lot

01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:13.480
of product or project small or big but one thing majority of

01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:18.360
us never try to focus on is a storytelling right everyone

01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:24.240
yes i believe that's the case with most of us yeah we never

01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:26.680
try to focus on a storytelling we never try to focus on a

01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:32.560
communication skill yeah and this creates a major failure

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:36.960
point for most of us in an interview doesn't matter let's

01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:40.880
suppose and I'm not very much aware about tech stack right

01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:45.260
so maybe I'm aware about a tech stack like some of the DB

01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:48.840
and then some of the algorithms that's completely fine but

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:53.580
if I'm aware about or if I know how to do a storytelling if

01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:58.820
I know how to phrase or how to talk about a project how to

01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:01.740
talk about the entire tech stack that I have learnt or maybe

01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:05.400
I'm using it in my current project how I'm solving a current

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:08.540
client problem what kind of a benefit I'm able to generate

01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:13.660
from my for my current organization believe me there is a

01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:16.520
very very high chance that you will be able to crack an

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:18.840
interview right you will be able to crack an interview

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:24.700
easily so communication a skill of always plays a vital role

01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:29.640
in almost all the interview so whether you are going to

01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:33.000
apply for a startup you are going to apply for MNCs or maybe

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.760
you are going to apply for a FANG because again so you

01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:39.780
should know that how you will be able to sell yourself

01:26:39.780 --> 01:26:43.460
because interview is all about selling yourself right so you

01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:47.000
are trying to you know prove your values you are trying to

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.820
prove your worth in front of our interviewer so technically

01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:52.480
you are trying to sell yourself and obviously technically

01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:52.480
you are trying to sell your value so technically you are

01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:56.000
trying to to become a good salesman you must have a command

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:01.140
on your story on your communication right so that is a skill

01:27:01.140 --> 01:27:05.540
set which majority of us try to ignore but I believe that is

01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:09.980
a skill set that we all should focus on since a very very

01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:13.200
very very first day if you don't have that skill set try to

01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:17.100
build it try to develop it because as long as you will be a

01:27:17.100 --> 01:27:20.700
part of industry it is going to help you out right it is

01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:24.740
going to help you out so communication skill this is the

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:29.020
another skills which is required now coming to the next part

01:27:29.020 --> 01:27:34.720
yeah coming to the next part the another skill that is

01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:39.360
getting relevant nowadays is a social media skill or social

01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:40.800
skills so

01:27:45.150 --> 01:27:47.850
many of us try to learn a lot of things many of us try to

01:27:47.850 --> 01:27:51.670
experiment a lot of things but many of us try to many of us

01:27:51.670 --> 01:27:56.470
hesitate right hesitate in terms of showcasing those work or

01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:59.170
maybe the exploration or maybe the things that I have

01:27:59.170 --> 01:28:03.750
studied over a social media platform but believe me a

01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:07.770
platform like linkedin I believe has been created for the

01:28:07.770 --> 01:28:11.110
same purposes where you can go you can talk about some of

01:28:11.110 --> 01:28:14.750
the like experimentation that you have done maybe the

01:28:14.750 --> 01:28:17.870
project you have worked upon or maybe the kind of

01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:22.270
achievement if you you have like a get in your organization

01:28:22.270 --> 01:28:23.830
or maybe from somewhere else you can go and talk about some

01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:23.830
of the like experimentation that you have done maybe the

01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:28.510
right so linkedin is one of the most powerful platform I

01:28:28.510 --> 01:28:32.970
would say to showcase your talent to connect with a like

01:28:32.970 --> 01:28:37.930
-minded people to do a stable networking not just for today

01:28:37.930 --> 01:28:41.070
maybe for a future like today tomorrow maybe for a future

01:28:41.070 --> 01:28:45.830
and many of us try to ignore it many of us are trying to use

01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:50.590
a social media just for like scrolling purposes right not to

01:28:50.590 --> 01:28:53.810
post or not to engage and not to network but to do a stable

01:28:53.810 --> 01:28:54.610
networking not just for today maybe for a future but just to

01:28:54.610 --> 01:28:59.110
a scroll right just we we all are using a social media for a

01:28:59.110 --> 01:29:02.890
endless scrolling and we all are spending approximately four

01:29:02.890 --> 01:29:05.230
to five hour of time maybe you can try to open up your

01:29:05.230 --> 01:29:07.390
mobile now and then you can try to check your screen time

01:29:07.390 --> 01:29:10.730
and you will be amazed that you are spending four to five

01:29:10.730 --> 01:29:14.730
hour of time on an average on a daily basis right but to do

01:29:14.730 --> 01:29:18.230
just one single post it takes maybe one minute of time right

01:29:18.230 --> 01:29:21.790
so where like-minded people will come and then they will

01:29:21.790 --> 01:29:23.810
connect with you in a future or maybe two or three years

01:29:23.810 --> 01:29:24.110
from now and then they will connect with you today tomorrow

01:29:24.110 --> 01:29:26.790
itself they will try to offer you some sort of opportunities

01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:32.350
or it will try to increase your social authentic footprint

01:29:32.350 --> 01:29:37.850
right authentic footprint so again majority of us are not

01:29:37.850 --> 01:29:41.590
able to do it on a regular basis and believe me from my

01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:45.250
personal experience I can tell you right that it helps a lot

01:29:45.250 --> 01:29:48.670
it literally helps a lot in terms of like getting a new

01:29:48.670 --> 01:29:52.270
opportunity in terms of getting the referrals or even when

01:29:52.270 --> 01:29:56.630
you will try to build some thing on your own it is going to

01:29:56.630 --> 01:29:59.170
help you out even at that point of a time so even as an

01:29:59.170 --> 01:30:03.230
entrepreneur or maybe in a future if you like once you will

01:30:03.230 --> 01:30:05.390
think that okay fine so I should get into entrepreneur so I

01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:08.590
should build some product and then launch it it is going to

01:30:08.590 --> 01:30:13.270
help you out a lot so LinkedIn is one such platform which is

01:30:13.270 --> 01:30:18.390
a part of a social skill so I believe LinkedIn

01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:26.840
right then as a coder as a developer again we try to ignore

01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:32.240
one more things which is a GitHub GitHub so LinkedIn and

01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:36.660
GitHub is the must link which should be a part of your

01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:39.640
resume by default no one is going to ask you that try to

01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:42.680
give me a LinkedIn ID or try to give me a GitHub no you

01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:46.200
should mention these two things by default and obviously

01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:48.820
when you are trying to mention this LinkedIn and GitHub you

01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:52.700
should show some activities because just sharing a LinkedIn

01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:56.900
and sharing a GitHub link of your like a profile is not

01:30:56.900 --> 01:30:59.400
going to work so unless and until you are not showcasing

01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:02.100
some activities on a GitHub unless and until you are not

01:31:02.100 --> 01:31:07.190
showcasing some activities on a LinkedIn it's of no use even

01:31:07.190 --> 01:31:11.210
if you are going to share so for LinkedIn start posting so

01:31:11.210 --> 01:31:13.550
for example if you have explored some project or maybe if

01:31:13.550 --> 01:31:16.310
you have done some sort of storytelling for example this is

01:31:16.310 --> 01:31:18.450
the task which I am going to give you right this is the task

01:31:18.450 --> 01:31:19.950
which I am going to give you let's suppose you are doing

01:31:19.950 --> 01:31:23.190
exploration that how to build a model from the scratch right

01:31:23.190 --> 01:31:25.890
maybe how to do a fine tuning of the model or maybe how to

01:31:25.890 --> 01:31:29.030
deploy of or do the inferencing for a pre-trained model

01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:32.650
write a beautiful article LinkedIn is giving you a platform

01:31:32.650 --> 01:31:35.350
for writing the entire into an article and if your article

01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:38.170
is good LinkedIn itself is going to promote and that article

01:31:38.170 --> 01:31:40.910
will reach out to a millions of people not millions forget

01:31:40.910 --> 01:31:43.710
about that maybe hundreds of people right it will reach out

01:31:43.710 --> 01:31:47.470
to the hundreds of people so that is that is going to help

01:31:47.470 --> 01:31:50.210
you out a lot there are other platform blogging platform for

01:31:50.210 --> 01:31:52.650
example a medium is one of the platform where you can go and

01:31:52.650 --> 01:31:57.370
you can try to write the blogs so start doing that and on

01:31:57.370 --> 01:32:00.710
GitHub right on GitHub so let's suppose if I am working on

01:32:00.710 --> 01:32:03.450
some of the class project because I keep on giving a lot of

01:32:03.450 --> 01:32:06.830
project inside a class a lot of experimentation so even in

01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:09.650
my generative you will be able to find out like every day

01:32:09.650 --> 01:32:15.850
I'm giving a challenges uh so just complete those challenges

01:32:15.850 --> 01:32:19.250
push it inside the GitHub so that your entire GitHub account

01:32:19.250 --> 01:32:23.010
will be active right people will be able to see a active

01:32:23.010 --> 01:32:25.410
contribution over there and they will say that okay fine

01:32:25.410 --> 01:32:28.230
these these this guy is like a serious about a coding reason

01:32:28.230 --> 01:32:28.230
or a code of conduct thing . that is what I am going to do

01:32:28.230 --> 01:32:31.290
right now. this guy is serious about the work so to showcase

01:32:31.290 --> 01:32:35.250
your seriousness you should be active over here you should

01:32:35.250 --> 01:32:38.550
be active over here and believe me you will enjoy doing it

01:32:38.550 --> 01:32:43.390
so once you will start like getting attraction on your

01:32:43.390 --> 01:32:50.190
profile you will enjoy making sense guys yep

01:32:52.430 --> 01:32:58.370
yeah so all all of you are going to enjoy so start doing it

01:32:58.370 --> 01:33:04.550
from today LinkedIn and github both let's suppose if you are

01:33:04.550 --> 01:33:07.730
trying to prepare the documentation post it on on a github

01:33:07.730 --> 01:33:10.150
post it on a LinkedIn blog just you have to do copy and

01:33:10.150 --> 01:33:12.610
paste right anyhow you are spending four to five hour of

01:33:12.610 --> 01:33:15.570
time on your mobile devices try to spend one to two minute

01:33:15.570 --> 01:33:20.490
of time to do this to post this daily continuously maybe

01:33:20.490 --> 01:33:24.530
twice or thrice in a day right twice and thrice in a day and

01:33:24.530 --> 01:33:27.270
believe me the kind of a return you will be able to get in

01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:31.030
long term is unimaginable and unbelievable you must have

01:33:31.030 --> 01:33:33.830
seen all the influencers right right they're just a human

01:33:33.830 --> 01:33:36.130
being yes they're just a human being you must have seen a

01:33:36.130 --> 01:33:38.210
LinkedIn influencer Instagram influencer YouTube influencer

01:33:38.210 --> 01:33:40.490
a different different categories of the influencer on a

01:33:40.490 --> 01:33:42.830
different platform they're just a human being like every one

01:33:42.830 --> 01:33:47.810
of us right the only unique thing that they have done is

01:33:47.810 --> 01:33:52.490
with discipline with consistency they just keep on posting

01:33:52.490 --> 01:33:58.370
and one kind of audience they have attracted right so which

01:33:58.370 --> 01:34:00.990
which like which is having a similar kind of a thought the

01:34:00.990 --> 01:34:04.430
kind of post that they are doing as simple as that and yeah

01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:07.390
they are able to leverage it this is how the entire world

01:34:07.390 --> 01:34:11.550
works so if you will start doing it believe me in next three

01:34:11.550 --> 01:34:14.890
to four month of time itself you will be able to leverage it

01:34:14.890 --> 01:34:17.430
in terms of getting a lots of different different kind of

01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:21.510
opportunity as per your need if you are not doing it because

01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:23.050
I know many of you are very familiar with will not do it

01:34:23.050 --> 01:34:27.350
right that that's a pretty like obvious things and I know by

01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:32.990
the way so it's completely fine world is not going to be

01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:36.470
going to change world is going to be exactly same as it is

01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:40.310
today so it's going to be exactly same but yeah you will not

01:34:40.310 --> 01:34:42.830
be able to get the opportunity maybe you will not be able to

01:34:42.830 --> 01:34:47.810
even reach out to those opportunities fine so hope this

01:34:47.810 --> 01:34:52.230
makes sense to all of us by the way so linkedin and github

01:34:52.230 --> 01:34:56.810
if you are not active over here activate yourself it just

01:34:56.810 --> 01:34:59.730
take one to two minute of your time in a daily basis not

01:34:59.730 --> 01:35:04.030
more than that and mention those links inside your resume

01:35:04.030 --> 01:35:08.930
yeah so now these are the skills now coming to the final

01:35:08.930 --> 01:35:13.790
part right final part of this discussion this basic

01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:17.350
discussion a resume resume

01:35:19.270 --> 01:35:26.210
right resume resume. So I'm expecting all of you to submit

01:35:26.210 --> 01:35:32.490
your resume on priority after making a changes and after

01:35:32.490 --> 01:35:37.050
refining your resume with a resume AI. Maybe you can try to

01:35:37.050 --> 01:35:40.950
use resume AI or even outside of Euron ecosystem. So there

01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:43.090
are multiple platforms where you can go and upload a resume

01:35:43.090 --> 01:35:46.210
and it is going to do a refinement. Maybe you can use a

01:35:46.210 --> 01:35:49.330
Euron platform. So create a resume from the scratch. But

01:35:49.330 --> 01:35:56.250
again, as a task before Sunday, right before Sunday, all of

01:35:56.250 --> 01:35:57.610
you have

01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:05.560
to send resume

01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:12.950
in group. So we already have a WhatsApp group, right? So

01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:16.630
just keep on sending your resume, but not a raw resume. If

01:36:16.630 --> 01:36:18.950
you are going to send a raw resume, if you are going to send

01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:22.190
your resume without any kind of a modification or work, I'm

01:36:22.190 --> 01:36:24.230
not going to give you any feedback. I'm not going to give

01:36:24.230 --> 01:36:26.330
you any kind of a comment. Because after doing this kind of

01:36:26.330 --> 01:36:29.850
a discussion, so obviously I'm not expecting such things. So

01:36:29.850 --> 01:36:35.170
you have to refine your resume. You have to modify your

01:36:35.170 --> 01:36:39.110
project. You have to modify the skill set that you have

01:36:39.110 --> 01:36:42.170
already mentioned, maybe into your old resume. So just

01:36:42.170 --> 01:36:44.830
refine your entire resume. Like I said, so try to use a

01:36:44.830 --> 01:36:48.570
resume AI, that's completely okay. So maybe as we have given

01:36:48.570 --> 01:36:51.210
you a JD section, so inside JD section, so maybe try to give

01:36:51.210 --> 01:36:54.230
some sort of a Gen AI kind of a JD. It will be able to

01:36:54.230 --> 01:36:57.010
refine it automatically. So again, it's a no brainer kind of

01:36:57.010 --> 01:36:59.970
a things, but yeah, so you have to at least do this. So just

01:36:59.970 --> 01:37:05.630
try to modify your resume and then try to add at least, at

01:37:05.630 --> 01:37:12.350
least for now, right? For now, two to three project

01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:15.860
related

01:37:18.350 --> 01:37:24.610
to Gen AI. Now when I say Gen AI, simply says that simply

01:37:24.610 --> 01:37:28.010
means that, that it should use all of these stack, right? A

01:37:28.010 --> 01:37:30.170
kind of a project. Right. If you are using all of these

01:37:30.170 --> 01:37:33.710
stack automatically, it will become a generative AI project.

01:37:33.990 --> 01:37:38.330
So with two to three project, so this is something that you

01:37:38.330 --> 01:37:41.650
have to mention inside your resume part number one. So this

01:37:41.650 --> 01:37:44.970
is basically part number one, part number two, right?

01:37:48.450 --> 01:37:54.780
Project that you have mentioned in

01:37:59.230 --> 01:38:01.150
your resume resume.

01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:10.340
So prepare a storytelling, prepare

01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:24.760
a story about it. So. So for example, if I have mentioned

01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:27.460
maybe a project, so where I'm trying to do a model fine

01:38:27.460 --> 01:38:31.640
tuning, right? So starting from the problem, because every

01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:34.820
story, every project starts with the problem statement that

01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:38.140
what was a problem that we have been facing and again, I'll

01:38:38.140 --> 01:38:40.240
talk about it. So when I'm going to discuss about the

01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:42.520
project, which is eventually going to happen next week, I

01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:45.200
don't think that today we have a time I've already prepared

01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:48.600
a list one for today's discussion, but yeah, so because of

01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:50.720
time crunch, I will not be able to discuss today. So next

01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:52.860
Monday, obviously we are going to have that kind of a

01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:55.380
project discussion. So we're telling basically where I'm

01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:57.400
going to tell this, tell you the story, you will be having

01:38:57.400 --> 01:38:59.280
your own story. That's completely fine. But yeah, so I'm

01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:01.820
going to make a, well, I'm going to tell you the refined

01:39:01.820 --> 01:39:05.240
story about any of this project in a very, very detailed way

01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:08.900
from a architecture perspective, from HLD, LLD, PRD from

01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:11.340
every side of it, right? So I'm going to talk about the

01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:15.300
story of the particular project. But before that, I want you

01:39:15.300 --> 01:39:17.980
to do some sort of an investigation. So whatever project

01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:20.300
that you are going to mention, because then only you will be

01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:24.040
able to get an interest, right? Otherwise. Yeah. It is. It

01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:26.880
is not going to work. It is not going to help you out. So

01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:29.440
here, whatever project that you have mentioned, let's

01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:32.020
suppose I have mentioned two to three project for that

01:39:32.020 --> 01:39:36.880
project, prepare your story board, right? Prepare a story

01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:39.740
board starting from where? So starting from a problem

01:39:39.740 --> 01:39:42.980
statement, the solution that you have proposed, what was

01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:45.440
your roles and responsibilities? What was your day to day

01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:49.280
task? What was our team structure? What was a final outcome,

01:39:49.460 --> 01:39:52.740
maybe outcome in terms of a monetary or maybe outcome in

01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:55.480
terms of optimizing the process, maybe outcome in terms of

01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:58.380
generating a new revenue sources, maybe outcome in terms of

01:39:58.380 --> 01:40:02.880
saving the existing expenses because technically that is

01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:05.580
kind of outcome that we all will be expecting as a business

01:40:05.580 --> 01:40:07.860
stakeholder, right? Because at the end of the day, either we

01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:10.260
have to save our money or we have to basically like a

01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:14.800
generate a new revenue sources. So just try to create your

01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:19.200
story around it. Plus in between, obviously architecture, a

01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:21.820
system design will comes into a picture. Algorithms will

01:40:21.820 --> 01:40:24.640
come into a picture. A component, component from a

01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:27.100
programming side, component from a database side, component

01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:30.680
from a cloud side will be involved technically, which means

01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:34.280
all of these things will be involved, right? All of these

01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:37.780
things will be involved in between those stories. So you

01:40:37.780 --> 01:40:40.740
have to prepare those stories. Maybe you can take a help of

01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:45.340
ChatGPT, URI, Gemini. I don't care, right? I literally don't

01:40:45.340 --> 01:40:47.660
care about it because at the end of the day I'm looking for

01:40:47.660 --> 01:40:52.560
a story. That's it. So try to take a help of AI. AI will

01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:54.380
help you. AI will be able to write a beautiful story for

01:40:54.380 --> 01:40:58.020
you. But again, that story, the outcome depends upon your

01:40:58.020 --> 01:41:01.380
imagination, right? So whatever imagination, which I have

01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:04.980
given you today, so based on that imagination, based on this

01:41:04.980 --> 01:41:09.900
discussion, so try to prepare a complete story of all of

01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:14.240
these projects, which you are going to mention inside your

01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:20.580
refined resume. As simple as that. If you are not able to

01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:23.200
get a project that which project I should mention. So maybe

01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:26.620
let's suppose if I'm working into a sales domain, again, try

01:41:26.620 --> 01:41:28.700
to do an investigation that, okay, fine. So what kind of a

01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:31.660
project I will be able to create, an enterprise grade

01:41:31.660 --> 01:41:34.400
project I will be able to write inside my resume for a sales

01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:36.700
domain, for a marketing domain, for a finance domain, for a

01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:39.180
banking domain or any other domain, right? In which you are

01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:43.280
working as of now, right? As of now, maybe as a XYZ

01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:46.400
engineer, that's completely fine. So try to build a project,

01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:49.020
try to do an investigation. This is what I want, right? So,

01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:51.780
and again, investigation wise, you will end up interacting

01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:55.640
with the AI. So I want you to do that, right? Because many

01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:58.480
of us are not doing it so that when you will come into my

01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:00.560
next class, right? And when I'm going to talk about the

01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:05.280
story, you will be able to relate easily. You will be able

01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:08.860
to refine. And then again, again, that is not going to be

01:42:08.860 --> 01:42:11.280
the last step. So when I'm going to talk about the story,

01:42:11.460 --> 01:42:15.200
obviously I'm going to ask you to do the refinement into

01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:20.960
your story. So just prepare this one, these two things. And

01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:29.820
here, so try to look into these three processes. One model

01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:33.520
building from the scratch, right? Starting from the N number

01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:35.900
of data sources, a different, different kind of a data in a

01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:39.500
different mode, streaming batch or mini batch, and then the

01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:42.580
entire ETL pipeline, building a model, hosting a model,

01:42:42.660 --> 01:42:45.580
doing inferencing. Just try to do the investigation on this

01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:48.160
particular part, theoretical investigation I'm saying,

01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:52.180
right? Theoretical investigation. Fine tuning, again, same.

01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:55.900
So investigation. If you are looking for a practical one,

01:42:56.020 --> 01:42:58.260
then I have already discussed inside my previous live

01:42:58.260 --> 01:43:01.020
batches. So you can try to follow that if you're looking for

01:43:01.020 --> 01:43:03.960
a practical, but yeah, as of now, as we are preparing for

01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:06.720
the interview, so it should be very, very quick, go with a

01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:08.760
theoretical understanding. That's completely fine. And

01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:11.400
deploying a pre-trained model in a private environment. So

01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:13.920
again, I have already created a video. So recently I have

01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:18.620
done a video with respect to hosting a model.

01:43:21.020 --> 01:43:25.720
So I have already done that video as well. So maybe you can

01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:29.300
try to refer that video. It's a crisp, precise end-to-end

01:43:29.300 --> 01:43:32.260
documentation I have already shared with the entire public.

01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:35.380
Or maybe you can do an investigation on your own and then

01:43:35.380 --> 01:43:39.780
try to like do some sort of experimentation. So this is a

01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:44.220
task guys. This is the task, this three part, and then this

01:43:44.220 --> 01:43:49.180
is a task for you. These two tasks. And this. You have to

01:43:49.180 --> 01:43:54.560
complete. Before Monday means you have a time till Sunday.

01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:58.100
So in your hand, you have five days, right? Five days. And

01:43:58.100 --> 01:44:03.320
this task is going to be the continuous task. So wake up in

01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:06.880
the morning, try to do one post again before going for a

01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:11.120
sleep, do one post or maybe after lunch, do one post done,

01:44:11.220 --> 01:44:15.540
right? Done. So just, just like try to like, uh, you know,

01:44:15.540 --> 01:44:18.440
adopt it as a ritual that you have to do it on a daily

01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:21.200
basis. And believe me, it is going to yield a very, very

01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:23.220
good result. Very good result means literally a very good

01:44:23.220 --> 01:44:25.720
result. It is going to yield in a long term, not in a short

01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:28.300
term. So don't expect that, uh, you will start posting

01:44:28.300 --> 01:44:30.760
tomorrow and then people will, you know, uh, come to your

01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:33.300
profile and they will start saying, wow, you are an amazing

01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:35.920
person known that that is not going to happen. By the way,

01:44:35.940 --> 01:44:38.580
social media takes its own sweet time and it's a very

01:44:38.580 --> 01:44:41.220
crowded space by the way. But yeah, it, it will give you a

01:44:41.220 --> 01:44:44.900
good result if your post is genuine. If you are trying to

01:44:44.900 --> 01:44:46.780
post something authentic, if you're trying to share that

01:44:46.780 --> 01:44:51.180
knowledge or maybe. Achievement and it's authentic one and

01:44:51.180 --> 01:44:54.240
get up. So at least once in a week, try to push some

01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:57.780
documentation, some sort of a, like a code or maybe a

01:44:57.780 --> 01:45:00.640
project or mini project. Try to push it over there. Making

01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:03.300
sense guys. Yeah. 12 of us.

01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:14.580
Yep. Everyone. So hope all of you are going to do it. I'll

01:45:14.580 --> 01:45:18.080
see guys. My responsibility is to like, uh, give you the

01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:21.400
instruction night. Uh, at the end of the day, you have to do

01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:24.020
this task. I'm not going to do this task for you. And no one

01:45:24.020 --> 01:45:27.480
is going to do this task for you, right? So start doing it

01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:30.120
and believe me, you will, you will enjoy. And all of these

01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:32.500
tasks is not going to consume much of your time. So don't

01:45:32.500 --> 01:45:37.400
worry about the timeline, uh, but yeah, result wise, it will

01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:40.020
give you a good result. So they're asking now, what are the

01:45:40.020 --> 01:45:43.420
tasks to be done by the next class? I think I have already

01:45:43.420 --> 01:45:47.160
talked about it. These three, more than five times I have

01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:50.580
discussed about the tasks. So try to focus on the class and

01:45:50.580 --> 01:45:55.140
these two. Yeah. Uh, don't worry. I'll just try to write,

01:45:55.180 --> 01:45:58.720
uh, create a writeups, uh, inside a doc. And I know many of

01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:01.380
you are sleeping. Many of you, you know, try to open up the

01:46:01.380 --> 01:46:05.960
lectures and then, uh, do your work. Uh, so, uh, that that's

01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:08.720
pretty much common, uh, while doing even a work from home or

01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:12.040
attending online classes, uh, which is bad, but yeah, this

01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:15.120
is how world works. So I'm completely okay with it. Uh, if

01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:17.900
you'll try to focus, I think you will be able to get a

01:46:19.890 --> 01:46:21.270
result.

01:46:24.510 --> 01:46:29.450
Okay. Fine guys. So this is it. I'll just create a writeup

01:46:29.450 --> 01:46:33.430
and I'll post this one into your group, uh, before Monday,

01:46:33.530 --> 01:46:37.950
try to complete it. And we have a dedicated group for this

01:46:37.950 --> 01:46:41.350
particular batch. So try to initiate a discussion among

01:46:41.350 --> 01:46:44.130
yourself that, okay, fine. So I have done this. I have done

01:46:44.130 --> 01:46:48.190
that because everything is going to start from a home and

01:46:48.190 --> 01:46:51.890
your group is your home. Now that's, that was the only

01:46:51.890 --> 01:46:54.810
purpose why we have created that particular group so that

01:46:54.810 --> 01:46:57.570
you all will be able to communicate. Uh, yeah. Initially

01:46:57.570 --> 01:47:00.910
this kind of a discussion, but eventually the same

01:47:00.910 --> 01:47:05.690
discussion or the same groups will get into a discussion. So

01:47:05.690 --> 01:47:08.710
where we will just discuss about the opportunities, fine,

01:47:08.850 --> 01:47:11.570
but I believe we all should have started. That's the reason.

01:47:11.670 --> 01:47:15.230
So we have a group, please suggest a kind of a policy

01:47:15.230 --> 01:47:18.070
summit. Don't expect these kinds of things. No one is going

01:47:18.070 --> 01:47:20.270
to teach you that what you should post on your LinkedIn

01:47:20.270 --> 01:47:22.370
because you have a different flavor. You have a different

01:47:22.370 --> 01:47:25.230
understanding, right? So at least start posting something.

01:47:25.450 --> 01:47:27.930
Don't go. So this is the problem with the people, majority

01:47:27.930 --> 01:47:30.730
of us, right? So when we say, do this, then we will ask,

01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:34.290
okay, tell me how I'm like, this is something that you have

01:47:34.290 --> 01:47:37.790
to figure it out, right? Yeah. In a company when your

01:47:37.790 --> 01:47:40.750
managers or your lead is going to give you a project, so you

01:47:40.750 --> 01:47:42.910
can't go back to them and say that, okay, fine, tell me how

01:47:42.910 --> 01:47:46.930
to do it. You have to figure it out. Then that's the reason

01:47:46.930 --> 01:47:48.770
they're going to pay you, right? That's the reason they have

01:47:48.770 --> 01:47:56.070
hired you. So to do the job, not to give them a job. Yes. So

01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:59.130
start doing it. Start doing a research. And again, you, you

01:47:59.130 --> 01:48:03.530
have a basically see my flavor is different, right? So my

01:48:03.530 --> 01:48:06.270
flavor is different. Sometime I used to post even, uh, you

01:48:06.270 --> 01:48:10.170
know, uh, poems and societies. I used to post, uh, sometime

01:48:10.170 --> 01:48:12.650
I used to post about my company. Sometime I used to post

01:48:12.650 --> 01:48:14.730
about my team. Sometime I used to post about the courses.

01:48:14.830 --> 01:48:18.370
Sometime I used to post about the, uh, you know, the project

01:48:18.370 --> 01:48:21.430
I'm, I'm working on or maybe a classes. So my flavor is

01:48:21.430 --> 01:48:25.030
different. Yours is different. Everyone offers flavors

01:48:25.030 --> 01:48:27.590
different. And on a social media, you will be able to find

01:48:27.590 --> 01:48:30.670
out every kind of a people. So maybe someone will align with

01:48:30.670 --> 01:48:33.350
my post, someone will align with your post. So try to figure

01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:36.470
out your needs and then start working on that. Uh, and

01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:39.590
eventually you will change, believe me. So whatever kind of

01:48:39.590 --> 01:48:41.630
a post that you are doing, if you're doing it on a

01:48:41.630 --> 01:48:46.150
continuous basis, right? Just observe yourself in next one

01:48:46.150 --> 01:48:50.730
month, you will change your style of post will change a

01:48:50.730 --> 01:48:53.650
flavor of your post will change. But if you will not start.

01:48:54.790 --> 01:48:58.210
Hmm. Nothing is going to change because there is nothing to

01:48:58.210 --> 01:49:02.330
observe the changes, right? So yeah, I started doing it. I

01:49:02.330 --> 01:49:07.670
started doing it. Simple. Uh, I didn't want to own a

01:49:07.670 --> 01:49:10.490
pipeline for the next month. Okay. That's amazing. Fine. So

01:49:10.490 --> 01:49:13.170
this is all about, uh, today's class guys. I'm done with the

01:49:13.170 --> 01:49:15.790
today's class. Today's lecture now in next class. So the

01:49:15.790 --> 01:49:20.150
agenda is going to talk about, uh, architecture system

01:49:20.150 --> 01:49:23.030
design of a project. So now if you'll go through the

01:49:23.030 --> 01:49:26.070
syllabus, let me share the syllabus by the way. Yeah. So I'm

01:49:26.070 --> 01:49:32.330
just trying to move myself, uh, via syllabus. So this is the

01:49:32.330 --> 01:49:42.070
syllabus. Hmm. Okay. So this one, so I talked about almost

01:49:42.070 --> 01:49:45.590
these things, uh, basically, and then we will be talking

01:49:45.590 --> 01:49:48.630
about this one project education strategy. So hopefully we

01:49:48.630 --> 01:49:51.750
are able to cover tentatively these two section, right? This

01:49:51.750 --> 01:49:54.630
was section. Then this section will come into a picture. So

01:49:54.630 --> 01:49:58.670
where? I'll be talking about just a project from every

01:49:58.670 --> 01:50:01.990
perspective, starting from a infrastructure. So when I say

01:50:01.990 --> 01:50:05.770
infrastructure simply means that on a cloud, which component

01:50:05.770 --> 01:50:10.250
I'm supposed to use for what purposes, maybe for a catching

01:50:10.250 --> 01:50:12.610
what I'm supposed to use for a DB, what I'm supposed to use

01:50:12.610 --> 01:50:15.850
for a CDN, what I'm supposed to use for a messaging queue,

01:50:15.970 --> 01:50:18.030
what I'm supposed to use for our infrastructure hosting,

01:50:18.270 --> 01:50:22.070
what I'm supposed to use. So starting from that label,

01:50:22.190 --> 01:50:25.370
right? Starting from that label. That system, that kind of a

01:50:25.370 --> 01:50:28.370
system in architecture label, we will start our discussion

01:50:28.370 --> 01:50:31.370
and then team roles and responsibilities because there will

01:50:31.370 --> 01:50:33.470
be a lead, there will be a QA, there will be an architect,

01:50:33.630 --> 01:50:36.590
there will be a SD, there will be a SREs, right? There'll be

01:50:36.590 --> 01:50:39.850
a researcher in your team. So what will be our roles and

01:50:39.850 --> 01:50:43.570
responsibility of all of these team member and where you fit

01:50:43.570 --> 01:50:49.270
in as a lead, as an architect, or maybe as a engineer. So

01:50:49.270 --> 01:50:51.390
I'll be talking about that again with respect to projects.

01:50:51.450 --> 01:50:54.510
So I have already prepared the project. Uh. For like this

01:50:54.510 --> 01:50:57.630
discussion. So I'll be, I'll be, I'll be talking about that.

01:50:58.450 --> 01:51:01.430
Uh, writing project requirement document, PRD, we used to

01:51:01.430 --> 01:51:04.870
say like a PRD. So again, this is, uh, something that we all

01:51:04.870 --> 01:51:07.590
used to do as a lead, not, not as a junior engineer, but

01:51:07.590 --> 01:51:10.130
yeah, junior engineer tried to contribute nowadays, uh,

01:51:10.270 --> 01:51:12.990
especially in a startup. But yeah, if I'll talk about a FANG

01:51:12.990 --> 01:51:15.050
or purpose company, so generally it will be a roles and

01:51:15.050 --> 01:51:18.190
responsibility of a lead or architect, high level, low level

01:51:18.190 --> 01:51:21.410
architecture, planning, wireframing. So all of these things

01:51:21.410 --> 01:51:25.890
with respect to the project. And then a story about it, I'm

01:51:25.890 --> 01:51:29.050
going to discuss next week. So next week, I think it will

01:51:29.050 --> 01:51:32.750
take two days of time for sure, because we have a lot to

01:51:32.750 --> 01:51:37.070
discuss, a lot to discuss in this segment. And again, this

01:51:37.070 --> 01:51:41.130
is a very important part. Then from next to next week

01:51:41.130 --> 01:51:44.530
onwards, next to next week, right? We'll start doing a

01:51:44.530 --> 01:51:46.810
question, answer, question, answer, question, answer. So

01:51:46.810 --> 01:51:50.450
where we'll try to cover 200 plus questions for all of these

01:51:50.450 --> 01:51:56.290
segments. But in between. Just a request from all of, to all

01:51:56.290 --> 01:52:02.350
of you that whenever you have a time and if you are not

01:52:02.350 --> 01:52:06.570
aware about any of these things, right? Any of these things,

01:52:06.650 --> 01:52:12.770
at least try to use URI or any other GPD kind of a system,

01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:19.490
copy and paste these lines and simple type one word, explain

01:52:19.490 --> 01:52:23.010
whenever you have a time, maybe if you're going for a sleep,

01:52:23.170 --> 01:52:25.970
right? Because this is how learning happens, right? Learning

01:52:25.970 --> 01:52:29.050
is nothing, not something like which you sit and you do it.

01:52:29.370 --> 01:52:34.310
Learning is a kind of a habit that we all used to form that,

01:52:34.370 --> 01:52:37.850
okay, even when I'm like a, uh, using some social, I'm

01:52:37.850 --> 01:52:40.230
learning something, right? Even if I'm going for a sleep,

01:52:40.310 --> 01:52:43.470
okay, fine, let's try to like, you know, uh, so this topic

01:52:44.070 --> 01:52:48.170
and that is going to be a real meaning of a learning that

01:52:48.170 --> 01:52:52.630
will keep you stress free. Okay. So. So you can search these

01:52:52.630 --> 01:52:57.370
topics, right? These topics, uh, maybe one at a time or

01:52:57.370 --> 01:53:00.410
maybe one in one day and then try to do some sort of a

01:53:00.410 --> 01:53:03.050
reading, just a reading, just a blunt reading. Even if

01:53:03.050 --> 01:53:05.710
you're not able to understand, that's completely okay

01:53:05.710 --> 01:53:07.970
because if you have a doubt or if you have a question,

01:53:08.130 --> 01:53:12.830
obviously I'm here to answer to those questions, but try to

01:53:12.830 --> 01:53:19.450
explore and start this one from today itself and unless and

01:53:19.450 --> 01:53:22.450
until you are not able to get the opportunity, that you are

01:53:22.450 --> 01:53:27.810
looking for into a market, right, started from today means

01:53:27.810 --> 01:53:31.190
literally today, if you are going to do it because even in

01:53:31.190 --> 01:53:34.050
past, many people have followed it and yes, they're able to

01:53:34.050 --> 01:53:37.550
make an easy transition into multiple companies and yes,

01:53:37.630 --> 01:53:42.110
there are many people who have not followed and now they're

01:53:42.110 --> 01:53:44.990
still asking that how to prepare or how to do this, how to

01:53:44.990 --> 01:53:48.090
do that. So you have to like, you have to, you know, uh,

01:53:48.250 --> 01:53:51.710
decide that what kind of a people you would like to be. What

01:53:51.710 --> 01:53:54.950
do you want to become in next four to five months? Choice is

01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:57.970
yours. Life is yours. Career is yours. Everything is yours.

01:53:58.250 --> 01:54:01.070
Simple, right? So start doing it. This is a small, small

01:54:01.070 --> 01:54:04.250
steps are going to give you a lot of benefit or plus, uh,

01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:06.930
like I said, so in every section, uh, like a session now

01:54:06.930 --> 01:54:09.430
onwards, I'm going to give you a lot of tasks for today. I

01:54:09.430 --> 01:54:11.970
have already given you a task. I think that's more than

01:54:11.970 --> 01:54:15.410
enough for this particular week and I have already talked

01:54:15.410 --> 01:54:18.130
about the strategy that you are supposed to follow. It was a

01:54:18.130 --> 01:54:20.510
simple one, but yeah, a continuous discipline, the strategy

01:54:20.510 --> 01:54:24.450
that you have to follow, keep on doing it. Believe me,

01:54:24.530 --> 01:54:28.570
things are not tough. It's actually very easy in terms of

01:54:28.570 --> 01:54:31.850
cracking a job. It's literally very easy, right? It's tough

01:54:31.850 --> 01:54:35.510
when you, uh, don't do all of these things and out of

01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:37.550
sudden, so you start like applying for the job, then

01:54:37.550 --> 01:54:39.970
obviously it's tough, right? Obviously it's tough, but

01:54:39.970 --> 01:54:43.910
otherwise it's not tough. So all of you are going to follow

01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:47.750
for next couple of weeks and then let me know about the

01:54:47.750 --> 01:54:50.950
changes that you are able to observe in yourself. Okay.

01:54:50.970 --> 01:54:54.130
Yeah. Changes that you are able to observe. So with that

01:54:54.130 --> 01:54:56.930
guys, thank you so much everyone. So those who is having a

01:54:56.930 --> 01:55:00.050
question, they can stay here, they can raise their hand and

01:55:00.050 --> 01:55:02.770
those who is not having a question. So maybe you can drop

01:55:02.770 --> 01:55:07.230
off, uh, I'm done for today and I'm going to post this task

01:55:07.230 --> 01:55:11.450
documentation inside your group. Uh, maybe right after the

01:55:11.450 --> 01:55:14.750
class, once I will be done with my, uh, doubt clearing, I'm

01:55:14.750 --> 01:55:17.690
going to post it so that you all can start working on it.

01:55:18.170 --> 01:55:22.250
Fine guys. It happens with many, sir. I'm able to build

01:55:22.250 --> 01:55:25.150
something by using a different tools or things. I'm like a

01:55:25.150 --> 01:55:27.450
Python dev. I have done many projects, but somewhere in my

01:55:27.450 --> 01:55:30.910
heart, I feel like I'm missing something. I, uh, that's why

01:55:30.910 --> 01:55:33.270
I have started everything from a zero learning Python SQL.

01:55:33.410 --> 01:55:36.130
Yeah, that's a great idea. That's a great idea. And see,

01:55:36.210 --> 01:55:39.310
once you are really starting, right, believe me this time,

01:55:39.370 --> 01:55:42.390
it is not going to take much of time. So this time you will

01:55:42.390 --> 01:55:45.290
be like, uh, able to do it with a speed. I think it's, it's

01:55:45.290 --> 01:55:47.550
a good approach and there is no, there is nothing wrong in

01:55:47.550 --> 01:55:51.350
that. Okay. Yeah. So, okay. We have a couple of hands. So

01:55:51.350 --> 01:55:55.530
just go ahead. One is, uh, I am saw who please go ahead with

01:55:55.530 --> 01:56:00.210
your question. Yeah. Hello, sir. Yeah. So my question is

01:56:00.210 --> 01:56:05.470
like, uh, related to this AI courses in finding the jobs. So

01:56:05.470 --> 01:56:09.550
what is your experience in the terms of, uh, every month,

01:56:09.610 --> 01:56:16.410
how many AI in, uh, AI, uh, engineers that they are, they're

01:56:16.410 --> 01:56:21.130
completely prepared for the interview. Okay. I think like

01:56:21.130 --> 01:56:24.070
that estimation, no one will be able to give you not even a

01:56:24.070 --> 01:56:28.230
purpose. No, there is, there is no approximation for that by

01:56:28.230 --> 01:56:30.470
the way. Right. But yeah. So in terms of our number of

01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:33.270
opportunity, obviously you will be able to see some sort of

01:56:33.270 --> 01:56:35.710
approximation. So you can go to maybe a LinkedIn and search

01:56:35.710 --> 01:56:38.910
for a job title, Jenny, I apply the filter and then you will

01:56:38.910 --> 01:56:42.670
be able to find out maybe a 10,000 opportunities. See, it's,

01:56:42.670 --> 01:56:44.810
it's not about the number of people who are doing a

01:56:44.810 --> 01:56:48.850
preparation. Okay. Okay. So it's not about the number of

01:56:48.850 --> 01:56:51.830
people who are doing a preparation. It's all about the

01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:55.190
number of opportunities, which is available. Right. And no

01:56:55.190 --> 01:56:56.930
one can estimate how many people are preparing, how you can

01:56:56.930 --> 01:56:59.870
estimate it and how I can estimate it. By the way, I don't

01:56:59.870 --> 01:57:02.270
have access of those data. I don't know, like how many

01:57:02.270 --> 01:57:04.130
people are sitting in their home and preparing, doing that.

01:57:04.410 --> 01:57:10.530
Right. So that's what I always want that every students are

01:57:10.530 --> 01:57:13.870
ready for the opportunities by following their tips.

01:57:14.570 --> 01:57:18.230
Exactly. Exactly. And so you're talking about that at

01:57:18.230 --> 01:57:22.350
LinkedIn. I just started since the last one month writing, I

01:57:22.350 --> 01:57:29.150
literally, I got a call to take a lecture on anything. Yes.

01:57:29.570 --> 01:57:33.750
I posted it only two, three workflow. Exactly. Exactly. So

01:57:33.750 --> 01:57:35.950
people are running the entire business out of LinkedIn,

01:57:36.070 --> 01:57:38.330
right? Even as an individual, people are able to run the

01:57:38.330 --> 01:57:41.350
business and it's not very tough. Like I said, so just look

01:57:41.350 --> 01:57:44.350
into your open up your mobile type a screen time and you

01:57:44.350 --> 01:57:46.990
must be spending four to five hours of time on an average on

01:57:46.990 --> 01:57:50.090
your mobile. So it can just take like a one to two minute of

01:57:50.090 --> 01:57:54.810
time to do a post. And maybe that post can do some sort of a

01:57:54.810 --> 01:57:58.630
wonder for you. Correct. Correct. So even one lecture also

01:57:58.630 --> 01:58:01.590
in pipeline for the next month. Exactly. Literally.

01:58:01.610 --> 01:58:06.030
Literally. It's a really amazing. Yeah. If you're doing just

01:58:06.030 --> 01:58:09.030
posting in the LinkedIn, what you are doing just showcase to

01:58:09.030 --> 01:58:12.350
the entire world. Exactly. Exactly. Even if you're doing a

01:58:12.350 --> 01:58:16.430
small thing, right? Show it to them. Very simple. Show it to

01:58:16.430 --> 01:58:21.650
them. Do you have a question? No, sir. Thank you. Thank you

01:58:21.650 --> 01:58:24.270
so much. Thanks. Thanks. Take care. Okay. Madhuri, please go

01:58:24.270 --> 01:58:27.110
ahead with your question. Yeah. Yeah. Good evening

01:58:27.110 --> 01:58:31.150
Sudhanshu. So basically my question is I have total 12 years

01:58:31.150 --> 01:58:34.950
of experience and out of that I have five years into Java

01:58:34.950 --> 01:58:40.810
and 6.5 around into as an RPA lead and I want to transition

01:58:40.810 --> 01:58:45.610
into Gen AI. Okay. So for that actually I have showcased

01:58:45.610 --> 01:58:48.770
some of the machine learning projects and some of the Gen AI

01:58:48.770 --> 01:58:52.810
use cases. Okay. But I'm stucking at the machine learning

01:58:52.810 --> 01:58:58.010
because I'm not full-fledged, you know, develop the code

01:58:58.010 --> 01:59:02.450
into ML. I am just learning it from the past one year. So

01:59:02.450 --> 01:59:07.350
I'm so basically I'm facing the difficulties in writing the

01:59:07.350 --> 01:59:11.210
use cases that I can, you know, showcase to the interviewer.

01:59:11.210 --> 01:59:15.190
And the entire storytelling or the, you know, end-to-end

01:59:15.190 --> 01:59:19.590
flow. Okay. So then actually how can I showcase or

01:59:19.590 --> 01:59:23.350
represent? So ma'am just do one thing for this week. Right.

01:59:23.370 --> 01:59:25.710
Just do one thing. So whatever task which I have given to

01:59:25.710 --> 01:59:29.110
you. Right. So task in terms of like writing two to three

01:59:29.110 --> 01:59:32.570
story or you can say a project into your resume which you

01:59:32.570 --> 01:59:33.910
are saying you are not able to do it. That's completely

01:59:33.910 --> 01:59:36.850
okay. Right. So maybe try to take a help of like a URI and

01:59:36.850 --> 01:59:39.890
then try in your domain. So in which domain you are working

01:59:39.890 --> 01:59:42.350
by the way? So let's suppose RPA. And Java work that you

01:59:42.350 --> 01:59:44.950
have done. Right. What was the domain? It was banking

01:59:44.950 --> 01:59:47.670
domain. Okay. That's great. So it was a banking domain.

01:59:47.670 --> 01:59:50.330
Let's suppose. Yeah. So in a banking domain. So try to

01:59:50.330 --> 01:59:51.910
figure it out that, okay, fine. So what kind of an

01:59:51.910 --> 01:59:54.830
enterprise grade project which people are developing or even

01:59:54.830 --> 01:59:58.530
like the project that you have done so far, right in Java or

01:59:58.530 --> 02:00:02.210
in RPA, just try to give a little bit of context, maybe two

02:00:02.210 --> 02:00:04.910
to three and of a context to a URI to a chat GPT, and it

02:00:04.910 --> 02:00:08.250
will be able to give you the gen AI approach to do the same

02:00:08.250 --> 02:00:11.150
project, right? Same project. Same project. So just try to

02:00:11.150 --> 02:00:13.850
do like, just try to write those for your resume. Part

02:00:13.850 --> 02:00:16.570
number one. Part number two, prepare the complete

02:00:16.570 --> 02:00:20.290
storytelling again with the help of a GPT for those same

02:00:20.290 --> 02:00:22.910
project. So I'm not saying that discover something new. No,

02:00:23.010 --> 02:00:26.150
whatever you have done, give a context, convert those into a

02:00:26.150 --> 02:00:28.430
gen AI and say that, okay, fine. So give me the tool which I

02:00:28.430 --> 02:00:30.770
will be using. What will be the info requirement? What will

02:00:30.770 --> 02:00:32.890
be the setup that I'm supposed to do? So it will give you

02:00:32.890 --> 02:00:36.910
each and everything approximately now. So once you are able

02:00:36.910 --> 02:00:40.870
to do it, like I said in next class. Monday and Tuesday, the

02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:43.370
next week, right? I'm going to talk about the storytelling.

02:00:43.650 --> 02:00:46.410
I'm going to talk about a storytelling with respect to not

02:00:46.410 --> 02:00:49.010
just one project with a multiple project starting from the

02:00:49.010 --> 02:00:50.990
complete infrastructure means system design perspective,

02:00:51.290 --> 02:00:53.910
from an application development perspective, from a security

02:00:53.910 --> 02:00:56.070
perspective, from a deployment perspective, from a

02:00:56.070 --> 02:00:58.710
scalability perspective, right? So from every perspective,

02:00:58.970 --> 02:01:02.210
and then you will be able to relate it more. And after that,

02:01:02.250 --> 02:01:05.150
again, I'm going to ask you that do a modification into your

02:01:05.150 --> 02:01:07.410
existing resume, the resume that you are preparing this

02:01:07.410 --> 02:01:11.350
week. Okay. But the projects are more related to the

02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:14.490
automation and it's not related to the machine learning or

02:01:14.490 --> 02:01:16.850
anything. That's completely see whether it's automation,

02:01:17.070 --> 02:01:18.930
whether it's anything, believe me, just, just do this one,

02:01:18.950 --> 02:01:22.470
right? Do this one and let me know whatever project that you

02:01:22.470 --> 02:01:25.670
have done with respect to automation, like I said, write a

02:01:25.670 --> 02:01:28.470
context or maybe in your resume, you have already mentioned

02:01:28.470 --> 02:01:32.370
that, right? Maybe two, three line copy that one. Just copy

02:01:32.370 --> 02:01:34.230
that one. Even now you can do it while we are talking,

02:01:34.290 --> 02:01:37.250
right? So just copy that one. Give it to UD. Give it to chat

02:01:37.250 --> 02:01:42.110
GPT. Give us names, ok. So just try to reframe or rephrase

02:01:42.110 --> 02:01:46.950
this entire project as a story, or maybe give me all kind of

02:01:46.950 --> 02:01:50.630
a detail with the help of humanity with the help of machine

02:01:50.630 --> 02:01:53.710
learning, it will do it immediately and then just try to ask

02:01:53.710 --> 02:01:55.970
a follow up question that tell me which algorithm I should

02:01:55.970 --> 02:01:57.870
use, which model I should use. What should be the

02:01:57.870 --> 02:02:00.610
infrastructure? What should be the security? What should be

02:02:00.610 --> 02:02:04.110
the team structure? So it will, it's really start giving you

02:02:04.110 --> 02:02:07.470
each and everything. Just do it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

02:02:07.470 --> 02:02:10.750
That's the best way. Yeah. That's the best way. And do it

02:02:10.750 --> 02:02:14.970
before next week, before next Monday. Sure. Yeah. Thank you

02:02:14.970 --> 02:02:17.630
so much. Yeah. Then come to the next class. Yeah. Okay. Next

02:02:17.630 --> 02:02:18.770
one is Amit. Please go ahead.

02:02:21.940 --> 02:02:26.880
Hello, sir. Yeah. Am I audible? Yeah, you are audible. Yes.

02:02:28.380 --> 02:02:32.640
Sir, I have one question regarding to framework. If I know

02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:38.030
only PyTorch, is it okay? Yeah, that's completely fine. If

02:02:38.030 --> 02:02:42.710
you know PyTorch, yes. Yes. Okay. But if you don't know

02:02:42.710 --> 02:02:46.470
TensorFlow, is it okay? Yeah, it's okay. No problem. You

02:02:46.470 --> 02:02:49.750
will use only one. You will either use PyTorch or

02:02:49.750 --> 02:02:52.970
TensorFlow. You will use TensorFlow and Keras. Generally,

02:02:53.050 --> 02:02:55.570
you don't use two. And if you are using one, then you know

02:02:55.570 --> 02:02:57.910
the other one, by the way. There are a lot of differences

02:02:57.910 --> 02:03:00.250
between both. You call the same neural network's simple

02:03:00.250 --> 02:03:05.990
concepts, layers, or models at the end of the day. Okay.

02:03:06.130 --> 02:03:09.590
Okay. And I have only two projects. One is machine learning.

02:03:09.610 --> 02:03:11.610
One is machine learning. And the other is NLP. So, if I

02:03:11.610 --> 02:03:14.050
showcase that, it will be fine on Monday. There is no

02:03:14.050 --> 02:03:17.730
problem for now. You can showcase that for now. We are going

02:03:17.730 --> 02:03:20.350
to have a discussion on Monday. Basically, it will be a

02:03:20.350 --> 02:03:24.070
discussion from my side. Right. So, I am going to talk about

02:03:24.070 --> 02:03:26.530
the project. So, don't worry. The expectation is that you

02:03:26.530 --> 02:03:31.810
start working. Okay. Okay. This is the expectation. This is

02:03:31.810 --> 02:03:36.950
not the final yet. A lot of classes have just started. Okay.

02:03:37.070 --> 02:03:39.770
Yeah. So, at least you should be involved. If you start,

02:03:39.990 --> 02:03:42.630
activate yourself. This is the thing that is going on right

02:03:42.630 --> 02:03:47.470
now. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Ranjeet, please go ahead with the

02:03:47.470 --> 02:03:52.330
question. Yeah. Yes. So, basically, today, I am very

02:03:52.330 --> 02:03:57.870
encouraged about this LinkedIn. Because I have created so

02:03:57.870 --> 02:04:01.770
many projects. Okay. Even yesterday, I created a beautiful

02:04:01.770 --> 02:04:05.670
project from your generative way. Yesterday, we had a

02:04:05.670 --> 02:04:07.590
discussion. Yeah. Yesterday, we were talking about it.

02:04:07.630 --> 02:04:09.590
Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But yesterday, I created a

02:04:09.590 --> 02:04:09.910
beautiful project from your generative way. And tonight, I

02:04:09.910 --> 02:04:13.590
created another one. Okay. Okay. Okay. That's amazing. Yeah.

02:04:13.750 --> 02:04:18.110
Yeah. I mean, there is no issue creating. And you will be

02:04:18.110 --> 02:04:20.630
amazed. Because they will be visually very, very appealing.

02:04:20.910 --> 02:04:26.250
I mean, it's not like just a simple thing. So, I think once

02:04:26.250 --> 02:04:29.310
I demo you, then you will understand that. Are you a part of

02:04:29.310 --> 02:04:31.010
group? Are you a part of WhatsApp group? Because yesterday,

02:04:31.130 --> 02:04:34.370
I was talking to my team. And I was like discussing about

02:04:34.370 --> 02:04:37.710
the discussion that we had, basically. We had like about

02:04:37.710 --> 02:04:42.790
this, you know. Podcast, right? I was like chatting. So, if

02:04:42.790 --> 02:04:46.390
you can ping me personally on like a WhatsApp, I think that

02:04:46.390 --> 02:04:49.490
will be helpful. So, that I can ping you back. And we can,

02:04:49.510 --> 02:04:52.710
you know, book a slot. We can book a schedule. Yeah. Yeah.

02:04:52.710 --> 02:04:55.610
Yeah. Sure. Sure. Sure. I mean, I would love that. So, are

02:04:55.610 --> 02:04:59.110
you a part of group? Any group that we have? Yeah. Yeah.

02:04:59.150 --> 02:05:03.670
Yeah. Because I do communicate. I do communicate with you as

02:05:03.670 --> 02:05:08.350
well. Okay. You replied me. Okay. So, please. Because we...

02:05:08.350 --> 02:05:11.830
I have so many like... I know you personally, but yeah. So,

02:05:11.910 --> 02:05:14.330
I have so many people with the same name, Ranjit. So, I get

02:05:14.330 --> 02:05:19.110
confused. Okay. And I reply to all the questions which has

02:05:19.110 --> 02:05:21.990
been asked, right? So, irrespective of, you know, who is

02:05:21.990 --> 02:05:23.810
asking. Because I have to reply to all the students. So,

02:05:23.830 --> 02:05:25.910
yeah. If you can ping me personally, that okay, fine. So,

02:05:25.930 --> 02:05:29.430
I'll save your number. So, should I ping you from the same

02:05:29.430 --> 02:05:32.390
generative AI bootcamp or some other... Yeah. Maybe you can

02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:34.990
just DM me. Yeah. Personally, you can ping me. I think I'll

02:05:34.990 --> 02:05:39.730
save your number. Let me... Hi. I'm a part of... Yeah. I'm a

02:05:39.730 --> 02:05:43.030
part of all the groups that you have, sir. Yeah. Okay. So, I

02:05:43.030 --> 02:05:45.990
just pinged you. I'm just clicking the send button now.

02:05:46.330 --> 02:05:49.990
Okay. So, you should have the IC that you... Okay. Okay. Got

02:05:49.990 --> 02:05:52.950
it. Got it. Got it. Okay. So, I have your personal number

02:05:52.950 --> 02:05:55.330
now. I can... I'll save you. I'll ping it to you. And

02:05:55.330 --> 02:05:57.050
whenever you are free, whenever you are available, so you

02:05:57.050 --> 02:06:00.990
can respond back. And we'll just schedule. Yeah. Yes. Yeah.

02:06:01.050 --> 02:06:05.030
I would love that. So, there is... I have question on math.

02:06:05.150 --> 02:06:09.090
Okay. Okay. Okay. My math education is very, very... Very

02:06:09.090 --> 02:06:13.330
old legacy, like maybe until 10th, the old style, okay?

02:06:13.490 --> 02:06:16.890
Okay. So, I have no idea about this cos, sin, theta, this,

02:06:16.950 --> 02:06:20.010
that, okay? But I can solve any problems, okay? And that's

02:06:20.010 --> 02:06:25.510
what I have been doing in IT. Okay. So, how important is for

02:06:25.510 --> 02:06:30.230
me to this math things you are talking about? I think, sir,

02:06:30.250 --> 02:06:32.830
like math things is not at all important for a senior

02:06:32.830 --> 02:06:36.770
people. Math things is important. Yeah. It become important

02:06:36.770 --> 02:06:40.750
for a core researcher. So, who is just going to join as a

02:06:40.750 --> 02:06:44.110
researcher guy on any level, on any level means junior till

02:06:44.110 --> 02:06:47.110
a very, very senior because math will be their day-to-day

02:06:47.110 --> 02:06:49.770
bread and butter, right? For example, statistics, calculus,

02:06:50.090 --> 02:06:53.090
linear algebra because this is what they do in terms of like

02:06:53.090 --> 02:06:56.170
doing a research. And the entire system that we are dealing

02:06:56.170 --> 02:06:57.930
with, right? So, it's all about mathematics, the entire

02:06:57.930 --> 02:07:00.710
computation and everything, the model that we used to build,

02:07:00.790 --> 02:07:03.210
it's actually a mathematics. It's actually a mathematics,

02:07:03.210 --> 02:07:07.490
nothing more than that. But when we see same thing from

02:07:07.490 --> 02:07:11.150
application side. Application side where we are trying to

02:07:11.150 --> 02:07:13.970
solve some of the problem for the user, where we are trying

02:07:13.970 --> 02:07:16.010
to build some sort of an interface, whether we are trying to

02:07:16.010 --> 02:07:18.610
build some sort of a product. At that point of a time,

02:07:18.750 --> 02:07:22.450
mathematics is not at all, means literally not at all

02:07:22.450 --> 02:07:27.230
required even for a data scientist. So, people generally say

02:07:27.230 --> 02:07:29.710
that if you have to become a data scientist, you have to,

02:07:29.710 --> 02:07:33.470
you know, be good with the mathematics. I agree with it and

02:07:33.470 --> 02:07:36.810
I disagree with it. It depends like what kind of a role you

02:07:36.810 --> 02:07:39.030
are looking for and what kind of a company. You are going to

02:07:39.030 --> 02:07:41.290
join, what kind of a work that you are going to do, and

02:07:41.290 --> 02:07:44.110
accordingly, you need a math or maybe you don't need a math.

02:07:46.310 --> 02:07:50.330
See for me, I have worked with product based companies also,

02:07:50.490 --> 02:07:54.450
and I have created some, some of the most complex, highly

02:07:54.450 --> 02:07:59.330
complex system on the planet, I mean, okay, which are used

02:07:59.330 --> 02:08:05.150
by, I mean, say, for example, quarter million people, okay,

02:08:05.210 --> 02:08:10.530
and very high complex applications. Okay. And, and I have

02:08:10.530 --> 02:08:15.890
never used those math concepts because I never had to. So,

02:08:15.950 --> 02:08:19.410
and anyway, so now I'm a little bit satisfied that that's

02:08:19.410 --> 02:08:22.130
not, I thought maybe it's too important. You are talking

02:08:22.130 --> 02:08:27.990
about math all the time, but, but I, but I do understand the

02:08:27.990 --> 02:08:31.450
concepts. Okay. Even if it's a transformer concept and

02:08:31.450 --> 02:08:34.730
encoder decoder concepts. Okay. Now, I do not know the math

02:08:34.730 --> 02:08:38.590
that we teach it, but, but conceptually, like, I, I, I, at a

02:08:38.590 --> 02:08:40.970
high level, logical level, I understand those kinds of

02:08:40.970 --> 02:08:45.150
things, but, but today I'm happy you reminded me about this

02:08:45.150 --> 02:08:49.470
LinkedIn and, and GitHub. So, because I've got so many

02:08:49.470 --> 02:08:53.030
things ready for me, I mean, I, they're in the progress now,

02:08:53.130 --> 02:08:58.630
so maybe I should start putting those in the LinkedIn. I

02:08:58.630 --> 02:09:01.110
have never put anything, any post in. Please do it, sir. I

02:09:01.110 --> 02:09:04.190
believe me, it's, it's like, it is going to give you an

02:09:04.190 --> 02:09:07.510
amazing result, right? Amazing result. Uh, maybe like, uh,

02:09:07.710 --> 02:09:11.170
uh, start like doing some videos on a YouTube that will also

02:09:11.170 --> 02:09:13.690
give you an amazing result. Believe me, see, social media is

02:09:13.690 --> 02:09:16.250
peoples are everything at the end of the day, you are going

02:09:16.250 --> 02:09:18.150
to build anything and everything that is going to be for

02:09:18.150 --> 02:09:21.430
people. Right. Yeah. So you need, you need a people who is

02:09:21.430 --> 02:09:23.350
going to see it, who is going to like a, you know, taste it,

02:09:23.410 --> 02:09:25.890
you're going to observe it and where you will be able to get

02:09:25.890 --> 02:09:29.150
those people, obviously on a social media, because now all

02:09:29.150 --> 02:09:34.050
are living in a virtual world, right? So it's better go and

02:09:34.050 --> 02:09:37.010
post anything and everything safely. Simultaneously on every

02:09:37.010 --> 02:09:41.510
platform, believe me, it works. Believe me, it works. And

02:09:41.510 --> 02:09:44.210
that's interesting because, because my own daughter is an

02:09:44.210 --> 02:09:48.190
influencer. She has her own on channels and she, she does a

02:09:48.190 --> 02:09:52.750
lot of things, but I never asked her. So maybe I should, you

02:09:52.750 --> 02:09:56.950
should actually, you should ask, right? See, power is not

02:09:56.950 --> 02:10:01.010
building something. Power is building one small thing, but

02:10:01.010 --> 02:10:04.070
distributing that small thing, a teeny tiny things, right.

02:10:04.210 --> 02:10:06.890
Among a millions of people. That is a power. That's a real

02:10:06.890 --> 02:10:11.070
power. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I mean, you're a very

02:10:11.070 --> 02:10:16.470
encouraging person and you just, uh, I'm amazed at you at

02:10:16.470 --> 02:10:20.610
your energy that you have it. Yeah. So, so I learned a lot

02:10:20.610 --> 02:10:22.850
of things from you. Thank you very much. Thank you for

02:10:22.850 --> 02:10:26.290
taking your time. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Yeah.

02:10:26.390 --> 02:10:30.310
Yeah. PK, please go over the question. Uh, so don't you

02:10:30.310 --> 02:10:35.210
serve by totally SAP say, uh, transition. Car. Rahoon. Uh,

02:10:35.210 --> 02:10:38.970
yeah. Gen many. I haveание. I'm going. OK, 20 years of

02:10:38.970 --> 02:10:48.870
experience. The horror. Or maybe like a supply chain.

02:10:49.010 --> 02:10:51.490
Cool. That'll be cool. undergrad.

02:11:04.230 --> 02:11:09.570
Technical. Sub. CICD and CPI Exactly, so you must be working

02:11:09.570 --> 02:11:12.610
for some domain or you must be using some tools or

02:11:12.610 --> 02:11:17.810
technology So give the whole context to AI You must have

02:11:17.810 --> 02:11:22.110
written in your old resume that we made this product or

02:11:22.110 --> 02:11:24.530
developed this thing for this client You must have written

02:11:24.530 --> 02:11:29.590
something in your old resume So give that to AI and tell him

02:11:29.590 --> 02:11:35.630
to convert it in terms of generative AI In terms of a modern

02:11:35.630 --> 02:11:39.930
AI tech stack Try to use generative AI related frameworks

02:11:39.930 --> 02:11:45.730
and databases And try to use the cloud environment and

02:11:45.730 --> 02:11:49.690
infrastructure Now what will AI do? You got the old

02:11:49.690 --> 02:11:57.070
reference Prashant, right? Prashit Okay Prashit, fine So

02:11:57.070 --> 02:12:01.370
basically Prashit was doing this And then you have to modify

02:12:01.370 --> 02:12:03.810
it here Then AI will modify it Otherwise how will AI do it?

02:12:03.810 --> 02:12:06.090
You will just tell it that you have a problem So it doesn't

02:12:06.090 --> 02:12:09.930
know what your background is Okay So it will just suggest

02:12:09.930 --> 02:12:12.870
you something vague at that point of time That okay you do

02:12:12.870 --> 02:12:15.630
this and that But no, if you want it precisely Modification

02:12:15.630 --> 02:12:18.130
of the same thing Then you put that You take out your old

02:12:18.130 --> 02:12:21.770
resume Put it in your old resume Put some context there It

02:12:21.770 --> 02:12:25.930
will do it And then follow up questions Search Sir, how will

02:12:25.930 --> 02:12:30.930
I showcase? Because I can't show any projects of SAP So I am

02:12:30.930 --> 02:12:34.110
going to show all the agents And I am also practicing in all

02:12:34.110 --> 02:12:37.930
of them I have 3-4 months for preparation I am coding in all

02:12:37.930 --> 02:12:42.910
of this But still I am not confident about it So it's been 3

02:12:42.910 --> 02:12:46.370
-4 months You keep doing this and you will be confident Okay

02:12:46.370 --> 02:12:48.670
With the badge of generative AI And with the interviewer

02:12:48.670 --> 02:12:52.090
Believe me you will be confident Because at the end

02:12:53.070 --> 02:12:55.270
Storytelling is the only thing left If we are able to

02:12:55.270 --> 02:12:58.070
explain well What we were doing Which is your problem now

02:12:58.070 --> 02:13:01.570
Right So it's over We have to reach there Just do this much

02:13:01.570 --> 02:13:03.970
Do this much for this week And then like Let's have a

02:13:03.970 --> 02:13:07.530
discussion next week Okay Thank you so much Just for this

02:13:07.530 --> 02:13:09.550
week But you have to do this much Means you have to modify 2

02:13:09.550 --> 02:13:15.210
-3 projects So you have to convert Talk more with AI this

02:13:15.210 --> 02:13:19.290
week Maybe talk less with your family Talk more with AI this

02:13:19.290 --> 02:13:22.210
week And then let's have a discussion next week It will be

02:13:22.210 --> 02:13:27.330
fun Okay Okay sir There is no problem of storytelling There

02:13:27.330 --> 02:13:30.150
is no problem of storytelling Sir If you ask something

02:13:30.150 --> 02:13:33.830
technically About the code inside Or related to it Then

02:13:33.830 --> 02:13:37.090
there is no confidence Exactly So that is the part of the

02:13:37.090 --> 02:13:42.230
story Right Means you speak well That's completely fine But

02:13:42.230 --> 02:13:47.150
there should be a story for that Okay sir Let me just get

02:13:47.150 --> 02:13:50.190
that And we will discuss And the code you are talking about

02:13:50.190 --> 02:13:55.010
That is also part of that story Okay Okay Start once Okay

02:13:55.010 --> 02:13:57.930
Until you make a skeleton Until then you will not be able to

02:13:57.930 --> 02:14:00.770
break it Okay Until then you will not know the edge cases

02:14:00.770 --> 02:14:04.650
And until it is not repeated again and again The story that

02:14:04.650 --> 02:14:07.130
we build on the last day Generally it does not work Okay It

02:14:07.130 --> 02:14:11.410
comes with failure And then That's when it happens That we

02:14:11.410 --> 02:14:16.150
try to go into a couple of interviews We spread there Then

02:14:16.150 --> 02:14:19.350
the interview after that is clear Because until then we have

02:14:19.350 --> 02:14:21.370
got a little idea That interviewer will ask How will we

02:14:21.370 --> 02:14:25.210
answer him Etc. Etc. But if we have to mitigate that

02:14:25.210 --> 02:14:28.050
situation too Let's go in this way Let's start doing it from

02:14:28.050 --> 02:14:33.270
now Sir one last question I have not posted anything on

02:14:33.270 --> 02:14:34.530
LinkedIn in the last ten years I have not updated LinkedIn

02:14:34.530 --> 02:14:36.710
at all From the last ten years Many people are like this

02:14:36.710 --> 02:14:39.730
Maximum people are like this How to cope up That's it Okay

02:14:39.730 --> 02:14:41.750
The story that we talked about What you are doing in SAP

02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:45.350
Okay Start writing after that Or leave SAP What you are

02:14:45.350 --> 02:14:49.130
reading About that Okay So this is the framework Which you

02:14:49.130 --> 02:14:51.430
can use For a generative AI Lion chain Lama index And

02:14:51.430 --> 02:14:57.750
knowledge Okay You yourself You are a good storyteller Okay

02:14:57.750 --> 02:15:00.810
Yes You are good at that And you have a chat GPT And the

02:15:00.810 --> 02:15:04.450
rest is Yuri Okay So you give your context Okay He will make

02:15:04.450 --> 02:15:07.870
it real Okay And what do you have to do with that feeling

02:15:07.870 --> 02:15:12.790
You have to post that feeling On social media That's it Okay

02:15:12.790 --> 02:15:17.690
Let me start sir Let me see how many views I get Okay No

02:15:17.690 --> 02:15:19.850
Initially Don't keep much hope Just don't keep too much high

02:15:19.850 --> 02:15:23.870
hopes Even I am not telling you That this will happen Yes If

02:15:23.870 --> 02:15:27.510
the post is very impactful Then it will happen Like the post

02:15:27.510 --> 02:15:33.130
Draws an animation base Archive And even we are all on

02:15:33.130 --> 02:15:36.330
social media, so you observe who is getting more likes on

02:15:36.330 --> 02:15:38.830
whose post. Or more views are going on it, or people are

02:15:38.830 --> 02:15:43.170
commenting or sharing. And try to post like that. It's

02:15:43.170 --> 02:15:48.790
simple. Okay. It's not necessary that we learn from zero. We

02:15:48.790 --> 02:15:51.790
can learn from them. From tomorrow, we can do that thing by

02:15:51.790 --> 02:15:56.630
looking at them. Okay sir. The problem will be solved

02:15:56.630 --> 02:16:01.170
automatically. Okay. Yeah, Asit, go ahead with your

02:16:01.170 --> 02:16:05.860
question. Sir, please like the post so that when you do,

02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:09.240
it's only notify other. Yeah, I'll like everyone's post if

02:16:09.240 --> 02:16:12.480
you are going to tag me. Yeah, I'll like it. I'll like it.

02:16:12.500 --> 02:16:16.060
I'll give a heart symbol to your post. And if your post is

02:16:16.060 --> 02:16:19.700
amazing, I'll even comment with my own thoughts. If posts

02:16:19.700 --> 02:16:23.500
are going to be thoughtful. Okay, so Asit, go ahead with the

02:16:23.500 --> 02:16:26.820
question. Yes, Sudhanshu, thank you. Two years ago, I

02:16:26.820 --> 02:16:32.740
changed my, migrated to a research role than lead data

02:16:32.740 --> 02:16:36.800
scientist, right? And I shared with you long back. Now, it's

02:16:36.800 --> 02:16:39.900
been two years and two months. Again, I'm thinking to make a

02:16:39.900 --> 02:16:44.360
next post. Okay, you want to do it again? Okay. And I made

02:16:44.360 --> 02:16:50.280
my resume with your AI. So, if you allow me, I'll share with

02:16:50.280 --> 02:16:53.240
you too. Okay, you can share with me. Do you want to do it

02:16:53.240 --> 02:16:55.660
now? Or do you personally want to review it and send it to

02:16:55.660 --> 02:16:58.300
me once? As you say. We do review it personally, right?

02:16:58.780 --> 02:17:02.900
Okay. Just DM me. You already have my number in the group,

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:10.060
right? Just DM me. Okay. So, I generated this from URI. So,

02:17:10.060 --> 02:17:14.100
from AI. But my resume was quite big and it was very small.

02:17:14.340 --> 02:17:18.440
And from the last two years, my journey started in Gen AI. I

02:17:18.440 --> 02:17:23.240
made a team from there. Okay. And more on research. And now,

02:17:23.380 --> 02:17:29.740
the research that we made is going to productions. So, now I

02:17:29.740 --> 02:17:34.200
thought that let's move to the agentic AI. That's why I

02:17:34.200 --> 02:17:38.080
joined you. Okay. We'll do it again. Transition. It'll be

02:17:38.080 --> 02:17:43.440
done. Okay. Okay. I'll share my resume with you. Sure. Thank

02:17:43.440 --> 02:17:46.460
you. You liked my meeting post. Many people have reposted

02:17:46.460 --> 02:17:49.660
and liked. Thank you, sir. Yeah, I'll do it. If your posts

02:17:49.660 --> 02:17:52.520
are good, if your posts are amazing, if you're tagging me

02:17:52.520 --> 02:17:56.660
personally, I don't have any problem in terms of liking or

02:17:56.660 --> 02:17:59.680
commenting or even sharing the post. Because see, this is

02:17:59.680 --> 02:18:03.140
how we build a community. This is how we grow together,

02:18:03.380 --> 02:18:07.720
right? So, grow together is not just a line for me. I live

02:18:07.720 --> 02:18:14.180
for that line, basically. So, I do it. I just not go and

02:18:14.180 --> 02:18:17.020
just talk about it. Yeah. So, fine, guys. With that, thank

02:18:17.020 --> 02:18:19.180
you so much, everyone. I think agenda is pretty much clear

02:18:19.180 --> 02:18:24.520
for next week for all of us, basically. So, just try to

02:18:24.520 --> 02:18:27.380
work. I know it's time to work. Now, if you're just

02:18:27.380 --> 02:18:29.860
attending a classes, it's not going to work for you. Believe

02:18:29.860 --> 02:18:32.560
me, it's not going to work and you will end up regretting

02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:36.080
about this entire time. So, it's better. Whatever I'm asking

02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:40.300
you on a weekly basis, do it. It will make your life very,

02:18:40.420 --> 02:18:43.260
very, very, very easy. Believe me, right? That's the reason

02:18:43.260 --> 02:18:45.320
why I keep on giving this task. If you are not doing it,

02:18:45.400 --> 02:18:49.180
then obviously I can't do anything. Right? Not just about

02:18:49.180 --> 02:18:53.200
me. No one can do anything in this entire world. Choice is

02:18:53.200 --> 02:18:55.980
yours. Yeah. So, we have last one. Dhaneshwar, go ahead.

02:18:56.060 --> 02:19:01.050
What is your question? Yeah. Dhaneshwar, question you have?

02:19:01.970 --> 02:19:06.570
Sir, can you hear me? Yeah. You are audible. Tell me. Sir,

02:19:06.670 --> 02:19:10.590
my question was that I have done Mathematics, MS

02:19:10.590 --> 02:19:14.150
Mathematics. Okay. After that, I have done farming for 2-3

02:19:14.150 --> 02:19:18.470
years. Okay. I had 2-3 problems in farming. What happened?

02:19:19.210 --> 02:19:22.970
After that, in 2019, I had done full-stack data science

02:19:22.970 --> 02:19:27.790
course. But due to more interest in farming, I couldn't

02:19:27.790 --> 02:19:33.730
continue it. After that, I have come to AI, BI. After

02:19:33.730 --> 02:19:38.310
listening to it, I have again got interest in it. So, I am

02:19:38.310 --> 02:19:42.470
again doing your classes in the last 6 months on the

02:19:42.470 --> 02:19:47.930
platform. Okay. My question was that how do you live in the

02:19:47.930 --> 02:19:50.170
village? How do you live in the village? I live in

02:19:50.170 --> 02:19:53.250
Maharashtra. In Maharashtra, there is a lot of farming of

02:19:53.250 --> 02:19:57.050
grapes. So, how do you live in the farming of grapes? If the

02:19:57.050 --> 02:20:01.190
normal farmer doesn't know which spray to give or which

02:20:01.190 --> 02:20:05.170
fertilizer to give, then what he does is that he hires a

02:20:05.170 --> 02:20:10.530
consultant. A consultant takes between 10,000 to 15,000 cash

02:20:10.530 --> 02:20:16.970
for a year. Okay. Okay. So, my problem was that now, JNI,

02:20:17.270 --> 02:20:21.250
JNT is also there. How can we solve this problem? It is very

02:20:21.250 --> 02:20:25.370
easy. I mean, I know many like people or many even startups

02:20:25.370 --> 02:20:28.450
who are trying to solve this problem. And literally, the

02:20:28.450 --> 02:20:31.850
knowledge that NITVI has, the knowledge that LLM has, no one

02:20:31.850 --> 02:20:34.170
has that knowledge. Not even a consultant. It is a simple

02:20:34.170 --> 02:20:36.630
thing. Let's suppose you are in Maharashtra. So, people

02:20:36.630 --> 02:20:38.670
there must understand the local language of Marathi. Or you

02:20:38.670 --> 02:20:41.090
are from Tamil Nadu. Or you are from somewhere else. Or

02:20:41.090 --> 02:20:43.530
whatever. Because when we talk about farming, right? So,

02:20:43.550 --> 02:20:45.770
obviously, local language is used there. Okay. Yes, yes,

02:20:45.770 --> 02:20:48.070
yes. There are many local languages in India. Yes, yes, yes.

02:20:48.070 --> 02:20:51.930
Now, we have this chat, GPT or JNI or whatever system you

02:20:51.930 --> 02:20:54.690
take, so every system can understand multiple languages.

02:20:54.870 --> 02:20:57.430
Yes, yes. So, people can communicate in their own language.

02:20:57.510 --> 02:21:01.030
There is no restriction now. Now, so, what can people do

02:21:01.030 --> 02:21:03.970
there? Like, anyway, the people who have their corp or

02:21:03.970 --> 02:21:06.170
field, they don't get their report done. They get soil

02:21:06.170 --> 02:21:08.590
testing done. Right? Soil testing is almost done by

02:21:08.590 --> 02:21:13.330
everyone. Yes, yes, yes. Okay. So, what they have to do is

02:21:13.330 --> 02:21:17.450
that you make a simple interface. A small interface. You

02:21:17.450 --> 02:21:19.970
make a small app. You make a one-pager app. Okay. For now.

02:21:20.350 --> 02:21:24.570
And try it. Okay. To try it. Tell them, who are your farmers

02:21:24.570 --> 02:21:29.670
or who work with you, tell them that whatever question you

02:21:29.670 --> 02:21:33.390
have, whatever you ask the consultant, whatever data you

02:21:33.390 --> 02:21:36.070
need, that how much water should be put in it, or how much

02:21:36.070 --> 02:21:38.730
fertilizer should be put in it, when should it be put, if

02:21:38.730 --> 02:21:40.990
the result of the soil testing, because the result must have

02:21:40.990 --> 02:21:42.510
come in the pdf or in the screenshot, it must have come on

02:21:42.510 --> 02:21:44.210
the mobile. Yes, yes. Okay. Yes, yes. So, take the

02:21:44.210 --> 02:21:46.910
screenshot and upload the photo. After that, to ask him the

02:21:46.910 --> 02:21:50.530
question. Or what will happen in your framework? It will be

02:21:50.530 --> 02:21:53.170
a chat GPT type of framework. Okay. In which by default,

02:21:53.230 --> 02:21:55.790
multiple questions will be given here in the tab. Okay. So,

02:21:55.850 --> 02:21:58.370
your farmer will click on it. He got the answer. He will

02:21:58.370 --> 02:22:00.270
click on it. He got the answer. He is reading or listening

02:22:00.270 --> 02:22:04.410
to the farmer. Okay. Okay. So, in this way, you propose that

02:22:04.410 --> 02:22:07.570
we are saving you 15,000 rupees for the year. The fees of

02:22:07.570 --> 02:22:09.190
the consultant. And we are giving you immediate information.

02:22:09.410 --> 02:22:11.570
Without running after the consultant. And this is more

02:22:11.570 --> 02:22:14.710
authentic information. Okay. More authentic information.

02:22:15.790 --> 02:22:20.110
Like more accurate information. I think this is the best

02:22:20.110 --> 02:22:22.610
way. And it is very easy to do this work. And I know like a

02:22:22.610 --> 02:22:24.270
couple of startups who are doing a lot for a people by

02:22:24.270 --> 02:22:25.550
building this very small solution.

02:22:29.770 --> 02:22:34.170
Okay, sir. And I mean, I am working on this too. And I mean,

02:22:34.190 --> 02:22:37.910
I have been thinking about it for the last week. Because its

02:22:37.910 --> 02:22:40.930
season is about to come. Of pruning. Of fruiting. You will

02:22:40.930 --> 02:22:43.350
make it in a week. In a week. What is a week? How much time

02:22:43.350 --> 02:22:46.130
does it take? Wait. Like it can be made by tomorrow or the

02:22:46.130 --> 02:22:48.110
day after. I mean, small or small. You can make it by

02:22:48.110 --> 02:22:50.130
tomorrow or the day after. You can make it by tomorrow or

02:22:50.130 --> 02:22:51.590
the day after. And you can test it. You can ask people. You

02:22:51.590 --> 02:22:54.750
can upload a photo of your corp. Like a soil testing report.

02:22:55.110 --> 02:22:58.150
Or like of your land. Or anything. Okay. Ask the questions.

02:22:58.610 --> 02:23:02.450
Whatever they want. And people will enjoy. Okay, sir. I will

02:23:02.450 --> 02:23:05.830
make that app. But there is a problem in deployment. I mean,

02:23:05.890 --> 02:23:10.610
I have deployed 4-5 projects. That too. Deployed on render.

02:23:11.010 --> 02:23:12.570
That runs very slow. And for that, there will be some

02:23:12.570 --> 02:23:16.410
alternative. It will be free. For free, it is only render.

02:23:16.830 --> 02:23:19.590
Streaming. That is all. If you want to go in paid, then you

02:23:19.590 --> 02:23:23.470
have to take elastic bean stack from AWS or EC2 system. But

02:23:23.470 --> 02:23:26.810
yes. For free, it means render and streaming. And obviously,

02:23:26.850 --> 02:23:29.190
there will be a limitation. Because it is a free platform.

02:23:29.430 --> 02:23:31.810
Even that is also paid. Render is also paid. Streaming is

02:23:31.810 --> 02:23:36.410
also paid. But again, you will have to spend some money in

02:23:36.410 --> 02:23:42.250
pay. Okay. Okay, sir. Thank you, sir. Okay. Okay. So, fine,

02:23:42.310 --> 02:23:44.750
everyone. Thank you so much. Take care. See you again in my

02:23:44.750 --> 02:23:47.350
next lecture. Till then. Take care, everyone. Bye-bye. Bye

02:23:47.350 --> 02:23:47.410
-bye.
