okay so hi everyone good morning uh we are going to start

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.860
with the class in some time maybe in like a couple of

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.980
minutes and today's topic is going to be very very

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.480
interesting as i'm going to talk about uh n8n framework so a

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.120
lot of things i have to show you so it to you so this uh

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.580
today and even tomorrow so we'll we'll start the discussion

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.660
and

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.780
believe me you all will enjoy this uh session so session

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.880
that we are going to take today and uh tomorrow both the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.000
sessions you all are going to enjoy a lot believe me a lot

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.080
okay

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.460
so yeah good morning everyone suprabhat uh we'll start in

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.840
some time so

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.010
just wait sit tight with your system by the way i know uh

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.770
there is a festive season which is going on so uh many of us

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.630
are busy and uh yeah so that's that's completely okay so i

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.090
believe recordings will be available and uh you can watch a

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.210
recording in later stage and if you have a doubt so

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.170
obviously you can come and you can ask the doubts what

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.230
about a voice agent yeah what about that okay

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.600
so selfie selfie start guys everyone yeah selfie start

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.400
okay sure so uh let's start guys let me share my screen

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.700
first of all and uh let's start with the discussion for

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.000
today so as i said uh we are going to discuss about uh n8n

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.880
framework one of the most popular framework worldwide for i

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.100
would say no code or low code generally people say that that

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.400
n8n is a platform is a no code kind of a platform but uh i

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.780
don't agree with it by the way yeah and believe me after

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.560
this class even you won't agree with that that uh it's a no

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.300
code platform and then people say that that okay uh so even

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.840
if you are like a completely non-technical completely non

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.060
-technical right you don't understand technology you

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.720
understand like a http request or apis or you know a little

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.560
bit of coding and programming and you know uh those node you

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.020
will be able to do some sort of automation with n8n again i

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.820
don't agree with that and believe me after this session so

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.180
you all will be able to realize that a little bit of

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.660
technical things are required even little bit of programming

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.920
is required little bit of technology understanding is

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.860
required in terms of like apis or maybe a web hooks or maybe

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.160
uh different different kind of tools or the nodes and

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.840
everything right so it is required so it's not a no code

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.700
platform you can say that it's a no code platform but it's

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.420
not a it's a low code platform there is a possibility there

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.920
is a provision where you can write a code you can try to

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.080
tune things and i'll show you that part as well don't worry

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.080
right and but believe me in it and is one of the amazing one

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.760
of the awesome like a platform one of the awesome framework

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.800
you all will be able to find out that if you are a little

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.660
bit technical right not much if you are little bit technical

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.220
you will be able to automate almost everything and platform

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.920
is still evolving so i can tell you even the gap in n8n uh

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.560
basically as per my experience because i keep on doing a lot

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.400
of like a experimentation i keep on building a lot of things

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.040
over n8n so i will i can tell you even like where is a gap

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.760
and maybe that gap will be fulfilled in a future right there

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.320
is a very high possibility that those gap will be fulfilled

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.720
uh whatever frameworks is not available whatever tools are

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.460
not available maybe that will be available or maybe like

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.700
existing things will be simplified a little bit so i will

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.660
tell you that because it's a evolving platform many people

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.760
have already adopted it many people are already using it but

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.760
i will never say that it's a no code kind of a platform or

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.540
it's a platform which can be used by a complete non

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.720
-technical people seamlessly no that is not possible you

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.640
have to have like a get some sort of idea uh just creating

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.200
one single node is not called as like a automation by the

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.420
way

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.320
and then let's like uh see that how in it and actually works

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.620
so first of all go to google and no need to do any kind of

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.960
installation by the way so n8n uh n8n just try to search for

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.900
that and you will be able to see n8n.io a website so you

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.980
have to go there and you just have to do a login or sign up

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.600
so if you are starting for the very first time so just go

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.680
ahead with the sign up and yeah so easily you will be able

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:21.020
to do a sign up it's like a piece of cake by the way fine so

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.440
do it guys everyone so just do a sign up i've just pinged

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.660
you the link inside your chat so that you all can use it and

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.180
even go and search for the google

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.340
do it guys quickly and confirm in a chat if you are able to

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.780
do a sign up okay

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.860
done everyone okay

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.060
take your time i think one or two minute you uh max to max i

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.800
think you should take yeah

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.570
free trial go ahead with the free trial they are giving you

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.330
like enough 14 days of trial i believe which is more than

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:09.370
sufficient to learn

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.680
it i will oh

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:57.760
o

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.560
l v s o for w

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.920
n which is a

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.240
funny my system but yeah in your system it will be

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.820
completely blank as it is your like a new new account that

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.360
you are using, but yeah, so you will be able to see

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.000
something like overall, personal, maybe some sort of a

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.920
default project name, you will be able to see some admin

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.260
panel, you will be able to see variable insights and all

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.100
those things and maybe this admin control of the account you

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.840
will be able to see. Now what is this initn by the way, so

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.680
initn is nothing but a platform, so where you can try to

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:44.480
maybe do some sort of a automation, you will be able to do

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.600
some sort of a automation. What kind of automation, so can

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:53.060
we do only a AI based automation or we can do even a non AI

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.380
based automation, so I will say you can do any kind of

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:59.140
automation, AI based automation or maybe a non AI based

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:03.120
automation, so each and everything can be done over a n8n

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.800
platform, it provides you both of these flexibilities, yeah,

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.440
both of these flexibility. Now what is the meaning of

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.900
automation, so obviously kind of automation, so where things

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.060
will keep on running automatically. And based on some

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.680
things. So it will try to fire up some trigger or based on

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.000
some instances, so it will try to fire up itself and then it

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.100
is going to perform some sort of a task, right, it is going

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.320
to perform some sort of a task, that is something called as

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.060
technically an automation, right, this is what we have been

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:35.560
calling that as an automation at any point of time, okay, so

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.980
this is where this n8n comes into a picture, so there is

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:42.180
nothing much you will be able to find out by the way on this

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.860
page, but yeah, so if you will go into the workflow, if you

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:49.280
will start creating a workflow, you will be able to find out

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.940
so many things inside that, yeah, so many things inside that

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:56.480
you all will be able to find out. So just click on this and

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.820
then maybe create a workflow, you can just click over here

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:03.260
and then click on create a workflow and then you will land

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:08.260
into a blank page over here, yeah, so once again, guys, go

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:15.160
back, yes, go back and now from here. Now. So. So if I have

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.460
to create a workflow, like I said, so if I have to create a

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:22.380
workflow, so simple, go over there, right, create a

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:25.520
workflow, so after doing a sign up inside n8n, you will be

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.220
able to find out this. So you have to just click on create a

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.660
workflow, simple, and then you will land into this

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.740
particular page and this particular page where you all will

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:39.220
be able to create a workflow, you all will be able to run

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.760
it, you all will be able to execute it and you all will be

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.780
able to make it active for as long. As possible. Yeah. As

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.580
long as possible. So this is the place where you can try to

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.220
create the workflow. Now what kind of a workflow we are

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.460
going to create? So we will see a couple of workflow, not

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.140
just one. So a couple of workflow we are going to see over

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:59.760
here. So where we are going to execute it and then we are

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.580
going to test that particular workflow that whether this

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:07.640
workflow for me is working or not. So are you able to reach

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:12.560
out to this page, guys, everyone? Yes. Are you able to reach

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:18.530
out to this page? Yeah. Okay. Simple. It's very simple till

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:21.290
this like a step. It's not at all a big deal to, you know,

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:25.050
reach out here and then do something on top of this. Okay.

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:28.270
So once you are able to reach out till this particular

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:32.010
place, till this particular point, now what we have to do

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:37.190
next. So see, let's suppose we are, let's imagine first of

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.530
all, because see, whenever we are talking about any kind of

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:42.610
automation, so always automations should start with the

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:45.450
business use case or maybe with our imagination, right?

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:48.770
Generally with respect to our business use cases, it is

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.610
going to start. So what is the business use case by the way?

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:55.730
So let's suppose we have to use a URI API, right? We have to

00:11:55.730 --> 00:12:01.730
use a URI API and we have to build a kind of a chat system.

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:06.710
So where I can send a message and whatever URI API is going

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:10.570
to respond back to me, right? Whatever URI API is going to

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:14.210
respond back to me. So it should show me that particular

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:17.770
message. Yeah. It should show me that particular message,

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:21.470
whatever response I will be able to get it from a URI API.

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:25.790
Fine. That's a use case that we have in our hand by the way.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:30.990
So let's try to build that part that how I can build a real

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:34.750
time kind of a chat interface without doing even a single

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:39.170
line of a coding, right? How I can keep it up and running

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:43.470
for as long as, as I want, how I can try to create a public

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:47.170
URL. Which not just me, which even you will be able to

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:51.490
access now and you all will be able to chat with the URI

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:58.210
API. Yes. Yeah. Shall we do it guys? Just a simple workflow.

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:02.370
So where we are going to consume a URI API key. See what is

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:05.410
my use case? Let me like, let me make it very, very clear

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:10.570
once again. So I would like to like a builder, a simple non

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:13.990
AI based workflow. URI API itself. Yeah. URI API itself is

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:16.810
calling some model, but yeah, that's okay. At the end of the

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:21.610
day for me, it's a HTTP request, simple HTTPS request. So

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:24.770
nothing more than that. But yeah, so we have to build a kind

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:30.470
of a small workflow. So where I will end up consuming a URI

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:35.750
API means I will just try to send a means like send, send a

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:39.630
sort of input and whatever URI API will give me as an

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:42.730
output. So yeah, I will try to consume it as an output. And

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:46.650
everything should happen with respect to a chat interface,

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:50.270
right? A chat window. So that, you know, and that chat

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:54.670
window, I must be able to share with all of you so that even

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:59.210
you all will be able to hit a URI API, my, my URI API, by

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:01.950
the way, and whatever I'm experimenting as of now, and

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:06.270
eventually you all will be able to do the exact same thing.

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:10.550
Yeah. That is something that we have to do now. See. Okay.

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:13.550
So the main story is going to start. Once you are going to

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:16.210
click on this plus button, are you able to follow along with

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:20.910
my cursor? Mouse cursor? Yeah. This plus button, because you

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:23.450
have to follow along with the mouse cursor. There is no

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:27.210
other option by the way. Yeah. So here you will be able to

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:30.290
see a plus button. Now once you are going to click on that

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:32.890
plus button, which you will do again and again repeatedly,

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:37.170
right? So here you will be able to see multiple things, a

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:39.530
trigger manually, maybe something different, you will be

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:41.050
able to see. You will see in your screen. That is a very

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:43.790
high possibility. Not the exact same like a things which I'm

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:48.030
able to see. So here you will be able to find out all the

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:52.770
things in terms of node. Yeah. For example, so let's suppose

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.970
if I'm searching for chat, so I will be able to see a chat

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:59.570
trigger kind of a node. If I'm searching for maybe a vector

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.370
databases, so you will be able to see Quadrant, Baviot,

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:07.310
Pinecone, Supabase, Miniverse, Jep, MongoDB vector database,

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:10.110
Postgres vector database, right? If I'm searching for

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:13.590
vector. If I'm searching for AI, you will be able to find

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:16.710
out kind of a AI agent and many more things with respect to

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:20.010
AI, even open AI, open AI chat. You will be able to find out

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:22.290
Google Gemini. You will be able to find out Anthropic. You

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:25.570
will be able to find out Dally. You will be able to do a lot

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:27.670
of things, a lot of things you will be able to find out over

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:31.610
here. If I'm going to search AWS, so many services of AWS

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:35.310
you will be able to find out. So S3, SNS, ELB, IAM, SES,

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:38.830
SQS, Lambda, many things, right? If I'm going to search for

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:43.990
Azure. So Azure, so you will be able to find out many

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:47.650
services from Azure as well, right? If I'm going to search

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:50.690
for a sequel, I will be able to find out a lot of databases,

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:55.750
databases over here in terms of a sequel. If I'm going to

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:58.470
search for a MongoDB, so I will be able to find like a

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:01.870
MongoDB over here and inside that if I'll click, I will be

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:04.210
able to find out multiple functions with respect to that

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:08.370
MongoDB. Now if I'm going to search for maybe a Gmail. So I

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:11.150
will be able to find out multiple things with respect to the

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:14.070
Gmail as you can see, right? Multiple things, send a mail,

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:16.890
delete a mail, get a mail, put a mail, whatever, right? So

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:19.870
everything I will be able to find out over here. So

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:24.990
basically this is a main thing for all of us. So here what

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:27.810
Anit N has done by the way, okay, let me tell you that

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:33.810
clearly. So what Anit N has done, so see anyhow to like

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:36.730
achieve any kind of automation with respect to a coding.

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:40.110
What do we do? We write a functions, right? Technically

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:43.630
inside a program at the end of the day, what do we try to

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:47.290
execute? Function, right? So even we write a classes and

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:49.750
object, but eventually we try to create an instance of

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:52.590
classes and object and eventually we try to execute a

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:55.650
function, right? Some function. Now what is the meaning of

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:58.890
function? Means take some input, do something, give me some

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:01.530
output. Technically that is the meaning of any functions

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:04.010
that you will write in this entire world by using any

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:06.670
programming language, right? Not just Python. Just any

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.150
programming language. Any programming language, right? So

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:11.510
you will try to like create a function which will solve some

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:15.030
purpose. Technically function will take a input, it will

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:18.850
give you as a output, right? This is what function does,

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:23.390
right? In any programming language? I think we all are

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:28.010
pretty much clear and lying on that part, yeah? So

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:30.510
technically this is what any kind of a function does. For

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:33.590
example, let's suppose if I have to connect with a MongoDB,

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:37.070
right? So what do we do? We just go to a MongoDB, we create

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:40.690
a URI, we create our user ID and password and let's suppose

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:43.190
in my Python programming, so I have written a function to

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:45.570
connect with a MongoDB. So what I will do? I'll just try to

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:49.670
like, you know, uh, give a URI, I'll give a password and as

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:53.550
a return, so it will return me the connection string. Agree

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:57.290
everyone? If I have to connect with my SQL system, same

00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:01.490
thing I will do. Yeah. If I have to send an email, we have

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:04.190
already configured an email in terms of programming, right?

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:09.370
So via SMTP, we were able to like, uh, simple mail transfer

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:12.650
protocol. So we were able to send a mail, what we have been

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:15.910
doing, right? What we have been doing. So whatever input is

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:18.430
required for the SMTP along with my user ID and password,

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:22.030
right? Uh, so we were lying, trying to, we'll try to give us

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:26.390
an input as an output. It will send a mail and return me the

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:29.970
success, simple, right? And maybe in case of failure, it is

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:33.350
going to return me the failure. So technically this is how

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:36.990
the programming world works, right? That we write something

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:40.110
to us, we write some sort of a function to achieve some of

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:45.210
the task. Now what in it and has done again, even in terms

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.610
of agents, okay, what, what, what, what is your

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:49.790
understanding with respect to the agent? Because so far we

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:51.890
have done a lot of programming with respect to our agents.

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:56.250
Now what agent does? So we try to design an agent for a

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:58.670
particular task. What is the understanding about the agent

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:01.770
that we have so far? So agent is nothing but a kind of

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:04.830
autonomous program. So which will be having some sort of a

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:07.530
element. LLM access means large language model access, which

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:11.050
can understand the something in terms of NLP and it will be

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:14.030
having a tool access as well tool means some functions

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:17.310
access, right? And whenever you are going to assign some

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:21.270
task to a agent, so with the help of LLM, it will try to

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:24.230
understand the task and automatically it will try to invoke

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:28.150
a tool. Yeah. Automatically means a function, right?

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:30.570
Automatically it will try to invoke a tool. It will try to

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:34.910
invoke a memory or maybe any X, Y, G factors. Execute a task

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:37.730
and create a function. Then give me the final result. I

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:39.870
believe this is something that we have seen even with

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:40.670
respect to the agent.

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:47.610
Yes. Yeah. This is something that we have seen with respect

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:50.070
to the agent, right? So agent automatically decides that,

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:52.830
okay, I have to use X tool, Y tool, Z tool, ABC tool,

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:55.750
whatever tool, right? I'm not making a decision. My agent

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:58.570
itself is going to make a decision because it is having LLM

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:01.550
capability and LLM can understand any kind of instruction,

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:04.990
which I'm going to give even as a layman, even in a NLP,

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:07.910
natural language. If I'm going to give up automation. So

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:11.630
technically agent is nothing but at the end of the day, it's

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:15.210
also a function, right? Agent itself. I think we have

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:18.030
created so many agents by using those frameworks, maybe a

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:21.690
crew AI, maybe a line chain, maybe a line graph, right? So

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:23.770
someone has created a wrapper function on top of that,

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:26.310
right? That okay, fine. This function is going to call

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:29.650
another function, the technical tool, right? Or maybe like a

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:32.810
LLMs, maybe some sort of APIs or LLMs execution it is going

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:37.290
to do. So overall, this is how we should understand. Yeah.

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:40.790
Like the world of this entire programming. Now what they

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:44.830
have done in case of any end, right? What they have done. So

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:48.070
for example, if I'm going to show you agent, right, AI

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:51.710
agent, now what they have done. So basically they have

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:55.850
created, as you can see, so they have created a kind of this

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:59.710
box. So where you can configure your model, right? So click

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.690
and then configure any of your model, open a model, Mr.

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:06.650
Model, Gemini model, group model. Anything that you want.

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:10.450
Anything you want, you can try to integrate it, right? So

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:14.050
click, select, integrate, done, right? Then if you have to

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:17.470
add a memory, then click, select, add a memory, right? Then

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:20.170
if you have to add multiple tool, not just one tool, click,

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:22.910
select, add any kind of a tool that you want. Maybe a

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:25.930
Wikipedia search tool, maybe any kind of a tool which will

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:29.490
go and do some sort of a retrieval or like RIG, it will try

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:31.670
to perform with respect to the chat that you are going to

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:34.470
give. Maybe some sort of a Lambda function, maybe some sort

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:37.270
of a, even a code based tool. So maybe some sort of a code

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:39.710
based tool. Maybe I can try to like add a code tool over

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:43.130
here in JavaScript, in Python, in Python, they have like in

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:45.310
a beta, maybe in a couple of months it will out of the beta,

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:47.950
but yeah, JavaScript is available. I have already tested it

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:52.010
in JavaScript, it is stable one, right? So I will just go, I

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:56.950
will try to add a tool and then yes, execute it. It will up

00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:59.170
and running, it will up and running, it will up and working,

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:03.790
right? So this is a kind of a system that they have created.

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:07.070
So whatever we have been doing in a programming. Yeah.

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:08.350
That's not very different. That's the reason in the

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:12.030
beginning, I told you that people say that, okay, fine in it

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:15.550
and can be like, you know, understood and can be built by

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:20.230
your non-tech people. No, you are supposed to be tech a

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:23.050
little bit at least on a very high level. I'm not saying

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:25.790
that you should go depth of it because in terms of writing a

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:27.890
function in terms of understanding line by line, obviously

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:30.770
we have to understand a depth of it, right? But at least

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:34.610
here you are supposed to be skilled enough to break down

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:38.610
things, right? Break down your task. Let's see this entire

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:42.050
workflow you will be able to create if you have a

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:46.010
imagination or if you are able to break down a task into a

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:49.330
small, small, small, small, small, small pieces. It's not

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:51.950
like in it and is going to do for, you know, not at all.

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:55.730
They have given you every kind of a function, everything as

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:58.910
a node. Node means this is a node. This this I'm talking

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:01.510
about. This is a node. This is a node, right? This is a

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:04.070
node. So they have given you like, okay, fine, create your

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:06.630
own node, create any kind of a, you know, a flow. I don't

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:09.070
have any kind of a issue map each and everything. And then

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:11.250
even they have given you a provision where you can come and

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:14.970
you can write a code in JavaScript and Python, right? Let's

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:17.050
suppose you have to do a data cleaning. You have to do a

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:20.450
data transformation, right? Yes, you can do it. Yeah, you

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:23.570
can do it. Basically, even with respect to a code, you can

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:26.070
do it. That's pretty much possible. So they have given you

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:28.570
all of these functionality, but you have to have a technical

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:31.290
one, right? Unless you're not technical one, you can't do

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:35.810
it. Okay, let me delete this node. Fine. So now what is the

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:39.130
task that we have to achieve in a very first place? What,

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:41.990
what, what, uh, we have discussed, yeah,

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:45.370
what

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:49.540
is, what is the task that we have to do guys?

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:59.230
Chat with Yuri, right? That's a task, right? So chat with

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:02.950
the Yuri. Okay. So see, uh, what, what I have to achieve

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:05.470
over here, uh, let me open up my eraser.

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:19.600
Okay, fine. So what I have to achieve, uh, by the way. So

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:23.920
basically I have to, uh, like, you know, first

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:31.660
of all, call Yuri, right? Uh, sorry. So create a chat

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:37.040
interface, which will technically, yeah.

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:45.220
So first of all, create a chat interface. Now what this chat

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:48.920
interface will do. So this chat interface is technically

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.620
going to call what? So chat interface is going to

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:55.420
technically call my

00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:02.900
chat. Okay. Yuri API, fine. So it is going to call

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:06.640
technically my Yuri API. Now once it is going to call a Yuri

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:11.000
API, now what Yuri API will do? So whatever response, which

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.600
I'm going to get, response from Yuri,

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:24.840
from Yuri. So my handwriting was bad. So now I have decided

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.380
that going forward in every classes, whenever I'll take a

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:30.220
class, I'll be using this one. Okay. And I'll try to create

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.660
this kind of a diagram and I'll type it so that, you know,

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.820
things will be pretty much clear to all of us. So I'm using

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.900
it as it at IU. I've taken a paid subscription for this. I

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:43.100
had that, but yeah, I was not using it. So moved from here

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.520
to here, hope you will like it. Things will be pretty much

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.940
clear whenever I'm going to draw any kind of a, you know,

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:52.340
architecture diagram. Yeah. So chat interface and then what

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:55.000
will happen? So it will go to a Yuri API. Basically it is

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.520
going to hit a Yuri API, whatever response I'm going to get

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:01.880
from the Yuri API, like. So it is going to, uh, basically

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:07.360
like, uh, send you the response again into a chat interface.

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:11.700
Fine. So response from the Yuri and I have to showcase

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:14.360
everything into a chat interface itself. Fine.

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:20.950
Right. So this is the kind of a flow that we have to create.

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:23.790
And I believe we all have been interacting with the Yuri API

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:26.650
since a very, very, very, very long time. So no one is new

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:31.090
with respect to a Yuri API. Right. Uh, handwriting was more.

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:35.190
Okay. Anyways, both are okay. Yeah, it was organic, but for,

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:38.410
for like, uh, some of the people to understand things in a

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:42.870
later stage. Right. It's not that handy. That's a feedback

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:44.830
which I have received. So I have decided, okay, like, like

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:49.490
let's let, let's keep it clean because with my handwriting,

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:52.490
I can't do much. Uh, it's my childhood habit. Even my

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:55.530
teacher has tried a lot. Uh, they, you know, used to give

00:26:55.530 --> 00:27:00.230
me, uh, uh, like, uh, uh, so there was a teacher called as

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:03.150
Mahalakshmi teacher. Uh, he was my Hindi teacher by the way.

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:06.910
And she was well aware about my handwriting, uh, that it's,

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:13.350
uh, like, uh, way beyond a bad. So, uh, basically she has,

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:16.590
uh, she used to give me like a one page writing every day.

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:19.270
And yeah, I used to write somehow I used to manage, but

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:23.110
again, it's like a habit which I was never able to change,

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:27.730
uh, a bad handwriting habits. And I think many of us has

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:30.310
that, that hacker, that kind of a habit. Right. Not, not

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:35.110
just me, but yeah, I have that one even now. Okay. So this

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:38.310
is something that we have, and this looks much cleaner by

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:40.930
the way. So, and again, I have all the options to draw and

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:44.390
then, uh, like even use my pen over here in terms of doing

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:48.090
organic things. So here we have a chat interface, then we

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:50.550
have a URI API, whatever response that we are going to get

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:53.370
from URI API. So we are going to showcase into a chat

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:57.590
interface. Fine. That's a flow that we have to design, uh,

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:03.510
with respect to a N8N. Okay. So, uh, let's go inside, uh,

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:12.560
Euron and URI inside that. Okay. So if I'll go inside a URI

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:15.720
and one more thing guys, so today I'm going to start a AI ML

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.360
masters. So those who would like to, you know, understand,

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:21.720
uh, things from a very scratch, uh, understand our data

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.700
science by the way, right. Understand the complete AI ML.

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:28.440
Uh, so yeah, you can join this particular batch or any of

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.780
your friends and family, if they would like to join. Uh,

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.200
there is no privilege. Which I have kept for this generative

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.640
AI batch. Yes. There was a prerequisite of Python, but here

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.040
I'm starting with the Python and today is going to be the

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:42.320
induction session. Uh, batch timing is going to be a 7 PM

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.320
IST to 9 PM IST evening time by the way. Uh, so yeah, but

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.700
yes, everything will be discussed from the scratch, whether

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.680
it's a Python, whether it's a mathematics, whether it's a

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.780
machine learning algorithm, plus I have added also a flavor

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:57.780
of ML ops over here inside this particular batch with

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:00.660
respect to a project and with respect to even a topic. Okay.

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:03.440
So we can go and we can discuss about the ML ops and build

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:06.140
something amazing over here. So this is just an

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:11.620
announcement. Now, uh, go to URI API, yeah, URI API and here

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:15.280
just go to a code example. Now you can go to any of this

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:18.840
code example. The only thing which matters for me is this

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:22.540
URL. First of all, by this URL, I believe we all understand

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:25.180
that what it is going to do. So it is going to help you out

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:28.460
to reach to your own system or URI system you can say,

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:31.040
right. But that's this URL. This is something called as end

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.620
point, right? End point. So it will help you to understand

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:37.440
or reach out to our system. Then this bearer token, this

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.100
authorization is going to give a password so that you can

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:43.740
log in into my system, right into this your own system. And

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:46.500
then this is a payload that you are going to send means this

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:49.200
is the input that you are going to send it technically and

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.520
inside the input you are going to send this as a chat, which

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:55.260
I can parameterize. So this I can parameterize. So this is

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:58.380
the payload and as a response, so it is going to give you

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.860
some data, right? As a response, it is going to give you

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:03.560
some data and which basically we say that, okay, fine. This

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:07.020
is the response from URI, right? This is a response from

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:11.920
URI, okay? So I need this URL to hit an API. I need this

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.640
URL. I need this authorization and I need this payload,

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.520
right? Payload with my custom messages and yeah, it should

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.340
be able to work and it should be able to give me the

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:23.220
response and model wise, I can parameterize it. I can select

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:26.540
any of these models, not just GPT models, but yeah, so

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:29.560
whatever model access that I have, I will be able to use it

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.960
directly. And even I can try to use our image creation

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:35.520
model. I can try to use it directly. Okay. That's cool. So

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.780
we all are aware about the API and how we are going to hit

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:42.440
the API. So let's go back to this init n workflow, right?

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:47.640
And here, let me delete this one and let me add plus over

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:53.500
here and here in case of n8n, right? In case of init n and

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.800
try to understand the fundamental guys, it's not about init

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:59.120
n node. So just by attending this class. I'll leave. So you

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:01.320
will not just see the example, but yeah, you will be able to

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:04.940
understand the fundamental breakdown of init n as well. So

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:09.560
here any workflow that you are going to create any workflow.

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:16.100
So it must be having a starting point or can I say it must

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:21.560
be having a trigger point? Yes, everyone. Let's suppose even

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:24.120
if I have created a streamlined application, a UI

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:27.320
application, right? It must be having a trigger point,

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:29.380
right? Trigger point. Trigger point means you will click on

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:33.300
the button. You will send some data. This is what you have

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.700
been doing with respect to a streamlined application, right?

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:39.200
Or maybe if there is a chat interface, so you will start

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.760
chatting. You will say, hi, you will say, send some data,

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:46.860
right? Or maybe trigger point could be automatic trigger

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:50.140
point means system will start automatically. System will

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:54.500
trigger automatically at some interval, right? Maybe once in

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:57.820
every day, twice in every day. Maybe in every minute.

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:02.060
Automatically system will start itself. So there must be a

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:05.660
starting point. There must be a trigger point, right? There

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:10.280
must be a trigger point. So here in case of init n, you will

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:13.180
be able to find out almost every kind of a trigger point,

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:16.200
right? So let's suppose if I would like to trigger something

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:20.260
with respect to a chat, right? So just search chat over here

00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:23.720
and you will be able to find out chat trigger. See chat

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:26.720
trigger node. This is one of the node chat trigger node. So

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:29.380
automatically. It will try to trigger itself and I can go

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:31.940
and I can configure this node. I'll get into that part. Just

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:34.840
wait. Yeah, I'll get into this node part and it's like a,

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:38.040
you know, internals of this one. So chat trigger node. So

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:41.620
here I can say hi and maybe I will be able to trigger this

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:44.760
particular node. So chat interface and I can even make it

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:48.980
public, right? So just as a chat window, people will be able

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:51.280
to see and people will not be able to see any other things.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:55.020
So there is something called a chat trigger. Okay, fine. So.

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:58.580
So there is something called as scheduled trigger. So just

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:01.440
try to search scheduled trigger, S-C-H-E and you will be

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.580
able to see scheduled trigger. Scheduled trigger means what?

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:06.540
So let's suppose if I have to trigger something every

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:10.400
second, every minute, every hour, every day, every week,

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:13.680
every month or any custom time, I can give my own custom

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:18.600
time that okay, so you should fire up every minute, every

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:22.780
second or maybe in like every week in any way, right? Kind

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:26.780
of a crown job. You can say. Time based job. So generally

00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:29.480
this is what we configure a system, right? So system will

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:31.800
spin itself and then it will try to, you know, fire itself

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.480
and whatever code, whatever flow that we have written, it

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.620
will try to execute all the flow. For example, if I have

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:39.060
written a file watcher, right? I think we have written that

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:43.400
in case of a resume, right? So file watcher, it will, it

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:46.420
will keep on watching the files and then once file will be

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:50.420
available, pick the file, process it, dump it, right? Even

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:53.340
in data engineering, we do the same thing, right? So

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:57.720
basically you can try to create such kind of a scheduler as

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:00.520
you can see, you have all the options, second minute, hour,

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:04.500
days, week, month, everything or maybe custom, right? So I

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:07.940
can try to even schedule that particular part, everything I

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:11.060
can schedule it and it will start from this particular

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:14.640
trigger basically, right? And with ease I can schedule it.

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:18.140
So maybe second and then every 30 seconds, maybe I can say

00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:21.380
every two seconds just to trigger it. Minutes. Maybe like a

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:24.940
every. Like a one minute trigger it. Maybe I can try to give

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:28.580
a hours. So again, hours and then trigger in minutes, hour

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:31.160
and a minute. You can try to fill over here, maybe a days.

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:34.380
So days, hours and minutes. You can try to fill all the

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:37.240
information and then automatically trigger, week means week

00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:41.780
and then which day of week. So trigger it on every Sunday

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:47.200
and Wednesday. It will do, right? Trigger it just on Sunday.

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:51.620
Trigger it twice, whatever, midnight or maybe 1 am, 2 am. So

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:55.900
everything I can try to schedule, system will start and do

00:34:55.900 --> 00:35:01.040
the task and done. Yeah. So trigger is available. So there

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:04.060
is something called a schedule trigger. So where you can try

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:07.320
to configure your own time, you can try to configure even a

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:11.260
time zone, right? So because time zone will be different,

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:13.200
right? For a different, different reason. For example, I'm

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.920
going to follow Asia Kolkata reason, right? You must be

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:18.360
following some different reason. It's okay. You can go and

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:20.760
configure that time zone and according to time zone, it is

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.620
going to trigger. Trigger itself as simple as that. In

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.920
whatever time zone you have configured it, you have

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:28.480
scheduled it simple. There is something called as manual

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:32.720
trigger, manual trigger. So basically unless and until you

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.220
are not going to come and click over here and you are not

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:38.060
going to execute it, unless and until you will not come

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:40.800
means human will not come. Someone will not come. It will

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.180
not execute itself, right? So there is something called a

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:48.100
manual trigger. So there can be a multiple trigger. You will

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:52.200
be able to find out over here. As you can see, there is

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.280
something called a chat trigger. There is something called

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.660
as type form trigger. There is something called as MQTT

00:35:56.660 --> 00:36:00.300
request, IOT, right? So generally we try to use it in a IOT,

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:04.800
SSC. Generally we try to use it in a MCP servers, right,

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:09.120
SSC. So servers and events occurs, right? Server sets,

00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:11.740
events occurs. So there is something called SSC trigger.

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.620
There is something called a struggle trigger. There is

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:16.260
something called as Kafka trigger. So when data will arrive

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:19.660
in a Kafka, Kafka is nothing but a messaging system which

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:23.060
take data as an input and then basically like you can try to

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:25.420
attach a producer and then you can try to attach many number

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:28.200
of consumers. If you are not aware about Kafka architecture,

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:31.960
I will strongly recommend to go and check my videos with

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:34.560
respect to a Kafka. I have recently created it. It's amazing

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:37.860
and you will be able to understand because in many places in

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:41.140
a real time messaging system we are using Kafka heavily by

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:43.600
the way, right? Even I have shown you programmatically that

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.840
how you can connect and then even in my previous big data

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:48.800
masters lecture, lot of examples, lot of architecture I have

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.560
discussed and that back to practical example I have

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.280
discussed with respect to Kafka. So I think as a programming

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:56.060
programmer, you should always go and check that out, right?

00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:00.340
Email trigger, right? Like a big Bitbucket trigger,

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:03.580
Bitbucket is nothing but just like a GitHub, another kind of

00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:06.340
a GitHub repository maintained by Bitbucket. So whenever

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:08.740
someone is going to do some sort of a check in or maybe some

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:11.640
sort of a, you know, even someone is going to call, will

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:14.480
trigger something different, right? Will trigger maybe some

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:16.780
sort of a pull request or maybe some sort of a check over

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:23.020
there. That is possible, right? So here you will be able to

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:25.560
find out that there are multiple different, different kind

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:28.460
of triggers which has been given, right? RSS feed trigger.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:31.620
RSS feed means whenever we try to read a news over here, a

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:34.540
Facebook trigger when someone is going to post or maybe

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:37.440
something is going to happen on Facebook, right? So maybe I

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:40.100
can try to trigger this one, Facebook lead ad manager

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:43.800
trigger, MCP server trigger. So here you will be able to

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:47.620
find out a multiple trigger, not just a chat trigger by the

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:50.940
way, that you are going to use it in a real time. Means

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:55.300
trigger means just start the entire event, right? Start the

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:58.400
entire flow. So this is something that you should understand

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.980
in a very first place because we have to start, right? Even

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:03.800
when we were trying to create a, you know, a streaming

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.640
application. So we used to go, we used to like fill some

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:09.280
data or maybe we used to click on the button. Now that is a

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.240
trigger point, right? That is a trigger point. It will

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:15.100
trigger the entire flow, do some task, return some output.

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:18.660
Yeah. So similar thing. So you have to start the task. Now

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:21.780
you need a trigger in general. So sometime maybe chat

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.900
trigger, sometimes schedule trigger, sometime maybe manual

00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:26.380
trigger, sometime Kafka trigger, sometime MQTT trigger,

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:29.840
sometime Bitbucket trigger. But yeah, you need some sort of

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:33.700
a triggers basically. So that task will automatically start

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:36.440
and then you can try to even configure it. You can try to

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:39.100
even schedule it that, okay, fine. So at this point of time,

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:43.860
fire it up or when this is going to happen, start only this

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:48.420
particular workflow. Fine. How to add a scheduler? I believe

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:51.600
I have already shown you that part. So basically there is

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:54.180
something called as a schedule trigger. Recently I talked

00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:56.700
about it, right? Now you can try to configure your week,

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:58.780
month, day, second minute, whatever you want, right?

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.400
Whatever you want. I've just shown you, there is something

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:04.100
called a schedule trigger, which is already available and

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:07.660
generally for to run a cron job, right? Even in big data, we

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.680
are using this kind of a trigger a lot, right? We are using

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:13.600
this kind of a trigger a lot. So every kind of a trigger you

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.960
will be able to find out on your like a fingertips. Very

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:20.640
simple. Right? It's available. So that task will start

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:24.980
itself. Okay, fine. So now our requirement is to build this

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:29.660
one. So whenever I'll say hi, it will hit my, uh, you know,

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:33.360
uh, URI API, whatever URI API will give a response, it

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:36.040
should send it to me. So technically I would, I would like

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.180
to do it with respect to a chat, right? With respect to a

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:42.700
chat, because maybe my people don't understand, uh, tech

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:45.840
things, right? So I have to build that kind of a system. So

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:49.820
what I will do. So I will try to use a chat trigger for now,

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:53.600
chat trigger for now. So I'll just go click and then I will

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:58.440
try to create a chat trigger over here. Okay. So I have

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:01.040
created a chat trigger. I have not configured anything, but

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:05.100
yeah, so on this panel you will be able to see, so let me

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:08.580
delete it once again. Right? Let me delete it once again. So

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:13.040
here you will be able to see a chat interface. So once you

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:15.000
are going to create a chat trigger, let me refresh this

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.400
part. So as of now there is nothing completely blank, right?

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:22.780
Let's suppose if I'm going to add a chat trigger over here.

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.980
So as long, as soon as I'm going to add, you will be able to

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:28.060
see a chat interface. This is just for testing purpose.

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:30.860
Yeah. You will be able to see a chat interface over here

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:34.420
automatically, which is nothing but like a input. So here

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:37.600
you are going to give an input. Now if I'll click on this

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:41.340
one chat interface, so you will be able to see a test chat

00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:44.440
because whatever node that in it and has given to you. Okay.

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:47.320
So every node you can try to go and you can try to test it.

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:50.140
Test it means let's suppose if I'm sending high. So it

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:54.180
simply means that, that it will take input as a high, right?

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:57.260
Input as a high. Okay. So that will start this entire

00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:59.900
things. And after that, whatever I'm going to add, so it

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.020
will keep on like, you know, adding those things. As you can

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:06.220
see that I have sent high, right? So it is trying to store

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:09.440
this high into a variable called as chat input variable.

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:13.760
What was the action I have used? So basically internally it

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:16.980
is trying to call an action. This function may be right as a

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:20.020
send message function. And what is the session? So obviously

00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:22.920
everything will be stored as a session ID. So yes, it has

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.500
created a session ID for this particular conversation for

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:30.760
this particular chat by the way. Now on your right hand

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:33.920
side, you will be able to see a table. So same thing, same

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:36.460
information it is going to show you in a tabular format and

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:39.600
same information it is going to show you in a JSON format. I

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:43.080
prefer JSON format in general. It's like I'm too much

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.200
comfortable. My eyes are too much comfortable. I prefer a

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:48.060
table with a JSON kind of a format, but technically it is

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:50.600
showing you the same data. Nothing different. Yeah, nothing

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:54.040
different. Okay. So this is about the chat. Now here you

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:58.840
will be able to see make chat publicly available. Now as of

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:02.680
now, this chat interface is available only in my in it and

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:04.980
you will not be able to access by the way, my chat

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.720
interface, yeah, you will not be able to access my chat

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:11.800
interface. I can only experiment. I can only do it. So if I

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:15.340
have to make it available publicly, right? So that you won't

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:18.180
be able to see everything. My this in it, in it, in it, in

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:21.160
console, you will be able to see only a chat window kind of

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:24.120
a thing. Just like a chat GPT or UD like a chat that we

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:28.640
have. So what I can do, I can try to make chat publicly

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:32.500
available. Click over here. Yep. Click over here. So by the

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:35.360
time you are going to click, you will be able to see a pop

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:38.160
up, not a pop up over here. Right. You all will be able to

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:43.200
see. So the very first pop up is chat URL. Yes. Chat URL.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:47.040
Now at this URL, anyone will be able to access it. Access

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:50.600
this chat basically, right? Access you can say the entire

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:53.060
flow or application, whatever flow, which I'm going to add

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:56.420
at this URL, but not now. Now if I'm going to hit this URL,

00:42:56.520 --> 00:43:01.480
you will be able to see that code 404, right? Code 404, the

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:04.620
request, this, this, this is not registered. So basically it

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:07.680
is telling me that no, it's not registered so far. I can't

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:10.960
do anything like a basically over as of now. Why? Because

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:15.380
when you try to do it, so you have to make your entire flow

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:18.400
active as by default, when you are trying to like do these

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:20.860
things for the very first time, it will be inactive. I'll

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:24.120
tell you from where you can activate it, right? So once I'm

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:27.560
going to activate it. So at this URL, if I'm going to share

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:31.680
this URL with you, all of you, you will be able to access my

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:34.480
chat interface by the way. Yeah. Every one of you will be

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:37.240
able to access means things will become public, right?

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:40.740
Public. Now here. So they have given you two option. One is

00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:43.800
a hosted chat means by default at this URL, you will be able

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.660
to, you know, uh, access my chat interface. The second one

00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:48.640
is something called as embedding chat. So let me just

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:51.020
suppose if I would like to embed this chat in some other

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:54.280
application, you must be able to see a lot of companies used

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:57.960
to like integrate a chat, small chat to visit, right? Chat

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:00.340
with is on the left hand side, right hand side so that you

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:03.380
can say hi, their end will respond. And then you can, you

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:06.260
know, ask the questions or maybe talk to AI, right? Chat

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:08.260
wizard. So maybe if you would like to do some sort of

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:10.400
embedding. If you would like to do some sort of a color on

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:14.100
all those modification, you can do that. So this is

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:15.880
something that you will be able to find out authentication.

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:18.520
So you can go, I am going ahead with nano authentication.

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:21.000
Basic means it will just ask for user ID and password,

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:24.340
whatever user ID password you are going to set, or maybe in

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:27.500
it an auth I can try to use, right? Or maybe I can try to

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:29.660
use my custom auth as well as of now I'll try to keep it

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:35.880
none, right? And uh, then right then by default, what, uh,

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:39.760
initial chat will show. So hi there. My name is Nathan. So

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:42.220
instead of that, my name is Don shoe. It's my chat window.

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:45.200
I'll give my name. Very simple. So my name is Don shoe. How

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:48.180
I can assist you today. So this is something which is, which

00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:50.260
it is going to show you as a default message. You can change

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:53.060
this message as per your wish. No one is going to stop you.

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:56.520
So basically hi there. So whenever you are going to, you

00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:09.460
know, uh, or welcome to your own, your own, ask me anything.

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:18.400
Okay. Okay. I will try to give answer from URI API call.

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:21.280
Yeah. Something this, something like this. So something like

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:24.280
this kind of a messages, people will be able to see it,

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:27.340
right? People will be able to say it. Okay. Fine. Not an

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:34.270
issue. So here I'm able to create this one. Yeah. So here

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:37.510
I'm able to create this chat widget, right? Chat a visit.

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:40.450
And uh, yeah. So whenever I'm going to send like a

00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:46.200
something, hi. How are you? Hi. How are you? Hi. How are

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:49.120
you? So obviously this will be executed. So this will become

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:52.460
green. Now if I'll go and check, hi, how are you as an

00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:55.740
output, this is trying to give it to you, right? Output. So

00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:58.980
automatically when I like, uh, give any kind of an input, it

00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:01.300
will try to give me outputs. This is this chat chat

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:04.100
interface. This is just doing that. Nothing more than that,

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:07.560
but still this is not active. So how I can try to make it

00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:10.740
active. So as you can see over here, so if I have to make it

00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:15.340
active, right, you have to activate this one. See, you have

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:19.100
to activate this one. So now this is active green button.

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:23.740
This is active, right? So now this is active. Now I can, so

00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:27.940
I can try to share this, uh, chat to visit URL, the URL,

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.640
which it is available over here after making it public. So I

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:35.600
can try to share with anyone and uh, yeah. So anyone will be

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:39.780
able to access this one, right? So welcome to your own. Ask

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:42.300
me anything. I'll try to give you answer from URI API call.

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:46.280
See this is a chat interface, right? This is a default one

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:50.440
that, uh, in it and has given to you, this is a default chat

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:54.520
interface. So at this URL, now I'm sharing this URL with all

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:57.400
of you and just tell me, are you able to access the same

00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:02.340
URL? Yeah, you will be able to say send just high and you

00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:04.980
will not get any kind of a response by the way, because I

00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:07.900
have just like, I'm taking an input. I'm not giving any

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:11.820
response as of now. Yeah. So now all of you will be able to

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:15.460
access this chat interface. My chat interface is public.

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:18.340
Obviously you will not be able to access my internet and

00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:20.860
interface. This interface is not available to you, right?

00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:23.820
This is my development interface. This is where I, you know,

00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:27.020
said you will the task, so you do the job, right? Or maybe

00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:30.240
you create my workflow. Uh, but yeah, so I have just made my

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:34.460
end point or maybe a starting point public. Yeah. So I

00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:37.480
believe all of you are able to access my chat. Yes. Yes.

00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:42.820
Everyone. Yeah. Fine. Yes. So all of you are able to hit my

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:47.200
URL. All of you are able to access my chat. Now if I'm going

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:52.940
to right now, if I'm going to integrate a URI API means when

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:56.360
you will send high or any, any kind of a messages, right, it

00:47:56.360 --> 00:48:03.540
will hit my URI API and give me a response back. So then you

00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:06.080
will be able to, you know, see a response over here. Once

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:08.680
I'm going to integrate it. Right. Once I'm going to

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:13.520
integrate it. So now just to create this chat interface, can

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:15.080
I say that we have to do a lot of programming?

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:20.320
Yeah. We have to do a lot of programming, right. And to host

00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:23.980
it, you know, on some URL, uh, maybe into some cloud

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:27.820
platform. But here I have not done anything basically just

00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:29.900
one click and done simple,

00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:37.590
right? Yeah. That's a use case of like any 10, which, which

00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:40.370
I'm trying to show you that. Yeah. You, you, you, you are

00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:45.070
supposed to be technical, right. But not much, maybe

00:48:45.070 --> 00:48:48.870
somewhere between a tech and non-tech guy, right. If you are

00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:53.110
there, I think you can automate anything. Fine. Now, not

00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:56.890
just that, right. Not just that. So they have even given you

00:48:56.890 --> 00:48:59.670
a customization option, right. Customization of the

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:01.770
customization means if you would like to change the color

00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:05.410
theme and all those things. So there is a possibility that

00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:08.710
you have. So here, uh, yeah. So first of all, if you would

00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:12.430
like to like, uh, see allow file upload means if you are

00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:15.410
taking a file, so maybe you can try to click on a lot of,

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:19.110
uh, like add a field. And then maybe if I'm going to refresh

00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:23.570
it, I will be able to see, uh, not in this way. I have to

00:49:23.570 --> 00:49:27.250
save it. Yeah. Save it. And then if I'm going to refresh it,

00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:30.730
I will be able to see even upload file options. See, now I

00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:34.010
have this option, upload file option. Even in my local, I

00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:36.650
will be able to see this upload file option. So I can upload

00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:40.010
any kind of a files. Simple. Now there are more features.

00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:42.730
There are so many features almost they have given to you. So

00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:47.390
add fields and then maybe I can try to say that, uh, allow

00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:51.190
file a Miami type input placeholder load previous section

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:55.670
required button click to a start the chat. So someone has to

00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:59.330
go and like this one, a custom chat styling. So this is

00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:02.010
where you can try to change the flavor, maybe some different

00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:04.330
color if you are looking for. So see, they have given you

00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:08.330
all the color codes. Right? Just change the color code. So

00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:11.390
for chat color, white light light, there's medium dark

00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:14.970
disabled for a route by the way. Right? So complete CSS they

00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:17.490
have given to you. So border color, background color, you

00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:20.910
can try to change a font size. Also you can change toggle

00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:24.190
button. You can try to change. So whatever styles that you

00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:27.090
are able to see, they have given you as a parameter, go

00:50:27.090 --> 00:50:31.210
ahead and change it and your entire chat interface will be

00:50:31.210 --> 00:50:33.570
customized, right? This entire chat interface will be

00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:38.190
customized by the way. So you have that option as well. So

00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:41.670
chat custom, uh, custom chat styling. So you have that

00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:44.410
particular option for all of these options is available and

00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:46.710
just have to click and then, you know, customize the titles.

00:50:46.850 --> 00:50:48.690
If you have to change the response mode, if you have to

00:50:48.690 --> 00:50:51.030
change subtitle, if you have to change load a previous

00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:55.610
session input placeholder, everything is available just on a

00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:58.470
click and you can try to customize your chat interface

00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:01.270
without writing any piece of the code. But yeah, you are

00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:03.630
supposed to be technical, right? So let's suppose if someone

00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:05.450
is trying to change the styling and someone don't

00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:08.490
understand, the CSS or maybe a background or maybe this

00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:12.330
color code, then obviously they don't know like how to like,

00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:17.590
you know, uh, go and change it, right? So that's the reason

00:51:17.590 --> 00:51:21.230
I told you that a person somehow between like tech and non

00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:24.310
tech. So if, if you are that kind of a guy, you will be able

00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:27.470
to do it easily. And if you are tech, then things will be

00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:30.730
even more easier for you. If you are a little bit tech, if

00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:34.130
you understand the coding and programming, so things will

00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:36.250
be, uh, pretty much. Like a easier for you because

00:51:36.250 --> 00:51:40.850
technically it's doing the same thing, right? Uh, okay. So I

00:51:40.850 --> 00:51:43.070
can try to go ahead and I can try to customize my entire

00:51:43.070 --> 00:51:46.450
chat. That option is already available. Fine. So I'll not

00:51:46.450 --> 00:51:49.930
try to focus now much on chat, uh, over here. So basically

00:51:49.930 --> 00:51:53.670
this chat, I'm able to, uh, like, uh, you know, uh,

00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:58.230
configure chat mode. Now next is what? So as we know that

00:51:58.230 --> 00:52:02.190
this chat node is giving me this output chat output, this,

00:52:02.250 --> 00:52:04.650
this is the output window, right? As you can see output. So

00:52:04.650 --> 00:52:07.830
chat is giving me this output. Now what I have to do, I have

00:52:07.830 --> 00:52:11.270
to consider, I have to take this output, right? And I have

00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:15.510
to send those output to the API. I have to send this high to

00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:18.910
API. Now what I can do, maybe I can do a little bit of data

00:52:18.910 --> 00:52:21.730
formatting over here. So I can try to call something called

00:52:21.730 --> 00:52:24.810
a set. So there is something called a set. So what set does?

00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:27.370
So again, this is the kind of internal function. So which

00:52:27.370 --> 00:52:30.230
will try to modify, add, remove item or a field. So let's

00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:32.290
suppose if someone has sent high, I would like to do some

00:52:32.290 --> 00:52:35.270
sort of modification addition. So I can try to call this set

00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:38.870
node. I can try to attach the set node with this chat one.

00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:46.650
Fine. Let's do it. So here in n8n, right? Whatever node you

00:52:46.650 --> 00:52:49.570
are going to call, whatever means literally whatever, right?

00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:53.330
Majority of times in 99% of time, if it is not a starter

00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:57.490
node or end node, so 99% of the time you will be able to

00:52:57.490 --> 00:53:00.970
find out two side of it and I believe you all should

00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:02.750
understand this two side. And generally. Generally people

00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:06.990
gets confused between this two sides. What are those, those

00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:10.430
two sides? So see, I told you the philosophy of a function,

00:53:10.570 --> 00:53:13.930
right? Function means take a input, give output, do

00:53:13.930 --> 00:53:18.990
something in between. Yeah. N8n follows the same philosophy.

00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:22.570
Take some input, do something, give the output. Simple,

00:53:22.690 --> 00:53:27.150
right? So for example, I have taken one of the node, it was

00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:29.870
called a set node, which, which can help you out in terms of

00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:34.830
modifying the data. Okay. So here you are able to see a

00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:38.850
previous node, which was a chat node, which was taking this

00:53:38.850 --> 00:53:42.730
as a, which was giving this as a output. So now this will

00:53:42.730 --> 00:53:46.070
become the input for the next one. Yeah. This will become

00:53:46.070 --> 00:53:48.310
the input for the next one. So let's suppose next node is

00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:51.050
set node, which I have created. So this will go as an input.

00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:53.930
So on your left hand side, you will be able to see a input

00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:58.050
things. If there is an input, right? If you have binded it,

00:53:58.110 --> 00:54:00.410
if you have not binded it, you will not see the input. Okay.

00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:03.590
So here you will be able to see a input. So input wise,

00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:06.470
these are the things which is coming. And then you will be

00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:09.670
able to see output on your right hand side. Yeah. And then

00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:13.150
middle will be your node parameter. You can try to configure

00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:15.770
it. So for example, this is a set to one, right? This is a

00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:18.330
set, a basically, which will try to take some input and

00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:20.390
which will try to give me some output. This is a set

00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:22.690
function set function from a Python. You can maybe try to

00:54:22.690 --> 00:54:26.730
recall. Right? Uh, so here, what I will do, I'll try to use

00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:30.490
this a simple function on node, you can say, in case of

00:54:30.490 --> 00:54:33.470
anything it is node, so I will try to take this one, I will

00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:37.010
try to click on add field and this is taking a name and a

00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:40.550
value. So name wise I can just drag, just drag, see, pick,

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:47.450
yeah, drag. So name wise chat input and then value wise so

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:51.950
high, simple. So I will just try to drag it over here. So

00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:54.490
automatically you will be able to see that it is going to do

00:54:54.490 --> 00:54:58.210
a mapping, simple and that too in a dynamic way it is going

00:54:58.210 --> 00:55:01.550
to do a mapping. So this was the key and this was the value,

00:55:01.790 --> 00:55:06.450
simple. Now if I am going to execute it, now see what it is

00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:10.050
doing. So your input was basically session ID action and

00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:14.930
chat input, right, session ID action, so your input. I have

00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:17.850
basically placed a function and I simply said that, that

00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:22.290
okay, just try to take chat input key and then give me this

00:55:22.290 --> 00:55:25.930
as a output, simple. So this is something that it is trying

00:55:25.930 --> 00:55:28.690
to give. If someone would like to even consider a session

00:55:28.690 --> 00:55:32.150
ID. Not an issue with the set, add a field, I can add one

00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:35.090
more field. I will just go ahead with the name session ID

00:55:35.090 --> 00:55:39.710
and then I will just drag and drop this one. So I will

00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:42.210
simply go and drag and drop over here. So dynamically it is

00:55:42.210 --> 00:55:46.110
able to map session ID. Now if I am going to execute, so see

00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:49.470
it is going to give me chat input and a session ID as well.

00:55:49.610 --> 00:55:53.170
So in whatever manner I would like to configure it, I can

00:55:53.170 --> 00:55:57.410
just configure it. So this is the middle one. So this has

00:55:57.410 --> 00:55:59.190
been designed to do a filtering. You have to filter it based

00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:03.250
on your like a mapping, right. It is doing it, simple. If I

00:56:03.250 --> 00:56:05.310
would like to return it in some different format, maybe

00:56:05.310 --> 00:56:07.890
number, boolean, array, some sort of type conversion if I

00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:09.870
would like to do, I can do it just like a programming,

00:56:10.030 --> 00:56:14.230
right. So all of these controls are available to me and that

00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:15.750
is the reason I told you in the beginning that you are

00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:19.510
supposed to be like kind of like a programming guy, right.

00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:21.830
Because in every node you will be able to find out

00:56:21.830 --> 00:56:24.450
programming itself, so you have to understand. I am not

00:56:24.450 --> 00:56:26.750
saying that you should write, come and write over here, but

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:29.070
at least you are supposed to be a guy who understands it. So

00:56:29.070 --> 00:56:31.530
those who say is that even if you are non-technical, a pure

00:56:31.530 --> 00:56:36.050
non-technical, you will be able to use an A10. That doesn't

00:56:36.050 --> 00:56:39.970
hold true, right? That doesn't hold true because even over

00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:42.150
here I'm not writing a programming, but obviously I should

00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:45.430
have the understanding about programming little bit, right?

00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:50.190
A little bit basic at least. So here, so on this left hand

00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:52.930
side I have an input and then on my right hand side output.

00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:56.990
So input coming from the previous node, so whatever is the

00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:59.830
output of the previous node, which was the chat node that

00:56:59.830 --> 00:57:02.930
was giving me output, it was, it is going into my set

00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:06.290
function and then it is going to give me the output. Okay,

00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:09.490
fine. I will delete it. I will just try to keep this only

00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:13.270
high part, right? So this high I will try to send to the

00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:16.490
next one. This high I will try to send to the next one.

00:57:16.590 --> 00:57:20.530
Okay, fine. So let's try to configure. So this two node is

00:57:20.530 --> 00:57:23.830
done. So whenever I will send high, whenever I will send

00:57:23.830 --> 00:57:27.970
high or maybe I'm sending, how are you right? Something like

00:57:27.970 --> 00:57:32.750
that I'm trying to send. So now here, how are you? I'm not

00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:35.270
considering this action session ID and all those things. So

00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:39.310
how are you as an output? It is going to give me at this

00:57:39.310 --> 00:57:44.210
point of time. Now this I have to send to my API API. Now

00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:50.250
when I talk about API, this is what HTTPS request API means

00:57:50.250 --> 00:57:53.190
hitting this URL right with the BRL token and then payload

00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:56.750
basically. This is the meaning of API by the way. And URI is

00:57:56.750 --> 00:58:00.590
also APIs, right? URI is available in the form of APIs. So

00:58:00.590 --> 00:58:04.370
here what I have to do, so I can try to call a node and

00:58:04.370 --> 00:58:08.070
there is a node called as HTTP request. You can send a

00:58:08.070 --> 00:58:10.350
request, get, put, post, whatever you want. You can try to

00:58:10.350 --> 00:58:13.230
send it. I think I talked about it in a very beginning.

00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:15.870
That's the reason I have taken a class of APIs in the

00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:18.610
beginning itself, right? So I can try to call this node,

00:58:18.790 --> 00:58:22.930
right? Call this node. So now this is technically a HTTPS

00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:28.730
request node. So hit any URL by any method, get, put, post,

00:58:28.790 --> 00:58:32.170
whatever you want, and then send a payload with a BRL token

00:58:32.170 --> 00:58:37.970
and then bingo done. Yes, simple, as simple as that. So here

00:58:37.970 --> 00:58:40.590
HTTPS request, and I believe we all know the philosophy

00:58:40.590 --> 00:58:43.470
behind the APIs. We have created a lot of APIs and we have

00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:46.030
been using and consuming a lot of APIs. And if, especially

00:58:46.030 --> 00:58:48.830
if I talk about URI APIs, I think we have been consuming it

00:58:48.830 --> 00:58:51.810
so many times, right? So here, as you can see, these two

00:58:51.810 --> 00:58:53.570
tools are connected. So now I just want to show you a little

00:58:53.570 --> 00:58:56.430
bit. As you can see, this is the input, which is coming from

00:58:56.430 --> 00:58:59.850
the previous node. So this is the input and output once I'm

00:58:59.850 --> 00:59:02.290
going to configure it, right? Output once I'm going to

00:59:02.290 --> 00:59:05.550
configure it, okay. So this is basically a HTTP request. I'm

00:59:05.550 --> 00:59:09.350
going to use it basically for a URI hit. Let's suppose I'm

00:59:09.350 --> 00:59:13.010
going to give a name of this node is equal to URI hit. Yeah,

00:59:13.070 --> 00:59:17.270
I can change the name by the way. So URI hit. Now here, if

00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:20.470
I'll talk about URI, right, go to like maybe copy this part,

00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:25.870
right? Copy this part. So here, okay,

00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:52.370
so basically, right, so basically, this is my like, if I, if

00:59:52.370 --> 00:59:55.370
I'll talk about this entire thing, so basically, this is my

00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:59.470
URL, yeah, this is my URL. Now what is a method that we are

00:59:59.470 --> 01:00:03.750
using to hit this API post, right, post. So fine, let's do

01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:07.350
one thing, copy this URL, fine, same URL, which is available

01:00:07.350 --> 01:00:11.010
in URI, nothing different. And then paste the URL over here,

01:00:11.130 --> 01:00:14.930
same. So api.uron.one, api.uron.one. URI chat completion.

01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:18.690
Now what is the method post, fine, select a method post,

01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:22.050
like I said, you can do like anything that you want, that

01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:24.950
you do with a postman that you do with the code, right? So

01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:30.330
post, fine, as like, as like the URI API is like doing it.

01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:35.130
So post, okay, fine. Now authentication. Now if you have to

01:00:35.130 --> 01:00:38.890
hit a URI, you have to provide authentication, a BRR token,

01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:42.130
you have to provide a BRR token. So unless an ID token is

01:00:42.130 --> 01:00:45.130
not available. URI is not going to give you a response by

01:00:45.130 --> 01:00:48.770
the way, right? Okay, fine. So here by default, none. So

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:51.270
let's suppose some API is already open. For example, if you

01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:56.030
remember, we have already hosted a OSS 20 B open AI model on

01:00:56.030 --> 01:01:00.510
a GPU by the help of framework called as VLM and over there

01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:03.130
we have not attached the authentication. So anyone can go,

01:01:03.150 --> 01:01:06.390
anyone can hit the URL, anyone can access the model. If my

01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:09.810
model is up and running, that was open, but URI is not open,

01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:12.970
right, URI is not open, or maybe you have created some other

01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:14.950
functions which is open. So it's in that case,

01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:18.850
authentication is none, but URI is not open. So basically

01:01:18.850 --> 01:01:22.250
you have to select a generic credential type. It's a fully

01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:25.190
customizable credential that basically we have created as a

01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:29.090
URON. So here generic credential type and then select, so

01:01:29.090 --> 01:01:33.770
select what, BRR auth, we have given you what? We have given

01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:36.190
you a BRR auth. So there are different, different kinds of

01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:39.510
auth you will be able to find out and that we decide when we

01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:42.590
try to create an API or expose any system. As an API. So

01:01:42.590 --> 01:01:45.130
basically we have entered a BRR auth. So here you have to

01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:48.530
select a BRR auth, simple, all the options you will be able

01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:51.930
to find out auth type one, auth type two, query auth, digest

01:01:51.930 --> 01:01:54.650
auth, custom auth, BRR auth, basic auth. So these are the

01:01:54.650 --> 01:01:57.050
different, different kinds of auth mechanism. So we are

01:01:57.050 --> 01:01:59.870
using a BRR auth by the way, which is clearly visible. You

01:01:59.870 --> 01:02:02.510
don't have to go and even ask anyone. It's a BRR auth and

01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:05.710
then API keys, this static is nothing but API key. So here

01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:09.290
I'm going to select the BRR auth, right, I'm going to select

01:02:09.290 --> 01:02:13.330
the BRR auth and then BRR auth wise. You have to now select

01:02:13.330 --> 01:02:16.350
the credential. I have already attached it. So from my like

01:02:16.350 --> 01:02:19.230
a previous session, it is showing me this. So I can try to

01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:21.870
click and I can try to click on create a new credentials,

01:02:22.050 --> 01:02:25.430
create a new credentials and then here I can try to give my

01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:28.430
BRR token. What is the BRR token? Your API key technically.

01:02:29.470 --> 01:02:32.530
Yeah. So BRR auth API key. So from where I can create the

01:02:32.530 --> 01:02:36.310
API key, the way we are doing it, create an API key, give

01:02:36.310 --> 01:02:39.670
any name, click and then this is my API key, right? This is

01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:41.650
my URI API key. So I believe we all know how to create an

01:02:41.650 --> 01:02:43.570
API key. So I click on create the API key, paste it as

01:02:43.570 --> 01:02:49.250
simple as that and then save it, done. So my BRR, so

01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:51.710
selected auth type, then it is going to give you this option

01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:55.650
and I have just given my credential over here, simple,

01:02:55.790 --> 01:02:59.430
right? I have just given my API key over here. So now from

01:02:59.430 --> 01:03:03.670
this API request system is having an idea what kind of a

01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:07.330
method we are using post, what is the URL, right? What is

01:03:07.330 --> 01:03:10.770
the authorization and what is the credential? What is the

01:03:10.770 --> 01:03:14.970
credential? Right? System is having all of this idea. System

01:03:14.970 --> 01:03:18.590
is having all of this fair understanding. Now I have to send

01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:21.710
a payload means data. I have to send, basically I have to

01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:23.590
send the payload. I have to send the data, this particular

01:03:23.590 --> 01:03:29.690
data where I have to send this data means this data is not

01:03:29.690 --> 01:03:31.910
going, not going to be write a poem about artificial

01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:35.870
intelligence. This data is supposed to be about my data

01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:38.810
means my user input, right? I just have to parameterize it

01:03:38.810 --> 01:03:41.750
so that you know, from a chat. It will try to take that

01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:44.650
message and then it is going to execute it. Okay, let's do

01:03:44.650 --> 01:03:49.970
it. So here send a query parameter option is available. Send

01:03:49.970 --> 01:03:53.050
a header option is available. Send a body option is

01:03:53.050 --> 01:03:55.950
available. You just have to go and you just have to activate

01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:58.830
it. Yeah, you just have to go and you just have to activate

01:03:58.830 --> 01:04:04.330
it over here. Okay, fine. So here if I have to like talk

01:04:04.330 --> 01:04:09.430
about the header, so what is my header by the way? Yeah. So

01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:11.850
what is my header? So I had two headers. One is a token

01:04:11.850 --> 01:04:14.350
which I have already provided. Now this is basically one of

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:18.110
the header content type application slash JSON. Okay, I can

01:04:18.110 --> 01:04:23.290
do that as well. So send a header and use a field below.

01:04:23.490 --> 01:04:28.690
Okay, so name is what? So as per my API name is basically

01:04:28.690 --> 01:04:33.030
let's suppose content type. Name is basically content type.

01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:36.490
Now what is the value? So value is nothing but application

01:04:36.490 --> 01:04:40.830
JSON. So just copy. Just copy from the URL itself.

01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:45.190
Application JSON. Okay, fine. Done that. Right. Now if you

01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:47.990
would like to add more headers parameter because there can

01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:51.030
be like n number of headers parameter in an API. You can add

01:04:51.030 --> 01:04:54.490
it. Otherwise it's fine. Then what? You have to send the

01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:58.690
body. Body is nothing but d. A data. d. Right. This is a

01:04:58.690 --> 01:05:01.710
data. Payload you can say. So I have to send the body. Okay.

01:05:01.810 --> 01:05:06.690
So I can try to enable a body. Fine. Because in some API

01:05:06.690 --> 01:05:09.150
request you have to send the body. In some don't. So every

01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:11.510
customization is available. Every customization is available

01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:14.950
just on your click. So body. So in what format I would like

01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:18.550
to send? All the options are given to you. In a raw format,

01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:22.670
in a JSON format, in a like encoder or any other format you

01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:25.010
can just do it. I will send it in a JSON format. Right.

01:05:25.590 --> 01:05:28.290
Using a field below? No. Using a JSON. So I will just change

01:05:28.290 --> 01:05:31.150
it to the JSON. So that you know because here things are

01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:33.930
available in a JSON format. So I will just try to copy it

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:36.670
and then I will try to you know paste it and then I will be

01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:39.570
able to technically send it. Okay. Yeah. I will technically

01:05:39.570 --> 01:05:45.130
send it. So now as a body right as a body what we are

01:05:45.130 --> 01:05:50.010
supposed to send over here. Fine. What we are supposed to

01:05:50.010 --> 01:05:55.110
send over here. So as a body right as a body we are supposed

01:05:55.110 --> 01:06:00.190
to send this entire data. From here to here we have to send

01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:04.550
this particular data. Fine. As a body we have to send this

01:06:04.550 --> 01:06:09.570
particular data set. Copy it. Just copy it, copy this data

01:06:09.570 --> 01:06:14.290
and then paste it. So here you will be able to find out

01:06:14.290 --> 01:06:17.550
again I can expand it by clicking on this one. So here you

01:06:17.550 --> 01:06:20.930
must be able to see that this is something that we are

01:06:20.930 --> 01:06:23.950
sending. Write a poem about artificial intelligence, this

01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:27.310
temperature and everything and I am just sending as it is

01:06:27.310 --> 01:06:32.270
like a data over here as a body. Okay. Close it. Now come

01:06:32.270 --> 01:06:36.570
over here. Right. So okay. I have already sent it. I have

01:06:36.570 --> 01:06:38.990
not parameterized it. Technically I am supposed to send this

01:06:38.990 --> 01:06:42.190
chat input but as of now it is sending me content write a

01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:45.210
poem about artificial intelligence. Let's hit it. Let's hit

01:06:45.210 --> 01:06:48.430
my API and let's see whether we are able to get some

01:06:48.430 --> 01:06:52.910
execution or not. So yeah. It's amazing. Right. We are able

01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:56.690
to see the output. So what was my question? Write a poem

01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:59.830
about artificial intelligence. Default question. Right.

01:07:00.070 --> 01:07:03.150
Which was hitting my model. I can change the model ID over

01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:06.210
here. I will be able to hit 29 other model as well. I can

01:07:06.210 --> 01:07:08.610
select temperature just the way we were using it in a

01:07:08.610 --> 01:07:12.410
function. So it is able to write a beautiful poem for me as

01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:16.190
per my input. Can I say that? Everyone?

01:07:18.810 --> 01:07:21.550
Yes. Can I say that we are able to get the beautiful poem?

01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:27.590
So technically can I say that from this N8N I am able to hit

01:07:27.590 --> 01:07:32.550
a URI API means I am able to achieve this one response from

01:07:32.550 --> 01:07:36.390
URI API. I am able to get it. Yeah. I am able to get it. I

01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:39.690
am able to hit this URI API and whatever question which I

01:07:39.690 --> 01:07:43.250
have sent. Yes. I am able to get the answer for that one. I

01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:46.170
am able to get the output for that one. Now what I am

01:07:46.170 --> 01:07:50.150
supposed to change in this one? Yes. Everyone. What I am

01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.850
supposed to change?

01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:59.020
Yeah. What I am supposed to change? Input parameter. A

01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:02.160
message. Because technically this is the hard coded one.

01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:05.240
Right. This is the hard coded one. So can I say that that I

01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:08.560
will just try to remove this one. Right. And instead of this

01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:12.960
content is equal to that. So maybe I can try to give this.

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:14.000
How are you?

01:08:16.710 --> 01:08:20.670
Yes. Can I say that that I can I can just try to give maybe

01:08:20.670 --> 01:08:25.030
like a how. Sorry. I think I have like I did it in a wrong

01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:25.310
place.

01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:37.480
So basically this is json.chat input. Let me cross it and

01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:44.170
then content. So content is equal to json.chat input. Right.

01:08:44.190 --> 01:08:47.130
json.chat input. Simple drag and drop or you can even write

01:08:47.130 --> 01:08:50.930
it manually. It's up to you. Right. So this is basically an

01:08:50.930 --> 01:08:54.670
input and I have just made it dynamic. So whatever question

01:08:54.670 --> 01:08:58.750
will come here. Right. So json.chat input. Chat input is a

01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:01.730
key. So it will try to fetch that value for the key and then

01:09:01.730 --> 01:09:05.330
it will try to send that. Now let me execute this. Let me

01:09:05.330 --> 01:09:10.230
test it. What happened? Somewhere I have made changes.

01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:14.330
Problem URI hit json parameter need to be valid json. Oh

01:09:14.330 --> 01:09:16.530
maybe I have disturbed my json.

01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:37.700
This message. So basically this is the message and write a

01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:41.860
poem about artificial intelligence. Maybe I can try to

01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:48.740
parameterize it and here so I can try to maybe like write

01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:50.240
json

01:09:59.590 --> 01:10:00.610
.chat input.

01:10:14.450 --> 01:10:19.010
Okay. Execute a step. Still giving me issue with the note.

01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:19.610
There

01:10:34.270 --> 01:10:40.490
is some issue with the input format. So content is this.

01:10:41.050 --> 01:10:43.850
That's completely fine. Let

01:10:56.900 --> 01:11:00.800
me wind it up inside this.

01:11:05.690 --> 01:11:15.620
So this quotes by the way. Yeah. So this quotes. Okay. As a

01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:20.320
string I can try to send it. Yeah. So now executed

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:24.600
successfully as you can see. So just inside the quotes I am

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:27.660
trying to pass this entire parameter because this will be

01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:33.620
just a plain string again. So now see I have passed what

01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:36.860
question how are you. This was the input I have mapped as

01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:40.560
you can see in a dynamic manner. So whatever question which

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:44.160
will come over here it will try to hit my URI and then what

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:46.540
is the response. I am doing well. Thank you. How I can

01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:49.460
assist you. So can I say that I am able to parameterize it.

01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:51.800
It means whatever question will come, whatever input will

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:55.560
come, go to URI, URI will give me output and this is the

01:11:55.560 --> 01:12:03.140
output. Yes everyone. Yeah. Yeah. I am able to get it right

01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:05.760
and I am able to make it dynamic. Means whatever question

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:10.180
will come. So here I am giving json.chat input and this name

01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:13.200
you can change. All this like parameter name you can try to

01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:17.700
change. It's in your hand basically. So okay. Successfully I

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:20.840
am able to test my URI API. Okay. And URI API is giving me

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:24.040
this as an output. Yeah. So it is giving me too many things.

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:27.260
It is giving me ID, object, created, which model it is

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:31.320
trying to use, choice, indexes, message assistant, finish

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:35.020
ready, users, many things, prompt token, which has been

01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:38.000
used, completion token, total number of token, all of these

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.860
things is being used. I don't want to showcase all of these

01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:46.000
message to my user. Yeah. I don't want to showcase this

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.720
total message to my user. For example. This is the flow,

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:52.980
right? And this flow is active. Now hit my chat interface,

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:56.140
the first maybe, and then try to hit my chat interface. Hi,

01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:04.440
how are you right? So if you are going to send a chat

01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:08.980
message, so here, how high are you? So action send a message

01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:11.340
session ID, everything. It is going to return by the way,

01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:14.940
right? It is going to return now. So I have to give the

01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:18.820
output output to the user. Yeah. Output to the user. So I

01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:21.920
don't want to give all of these things as an output. What I

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:24.640
would like to give, I would like to give maybe just content.

01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:28.960
I'm doing well. Thank you. As an output, this, this JSON, a

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:31.980
small JSON, not this one. So what I can do, so whatever

01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:34.980
output I'm getting from this one, I can try to attach one

01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:38.700
more node filter for a filtration again, set a node. Yeah.

01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:42.600
Set a node. So set a node. This is the input coming from

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:47.180
URI. What I will do, do a field mapping. Right. Set a node

01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:50.520
to content and then the content is equals to value is equal

01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:53.460
to this one. So this will just give me this one. So execute

01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:57.380
a steps. So now out of this entire data, whatever data I

01:13:57.380 --> 01:13:59.960
would like to like a send, I would like to showcase. I can,

01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:02.140
I can showcase that part. Maybe someone is looking for users

01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:05.300
so I can showcase users as well. So now this is just going

01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:08.780
to return me this much. So content I'm doing well. Thank

01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:12.800
you. How I can assist you. Simple. Now back to canvas. So

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:17.400
this is a steps which we have added. Now. So now just go and

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:23.620
send a message. Hi, how are you? Yeah. Uh, maybe I'll have

01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:27.180
to restart my workflow so that it can take an effect. Save

01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:38.820
it. Hi, how are you? Right. So now it is executing the

01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:41.320
workflow and as you can see, this is something which I was

01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:43.800
trying to return choice message content. Hello, I'm here

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:47.940
ready to help you out. How are you doing today? Okay. Okay.

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:57.480
I'm doing good. Tell me about, uh, about, about agentic AI,

01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:02.420
right? So now it is hitting my URI API in a backend and

01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:04.920
agentic AI refer to the artificial system design this, this,

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:09.200
this, this, this, this, right? Yeah. So it's amazing, right?

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:11.820
So we are able to create a chat interface and then whatever

01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:16.820
it was returning. So yes, I'm able to return this one. Got

01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:20.320
it. Everyone. Yeah. Got it.

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:27.100
Simple, right? Simple. So can I say that now I'm able to

01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:29.160
create a chat? Maybe I just have to look into data

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:35.780
formatting a little bit and then like my chat is ready. Yes.

01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:41.580
Yeah. So yeah, now you have to just do a content formatting,

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:44.360
right? See in it and every node is going to return JSON by

01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:48.320
the way, right? Now there is a node where you can go and you

01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:52.080
can try to filter out all those data. It's just a content

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:55.700
part. This is just a JSON, right? So I can, I can just add

01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:58.680
maybe a code node and then as a code node. So I'll try to

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:02.400
like this only this one and then I can try to showcase those

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:07.560
data. Yeah. How to share this setup to other person. See,

01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:10.640
there are two things. This is my end product. You can say

01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:13.740
right at this URL and the product. So you will be able to

01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:17.220
access my flow, but as a chat, right, you all will be able

01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:20.780
to access this entire flow as a chat and you will not be

01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:23.340
able to see internal mechanism. All of this. You will not be

01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:26.440
able to see, you will not be able to see even a logs or any

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:30.400
traces. So here, as you can see, so it is storing a log so

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:33.400
that I can come, I can debug it for each and every steps. It

01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:37.320
is like a, if it is live, even if it is not live here, it

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:39.760
will show you the logs and everything right. Input, output,

01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:42.060
everything. You will be able to see, you will come and you

01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:45.300
will be able to debug. And I have exposed this one as a, to

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:47.420
the outer world. So this chat interface, I can even

01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:50.580
customize the color, font, everything. And then I can. So

01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:53.660
this one, something which people will be able to access if I

01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:56.200
have to share this workflow. So here you will be able to

01:16:56.200 --> 01:17:00.880
find out three dots. So click on this dot import from URL,

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.900
right? Import from URL or maybe like a import from a file,

01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:09.280
sorry. So here you have a download option. So click on this

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:17.760
download and then my URI API workflow. So here it is able to

01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:21.980
download as a JSON. As you can see, it is able to download

01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:26.180
as a which file, JSON file. Now let's suppose if I'm going

01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:29.900
to share this JSON and let me do it now. Yeah. So let's

01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:33.020
suppose many of you are not able to execute this entire

01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:36.700
things that that's completely fine. Right. Many of you are

01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:40.360
just watching it. Maybe let's suppose if you would like to

01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:42.760
execute it quickly without doing it and without doing

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:45.340
anything. So let me upload this one.

01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:20.480
So here in your zoom chat. I have already shared my JSON

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:23.660
file. This JSON file, which I have downloaded. Yeah. A JSON

01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:26.800
file, which I have downloaded now without even doing

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:31.120
anything right without even doing anything or maybe list of

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:34.240
the things. If you would like to execute my workflow, a JSON

01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:36.760
file, I have already shared with all of you, or maybe

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:39.280
someone has given you an innate N workflow. And if you would

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:42.880
like to execute it so simple, uh, open up a new tab of

01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:46.560
innate N right. Open up a new tab of innate N by the way.

01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:51.440
Okay. Uh, like after doing a sign in, obviously click on

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:54.420
create a workflow. Open instance.

01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:02.580
Yeah. Create a workflow. Now this is the blank one, right?

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:05.180
This workflow is completely blank. There is nothing in this

01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:10.740
workflow. Right? Simple. Click on this three dots and import

01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:14.020
from a file. If there is something available on URL, so you

01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:16.860
can go to URL or just click on import from file, which file

01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:19.660
a JSON file, which I have shared with you. So import from

01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:22.300
file. Now. This was the JSON file, which I have already

01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:26.400
shared with all of you. Click on open. See the entire things

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:27.280
is available to me.

01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:33.400
What other application you can develop, whatever you can

01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:38.240
imagine. Your imagination is the only like a bottleneck

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:40.200
apart from that you can develop because there are thousands

01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:43.320
of node which is available. Technically all the functions

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:47.980
are available, which is like a used to build in any tech on

01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:50.580
this entire world. So anything you will be able to access.

01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:53.340
So now I have already, are you, are you able to create it

01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:56.700
guys? Those who are not able to do it. Yeah. Without even

01:19:56.700 --> 01:19:59.360
looking into any of these nodes, you will be able to access

01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:01.580
the exact same thing. It's like I'm sharing the code with

01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:05.160
you. So I've already shared a JSON file inside your chat

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:09.960
tab, right? Download it, click it, import it, and you will

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:13.480
be able to see each and everything just like me. Yeah. And

01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:16.600
then you can try to, you know, configure it by default by

01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:18.780
see everything is available, right? Everything is available

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:21.380
over here. Even my author, everything is available over

01:20:21.380 --> 01:20:24.180
here. Whatever setting, which I have done. All the settings

01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:29.440
are already available to all of you, right? Modify it and

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:37.170
then you can use it. Yeah. Right. Everyone. Yeah. So can we

01:20:37.170 --> 01:20:38.770
productionize it? Obviously we have done the

01:20:38.770 --> 01:20:40.930
productionization right now we can try to bind it with some

01:20:40.930 --> 01:20:46.510
other URL, whatever URL of my choice. So already if you, my

01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:50.410
workflow is active inside in it and it's active means

01:20:50.410 --> 01:20:57.550
productionized. This is how easy it is. And then anything is

01:20:57.550 --> 01:21:00.070
going to charge you for that, but every hit it is going to

01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:04.230
charge you for every execution. It is, it is going to like a

01:21:04.230 --> 01:21:06.030
charge you. Yep.

01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:20.420
Cannot able to share. I think like we all can. Yeah. Okay.

01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:24.280
I've just shared my JSON file once again. Okay. So this is

01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:27.500
cool stuff, right guys? Everyone. Hope this is, this looks

01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:33.380
cool to all of us can be directly chat GPT without a URI

01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:36.100
API. Obviously. Obviously you can call a chat GPT API is

01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:40.380
just, uh, we have like a, you know, a chat GPT chat is

01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:47.180
available. So chat, sorry, open AI chat, open AI chat model.

01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:50.240
See it's available. Open AI chat model. Just call it, give

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:55.340
the API key bingo done. So send a request to a chat GPT and

01:21:55.340 --> 01:21:58.500
then get a response similar to this one, right? Similar to

01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:01.020
this one. So it's, it's already available. All these nodes

01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:05.660
are already available inside your API. Uh, in eight and by

01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:08.740
the way, fine.

01:22:12.870 --> 01:22:15.850
Can we see the input output when you use your, well, no, you

01:22:15.850 --> 01:22:18.690
can't see my input output, right? Basically. Uh, yeah. If

01:22:18.690 --> 01:22:20.330
you're going to inspect it, you will see some couple of

01:22:20.330 --> 01:22:22.550
things, but yeah, technically you will not be able to see

01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:25.950
it. Only I can see it like who is hitting, who is doing what

01:22:25.950 --> 01:22:29.890
I can see it from my side. Right. But you are the end user

01:22:29.890 --> 01:22:32.550
for this application. You are the end user. So why you would

01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:35.450
like to see it? Why I should show you. And I can even make

01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:37.910
it secure. So without even user ID and password. You will

01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:41.630
not be able to access it. That option is also available. Uh,

01:22:41.630 --> 01:22:46.510
okay. So this is a very first, a very small, uh, like a node

01:22:46.510 --> 01:22:50.410
or multiple nodes we are able to build, which is going to

01:22:50.410 --> 01:22:54.270
give you a good idea, right? And this is active. So active

01:22:54.270 --> 01:22:58.450
means it's in a production. By the way, I can just name it

01:22:58.450 --> 01:23:05.110
as a URI chat hit. Okay. It's chat hit. Now it will be

01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:07.910
saved. Now I'm trying to make it inactive. Now you will not

01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:09.850
be able to access it. I have already shared the JSON file.

01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:13.330
So you can from the JSON file, anyhow, you will be able to

01:23:13.330 --> 01:23:18.270
replicate the entire things. And let me, uh, deactivate my

01:23:18.270 --> 01:23:23.170
API key as well. So you can attach your own API key in a

01:23:23.170 --> 01:23:28.330
bearer auth. I have like so many API key I have created for

01:23:28.330 --> 01:23:29.790
the experimentation and classes.

01:23:34.990 --> 01:23:39.070
Okay. So next what? So one, one of the flow I'm able to

01:23:39.070 --> 01:23:41.690
create this flow, I'm able to create, as you can see, right?

01:23:41.690 --> 01:23:44.850
This, so this flow is available and based on like, uh, our

01:23:44.850 --> 01:23:47.690
previous understanding, we are able to create this flow. Let

01:23:47.690 --> 01:23:51.290
me like, uh, make it quotes and

01:23:55.450 --> 01:23:59.090
quotes here. Okay. So this is the flow which we are able to

01:23:59.090 --> 01:24:02.750
create happily. Okay. That's cool. Now let me show you the

01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:06.370
another application. So I'll just try to go to my in it in a

01:24:06.370 --> 01:24:10.230
workspace. I'll try to click on create workflow and then

01:24:10.230 --> 01:24:13.670
I'll try to create a new workflow, a completely new one.

01:24:13.690 --> 01:24:17.270
Fine. Completely new one. I'm going to create it. So

01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:22.430
basically, uh, I would like to send a mail, yeah, I would

01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:27.150
like to send a mail. So maybe like, uh, any, any messages I

01:24:27.150 --> 01:24:29.930
would like to send anything in a, in a mail by the way.

01:24:30.010 --> 01:24:32.490
Right. So I would like to send any kind of messages in a

01:24:32.490 --> 01:24:36.330
mail. So how I can do it, let's, let's try to understand

01:24:36.330 --> 01:24:40.010
that part again. This is going to be very, very easy. So

01:24:40.010 --> 01:24:42.230
there should be a trigger point. So let's suppose if I'm

01:24:42.230 --> 01:24:46.050
sending high. Okay. Like, or like any, any responses which

01:24:46.050 --> 01:24:49.450
my, you know, system is going to give, uh, it should

01:24:49.450 --> 01:24:52.810
basically like, you know, uh, send that as a me or any

01:24:52.810 --> 01:24:55.850
messages which I'm going to type. Maybe that message it

01:24:55.850 --> 01:24:59.250
should send as a, in, in a mail as of now a simple workflow,

01:24:59.430 --> 01:25:03.510
I'm going to create it in that way. So what I can do, I can

01:25:03.510 --> 01:25:08.230
try to maybe like a quickly pick my chat trigger so that I

01:25:08.230 --> 01:25:10.690
can send the message. I'm not going to make it public, leave

01:25:10.690 --> 01:25:14.510
it as it is only the chat trigger over here. So chat trigger

01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:18.750
is done. Now I have to format the data. So same set I'm

01:25:18.750 --> 01:25:20.970
going to use so that, you know, I can try to map the data.

01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:25.070
So whatever chat, uh, like, let me send high so that I can

01:25:25.070 --> 01:25:30.410
populate some data. Yeah. For this one. So it's, it's giving

01:25:30.410 --> 01:25:33.710
me like Chad input high. Now I would like to like just map

01:25:33.710 --> 01:25:38.590
it. Chad input. Hi. Yeah. So now data will be there and this

01:25:38.590 --> 01:25:41.590
output will be this one. Now I would like to send this high

01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:46.370
into a mail. Okay. Yeah. High into a mail. So here you will

01:25:46.370 --> 01:25:49.010
be able to find out a gmail service. There is something

01:25:49.010 --> 01:25:52.770
called a gmail. So I'll try to select gmail fine. And then

01:25:52.770 --> 01:25:55.650
inside a gmail you will be able to find out like add a

01:25:55.650 --> 01:25:58.630
label, delete a message, get a message. So you can fetch a

01:25:58.630 --> 01:26:01.570
messages. You can send a message, you can get a message, you

01:26:01.570 --> 01:26:05.050
can reply to a messages, right? So everything you will be

01:26:05.050 --> 01:26:07.650
able to find out all of these functions, individual

01:26:07.650 --> 01:26:09.770
function, you will be able to find out. So I'll try to

01:26:09.770 --> 01:26:13.250
select send a message, right? Send a message. So send a

01:26:13.250 --> 01:26:16.850
message node. I'm going to select by the way, right? So I

01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:21.350
have to send a message to any mail ID. But to do that, you

01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:24.630
have to connect your gmail account. So there will be a

01:26:24.630 --> 01:26:26.750
sender and there will be a receiver, right? This is the

01:26:26.750 --> 01:26:29.610
meaning of a send a mail. Even with respect to SMTP, we were

01:26:29.610 --> 01:26:31.430
doing the same thing, right? You can send anything to

01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:34.650
anyone. So here there will be a sender and there will be a

01:26:34.650 --> 01:26:37.130
receiver, right? There will be a sender. There will be a

01:26:37.130 --> 01:26:39.690
receiver. So first of all, I have to configure my gmail

01:26:39.690 --> 01:26:41.870
account. I have already tested on configured it. So it is

01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:44.070
showing you. This I'll try to click on create new

01:26:44.070 --> 01:26:47.010
credential. So click on create new credential and then you

01:26:47.010 --> 01:26:49.250
don't have to do anything. Just do a sign up with a Google

01:26:49.250 --> 01:26:53.190
account. Simple. So it will pop up and whatever mail you

01:26:53.190 --> 01:26:57.870
have to configure. So just click on tick continue. It will

01:26:57.870 --> 01:27:01.590
authorize automatically. See connection successful means it

01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:07.230
is able to connect with my mail from where it will send a

01:27:07.230 --> 01:27:11.830
mail means from right from is connected. So basically

01:27:11.830 --> 01:27:15.570
whatever mail ID login, which I have done, so from this mail

01:27:15.570 --> 01:27:19.790
ID it will start sending the mail, right? Resource what? So

01:27:19.790 --> 01:27:23.930
resource like in a messages it is going to send option send,

01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:28.470
send I have selected. Yeah. Now to, to whom you would like

01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:31.590
to send the mail. Yeah. To whom you would like to send the

01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:34.830
mail. So maybe I would like to send a mail to Sudhanshu, S-U

01:27:34.830 --> 01:27:41.790
-D-H-A-N-S-H-U, S-U-D-H-A-N, Sudhanshu at the rate Euron,

01:27:43.230 --> 01:27:47.790
Euron dot one. So to this mail ID, I would like to send a

01:27:47.790 --> 01:27:50.630
mail. So whenever like I will, I will send some message, it

01:27:50.630 --> 01:27:53.890
should go to Sudhanshu at the rate Euron dot one. What

01:27:53.890 --> 01:27:57.990
should be the subject? So here you have to do a mapping,

01:27:58.110 --> 01:28:02.530
fine, here you have to do a mapping. So here, let's suppose

01:28:02.530 --> 01:28:05.110
if I'm sending a mail. If I'm sending hi, right. If I'm

01:28:05.110 --> 01:28:08.330
sending hi, now let's try to connect it, connect this too.

01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:12.910
So it is getting some input and now let, so now it will show

01:28:12.910 --> 01:28:19.570
me the input by the way. Yeah, fine. So here once I will

01:28:19.570 --> 01:28:26.830
like, I have already connected. So here, edit field or let's

01:28:26.830 --> 01:28:29.350
suppose I'm writing when chat received, why it is not

01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:35.190
showing me this? It should show me. Let me save.

01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:42.720
Let me run the workflow and test it. The workflow is issued

01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:47.100
and cannot be executed from that reason. Please fix them

01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:53.480
first. Okay. So hi, let's suppose if I'm writing subject is

01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:56.640
hi and the message message should be parameterized. I'll

01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:00.080
parameterize it, but let me just execute the steps first.

01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:04.120
Yeah. So here it must have sent some sort of a like a

01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:07.040
message or test message to me. Well, let me go and check.

01:29:37.270 --> 01:29:40.290
Hmm. So now the entire workflow is executed, not executed

01:29:40.290 --> 01:29:44.230
successfully. It is showing me. And now if I'll show you my

01:29:44.230 --> 01:29:48.830
mail, right, see, I have received a mail from which one,

01:29:48.870 --> 01:29:51.630
from which mail ID, the mail ID with which I have logged in

01:29:51.630 --> 01:29:55.250
and what is the message? So basically the subject is hi and

01:29:55.250 --> 01:29:59.130
then even body is hi, right? The subject of the mail is hi

01:29:59.130 --> 01:30:01.770
and then body is also hi. This is something which I have

01:30:01.770 --> 01:30:04.150
configured, right? And that's the reason. So it is like a

01:30:04.150 --> 01:30:07.110
showing me hi. So immediately I'm able to receive the mail.

01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:10.130
Okay. Now I have to parameterize it. Parameterize means

01:30:10.130 --> 01:30:13.550
what? So subject may be like a, I can try to parameterize it

01:30:13.550 --> 01:30:16.310
in any way if I'm sending a subject, right? As of now I'm

01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:20.090
not sending a subject, for example, a message. So maybe I

01:30:20.090 --> 01:30:22.590
can just drag and I'll say that, okay, fine. So whenever,

01:30:22.650 --> 01:30:25.650
whatever output that you will get, just try to send it as a

01:30:25.650 --> 01:30:29.290
mail to me. Fine. Just send it as a mail to me. So now

01:30:29.290 --> 01:30:32.590
execute the steps. So fine. If I'm going to execute the

01:30:32.590 --> 01:30:38.750
steps over here, it will send that message. Always. Right?

01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:41.070
It will try to send that particular message. It's sending me

01:30:41.070 --> 01:30:45.170
hi, hi. So okay. Let me remove it. Execute the steps. So now

01:30:45.170 --> 01:30:48.470
it will be able to send me the messages over here.

01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:55.850
So see, I have received the mail, right? Hi. Now let me do

01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:58.890
one thing. So now whatever I will write in chat, now let me

01:30:58.890 --> 01:31:04.170
execute the entire workflow. So I will send it like a, hi,

01:31:04.290 --> 01:31:11.650
this is Sudhanshu Kumar. I am. Hi. Sending you a test mail.

01:31:11.950 --> 01:31:16.650
Fine. Now entire workflow is executed. So by the time I have

01:31:16.650 --> 01:31:18.870
sent the chat, entire workflow is executed and it's showing

01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:22.090
me that even mail trigger has been done. Let's go and check

01:31:22.090 --> 01:31:24.850
whether I have received the mail or not. And yes, hi, this

01:31:24.850 --> 01:31:27.310
is Anshu Kumar. I am sending you a test mail. I'm able to

01:31:27.310 --> 01:31:32.470
receive the mail, right? Yes. I'm able to receive the mail.

01:31:33.670 --> 01:31:35.990
How to send a bulk mail. So basically you can try to

01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:38.870
configure a multiple email ID without quotation marks. So

01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:41.210
where I have used a sender mail. You can configure a

01:31:41.210 --> 01:31:43.170
multiple sender mail. This is how you can send it in a bulk.

01:31:43.930 --> 01:31:47.150
Basically that option is already available in this one.

01:31:47.490 --> 01:31:50.270
Fine. So if I have to send some sort of a newsletter or if I

01:31:50.270 --> 01:31:54.610
have to send any kind of things to my user, I can just go, I

01:31:54.610 --> 01:31:58.490
can try to, you know, add all the mail ID here, quotation

01:31:58.490 --> 01:32:01.210
marks, just try to give this one, then one, two, three,

01:32:01.310 --> 01:32:03.730
four, five, six and so on. Maybe hundreds of mail ID I can

01:32:03.730 --> 01:32:06.490
try to configure and maybe I can try to even parameterize

01:32:06.490 --> 01:32:10.290
it, right? I can try to parameterize it. So maybe this, this

01:32:10.290 --> 01:32:12.310
mails are getting populated from some sort of an Excel

01:32:12.310 --> 01:32:15.590
sheet. So fine. I will read the Excel sheet because read

01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:18.910
Excel sheet is available over here. If I'll talk about

01:32:18.910 --> 01:32:22.190
Excel, right? So I can try to read anything from the Excel

01:32:22.190 --> 01:32:25.610
sheet, see, get column, convert range, this, that,

01:32:25.670 --> 01:32:28.990
everything is available, right? So let's suppose all my mail

01:32:28.990 --> 01:32:32.170
IDs are available in some Excel sheet or maybe not in Excel

01:32:32.170 --> 01:32:35.410
sheet, some CRM system, maybe not in some CRM system, maybe

01:32:35.410 --> 01:32:38.630
some databases. So I'll connect, read all the mail.

01:32:39.170 --> 01:32:41.950
Configure it, drag and drop, configure it into a sender

01:32:41.950 --> 01:32:46.730
mailer. So can I say that everything is configurable and

01:32:46.730 --> 01:32:52.490
easy peasy to do it? Yes, everyone. It's easy, right? I have

01:32:52.490 --> 01:32:57.900
to be just a little bit technical. That's it. Yeah. If mail

01:32:57.900 --> 01:33:00.320
ID is available in CRM system, maybe in SQL system, maybe

01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:04.340
into MongoDB, doesn't matter at all. It's fine. Yeah. So you

01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:10.280
call the connector, use it, do it simple. So here, right? So

01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:13.120
whatever we do in a CRU AI, same, we can do it by

01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:15.320
configuring only, right? Yeah. More than that, by the way,

01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:18.780
CRU AI, if I'll talk about a cloud interface, it's not ready

01:33:19.180 --> 01:33:23.260
for now. I would say it's in a beta phase and the kind of a

01:33:23.260 --> 01:33:27.160
node that they have given you here, I think it's not

01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:31.800
available on any other platform so far, right? So far. Okay.

01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:35.520
Fine. Now this is, this is something that we are able to

01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:38.640
test. So we are able to send a mail by the way. Right? So

01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:43.000
this is another flow, how to send a mail. Everything is

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:48.260
configurable. Now mail sender, mail sender. So second

01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:51.520
configuration, we are able to do it. Now let's go ahead and

01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:55.320
then try to create another new workflow. Yeah. Another new,

01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:57.880
like a workflow. Let's go ahead and let's try to create it.

01:33:58.140 --> 01:34:00.980
So this time what we will do, so we'll try to create

01:34:00.980 --> 01:34:05.100
something a little bit bigger. Yeah. We'll try to create

01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:08.640
something a little bit bigger over here. So what kind of a

01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:12.660
bigger thing we are going to create? So we are going to

01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:17.560
basically create our agents. So we are now going to

01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:22.380
integrate our agents. What that agent will do? Let me write

01:34:22.380 --> 01:34:29.880
it down here. So this time what I will do, uh, so we are

01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:36.710
going to create maybe a chat interface, chat interface.

01:34:37.050 --> 01:34:39.950
Yeah. Now with the help of this chat interface, by the way,

01:34:40.030 --> 01:34:40.910
with

01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:50.760
the help of this chat interface, what I will do, so I will

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:58.940
try to basically send questions, fine. I will try to send

01:34:58.940 --> 01:35:02.680
basically a questions. Now once it will receive my question,

01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:05.700
right? Once it will, one system will receive the questions.

01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:08.740
So what, what it is going to do? So maybe it is going to

01:35:08.740 --> 01:35:11.540
apply some sort of a filtration operation on top of this

01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:14.560
one. Yeah. So this filtration operation, it is going to

01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:19.520
apply now. So after applying this filtration operation, uh,

01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:21.500
let me apply

01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:30.960
filter, right?

01:35:45.630 --> 01:35:48.450
Apply some sort of a filter. Now after applying some sort of

01:35:48.450 --> 01:35:50.450
filter in terms of questions, means it will try to filter

01:35:50.450 --> 01:35:54.050
out the questions over here after applying the filters, uh,

01:35:54.210 --> 01:35:59.050
what it will do. So it will try to call technically my

01:35:59.050 --> 01:36:05.010
agent. So it is going to call my agents over here.

01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:12.080
It is going to call the agents. Now what does the meaning of

01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:15.680
an agent as per our previous understanding? So meaning of

01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:20.280
agent is very simple. So agent will be having, right?

01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:23.700
Meaning of agent is what? Meaning of agent means agent will

01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:31.800
be having a LLM access by the way, right? So agent will be

01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:38.820
having a LLM access. Yeah. Now agent will be having a kind

01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:40.920
of a memory. You can say.

01:36:43.940 --> 01:36:47.440
Yes. If I want, if I don't want, I can like a detach the

01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:51.840
memory. That's completely okay. Agent will be having a tool

01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:57.060
access. Yes. So agent will be having a tool access tool

01:36:57.060 --> 01:37:02.700
means any kind of a function access by the way. Then only we

01:37:02.700 --> 01:37:05.560
can say that. Okay, fine. So it's a technically agent. So

01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:08.600
this is what in general agent will be having.

01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:19.960
So agent will be having this access. Agent will be having

01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:24.080
memory access. And agent will be having technically a tool

01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:28.120
access, right? So whatever filter we are going to apply,

01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:30.820
right? Whatever filter we are going to apply on the

01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:33.280
questions, I'm going to send that question to my agent.

01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:36.760
Fine. I'm going to send those questions to my agent. Now

01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:39.480
what agent will, I think I'm able to create a beautiful

01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:41.960
diagram. Yeah. It's look pretty by the way.

01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:52.380
Yes. Okay. So jokes apart. Okay. So here basically we are

01:37:52.380 --> 01:37:55.380
able to, we'll try to take the question as an input from

01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:57.600
anywhere that that's okay. Maybe from Excel sheet I'm

01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:59.700
sending, maybe from a chat I'm sending, it doesn't matter.

01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:03.920
Now it will go to the agent. Now agent will be having LLM

01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:06.840
access, so it will try to understand my question, right? And

01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:09.940
eventually it is going to call a tool, some sort of a tool.

01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:13.640
Now here, so what I wanted to do, a kind of a use cases

01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:17.240
which I'm trying to solve, right? A kind of a use cases that

01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:20.740
I will ask some question. Yeah. I'll try to ask some

01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:26.700
question and it should go to Wikipedia. It can go to Google

01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:29.840
search as well. Surfer API can try to call. Maybe it can try

01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:33.160
to call my URI real time search APIs, anything, right?

01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:37.500
Anything. So basically I will try to like bring an agent and

01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:39.980
I know what is the capability of the agent because we have

01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:43.640
done a lot of like a coding there, right? So we are coming

01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:46.420
from that background. So basically it will, you know,

01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:49.720
understand my questions automatically. Memory? leave it. As

01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:51.240
you can see. As of now, I'll try to add a memory in later

01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:55.540
stage, maybe tomorrow, uh, like a demo class and it will try

01:38:55.540 --> 01:38:58.240
to access the tool, tool means. So let's suppose if I'm

01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:00.880
doing a Google search. So obviously for a Google search,

01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:03.260
Surfer API, right? So automatically it will understand that,

01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:05.740
okay, I have to do a Google search. Maybe I'm saying that,

01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:07.900
okay, fine, search everything from the Wikipedia. So I can

01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:11.100
try to attach that tool. Any number of tools, hundreds of

01:39:11.100 --> 01:39:13.300
thousands of tool or function access I can try to give.

01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:15.960
System will try to, you know, uh, you know, call those tools

01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:19.720
automatically. So whenever it is like a needed. Yeah. Uh,

01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:23.420
tool access. Fine. So here I'll try to send a question and

01:39:23.420 --> 01:39:26.880
tool access wise, uh, what, what I wanted to do is that,

01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:30.280
that, uh, okay. So try to try

01:39:32.620 --> 01:39:38.060
to search on Wiki fine. So try to search. So whenever, like

01:39:38.060 --> 01:39:41.420
this is the tool access, which I'm going to give. So tool

01:39:41.420 --> 01:39:42.780
wise, yeah.

01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:56.740
So tool access wise, I'll try to give, uh, Wikipedia tool

01:39:56.740 --> 01:40:00.720
access, right? Wikipedia tool access. LM wise. So I can try

01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:04.980
to give maybe a open AI and tropic Gemini, any of these like

01:40:04.980 --> 01:40:06.280
access I can try to give.

01:40:09.020 --> 01:40:14.120
So here what I will do, I'll try to give a GPT access, fine.

01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:17.280
Any version of GPT or Gemini and tropic, they have given you

01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:20.760
everything. So it will try to like, you know, use this LLM,

01:40:20.780 --> 01:40:23.580
it will try to use this tool, right? And then it is going to

01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:26.240
give me some sort of a return. Now what I will do with this

01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:30.100
return. So what ever return it is going to give it to me. So

01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:34.040
whatever output. Uh, this agent is going to give it to me. I

01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:42.320
will try to mail that output. So send over a, over a mail.

01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:44.520
So whatever question that you have asked, I'll try to like,

01:40:44.580 --> 01:40:47.380
you know, uh, whatever question you will ask through a chat,

01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:51.500
I will send it over the mail. So this is something that we

01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:54.700
have to design. Let's suppose this is something that we have

01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:57.720
to design. This is the flow that we have to complete. So

01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:01.320
just open up chat interface, ask a question. Agent will try

01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:05.620
to, you know, uh, come into a picture, uh, invoke some LLMs

01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:08.780
and then send the mail. So whatever like responses I will be

01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:12.620
able to get, send it over the mail. So this is something

01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:18.740
that we are supposed to design. This is beautiful, sir. To

01:41:18.740 --> 01:41:21.000
draw the diagram. Yeah, that's, I think you guys are liking

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.780
it, right? Going forward in all the classes, I'm going to

01:41:23.780 --> 01:41:27.760
use it. So, um, I have just like, uh, paid $35 for that.

01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:33.040
Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty much clean to, you know, write, uh,

01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:35.860
instead of writing over this, uh, scribbling. So I'm not

01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:39.460
going to use a scribbling now. I just left it. I'll be using

01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:43.720
like this for like, uh, every classes means not just this

01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:47.700
class in all my classes. Yeah. So that, you know, every time

01:41:47.700 --> 01:41:50.180
it will be clean, you can take a screenshot, you can put it

01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:51.600
on a social media if you want.

01:41:55.320 --> 01:42:01.760
Yeah. Okay. So now fine. Uh, it's, uh, yeah. It actually

01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:07.220
looks good. So basically it's easy to use it. So it's a very

01:42:07.220 --> 01:42:09.580
easy tool, uh, that they have created. So that's the reason

01:42:09.580 --> 01:42:13.860
I opted for this one, but it's paid now, sir. So basically I

01:42:13.860 --> 01:42:15.900
have to use it, right? You just have to like look into it.

01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:21.100
So monthly, it's, it's a monthly, they have different,

01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:23.680
different plans. Maybe you can go and check. So the plan

01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:26.500
which I have taken is like, uh, including taxes. So it was

01:42:26.500 --> 01:42:29.940
showing me something like, uh, yeah, $35 monthly plan. I

01:42:32.050 --> 01:42:34.690
have so many other different, different subscriptions. So

01:42:34.690 --> 01:42:41.050
which is pretty much required for me as a mentor. Okay. So

01:42:41.050 --> 01:42:44.050
here, uh, basically like, uh, this is something that we have

01:42:44.050 --> 01:42:46.250
like, uh, created, and this is something that we have to

01:42:46.250 --> 01:42:49.330
create even in any, and I'm using a paid version. If you

01:42:49.330 --> 01:42:52.990
will go to my setting, right. So that it can give me a

01:42:52.990 --> 01:42:55.830
unlimited execution flow because, uh, I have so many

01:42:55.830 --> 01:42:58.730
accounts and uh, if, if you'll go to all the accounts,

01:42:58.850 --> 01:43:02.250
right. I have. I have surpassed all the quotas and limits

01:43:02.250 --> 01:43:06.970
basically because, uh, before coming to a class and even

01:43:06.970 --> 01:43:10.830
when I sit ideal, so I like a, do a lot of experimentation.

01:43:11.170 --> 01:43:15.270
So a 14 days trial is not enough for me for any platform. So

01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:18.410
I have to anyhow go and, you know, take the, uh,

01:43:18.570 --> 01:43:23.990
subscription by the way. So I'm like, uh, everywhere I'm

01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:28.210
using a paid one because free, free one is not going to work

01:43:28.210 --> 01:43:31.510
for me. If you'll. If you go to my admin panel, so you will

01:43:31.510 --> 01:43:35.190
be able to see that, uh, uh, like if I'll click on this

01:43:35.190 --> 01:43:39.690
manage. So yeah, if I'll click on billing, so yeah, it's

01:43:39.690 --> 01:43:42.570
like I'm on billing.

01:43:46.100 --> 01:43:49.580
Yes. I can't use like as your mentors, I can't use the free

01:43:49.580 --> 01:43:53.700
one. Uh, and although I have like a four to five email ID,

01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:56.880
but it's still, I can't use it because I used to do a lot of

01:43:56.880 --> 01:44:00.700
experimentation then only like I will be like a smooth,

01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:05.340
right. And, uh. I can, uh, give you the explanation. If I am

01:44:05.340 --> 01:44:09.240
not doing it, if I'm not doing a lot of experimentation, how

01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:12.220
I can come to class and then like, you know, uh, teach you

01:44:12.220 --> 01:44:13.840
about something, right.

01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:19.900
And I believe we all should do it. We'll see. I have seen

01:44:19.900 --> 01:44:22.580
people that people are spending a lot on big billion days on

01:44:22.580 --> 01:44:25.440
iPhones and everything. Uh, but when it comes to, you know,

01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:29.320
spending on their learnings, uh, they hesitate a lot, right.

01:44:29.380 --> 01:44:31.480
They don't spend on learning, which, which I believe it's

01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:35.260
bad because, uh, learning can make you like enable, learning

01:44:35.260 --> 01:44:38.080
can like, you know, give you a capability by which you will

01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:40.700
be able to buy maybe a hundreds of iPhone, you will be able

01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:45.720
to buy a real happiness of your family, right. In a short

01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:48.200
term, I am not talking about the long term in just short

01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:50.560
term or short term of like four to six months itself, right.

01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:52.620
You will be in a different position with a different kind of

01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:56.500
a hike, but still I see like people hesitate a lot in terms

01:44:56.500 --> 01:45:00.340
of spending maybe like a $60, $70, $80, $100, which is a

01:45:00.340 --> 01:45:04.320
very small amount for any one of us. Uh. In terms of like

01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:07.180
taking some subscription of the platform. Yeah. See all the

01:45:07.180 --> 01:45:09.120
subscription, you will not be able to use it. That's okay.

01:45:09.140 --> 01:45:11.340
Again. Right. It's not a wastage of money. It's something

01:45:11.340 --> 01:45:14.160
called as experience. Sometime we don't like, you know, we

01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:17.840
pay for iPhone, right. Uh, we all pay for iPhone. Uh, I'm

01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:20.820
like, what it is going to give you like 20,000 rupees a mile

01:45:20.820 --> 01:45:22.740
will give you the same thing. But yeah, you are paying that

01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:25.140
much of iPhone maybe for a status showing a status that,

01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:28.480
okay, I have iPhone or maybe like, uh, for experience,

01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:32.500
right. Yeah. That much of money for experience you are, you

01:45:32.500 --> 01:45:35.800
are doing it. So you will be able to get that experience.

01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:38.100
I'm not saying that don't buy iPhone, I'm not saying that

01:45:38.100 --> 01:45:41.880
don't buy car houses or anything that you want. I simply say

01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:45.420
buy everything, right. What do you like? Whatever you have

01:45:45.420 --> 01:45:48.960
dreamed of, just go ahead and buy it. I did the same thing

01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:52.300
in my entire life, right. And so I do the same thing. So

01:45:52.300 --> 01:45:56.260
whatever I like, I buy it. But for that means before that,

01:45:56.360 --> 01:46:00.160
right. I always make sure that I'm sitting, I'm earning, I'm

01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:03.260
like, uh, you know, I'm eligible enough. I'm not buying

01:46:03.260 --> 01:46:05.760
anything on loan or maybe on a carrier or something. No, I'm

01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:09.140
eligible enough. And yeah, my family's happy. I'm able to

01:46:09.140 --> 01:46:11.160
provide everything done. So I believe if you have followed

01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:13.600
this philosophy, right, you will never fail in your life.

01:46:13.740 --> 01:46:16.580
And yes, you will be able to buy everything. I've seen many

01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:19.440
influencers saying that don't buy a house, uh, don't buy a

01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:22.240
car. It's a depreciating asset. A house. Yeah. You can, you

01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:25.920
can try to, you know, invest in SIP. I don't follow those

01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:28.740
philosophy. I simply say that if you want a house, go and

01:46:28.740 --> 01:46:34.520
buy it. Simple. If you want like a car, go and buy it. Yeah.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.860
Simple. Buy everything, whatever you want, even though if

01:46:37.860 --> 01:46:39.700
you're not going to use it, even though if it is a waste

01:46:39.700 --> 01:46:42.080
tomorrow, if you're going to throw it in a river, that

01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:46.300
that's okay. That's okay. Because we, we just have only one

01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:50.040
life, right? And we have to live it at a fuller scale. So

01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:52.860
obviously I will spend whatever make me happy. So see,

01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:57.020
buying is not about uses. It's most of the time for me, it's

01:46:57.020 --> 01:46:59.580
about happiness that, okay, I bought this. I'm happy. It's

01:46:59.580 --> 01:47:01.800
simple. Right. It's simple. But before that, like I said

01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:05.400
before that, so yes, I sit enough. I used to walk enough

01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:10.380
amount of time, uh, you know, so that I will be able to earn

01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:15.900
enough and then I can, I can try to spend. So just follow

01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:18.220
the same and believe me, you will be very, very happy person

01:47:18.220 --> 01:47:21.200
in your life. But yeah, if you, if you're not, and

01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:23.560
especially in upskilling, see, we, we all are techie, right?

01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:27.700
Obviously we, we have to like earn a bread with the help of

01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:31.920
skills. We are not politicians. We are not actor. Right. We

01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:37.320
are techie. So obviously what is going to give me a, like a

01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:39.680
money, what, what is going to bring a money for me? My

01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:43.580
skill, right? If you are actor, obviously you're acting,

01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:45.960
you're a politician. So obviously your work or something

01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:47.800
that you are going to do welfare or something that you are

01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:50.860
trying to do, right? Uh, if you're in different segment, so

01:47:50.860 --> 01:47:53.700
obviously you will be doing that. So see in every sector,

01:47:53.780 --> 01:47:55.820
everyone is walking, right? Everyone is trying to do some

01:47:55.820 --> 01:47:57.860
tasks. If you're trying to deliver something, creating some

01:47:57.860 --> 01:47:59.860
values. And then only they are able to earn something right

01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:04.560
now for you, what, what do you have to do? Obviously you

01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:07.640
have to, you know, uh, uh, like, uh, you have to get as much

01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:10.140
skill as possible, right? That, that is a super power,

01:48:10.220 --> 01:48:13.160
right? For actor, obviously they spend a lot of things, uh,

01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:16.420
they spend a lot, right? They spend a lot on themselves to

01:48:16.420 --> 01:48:19.040
make them fit, to, you know, train themselves to, you know,

01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:21.160
practice a lot of, uh, you know, dialogues and everything.

01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:24.440
And then you see something on a screen, even for a

01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:26.880
politician, they spend a lot on people, right? Then only

01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:28.720
they used to get a boat. Right? So I think we all know the

01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:33.280
story, uh, we, as a, you know, a techie, we have to spend a

01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:36.600
lot on a skills, time and money, both. And then I will learn

01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:39.280
the skills and then I will try to like, uh, get something in

01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:44.320
return. So never ever hesitate if you are hesitating, uh,

01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:48.120
like in terms of spending a rupees on us or a dollar on our

01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:55.270
skills, believe me, you are wasting your time. And maybe if

01:48:55.270 --> 01:48:58.650
you are spending those monies on something else, so always

01:48:58.650 --> 01:49:01.730
try to prioritize it as a skills. It is, it is going to give

01:49:01.730 --> 01:49:05.290
you a lot of return, return more than anything else in your

01:49:05.290 --> 01:49:10.060
life. And believe me, you will be able to buy anything. If

01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:12.740
I'm getting 250 crores, it was not all mine, by the way,

01:49:12.780 --> 01:49:15.600
there was other a stakeholder as well. Yeah. I had my own

01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:19.420
cut, but yeah. And obviously the like, uh, 250 crores used

01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:25.560
to say, I mean, uh, it's, it's been eight years since I was

01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:28.520
working eight year day

01:49:30.500 --> 01:49:34.020
and night and I still am working. So yes, if you are

01:49:34.020 --> 01:49:37.680
dedicated enough, if you're able to work that much, you can,

01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:39.940
you can do anything that you want. And yes, one more thing

01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:42.880
I've seen that, uh, people generally get jealous, right? We

01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:45.940
all have that kind of a feeling, uh, in, in, uh, inside us.

01:49:45.980 --> 01:49:48.760
So where, uh, we see someone's success and we feel jealous

01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:52.900
about it that, okay, why this person is successful. Uh, so

01:49:52.900 --> 01:49:55.420
see, you are just able to see the very last part, the

01:49:55.420 --> 01:49:59.080
success part, right? The kind of a restless night, the kind

01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:02.220
of a stress person has taken night, the kind of execution.

01:50:02.220 --> 01:50:06.300
Person has done, uh, the kind of attention headache person

01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:09.660
has taken in the past. You are not aware about it. You're

01:50:09.660 --> 01:50:12.780
just able to see the very, very, very, very last point, not

01:50:12.780 --> 01:50:17.340
even a fraction of it. Right. So, uh, I will always say

01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:21.160
that, uh, try to be happy about others, right? I literally

01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:23.580
feel happy when I'm a student, get a success when they build

01:50:23.580 --> 01:50:26.220
a startup, when they like, uh, raise some sort of a funding

01:50:26.220 --> 01:50:29.520
and when they get a new job, when they get a hike, I feel

01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:33.300
like, uh, my success in that somewhere. And then, uh, I

01:50:33.300 --> 01:50:35.600
literally feel happy about them. Right. I genuinely feel

01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:39.660
happy about them because I know that, that, yeah, uh, uh, so

01:50:39.660 --> 01:50:42.600
just, just try to, you know, uh, feel happy about others and

01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:49.570
believe me, work hard, not hard, harder. Okay. So you are

01:50:49.570 --> 01:50:52.270
saying, sir, let's create this agent. Okay. I think people

01:50:52.270 --> 01:50:55.590
are feeling bored by my lectures, this kind of like, okay,

01:50:55.770 --> 01:50:57.610
let's, let's build the agent by the way.

01:51:05.490 --> 01:51:11.050
Oh, workspace room is awesome. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So let's

01:51:11.050 --> 01:51:13.550
create this agent, the agent that we have drawn here in

01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:17.670
Razor. So what I will do, I'll try to create a chat

01:51:17.670 --> 01:51:20.310
interface first. Then I'll try to like, you know, through a

01:51:20.310 --> 01:51:22.590
chat, I'll send a question, I'll try to apply some sort of

01:51:22.590 --> 01:51:25.990
filter. I'll try to build an agent over here and then I'll

01:51:25.990 --> 01:51:30.210
try to, uh, send it, configure the mail basically. Right.

01:51:30.250 --> 01:51:33.270
This is the flow. I will try to create it quickly. So let's

01:51:33.270 --> 01:51:40.850
go. Uh, let me close all the unnecessary windows. Okay. Now

01:51:40.850 --> 01:51:41.650
sign in.

01:51:45.780 --> 01:51:50.860
So the whole story is try to spend on your upskilling time

01:51:50.860 --> 01:51:54.600
and money as much as you can. That was the whole conclusion.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:52:00.040
Okay. So I'm into a new workflow and uh, here I can name it

01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:06.420
as a agentic workflow. Fine. Okay. Now. So I'll try to

01:52:06.420 --> 01:52:09.380
follow the same thing, chat interface. Right. Okay. Bring a

01:52:09.380 --> 01:52:14.260
chat interface. So chat trigger, fine. Uh, maybe I can try

01:52:14.260 --> 01:52:18.160
to make it public, not public. That's okay. Test it. Fine.

01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:23.100
So I'll send high. So input will go here as you can see. So

01:52:23.100 --> 01:52:28.500
it is like bringing this chat now. What is next? So, uh,

01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:31.160
like a chat interface and a question. So maybe I'm sending a

01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:35.780
high as of now apply a filter. Okay. So maybe it is giving

01:52:35.780 --> 01:52:39.140
me this many things. Session ID action and chat. I don't

01:52:39.140 --> 01:52:42.020
want those things. I just want my chat. So what I will do,

01:52:42.060 --> 01:52:44.980
I'll try to apply a set filter over here. There are so many

01:52:44.980 --> 01:52:47.440
other filters as well. You will be able to find out, right?

01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:53.080
So set filter and I'll do the field mapping. So first of

01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:55.660
all, let me connect so that you can see the output and I can

01:52:55.660 --> 01:52:59.760
just drag and drop. So high. Okay. So input is basically

01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:03.520
chat input. Okay. So this is going to be the name and then

01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:10.600
this high, this high as a value. Okay. So this is the input

01:53:10.600 --> 01:53:13.780
now execute. Now what is the output? So it is not giving me

01:53:13.780 --> 01:53:17.020
a session ID action or chat, uh, chat only chat input. So

01:53:17.020 --> 01:53:19.500
I'm able to apply the filter out of those three things. I'm

01:53:19.500 --> 01:53:21.820
picking up only one with the help of this particular node.

01:53:21.980 --> 01:53:25.600
Okay. This is done. Configuration is done. Now what is next?

01:53:25.740 --> 01:53:28.740
So next we have to call the agents. Yeah. We have to call

01:53:28.740 --> 01:53:30.820
the agents. Applied filter is done. We have to call the

01:53:30.820 --> 01:53:35.160
agents. So I'll just click over here and I can try to search

01:53:35.160 --> 01:53:38.840
for agent. So here, AI agent is something. Yeah. You will be

01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:42.780
able to find out now click on this AI agent and then this is

01:53:42.780 --> 01:53:46.360
the configuration. So see, this is how your AI agent looks

01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:49.000
like by default, they're giving you three options, chat,

01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:52.120
model, memory, and tool by default, this three option, but

01:53:52.120 --> 01:53:54.640
these are not the only three options I will show you. There

01:53:54.640 --> 01:53:57.300
are other options as well, which is already available inside

01:53:57.300 --> 01:53:59.800
the agent. You just have to go and you just have to enable

01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:04.500
it. Yeah. So this is the agent agent tab by default, three

01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:07.180
options are given. You can attach a chat model. You can try

01:54:07.180 --> 01:54:10.260
to attach a memory. You can try to attach a tool as many as

01:54:10.260 --> 01:54:12.800
possible. You can try to attach even a multiple model. One

01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:15.640
is a primary model. One is a fallback model. That is

01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:19.720
possible that you can try to attach it very simple. So here

01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:23.380
to this agent, what I will do, uh, I would like to attach

01:54:23.380 --> 01:54:26.280
first of all, chat model. Yeah. I'll try to attach a chat

01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:29.300
model. Now here you will be able to find out that they have

01:54:29.300 --> 01:54:33.220
given you a configuration with the limitation. Yeah. They

01:54:33.220 --> 01:54:35.480
have given you a configuration with the limitation. So

01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:37.980
basically they have given you all the features. They have

01:54:37.980 --> 01:54:40.320
given you a famous platform integration only, and they have

01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:42.680
not given you a customer. If you have to do a customer means

01:54:42.680 --> 01:54:45.680
URI, if you have to call as a chat model inside the agent,

01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:49.800
then you have to call maybe via a web hook or else maybe

01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:53.480
just remove the agent part. The inbuilt agent part from

01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:57.520
here, just remove this node and the way we were building a

01:54:57.520 --> 01:55:00.600
agent in crew AI or in any other places, maybe a language

01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:03.320
and maybe a llama indexes, maybe land graph in the exact

01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:07.100
same way. Build it. It means a step by step. Attach a

01:55:07.100 --> 01:55:10.460
function. Build it. Build a agent. Call URI API because we

01:55:10.460 --> 01:55:13.520
know how to call the URI API, right? So here I will be using

01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:17.220
a open AI chat model. I have already like a created a key

01:55:17.220 --> 01:55:20.980
for that. So maybe I can share this key. So this key will be

01:55:20.980 --> 01:55:24.500
active during this live classes. So this is a open API key

01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:28.100
guys. Just keep it. So here, first of all, try to attach a

01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:32.840
chat model and I will try to attach what? So first of all, I

01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:36.220
can try to create a credential click on create a new

01:55:36.220 --> 01:55:39.440
credential. Yeah. It is going to ask you for the API key. So

01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:41.880
API key, which I have painted to you. So just paste it. So

01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:47.000
now save. So open API key, open API key. I have already

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:51.100
saved. Yeah. Now from the list, you can try to select any of

01:55:51.100 --> 01:55:53.240
this model. It will give you all the model which is

01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:55.940
available in my account. The key that you are using some of

01:55:55.940 --> 01:55:59.740
these models is a fine tuned model by me, by the way. Yeah.

01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:03.300
So in my account, whatever models are available, it is going

01:56:03.300 --> 01:56:05.600
to show you all the models. So every model by default, you

01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:08.720
will be able to access. And my custom model, which I have

01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:11.880
trained, uh, or I have fine tuned, even that you will be

01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:14.540
able to find out. So see this FT, FT, FT, right? FT means

01:56:14.540 --> 01:56:18.460
fine tuned model by me. So let's suppose I'm using a GPT 4.1

01:56:18.460 --> 01:56:22.860
mini. Okay. That's cool. So this is the model and open AI

01:56:22.860 --> 01:56:25.740
account. So now it will be able to get a chat GPT by

01:56:25.740 --> 01:56:29.540
default. Yeah. Chat GPT by default. This is the only thing.

01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:33.000
So now model is done. Now it is having a open AI chat model

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:36.460
access. Okay. It is having open AI chat model access. Fine.

01:56:37.180 --> 01:56:40.020
So tool wise, right? So what is the requirement that we

01:56:40.020 --> 01:56:42.120
have? So whenever I'm going to ask a question, it should

01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:45.460
access the tool Wikipedia tool. So LLM access is provided.

01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:48.860
Now it should call the Wikipedia tool by the way. So okay.

01:56:48.980 --> 01:56:53.200
Wikipedia tool. So click and then try to search on Wiki. So

01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:56.180
search in Wikipedia. This is available over here. So click

01:56:56.180 --> 01:57:00.980
and bring it fine. So this is, this is just like a kind of a

01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:02.740
function. You don't have to do any kind of a configuration

01:57:02.740 --> 01:57:05.800
by default. It is configured. So this node doesn't have any

01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:09.160
other parameter. Close it. So now Wikipedia tool I'm able to

01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:11.560
attach. If I would like to attach maybe a server API, I can

01:57:11.560 --> 01:57:16.260
click server for a Google search. So server. Yeah. Server

01:57:16.260 --> 01:57:19.340
API, Google search. See it's available. I can try to attach

01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:23.460
even second tool as well. So here we have a Wikipedia tool.

01:57:23.540 --> 01:57:25.880
I have attached memory. I have not, I'm not attaching as of

01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:29.100
now. So LLM access and Wikipedia tool access is given to it.

01:57:29.260 --> 01:57:33.460
As you can see as per this diagram, right? Okay. Now let me

01:57:33.460 --> 01:57:36.540
do the agent configuration by the way. Okay. So what is the

01:57:36.540 --> 01:57:40.120
agent configuration? So agent configuration wise, I have to

01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:43.700
set my input. I have to set my system prompt user prompt.

01:57:43.860 --> 01:57:46.900
Yeah. Because agent should know, right? What is the input

01:57:46.900 --> 01:57:49.500
which is coming? So agent should know that what is the

01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:52.160
input? So input is coming from where input is coming from

01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:55.840
this, this one, right? So this will go as an input into my

01:57:55.840 --> 01:57:58.600
agent. So I have to configure that. So let's click on this

01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:03.360
agent. Let's try to configure it. So here a user will get

01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:07.500
what? So user. So basically this one, I can just drag and

01:58:07.500 --> 01:58:11.820
drop, right? So just on that chat input. So hi user will get

01:58:11.820 --> 01:58:16.160
this one. Now I can try to basically add over here a system

01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:20.120
message. So I can, I can say that, that basically you are a

01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:24.980
helpful assistance. Uh, whatever, whatever

01:58:26.740 --> 01:58:31.000
question will be asked,

01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:42.860
do one thing, go to Wikipedia. Yeah. And search for an

01:58:42.860 --> 01:58:50.470
answer and summarize it with all the bullet points with all

01:58:50.470 --> 01:59:00.950
the bullet points and give me a final output. Give me the

01:59:00.950 --> 01:59:14.360
final output. Uh, output should not be more than in, in 200

01:59:14.360 --> 01:59:19.020
words. Yeah. So this is the system prompt. The way we try to

01:59:19.020 --> 01:59:21.920
pass a prompt to any agent, even when we create it, right?

01:59:21.980 --> 01:59:25.660
So you can try to give as lengthy as possible. There is no

01:59:25.660 --> 01:59:28.800
restriction on top of this one, right? So you can try to,

01:59:28.800 --> 01:59:31.740
you know, add as many lengthy prompt as possible. So just

01:59:31.740 --> 01:59:34.720
try to write some sort of a system prompt over here so that

01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:37.060
it will be able to understand that what it is supposed to

01:59:37.060 --> 01:59:40.720
do, right? So user message wise or user prompt wise, user

01:59:40.720 --> 01:59:44.300
prompt wise, question will come over here. Now. Now how to

01:59:44.300 --> 01:59:47.080
act and what to do on this question. So that is something

01:59:47.080 --> 01:59:50.400
which I'm trying to give instruction in a NLP manner, right?

01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:53.720
In my LLM manner. So I'm trying to give that one into this

01:59:53.720 --> 01:59:58.240
one. Yeah. This one. So now it will take like a high, it

01:59:58.240 --> 02:00:00.800
will go on search on Wikipedia. Let's make the cute, the

02:00:00.800 --> 02:00:03.900
step that is nothing to search on Wikipedia. So here output

02:00:03.900 --> 02:00:06.780
is hello, I can assist you today. If you have any question

02:00:06.780 --> 02:00:09.740
or need information, feel free to ask. So see, I have not

02:00:09.740 --> 02:00:12.580
done anything, right? This is my agent. It's a very smart

02:00:12.580 --> 02:00:16.380
agent, right? It is taking high, right? It is taking high

02:00:16.380 --> 02:00:20.380
and it can understand easily that, okay, there is basically

02:00:20.380 --> 02:00:24.420
no, uh, I would say, so there is basically no questions. So

02:00:24.420 --> 02:00:26.080
it is asking you that, okay, fine. So please ask the

02:00:26.080 --> 02:00:30.700
question. Yes, everyone. Yeah. So please ask the question

02:00:30.700 --> 02:00:33.800
and technically it is able to access what this chat model,

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:37.900
as you can see, it's been tested. Now if I'm going to say

02:00:37.900 --> 02:00:48.020
that, okay, who is, uh, Donald. Donald. Tell me about Donald

02:00:48.020 --> 02:00:52.460
Trump. I'm fine. So this is the question now see it is, it

02:00:52.460 --> 02:00:55.140
is executing my Wikipedia, falling back to chat model,

02:00:55.360 --> 02:00:58.520
summarizing it, my agent has been caught. So you will be

02:00:58.520 --> 02:01:00.560
able to see that flow, right? You will be able to see the

02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:03.080
floor. And sure, you will be able to see the floor once

02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:06.180
again. So when you have passed something that you're a agent

02:01:06.180 --> 02:01:08.860
in a log itself, when you have passed so basically, this is

02:01:08.860 --> 02:01:11.980
a how the flow is doing to the agent then going to the chat

02:01:11.980 --> 02:01:14.440
model. Right? Right. It is trying to understand your

02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:17.600
questions with the help of chat model. Then it is able to

02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:19.460
understand that, okay, fine. You have to go to the Wikipedia

02:01:19.460 --> 02:01:22.480
and search something for that. And then again, whatever data

02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:25.200
which it is trying to pull from the Wikipedia as per the

02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:28.060
instruction that give me everything into 200 words only, I'd

02:01:28.060 --> 02:01:30.940
see only in 200 words, right? Uh, I'm looking for some

02:01:30.940 --> 02:01:33.780
answer. So it is trying to send those data to the again,

02:01:33.860 --> 02:01:36.620
chat model. So it is, you can see that it has been called

02:01:36.620 --> 02:01:40.320
two times, yeah, two times and suck complete exact flow.

02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:43.820
What is happening inside the agent, how my agent is behaving

02:01:43.820 --> 02:01:47.380
in this call, everything you will be able to see. So what

02:01:47.380 --> 02:01:50.200
happened here? What happened here? What happened here?

02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:53.220
Right. So everything you will be able to see that, okay, it

02:01:53.220 --> 02:01:55.440
is giving me like answer in a bullet points. This is what I

02:01:55.440 --> 02:01:58.020
have mentioned somewhere in my system prompt, right? So

02:01:58.020 --> 02:02:04.060
every call now, if I'm going to ask, tell me about, uh,

02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:10.400
about Elon Musk. Yeah. So now see the call, right? So one by

02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:13.580
one, it's like moving and calling and then like it is, it is

02:02:13.580 --> 02:02:16.620
able to give me the final bullet point as an output as a, as

02:02:16.620 --> 02:02:19.920
a part of this final one, right? So now if I'm going to show

02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:23.880
you, so this is our output of the agent and yeah, it is, it

02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:26.100
is behaving in that same manner. I have given 200 words,

02:02:26.220 --> 02:02:28.760
right? So I believe it's like giving me all the responses in

02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:33.400
200 words, right? So by calling my, uh, like a tools, which

02:02:33.400 --> 02:02:36.260
is nothing but a Wikipedia function and by calling this one.

02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:39.580
Now whatever answer, which I have received, right? Whatever

02:02:39.580 --> 02:02:42.640
answer, which I have received here, what I'm supposed to do,

02:02:42.700 --> 02:02:45.640
I have to send it over the mail. Yeah. There was a flow,

02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:47.920
right? I have to send it over the mail. So whatever answer,

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.900
which I have received, do one thing, send over the mail. So

02:02:50.900 --> 02:02:53.420
this is the output which I have received. That's cool. Now

02:02:53.420 --> 02:02:57.720
I'll try to call one more node, Gmail, right? Gmail. And

02:02:57.720 --> 02:03:01.360
then maybe I can even access Gmail as a tool. Let's let's

02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:04.520
suppose if agent, uh, you have, you are giving a access of

02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:06.980
your Gmail so it can fetch your Gmail message as well. So

02:03:06.980 --> 02:03:09.520
Gmail has a tool also. I can try to use. Gmail has a

02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:11.740
separate independent node as tool means as a function,

02:03:11.940 --> 02:03:15.000
right? So which tool, which will be attached to the agent,

02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:18.700
which only agent can access. Yeah. Or maybe I can, I can try

02:03:18.700 --> 02:03:23.340
to like a send a message Gmail. We have already used it. So

02:03:23.340 --> 02:03:25.640
attach the Gmail account or if you have already attached it,

02:03:25.700 --> 02:03:29.780
so it will be available as a credential, a message. So yeah,

02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:33.500
option send it to, so send it to like a Sudhanshu at the

02:03:33.500 --> 02:03:38.100
rate you're on dot one. Yeah. Subject. Subject. Maybe for

02:03:38.100 --> 02:03:43.580
now I'm giving dummy high body high fine. Now execute a

02:03:43.580 --> 02:03:46.400
step. So fine. It is, it is going to like, uh, give me the

02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:50.520
sense. So this is tested. Now just try to attach it. Yeah.

02:03:50.700 --> 02:03:54.640
Attach it. Run it once again so that my data will be

02:03:54.640 --> 02:03:59.300
available. Yeah. So now I have run it, I have connected it,

02:03:59.320 --> 02:04:03.880
connected like agent to my mail. So it is having an input as

02:04:03.880 --> 02:04:07.680
an output as an input. Right. So here, uh, basically, uh,

02:04:07.860 --> 02:04:10.040
like this message, let

02:04:12.150 --> 02:04:16.770
me map it. Yeah. So instead of sending high, it will send

02:04:16.770 --> 02:04:20.190
what the output that which I received from the previous one

02:04:20.190 --> 02:04:22.610
means from your agent, the previous note is basically

02:04:22.610 --> 02:04:25.510
nothing but it was an agent, right? So whatever message we

02:04:25.510 --> 02:04:27.590
had received from the previous one, it should send as a

02:04:27.590 --> 02:04:30.730
input and the subject, maybe I can write it as a wiki

02:04:30.730 --> 02:04:35.190
search. If I have to parametrize something, I can try to

02:04:35.190 --> 02:04:38.390
parametrize something. Maybe. I can send the question as an

02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:41.810
input, uh, or I can send the question as well. So it field,

02:04:42.050 --> 02:04:46.230
maybe I can try to map the question as a input. So you will

02:04:46.230 --> 02:04:49.270
be able to see subject as a question from a separate node

02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:51.890
from which node from previous to previous node, which was

02:04:51.890 --> 02:04:54.810
the agent field, right? So whatever question is coming that,

02:04:54.850 --> 02:04:57.550
that I'm sending as a subject and whatever answer is coming

02:04:57.550 --> 02:05:00.870
from the agent that I'm sending as a message over here. So I

02:05:00.870 --> 02:05:02.970
have just like configured it over here, drag and drop,

02:05:03.050 --> 02:05:06.150
right? So I can select like any node, any previous mode from

02:05:06.150 --> 02:05:08.470
here. Drag and drop. Drag and drop. Input field. And I can

02:05:08.470 --> 02:05:13.130
configure it. Okay. So as a STL, now execute the steps,

02:05:13.310 --> 02:05:19.430
okay? So executed the steps and it has been tested fine

02:05:26.690 --> 02:05:32.130
subject, uh, edit field high. So again,

02:05:50.780 --> 02:05:53.240
something like that, like, okay, let's keep it in this way.

02:05:53.560 --> 02:06:00.160
Fine. Now let me ask a question. Tell me about Elon Musk.

02:06:05.500 --> 02:06:09.720
So now everything is running. Right? Everything is running

02:06:09.720 --> 02:06:13.260
and looks like it has sent a mail to me and here I can see

02:06:13.260 --> 02:06:18.180
the log. So in my log, I'm able to see everything. Now if I

02:06:18.180 --> 02:06:21.760
will go and check my mail, see just zero minute ago, 1115,

02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:25.260
which is now, can I say I'm able to receive the subject,

02:06:25.420 --> 02:06:30.240
subject as a question? Yes guys. Subject as a question. I'm

02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:33.420
able to receive. And can I say that I'm able to receive even

02:06:33.420 --> 02:06:39.560
the output as an answer in my mail body? Yeah. So this, this

02:06:39.560 --> 02:06:43.500
entire flow is done. Yeah. So I'm able to parameterize

02:06:43.500 --> 02:06:45.900
everything just by like doing a drag and drop, drag and

02:06:45.900 --> 02:06:50.140
drop. Fine. So this is, again, I'm able to like, uh, create

02:06:50.140 --> 02:06:53.220
it and I'm able to send our mail, whatever I'm searching and

02:06:53.220 --> 02:06:56.620
I'm able to successfully use our agent in between, right?

02:06:57.140 --> 02:07:02.100
Successfully I'm able to use our agent in between. So do we

02:07:02.100 --> 02:07:04.360
have a DV hook as well? Yes. Yes. We have everything.

02:07:04.620 --> 02:07:07.220
Everything is literally everything. All the tools they have

02:07:07.220 --> 02:07:09.900
created, this is one of the beautiful platform you will be

02:07:09.900 --> 02:07:11.800
able to find out why

02:07:15.130 --> 02:07:19.310
here Wikipedia, although we are using elements, I'm simply

02:07:19.310 --> 02:07:23.630
saying that see LLMs can generate the output. LLMs can do

02:07:23.630 --> 02:07:27.710
the calculation, but we are giving a special function access

02:07:27.710 --> 02:07:31.170
that don't give me an output from your knowledge. Give me an

02:07:31.170 --> 02:07:34.390
output from the Wikipedia. For example. Let's suppose. Uh.

02:07:34.390 --> 02:07:39.650
Uh, basically my model has been trained till yesterday. I

02:07:39.650 --> 02:07:44.130
became famous today, right? Now someone has published a

02:07:44.130 --> 02:07:48.410
Wikipedia page for me today. You're more, do you think that

02:07:48.410 --> 02:07:50.950
your model will be able to give a response? Your LLM will be

02:07:50.950 --> 02:07:59.270
able to give a response about me. No, right? Yes. This is

02:07:59.270 --> 02:08:04.150
where we are using tool. So my model here. We'll understand

02:08:04.150 --> 02:08:07.410
my question. It will just summarize. This LLM is doing what?

02:08:07.490 --> 02:08:09.730
Just a summarization. It is not generating any kind of it.

02:08:09.810 --> 02:08:12.270
Just doing a summary. It means final output as per the

02:08:12.270 --> 02:08:15.150
system from which I have given data, which I'm trying to

02:08:15.150 --> 02:08:17.530
face that I'm fetching from a Wikipedia. This is where I

02:08:17.530 --> 02:08:19.610
believe tools comes into a picture, right? We have done

02:08:19.610 --> 02:08:22.410
multiple, like we have used our tool multiple times. That's

02:08:22.410 --> 02:08:25.710
a use of tool, right? Let's suppose if I have to access your

02:08:25.710 --> 02:08:29.270
Gmail and read all the mails from last 10 days and then give

02:08:29.270 --> 02:08:31.850
a, uh, like, you know, reply to all of these mail by using,

02:08:31.850 --> 02:08:35.210
uh, uh, like, you're like a chat model. So basically your

02:08:35.210 --> 02:08:37.810
LLMs will not be having access directly, right? You have to

02:08:37.810 --> 02:08:42.070
call a function which will, you know, call your mail, uh,

02:08:42.190 --> 02:08:44.630
which will try to fetch all of your mail and which will

02:08:44.630 --> 02:08:50.310
summarize it and give a response. Yeah. Tool is optional.

02:08:50.470 --> 02:08:53.110
Yes. Tool is optional. You can remove it. That's, that's

02:08:53.110 --> 02:08:55.910
okay. You can remove the tool and say that. Okay, fine. So

02:08:55.910 --> 02:09:00.170
generate from a LLM directly. What is a memory? So I believe

02:09:00.170 --> 02:09:02.790
when I was talking about a line chain land graph, and then

02:09:02.790 --> 02:09:05.530
even a crew AI, I talked about. A buffer memory. I talked

02:09:05.530 --> 02:09:08.090
about our window memory. I talked about a summary memory.

02:09:08.930 --> 02:09:11.750
This is that memory. So I can try to attach a node over here

02:09:11.750 --> 02:09:14.690
and I can try to give a memory so that whenever I'm doing a

02:09:14.690 --> 02:09:17.350
chat or whenever my system is trying to give or produce some

02:09:17.350 --> 02:09:20.570
sort of responses, it can refer to the memory. Maybe from a

02:09:20.570 --> 02:09:23.030
memory summary, maybe from a windows memory, maybe from a,

02:09:23.030 --> 02:09:26.110
this one. So just like a programming, right? Whatever we

02:09:26.110 --> 02:09:28.910
have done in a programming and whatever we have learned over

02:09:28.910 --> 02:09:35.050
there, it's not at all a different and not even a. Bit, not

02:09:35.050 --> 02:09:38.330
even an inch of a differences. You will be able to find out

02:09:38.330 --> 02:09:42.110
when you are creating an agent over here in theory or even

02:09:42.110 --> 02:09:42.650
in practical.

02:09:46.160 --> 02:09:49.520
Yeah. How do you connect any external services or tools? See

02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:53.960
I have already connected with the HTTP request, right? Yuri,

02:09:53.960 --> 02:09:56.540
can I, so that, can I say that the very first example, which

02:09:56.540 --> 02:09:58.400
I have shown you, basically I have connected through the

02:09:58.400 --> 02:10:01.740
HTTP request. Yeah. So anything and everything is available

02:10:01.740 --> 02:10:05.520
over the HTTP. I can connect it. Anything. Anything and

02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:09.400
everything, if available as a web hook, I can call it. Yeah.

02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:11.100
That's the reason the very first example, which I have shown

02:10:11.100 --> 02:10:13.740
you, that was a Yuri. Yuri was a complete external system.

02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:16.940
Right. And yeah, so everything will be available as a rest

02:10:16.940 --> 02:10:20.220
API. So if it is available, just call it anything from any

02:10:20.220 --> 02:10:23.520
server. So let's suppose some tool is not given to you.

02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:26.180
Some, you know, some, some nodes are not given to you, but

02:10:26.180 --> 02:10:28.480
still I have to call that node. If it's still, I have to,

02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:30.580
you know, build that kind of a node. This will have to fetch

02:10:30.580 --> 02:10:34.260
the responses maybe from my custom one, right? A complete

02:10:34.260 --> 02:10:38.040
custom one. Not an issue. I can, I can just, you know, call

02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:40.760
the HTTP request. I can call as a web hook. I will be able

02:10:40.760 --> 02:10:45.240
to do it as an API because once, if you're able to call the

02:10:45.240 --> 02:10:47.860
API, it simply means that you can call the entire world

02:10:47.860 --> 02:10:52.760
basically, right? This is the meaning of the API. So hope

02:10:52.760 --> 02:10:59.020
you have liked it. Right guys. Yeah. This entire session and

02:10:59.020 --> 02:11:01.680
hope all of you are able to do a demo. I will just like

02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:10.080
upload this. Yeah. This is a JSON material so that, you

02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:14.240
know, you can, you can try to follow along. And for today,

02:11:14.380 --> 02:11:17.860
just try to play, just try to play with it, right? Because

02:11:17.860 --> 02:11:20.340
if you are going to play with it by creating a small, small

02:11:20.340 --> 02:11:23.460
application, maybe create some site of sort of Excel sheet,

02:11:23.620 --> 02:11:26.780
put some data into it, maybe try to read some sort of a PDF,

02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:29.700
maybe some word document, anything that you do with the

02:11:29.700 --> 02:11:32.960
programming, just, just play with that. Right. Over here.

02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:35.560
Maybe try to create some scheduled trigger. So in every one

02:11:35.560 --> 02:11:39.140
minute it will keep on fighting itself. And then try to make

02:11:39.140 --> 02:11:42.000
it active. Right. See if I'm, so this is how I can

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:43.900
productionize it. Just make it active and it's a

02:11:43.900 --> 02:11:47.040
productionize, right? Just try to make it active, test each

02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:49.720
and everything, test your log and initially you will face a

02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:52.940
lot of problems, right? Maybe in terms of configuration, it

02:11:52.940 --> 02:11:55.820
will not be able to like give you the correct result. But

02:11:55.820 --> 02:11:59.620
believe me, after spending four to five hour of time, just

02:11:59.620 --> 02:12:03.780
four to five hour quality time, right? Right. And if you

02:12:03.780 --> 02:12:06.480
understand programming, well and good, it will be very easy

02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:10.080
for you. Right. It will be very, very easy for you and you

02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:13.360
can solve like anything. So tomorrow what I will do, I'll

02:12:13.360 --> 02:12:17.320
try to create a couple of more workflow with the agenting

02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:19.840
workflow. So I will be using AI agent. I will try to add

02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:22.580
some sort of a memories over there. I will try to give an

02:12:22.580 --> 02:12:25.360
access of couple of more tools over there. So a little bit

02:12:25.360 --> 02:12:28.400
bigger flow we are going to create tomorrow as we are able

02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:32.660
to complete a basic today. And then if time allows. Okay.

02:12:32.660 --> 02:12:35.880
And then I'll try to show you even autogen. Autogen provide

02:12:35.880 --> 02:12:39.980
you two approaches, one with the code and one with the UI

02:12:39.980 --> 02:12:42.600
interface, similar kind of a UI interface. But believe me,

02:12:42.700 --> 02:12:46.700
after like, you know, looking at any 10, you will not enjoy

02:12:46.700 --> 02:12:54.060
this autogen UI by the way. Code might be, but yeah, so

02:12:54.060 --> 02:12:56.700
autogen UI interface, you are not going to enjoy at all. You

02:12:56.700 --> 02:12:59.240
will say that, okay, I'll not use it. I'll just use any 10.

02:12:59.560 --> 02:13:03.640
This is how this. Okay. Yeah. I'm going to cover autogen

02:13:03.640 --> 02:13:06.780
tomorrow by the way. So autogen provide you two things,

02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:08.900
let's just like a crew AI, right? Even crew provide you two

02:13:08.900 --> 02:13:12.020
things, one by the code, one by a UI interface, which is in

02:13:12.020 --> 02:13:15.840
a beta mode in autogen. So again, like you can try to build

02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:17.640
everything with the code and you can try to build everything

02:13:17.640 --> 02:13:22.420
with the UI both. What are the other competitors of N810? So

02:13:22.420 --> 02:13:26.960
far none for N810. The way they have built this entire

02:13:26.960 --> 02:13:32.960
platform. It's literally awesome. Autogen is free. It's

02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:35.600
basically local. So you just do a pip install autogen and

02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:42.200
your UI will pop up in your local and then you do it. I'll

02:13:42.200 --> 02:13:45.060
show you tomorrow. It's like a two minute to, you know, um,

02:13:45.240 --> 02:13:48.840
like, uh, you know, uh, make autogen UI available in your

02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:51.800
system. Just it takes two minutes, not even two minutes, 30

02:13:51.800 --> 02:13:56.620
seconds, I would say, I'll show it to you, but yeah, you

02:13:56.620 --> 02:13:59.000
will not love it. Believe me after looking at N810, yeah,

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:02.700
before N810, if I would have shown you autogen, then you

02:14:02.700 --> 02:14:06.400
will say, okay, fine. Wow. Autogen is good. Uh, but after

02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:09.380
showing N810, if I'll show you like a autogen, then you will

02:14:09.380 --> 02:14:09.980
not like it.

02:14:13.580 --> 02:14:16.660
I'm using URI API in agent. You can't use it by the way. You

02:14:16.660 --> 02:14:19.800
have to call it as a webhook. So just like that's a little

02:14:19.800 --> 02:14:23.000
bit of lengthy process. Just forget about the agent, the way

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.060
you try to create it programmatically, then try to create

02:14:25.060 --> 02:14:31.820
the agent, then it will work. Yeah. In case of URI, because

02:14:31.820 --> 02:14:34.680
you have to call the call via the HTTP request, HTTP

02:14:34.680 --> 02:14:40.400
request. Okay. So this is it guys. This is all about my

02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:43.460
today's class. Hope all of you have enjoyed it. Like I said,

02:14:43.500 --> 02:14:47.560
today I'm going to start one more batch, basically like a AI

02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:50.380
ML where I'm going to discuss everything from the scratch.

02:14:50.580 --> 02:14:52.980
So if you are interested, if someone is interested, maybe

02:14:52.980 --> 02:14:56.300
you can join this AI ML master where I'm going to discuss

02:14:56.300 --> 02:14:58.540
everything from the scratch, starting from the Python. Those

02:14:58.540 --> 02:15:00.420
who are weak in Python, those who would like to do some sort

02:15:00.420 --> 02:15:04.000
of a revision of Python stats ML because core is core. Core

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.380
is always important. ABCD is always important. And this is

02:15:06.380 --> 02:15:13.940
the ABCD of any like AI stuff. So yeah. And even we have

02:15:13.940 --> 02:15:15.760
created the WhatsApp group, so you can go and you can try to

02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:18.220
check the WhatsApp group. So I think we all know the drill,

02:15:18.340 --> 02:15:21.880
right? That we create a WhatsApp group for everything. Yeah.

02:15:24.140 --> 02:15:27.240
If we add a multiple tool, then we can define the sequence

02:15:27.240 --> 02:15:30.680
of the tool or will they be simultaneous. Just tell me one

02:15:30.680 --> 02:15:35.500
thing, right? Anuragha. When we create tools, when we give

02:15:35.500 --> 02:15:37.500
access to a tool in an agent while doing a program,

02:15:37.500 --> 02:15:42.680
programming in anywhere, do we define our sequences? Yeah.

02:15:43.020 --> 02:15:43.860
Do we define sequences?

02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:51.680
What is the meaning of an agent? Right? What is the meaning

02:15:51.680 --> 02:15:54.100
of an agent? Can I say that agent is nothing but a smart

02:15:54.100 --> 02:15:56.720
person, so which can try to pick and choose a tool

02:15:56.720 --> 02:16:00.380
automatically? Yeah. Same thing as we'll do. We don't define

02:16:00.380 --> 02:16:02.660
the sequences over here. Attach thousands of tools, it will

02:16:02.660 --> 02:16:06.640
pick automatically. Like I said, theory has not changed,

02:16:06.840 --> 02:16:11.180
neither the practical. Whatever we have learned so far, bit

02:16:11.180 --> 02:16:16.540
by bit, inch by inch, everything is true even here. Simple.

02:16:17.420 --> 02:16:20.020
Nothing has changed me little, nothing has changed. Not even

02:16:20.020 --> 02:16:23.240
a single concept of fundamentals, even when you are using a

02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:30.560
N8N. It's exact same means exact same. Okay, fine guys. This

02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:35.120
is it from today's class. Can you share the N8N JSON file?

02:16:35.260 --> 02:16:38.420
Yeah. I'll just do it in a, like a dashboard. Yeah. I'll

02:16:38.420 --> 02:16:41.760
just share all the N8N file inside your dashboard. And from

02:16:41.760 --> 02:16:45.180
there you can download it. So fine. Those who have any kind

02:16:45.180 --> 02:16:46.820
of a question, please be here. Those who don't have a

02:16:46.820 --> 02:16:50.860
question, you can just leave it and yeah, raise a hand. If

02:16:50.860 --> 02:16:53.120
you have like any kind of a question, I'll just try to

02:16:53.120 --> 02:16:56.480
answer one by one to all of your question.

02:17:03.060 --> 02:17:05.520
Okay. So Uday

02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:10.060
go ahead, Naresh go ahead, Mukesh go ahead. Yeah. All three.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:16.580
Hi sir. Yeah. I can hear you. Yeah, I can hear you. Alright

02:17:16.580 --> 02:17:22.560
now sir. Actually, we have some questions. We came up with

02:17:22.560 --> 02:17:24.320
different different indexes in different different indexes.

02:17:24.920 --> 02:17:28.540
We brought out the document from Dax. You are there in this

02:17:28.540 --> 02:17:32.840
challenge. If you have two three, the document is the same.

02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:37.120
In the Bug, let's say whatever database we are using, the

02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:41.720
result is wrong. So if the whole LLM flow and everything in

02:17:41.720 --> 02:17:43.520
the pipeline breaks, the client can be a failure. will

02:17:43.520 --> 02:17:49.580
always they don't know that we are failing there so we were

02:17:49.580 --> 02:17:52.260
thinking that there first of all through prompt

02:17:52.260 --> 02:17:57.540
classification that query in this index but I was thinking

02:17:57.540 --> 02:18:01.960
that why not create an agent flow there that user query

02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:06.960
agent let's say I have four indexes somewhere finance

02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:10.820
somewhere medical somewhere there are three four indexes in

02:18:10.820 --> 02:18:17.940
our database so there agent tell that this query we should

02:18:17.940 --> 02:18:24.880
query in this index so this means you can why not agent will

02:18:24.880 --> 02:18:28.260
classify match your classification your number of classes

02:18:28.260 --> 02:18:31.800
that is the first approach second approach is to manage meta

02:18:31.800 --> 02:18:35.420
data generally why call agent here because unnecessary

02:18:35.420 --> 02:18:39.040
overhead will come it is better that you maintain meta well

02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:42.860
that this data classification was this this is from this

02:18:42.860 --> 02:18:45.400
data document its chunk which is that is basically part of

02:18:45.400 --> 02:18:48.960
this document you can also do meta management generally we

02:18:48.960 --> 02:18:54.420
do meta management we can do it better meta management means

02:18:54.420 --> 02:18:58.400
write it in prompt no no no not in prompt whatever data you

02:18:58.400 --> 02:19:01.600
are inserting in your db whatever data you are inserting in

02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:04.820
terms of embedding so you already have option to insert that

02:19:04.820 --> 02:19:11.860
data also okay in metadata but what what will go in it? like

02:19:11.860 --> 02:19:14.840
content in metadata whatever beta data basically it's

02:19:14.840 --> 02:19:17.700
nothing but simply a key value pair so whatever meta schema

02:19:17.700 --> 02:19:20.220
you will make it will go with it for example we say here

02:19:20.220 --> 02:19:23.120
that no we are storing a data its id will go then id which

02:19:23.120 --> 02:19:25.180
is some numbers or some has that we will generate and send

02:19:25.180 --> 02:19:28.240
it then you will say that no the author's name will also go

02:19:28.240 --> 02:19:30.520
in it let's suppose that you have built it or the author's

02:19:30.520 --> 02:19:34.020
name as a document from which the source is coming okay that

02:19:34.020 --> 02:19:36.480
is also available in it so it will go then in page number

02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:38.680
you will also say that we picked this from this page so it

02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:40.860
will also go here so whatever you want you can just

02:19:40.860 --> 02:19:43.520
configure it as per your use cases and then when it will go

02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:46.220
on search then you also put a meta filter there directly

02:19:46.220 --> 02:19:48.880
like instead of doing a similarity search with the embedding

02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:51.220
first go for the meta filter and then do the embedding

02:19:51.220 --> 02:19:54.360
search that the data matches with that as much as possible

02:19:54.360 --> 02:20:00.040
and then match it from that okay okay means the document

02:20:00.040 --> 02:20:04.200
sources you are talking about like meta means beta means

02:20:04.200 --> 02:20:07.260
data of data simple definition wise right and then you can

02:20:07.260 --> 02:20:09.640
configure meta in your own way means you decide the key

02:20:09.640 --> 02:20:11.140
value pair you decide the key value pair you can do now in

02:20:11.140 --> 02:20:16.680
this in this like if there is a pdf in azure blob and we run

02:20:16.680 --> 02:20:19.700
an indexing an indexer pipeline which indexes the entire

02:20:19.700 --> 02:20:25.660
data so in this to add meta data then code okay okay I think

02:20:25.660 --> 02:20:30.900
I got I got we can do this in the indexing pipeline we can

02:20:30.900 --> 02:20:34.860
do some meta data so basically what will happen that you are

02:20:34.860 --> 02:20:37.060
going on key value search instead of going ahead with the

02:20:37.060 --> 02:20:38.460
whole document search you are going on key value search

02:20:38.460 --> 02:20:43.220
which will be less costly right right right we can do this

02:20:43.220 --> 02:20:48.460
but the agent one once agent one means in agent one it will

02:20:48.460 --> 02:20:51.540
be like costly operation okay just as your data will

02:20:51.540 --> 02:20:54.520
increase it will be like become a very costly operation see

02:20:54.520 --> 02:20:57.380
what agent is doing agent is just something which is going

02:20:57.380 --> 02:21:00.540
to understand your language right right search will hit on

02:21:00.540 --> 02:21:05.700
the whole data right yes what you have to optimize it is not

02:21:05.700 --> 02:21:08.040
like you will bring accurate data let's suppose you have 1

02:21:08.040 --> 02:21:11.080
billion data set there okay so you will hit 1 billion data

02:21:11.080 --> 02:21:16.360
on it no right okay so tomorrow again there will be a

02:21:16.360 --> 02:21:19.960
problem created for you so just to like avoid those things

02:21:19.960 --> 02:21:24.320
go ahead with the meta so that your filter like less costly

02:21:24.320 --> 02:21:27.960
less expensive yeah okay next question mukesh please go

02:21:27.960 --> 02:21:34.200
ahead yeah sir i have two questions one is which you just

02:21:34.200 --> 02:21:39.000
told how by integrating and then we got that output so

02:21:39.880 --> 02:21:43.880
likewise like wikipedia we have given we have a tools we

02:21:43.880 --> 02:21:48.800
have selected right so likewise can we select a particular

02:21:48.800 --> 02:21:52.820
site website where like all the informations available let's

02:21:52.820 --> 02:21:56.760
say confluence kind of thing where like your private private

02:21:56.760 --> 02:21:59.540
website right all the informations are yes and label and it

02:21:59.540 --> 02:22:02.680
should scrap the entire website by the way right this is

02:22:02.680 --> 02:22:05.400
something that you're talking about yeah website or page

02:22:05.400 --> 02:22:09.860
bytes we have it and then we can go like because whenever we

02:22:09.860 --> 02:22:13.100
search in the confluence is same kind of wikipedia itself

02:22:13.100 --> 02:22:16.140
but it's not like the tool they have given integrated here

02:22:16.140 --> 02:22:20.320
wikipedia as a globally right but the same kind of we have a

02:22:20.320 --> 02:22:24.440
internal page where we can search and then we can get the

02:22:24.440 --> 02:22:31.060
results yeah okay and another huge case is let's say user

02:22:31.060 --> 02:22:34.880
are going to give us few inputs I wanted to create some

02:22:34.880 --> 02:22:40.060
service tickets or let's say a change request so they have

02:22:40.060 --> 02:22:44.900
given sort of predefined input and like this agentic AI can

02:22:44.900 --> 02:22:50.440
create this service tickets or CR change request for them by

02:22:51.690 --> 02:22:56.130
accessing your tool right yes by accessing our tool service

02:22:56.130 --> 02:22:59.110
now is a kind of global that is possible see I'll show you

02:22:59.110 --> 02:23:02.690
one thing let me share my screen see let's close this part

02:23:02.690 --> 02:23:05.530
if I'm going to click on this tool right so let's suppose if

02:23:05.530 --> 02:23:09.370
I'm going to ask code cod code now they have given you a

02:23:09.370 --> 02:23:12.270
very simple plain option that code now if you click on code

02:23:12.270 --> 02:23:15.470
so here description then you can select python javascript

02:23:15.470 --> 02:23:19.550
and then simply write a code so far we have been using a

02:23:19.550 --> 02:23:23.470
programming right yes now with the help of programming can I

02:23:23.470 --> 02:23:27.150
say that I was creating a functions yes and those functions

02:23:27.150 --> 02:23:30.110
can access my website those functions can access my anything

02:23:30.110 --> 02:23:34.290
which is available in the entire world yes agree yes now

02:23:34.290 --> 02:23:37.590
they have simply given you that one okay sir write a

02:23:37.590 --> 02:23:40.750
function right it will access and then it you can attach

02:23:40.750 --> 02:23:43.770
that as a tool code tool and you can try to create hundreds

02:23:43.770 --> 02:23:44.170
of that

02:23:51.290 --> 02:23:53.610
thousands of system out there they are already aware about

02:23:53.610 --> 02:23:56.930
it and people are already aware about it so just to mitigate

02:23:56.930 --> 02:24:00.230
all those thousands possibility and just to give you a

02:24:00.230 --> 02:24:03.870
complete control they have simply said that that okay do one

02:24:03.870 --> 02:24:07.690
thing write your function here in your language javascript

02:24:07.690 --> 02:24:11.530
or python right and in this way now you can write anything

02:24:11.530 --> 02:24:14.410
and everything you can access the entire world right doesn't

02:24:14.410 --> 02:24:16.430
matter whether it's available or even available in an

02:24:16.430 --> 02:24:19.310
internet still i will i can access it through a code just

02:24:19.310 --> 02:24:22.110
like i was like building a crew agent i was building a land

02:24:22.110 --> 02:24:24.690
graph agent again over there i was writing a functions right

02:24:24.690 --> 02:24:27.830
tool means functions and i was giving access so simply they

02:24:27.830 --> 02:24:30.350
have given you this option and this option is like one of

02:24:30.350 --> 02:24:33.170
the best option one of the powerful option now after this

02:24:33.170 --> 02:24:35.630
option i don't need anything actually i don't have to even

02:24:35.630 --> 02:24:38.030
go and look into wikipedia let's suppose this wikipedia tool

02:24:38.030 --> 02:24:40.530
is not available no issue at all i'll simply write a code

02:24:40.530 --> 02:24:43.090
that go to wikipedia and then face the data done end of the

02:24:43.090 --> 02:24:50.950
story yeah got it right yeah thank you sir yeah yeah yeah go

02:24:50.950 --> 02:24:55.470
ahead please nares yeah yeah uh thank you so much class was

02:24:55.470 --> 02:25:00.650
very good thank you uh yeah uh my basic question is let's

02:25:00.650 --> 02:25:04.350
say uh so if you are building end to end the product right

02:25:04.830 --> 02:25:11.390
so i'll be having uh so many apis also yes true so do do i

02:25:11.390 --> 02:25:15.870
need to keep my apis separate in python code and uh use only

02:25:15.870 --> 02:25:22.150
agentic thing here or i can make apis in n8n also api so

02:25:22.150 --> 02:25:26.370
basically you are saying that making an api in n8n yes yes

02:25:26.370 --> 02:25:29.710
means exposing some of the things as a yeah because see in

02:25:29.710 --> 02:25:33.150
the end to end application i'll be having login apis i'll be

02:25:33.150 --> 02:25:38.370
having you know so many apis so those apis i can keep in

02:25:38.370 --> 02:25:43.150
python and use n8n only for agentic agentic stuff or can i

02:25:43.150 --> 02:25:47.270
completely build my system uh back end system completely in

02:25:47.270 --> 02:25:50.610
n8n uh no it's not like that so you can't like uh do it it

02:25:50.610 --> 02:25:54.190
is having a limitation uh as a node by the way see it's not

02:25:54.190 --> 02:25:56.670
about agentic or non-agentic i'll i'll i have just shown you

02:25:56.670 --> 02:25:58.530
previous two approaches right so where i was not even

02:25:58.530 --> 02:26:01.430
building an agent i was just doing a small like a workflow

02:26:01.430 --> 02:26:04.970
completion where i was accessing the uri so see api means it

02:26:04.970 --> 02:26:07.730
will be available in any other system right any another

02:26:07.730 --> 02:26:10.750
system in any other languages someone has written it and the

02:26:10.750 --> 02:26:12.930
very first application which i have shown you where i was

02:26:12.930 --> 02:26:15.630
accessing uri with the help of apis the very first

02:26:15.630 --> 02:26:19.630
application right if you remember uh which i have shown it

02:26:19.630 --> 02:26:23.670
to you yeah so this is this is the uri right so uri hit yeah

02:26:23.670 --> 02:26:26.530
uri chat hit so here what i was doing so i was just trying

02:26:26.530 --> 02:26:29.090
to call the uri api so in the similar manner doesn't matter

02:26:29.090 --> 02:26:32.910
where your api is in which platform call it https request

02:26:32.910 --> 02:26:35.470
option they have already given to you or even if you have to

02:26:35.470 --> 02:26:37.850
call it as a bevhook bevhook is nothing but also an api but

02:26:37.850 --> 02:26:41.710
yeah it will be triggered on some events right so when

02:26:41.710 --> 02:26:44.030
something is going to happen so it is going to trigger so

02:26:44.030 --> 02:26:48.570
you can expose even anything as a bevhook for example this

02:26:48.570 --> 02:26:51.910
chat when i say public what is this it's a bevhook url

02:26:51.910 --> 02:26:55.090
that's some if someone is going to hit this one right if

02:26:55.090 --> 02:26:57.570
someone is going to hit this url the url which i have shared

02:26:57.570 --> 02:26:59.870
with all of you it's technically a bevhook technically api

02:26:59.870 --> 02:27:02.690
right so if someone is going to hit this url then this

02:27:02.690 --> 02:27:07.810
interaction and that flow will be active no i got it that my

02:27:07.810 --> 02:27:12.170
question is like let's say we are building uri system right

02:27:12.170 --> 02:27:16.930
so in uri you have separate user module for sign up and

02:27:16.930 --> 02:27:23.370
login right and then let's say i wanted to access ats in uri

02:27:23.370 --> 02:27:28.890
yes yes so now my question is my this user module will be in

02:27:28.890 --> 02:27:32.890
my server and only ats system i can keep it in n8n n8n yes

02:27:32.910 --> 02:27:36.570
entire thing i can keep it in n8n no your your your

02:27:36.570 --> 02:27:38.910
basically like entire login model will be available in your

02:27:38.910 --> 02:27:42.690
system somewhere else as a separate service and your ats is

02:27:42.690 --> 02:27:45.690
here now what you can do you can try to expose it as a

02:27:45.690 --> 02:27:49.830
embedding maybe and then wrap it with your login yeah got it

02:27:49.830 --> 02:27:52.250
got it yeah so that that should be the approach basically

02:27:52.250 --> 02:27:55.610
they provide you like a core back end automation kind of

02:27:55.610 --> 02:27:58.810
things but yeah it's not like they can do everything yeah

02:27:58.810 --> 02:28:02.010
got it seems yeah and the second question uh does a

02:28:02.010 --> 02:28:03.890
production system uh does a production system uh they are

02:28:03.890 --> 02:28:08.110
hosting in n8n because i don't know companies how they uh uh

02:28:08.110 --> 02:28:10.730
they they have they're claiming it they're claiming it many

02:28:10.730 --> 02:28:13.170
people have already adopted it so if i'll go to their

02:28:13.170 --> 02:28:18.130
website n8n so yeah there is a claim uh that people are

02:28:18.130 --> 02:28:22.370
using this entire things uh like these many peoples and i

02:28:22.370 --> 02:28:25.610
believe uh yeah some of the companies how much in a

02:28:25.610 --> 02:28:28.950
production i don't know because see production depends upon

02:28:28.950 --> 02:28:32.870
a tie-up as well and now anything became a big one right and

02:28:32.890 --> 02:28:35.450
n8n become a big one they have like a so many built tie-up

02:28:35.450 --> 02:28:38.510
uh they have done this also in your tie-up so many companies

02:28:38.510 --> 02:28:41.450
you will be able to see it here and like integrations by the

02:28:41.450 --> 02:28:44.710
way so maybe they there must be using it but i think it's a

02:28:44.710 --> 02:28:47.430
good tool to have and then uh good tool to even use it in a

02:28:47.430 --> 02:28:51.610
day-to-day life yeah thank you thank you that's it yeah and

02:28:51.610 --> 02:28:55.230
even to build up like you know some sort of uh quick mvps or

02:28:55.230 --> 02:28:57.870
i would say a quick automation for your customer if you are

02:28:57.870 --> 02:29:01.750
doing some freelancing job yeah i can think of that because

02:29:01.750 --> 02:29:04.690
mvp are uh you know they are very much easy easy because you

02:29:04.690 --> 02:29:07.450
don't need to spend more than half an hour to build yeah i

02:29:07.450 --> 02:29:10.590
mean like if you if steps are clear in your brain right drag

02:29:10.590 --> 02:29:14.570
and drop drag and drop done yeah yes yeah with with

02:29:14.570 --> 02:29:17.410
everything thank you thank you and one more thing they have

02:29:17.410 --> 02:29:21.730
also given you if you'll go to a community forum so uh not

02:29:21.730 --> 02:29:29.650
this one uh use cases yeah um not talk to sales uh they have

02:29:29.650 --> 02:29:33.010
somewhere like example uh browse all interviews integration

02:29:33.010 --> 02:29:37.210
yeah so here you can come and as not integration examples

02:29:37.210 --> 02:29:41.290
let me show you that i have saved a couple of examples which

02:29:41.290 --> 02:29:49.110
is my favorite uh oh okay yeah so for example so viral ai

02:29:49.110 --> 02:29:52.390
video tiktok youtube instagram right send it a message to

02:29:52.390 --> 02:29:55.610
the tiktok instagram so here you will be able to find out a

02:29:55.610 --> 02:29:57.710
lot of template which people have built even you can build a

02:29:57.710 --> 02:30:00.890
template and publish it for sales it ops marketing so here

02:30:00.890 --> 02:30:03.610
what you have to do someone has already built it you just

02:30:03.610 --> 02:30:06.050
have to click over there you just have to use it for free

02:30:06.050 --> 02:30:10.230
and then like uh go and start modif customize it according

02:30:10.230 --> 02:30:12.610
to your credential and need just like i have shared the

02:30:12.610 --> 02:30:15.190
template right i have shared the json file so technically

02:30:15.190 --> 02:30:17.750
this is the json file so many people have already created so

02:30:17.750 --> 02:30:20.810
many workflows 1700 something they're they're claiming right

02:30:20.810 --> 02:30:24.230
or maybe 2000 they have created it and then click it use it

02:30:25.490 --> 02:30:30.870
thank you so much thank you yeah okay so fine everyone i

02:30:30.870 --> 02:30:33.030
think we don't have any kind of a question so we'll try to

02:30:33.030 --> 02:30:34.410
wrap up this session so we'll see you in the

02:30:44.370 --> 02:30:47.170
next session

02:31:15.070 --> 02:31:18.650
bye bye

02:31:46.630 --> 02:31:48.030
bye

02:32:06.730 --> 02:32:12.190
The second thing is that if it is adopted in the company,

02:32:12.190 --> 02:32:18.290
then how are these accounts, how is its integration? You

02:32:18.290 --> 02:32:21.670
have multiple services running in the backend. You have to

02:32:21.670 --> 02:32:25.590
integrate and create a workflow. So simple, a workflow has

02:32:25.590 --> 02:32:27.530
been created here. Here you can go and manage the user in

02:32:27.530 --> 02:32:31.990
the setting. What will be used in the admin panel, just like

02:32:31.990 --> 02:32:33.690
any other platform where there is user management,

02:32:34.070 --> 02:32:38.630
authentication, etc. You can secure everything and then make

02:32:38.630 --> 02:32:41.570
it active live. So that this process keeps running on its

02:32:41.570 --> 02:32:43.330
own in the backend. We said trigger, here you are triggering

02:32:43.330 --> 02:32:46.070
with chat or you can schedule it. So the process is running

02:32:46.070 --> 02:32:48.530
on its own, the way you have scheduled that it has to run

02:32:48.530 --> 02:32:50.450
every day. So you have to get data, you have to do this, you

02:32:50.450 --> 02:32:52.870
have to do that and then you have to reach here. Everything

02:32:52.870 --> 02:32:55.770
it will do, simple. Just like any other automation platform.

02:32:56.010 --> 02:32:59.830
Okay, like we use Gator. Okay, like we use Gator. You can

02:32:59.830 --> 02:33:01.910
manage everything here, you can complete user management

02:33:01.910 --> 02:33:07.610
here. Okay, sir, like our use case is that we were making a

02:33:07.610 --> 02:33:10.890
search engine. So there we indexed the data of different

02:33:10.890 --> 02:33:18.590
sources and sent it to the databases. So this happens again

02:33:18.590 --> 02:33:22.130
and again, we have to run the indexing pipeline. Like new

02:33:22.130 --> 02:33:25.250
data came, client will say that I have put some data, then

02:33:25.250 --> 02:33:28.130
that indexing pipeline is completed. So you have to run it,

02:33:28.210 --> 02:33:30.570
you can schedule it in Cron. You can schedule it in Cron or

02:33:30.570 --> 02:33:33.050
you can use any other scheduler. Like you can use Airflow in

02:33:33.050 --> 02:33:36.510
your current job. Simple thing is that here schedule it

02:33:36.510 --> 02:33:40.110
through Cron. Which is available in all your CMDs commands.

02:33:40.610 --> 02:33:46.970
Right. Otherwise like try to use basically like any kind of

02:33:46.970 --> 02:33:50.210
a scheduler. Use Airflow. If you are using init any, then we

02:33:50.210 --> 02:33:54.270
have told you that by default click here. Then schedule

02:33:54.270 --> 02:33:56.870
trigger is already available here. where your day, month,

02:33:57.010 --> 02:33:59.490
minute, whatever you say, it will schedule at that time, it

02:33:59.490 --> 02:34:03.130
will call itself at that time. Or you don't want it to be

02:34:03.130 --> 02:34:04.230
scheduler-wise, it should be there only when the data

02:34:04.230 --> 02:34:08.050
arrives. So there are also triggers available for that. Look

02:34:08.050 --> 02:34:12.190
here, I told you in the class today also, all the triggers

02:34:12.190 --> 02:34:14.710
are available. MQTT triggers are available, Kafka triggers,

02:34:14.870 --> 02:34:17.090
when the data will come through Kafka, then it will come. If

02:34:17.090 --> 02:34:21.870
you want to keep a file watcher or a drive watcher, then you

02:34:21.870 --> 02:34:24.110
write a code for a drive watcher and it will trigger only

02:34:24.110 --> 02:34:28.250
when some data will come in it. Anything can be possible. We

02:34:28.250 --> 02:34:32.230
do that. Who runs it manually these days? I don't think

02:34:32.230 --> 02:34:34.830
anyone is doing it. And if you are doing it, I think you are

02:34:34.830 --> 02:34:37.710
doing it wrong. Yes, actually, in GitLab, we have just

02:34:37.710 --> 02:34:42.610
implemented this scheduler. So now on a button, that

02:34:42.610 --> 02:34:47.470
scheduler itself triggers on a timing basis. But I thought

02:34:47.470 --> 02:34:50.730
this was more advanced. The client also felt that it was

02:34:50.730 --> 02:34:53.850
more agentic. Yes, just because of the time. You trigger on

02:34:53.850 --> 02:34:55.810
the event, right? If this data will come, then trigger this.

02:34:56.330 --> 02:34:58.850
Okay. So it won't do it on a time basis. I mean, the data is

02:34:58.850 --> 02:35:00.890
available immediately. As soon as the data comes there, it

02:35:00.890 --> 02:35:03.030
will send it forward to process it. Generally, we do event

02:35:03.030 --> 02:35:06.270
-based too. We do event-based generally these days. Or time

02:35:06.270 --> 02:35:10.230
-based too, just like your use case. Right. I think there is

02:35:10.230 --> 02:35:14.890
a perfect use case for this. So we can suggest the client to

02:35:14.890 --> 02:35:18.430
make one like this. Now, sir, Confluence, Jira, all these

02:35:18.430 --> 02:35:20.230
sources are also available. Oh, Jira is completely

02:35:20.230 --> 02:35:24.230
available. Search. See, Jira is available. What is not

02:35:24.230 --> 02:35:26.990
available here? See, all the endpoints of Jira are

02:35:26.990 --> 02:35:33.950
available. Yes, I think there. Everything is available. It

02:35:33.950 --> 02:35:38.830
will be very easy and we will also get to learn, the client.

02:35:39.170 --> 02:35:43.310
It is also very easy to learn. It is easy to learn or do. If

02:35:43.310 --> 02:35:45.810
the credentials are handy, you will quickly map everything

02:35:45.810 --> 02:35:50.710
one by one. Right. Sir, one problem is also happening. There

02:35:50.710 --> 02:35:53.270
is no vector db available. Only baby 8 is available. What

02:35:53.270 --> 02:35:55.170
are you talking about? There is no vector db available. Who

02:35:55.170 --> 02:35:58.170
said vector db? Did you search? There is no vector db

02:35:58.170 --> 02:35:59.450
available. Which one is not available? There is no vector

02:35:59.450 --> 02:36:02.950
db. There is quadrant, miniverse, baby 8, pine cone, mongo

02:36:02.950 --> 02:36:06.970
vector, postgres vector. All are available here. Now, chroma

02:36:06.970 --> 02:36:09.830
db or chroma db is self-hosted. It has just happened. Where

02:36:09.830 --> 02:36:11.510
it has come serverless. So they have not made the name of

02:36:11.510 --> 02:36:14.930
chroma db. You can directly code it and call it. You have

02:36:14.930 --> 02:36:19.490
the code type available, right? Facebook is also good. This

02:36:19.490 --> 02:36:20.690
is a wrong question. Actually, this is a very good question.

02:36:20.690 --> 02:36:22.070
After studying so much, at least we do not expect this

02:36:22.070 --> 02:36:25.370
stupid question. Okay. Simple. What were we doing with

02:36:25.370 --> 02:36:28.370
Facebook as a similarity? We were hosting it locally. Right.

02:36:28.670 --> 02:36:30.570
What is it giving here? It is just giving a connector node.

02:36:30.830 --> 02:36:34.370
It is not hosting. None of the services. Right. Is any of

02:36:34.370 --> 02:36:36.730
these services hosting in return? No. What is it doing? It

02:36:36.730 --> 02:36:38.710
is giving you a connector. That you will connect an endpoint

02:36:38.710 --> 02:36:41.530
there. As far as chroma and fasi are concerned, generally if

02:36:41.530 --> 02:36:44.930
we talk about Facebook as a similarity, we host it in our

02:36:44.930 --> 02:36:49.010
system. Whether it is local or cloud. Why will it give it

02:36:49.010 --> 02:36:51.350
here? Why will it give it here? If you want to call, if you

02:36:51.350 --> 02:36:54.190
have hosted Facebook as a similarity on your cloud, if you

02:36:54.190 --> 02:36:56.390
want to call from there, no problem. Expose it as an API.

02:36:56.610 --> 02:37:00.830
Call it as an HTTPS request. So much basic understanding

02:37:00.830 --> 02:37:02.870
should be there, right? After taking so many classes, after

02:37:02.870 --> 02:37:05.850
understanding the API, it is okay that why it is available

02:37:05.850 --> 02:37:09.370
and why it is not available. Yes, sir. There was one last

02:37:09.370 --> 02:37:13.150
question. I have one question. Can I use this? I can

02:37:13.150 --> 02:37:15.850
automate the Excel sheet data to PPT summary data.

02:37:15.930 --> 02:37:17.590
Obviously, you can solve it. So, the Excel sheet is given

02:37:17.590 --> 02:37:20.970
here by default. Here. Excel sheet conversion. Convert to

02:37:20.970 --> 02:37:23.950
file. Extract from file. Microsoft Excel connector. Now you

02:37:23.950 --> 02:37:26.250
can like call each and everything from the Excel over here.

02:37:26.470 --> 02:37:29.150
Right. And maybe if I have to save it into some other file,

02:37:29.250 --> 02:37:35.100
maybe like a PowerPoint. I don't think the PowerPoint direct

02:37:35.100 --> 02:37:38.360
tab is given. You have a docs, by the way. Yes, Microsoft

02:37:38.360 --> 02:37:42.300
SharePoint is given. So, put it wherever you want to store

02:37:42.300 --> 02:37:45.640
data. SharePoint option is given. PowerPoint is not there.

02:37:45.840 --> 02:37:50.420
By the way, there is a docs. Sir, one last question. Yes.

02:37:51.160 --> 02:37:53.000
Sir. Yes. Yes. So, the last question is, I mean, I too

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:57.780
understand that we were using this OpenAI, so it happened on

02:37:57.780 --> 02:38:02.220
LLM intelligence. Yes. But now you have, if here, you have

02:38:02.220 --> 02:38:05.680
shown any custom training, that fine-tuned models can also

02:38:05.680 --> 02:38:08.380
be accessed. That's in my account. This was not available in

02:38:08.380 --> 02:38:11.160
my account, right? Here it is already in my account. The

02:38:11.160 --> 02:38:14.000
account we have connected to. Right. In this account, see,

02:38:14.060 --> 02:38:16.160
Anet is not hosting anything. Okay. He is just giving you

02:38:16.160 --> 02:38:18.280
the connector. He is hosting the connector. He is hosting

02:38:18.280 --> 02:38:21.140
the configuration, basically. Okay. Okay. Okay. You

02:38:21.140 --> 02:38:23.860
understand, right? Right. Okay. It is just hosting the

02:38:23.860 --> 02:38:25.440
configuration, it is not doing any real physical hosting.

02:38:25.660 --> 02:38:28.360
For this model, I need a physical instance where it runs,

02:38:28.760 --> 02:38:31.540
where there is memory, where there is compute. In it,

02:38:31.580 --> 02:38:35.020
compute charges you just for what? Just for hosting that

02:38:35.020 --> 02:38:38.540
flow, the flow that you have created, the system that you

02:38:38.540 --> 02:38:42.140
have connected to the whole world. Fine-tuned one is not

02:38:42.140 --> 02:38:44.500
available here, it is available in my account. That's the

02:38:44.500 --> 02:38:49.000
reason, if you give your API key here, you will not see it.

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:52.920
Because it will not be fine-tuned. By default, the model

02:38:52.920 --> 02:38:56.840
given to you by OpenAI, you will see the default model. So

02:38:56.840 --> 02:38:59.860
basically, this is not hosted in NIT, it is hosted from

02:38:59.860 --> 02:39:03.360
there, it is taking it from there. Sir, I was just asking

02:39:03.360 --> 02:39:06.800
that we will also study custom training and fine-tuning in

02:39:06.800 --> 02:39:10.020
the future. Yes, it is already in the chapter, I think it is

02:39:10.020 --> 02:39:13.780
the next topic. Right, then we can also use our custom in

02:39:13.780 --> 02:39:18.080
it. Like we have made something custom. Fine-tuning model is

02:39:18.080 --> 02:39:20.320
visible there. We can use custom there. Let's suppose that

02:39:20.320 --> 02:39:24.640
we have hosted somewhere on our GPU, no problem. Right. We

02:39:24.640 --> 02:39:27.380
showed you the first example, the HTTP one. Because when you

02:39:27.380 --> 02:39:31.440
know the HTTP, which was the very first example, right?

02:39:31.520 --> 02:39:35.440
Which we showed the HTTP one. Where did it go? Yes, UriChat,

02:39:35.460 --> 02:39:38.580
this one. The meaning of showing this was that you can hit

02:39:38.580 --> 02:39:44.140
any HTTP. Yes. Means any API. Now, even if it is running on

02:39:44.140 --> 02:39:46.720
some other server, wherever it is running, like Uri. We

02:39:46.720 --> 02:39:49.540
called it through the HTTP request. It means that we can

02:39:49.540 --> 02:39:52.440
call all the systems of the world here. This was the thing,

02:39:52.540 --> 02:39:55.020
this was the reason I have shown you. The very first example

02:39:55.020 --> 02:39:58.000
is this one. Now call Uri, you can call all the systems of

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.580
the world. Because wherever the API will be used in all the

02:40:00.580 --> 02:40:02.240
systems, there will be your endpoint, there will be your

02:40:02.240 --> 02:40:06.780
auth, and there will be your payload. Right. Right. Right.

02:40:06.780 --> 02:40:08.840
That's all there is to API, right? Right. Yes, sir. Okay.

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.560
Okay. Then you can call this, then you can call the world.

02:40:11.940 --> 02:40:15.760
Yes. Thanks, sir. Thanks. Thanks for the wonderful session

02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:19.060
as well, sir. Yeah. Thanks. Thank you. Okay. Next, yeah,

02:40:19.140 --> 02:40:25.740
Rakesh, go ahead. Yeah. Yeah, Rakesh, I think your voice is

02:40:25.740 --> 02:40:32.830
low. Hello. Imtiaz, you can go ahead. Thank you, sir. First

02:40:32.830 --> 02:40:36.010
of all, thank you for the wonderful session. Thank you. I

02:40:36.010 --> 02:40:41.830
have a use case, and I didn't have the courage to start in

02:40:41.830 --> 02:40:46.470
it, and thanks for your demonstration. So I will start,

02:40:46.550 --> 02:40:50.510
definitely. So the use case is, that's a recruitment farm.

02:40:50.790 --> 02:40:54.670
They usually post ads in LinkedIn and somewhere else. Yes,

02:40:54.670 --> 02:40:59.150
yes. And emails. The first thing is, whenever there is an

02:40:59.150 --> 02:41:03.950
email, they will shoot another email to the person that how

02:41:03.950 --> 02:41:07.290
many years of JavaScript experience you have, do you find

02:41:07.290 --> 02:41:12.190
something like that. So first of all, so from email, we will

02:41:12.190 --> 02:41:16.770
have send them an email, and when they reply, then there

02:41:16.770 --> 02:41:21.770
will be a bot to call them to have that, because there is

02:41:21.770 --> 02:41:25.630
some fictitious participant. So they said that calling is

02:41:25.630 --> 02:41:29.910
the best thing. So for call, I have found that they have

02:41:29.910 --> 02:41:35.110
integration with 11 labs. So these are two separate agents,

02:41:35.250 --> 02:41:39.810
sir, or we can have it in the single workflow? Like one is

02:41:39.810 --> 02:41:43.290
getting email and then calling them? No, in both the way you

02:41:43.290 --> 02:41:50.830
can have it. Okay. So for my building purpose, shall I first

02:41:50.830 --> 02:41:55.030
prepare two separate agents, then connect with here? You can

02:41:55.030 --> 02:41:57.790
try to prepare two separate agents, means agent wise you can

02:41:57.790 --> 02:42:00.750
try to prepare n number of agents, right? So you can try to

02:42:00.750 --> 02:42:02.770
prepare two separate agents, or maybe you can try to create

02:42:02.770 --> 02:42:07.710
one agent, give a multi-tool access to one agent. Multi-tool

02:42:07.710 --> 02:42:10.070
you said, sir? Multi-tool means multiple function access,

02:42:10.210 --> 02:42:12.490
multiple like application access to one agent itself. So

02:42:12.490 --> 02:42:14.190
agent will decide automatically. This is the meaning of

02:42:14.190 --> 02:42:17.490
agent, right? Agent means it is having a decision making

02:42:17.490 --> 02:42:20.630
ability, right? Decision making ability. Yeah. So you can

02:42:20.630 --> 02:42:23.070
try to give a multiple tool access to one agent or maybe

02:42:23.070 --> 02:42:26.210
like here I'm giving it, right? So say let's suppose there

02:42:26.210 --> 02:42:28.170
is a code tool, there is a Wikipedia tool. It will decide

02:42:28.170 --> 02:42:31.110
when to use code, when to use Wikipedia. It's not my job.

02:42:31.190 --> 02:42:36.870
It's basically this agent's job. Right. And sir, for the

02:42:36.870 --> 02:42:41.310
question bank, like that if it is a JavaScript related post,

02:42:41.470 --> 02:42:46.990
so for, shall we ask the agent to prepare? Or we will- You

02:42:46.990 --> 02:42:48.850
can ask the agent to prepare that. Okay, fine. So this is

02:42:48.850 --> 02:42:51.710
the candidate. This is the resume. So based on this resume,

02:42:51.830 --> 02:42:54.370
parse it, match it, and then try to generate one question.

02:42:54.510 --> 02:42:56.530
And to generate a question, use one of the tools which I

02:42:56.530 --> 02:42:59.990
have given you as an access. Okay. Okay. Fantastic.

02:43:00.250 --> 02:43:03.550
Fantastic. Thank you very much. Yeah. Sir, I'm calling from

02:43:03.550 --> 02:43:08.150
New York. It is just after 2.30 AM. I'm just waking up to-

02:43:08.150 --> 02:43:13.470
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. That's all dedication. And

02:43:13.470 --> 02:43:15.710
I hope you're learning something. Thank you. Definitely,

02:43:15.770 --> 02:43:17.550
sir. Thank you very much. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks.

02:43:20.440 --> 02:43:24.380
Yeah. Hi, sir. Okay. Let me give an answer to Rudra. So,

02:43:24.420 --> 02:43:27.540
sir, why anybody will go through, go for LangChain,

02:43:27.560 --> 02:43:32.900
LangGraph? See, I'll tell you one thing. There are, in a

02:43:32.900 --> 02:43:36.540
market, there are a lot of like CRM provider. Okay. Joho is

02:43:36.540 --> 02:43:39.480
also providing. Salesforce is also providing. Oracle is also

02:43:39.480 --> 02:43:42.380
providing. And SAP is also providing. Right. Now, everyone

02:43:42.380 --> 02:43:45.080
is having their client base since last 20, 30 year. Okay.

02:43:45.240 --> 02:43:47.300
Joho exists since last 26 year. Okay. And then, you know,

02:43:47.300 --> 02:43:47.340
there are a lot of, you know, there are a lot of, you know,

02:43:47.340 --> 02:43:49.200
there are a lot of, you know, Salesforce and all the other

02:43:49.200 --> 02:43:52.500
companies exist, even more than that. So, CRM, HRM, FICO,

02:43:52.540 --> 02:43:55.740
FIFO system is being provided. Talking about Google Gmail

02:43:55.740 --> 02:43:58.660
provider, let's forget about CRM, a lot of people won't

02:43:58.660 --> 02:44:00.860
understand CRM. Customer Service Management System. Right.

02:44:01.260 --> 02:44:05.260
And ERP solution. And let's talk about Gmail. So, there are

02:44:05.260 --> 02:44:08.900
a lot of platforms that provide you mail. Hotmail is also

02:44:08.900 --> 02:44:12.940
there, Gmail is also there, and Rediff mail is also there.

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.280
There are a lot of such. Okay. Where you can go, you can try

02:44:15.280 --> 02:44:18.860
to create your. Basically, BlackBerry. Like emails. Right.

02:44:18.940 --> 02:44:21.800
And you can send a mail to anyone, communicate with anyone.

02:44:22.840 --> 02:44:25.720
Now, there are a lot of such solutions that you will get.

02:44:25.880 --> 02:44:29.660
There are a lot of vendors. They are providing you LLMs.

02:44:29.880 --> 02:44:34.240
Okay. Chat GPT, OpenAI. One. One is done. Then, your

02:44:34.240 --> 02:44:37.580
Publicity is done. Gemini is done. Facebook is also

02:44:37.580 --> 02:44:41.080
providing you. TwitterX. Basically, Grooke is providing you.

02:44:41.200 --> 02:44:48.940
Right. Now, which one you are using. Okay. That depends upon

02:44:48.940 --> 02:44:53.340
multiple factors. Maybe, you have a business. The company

02:44:53.340 --> 02:44:58.180
reached out first. You liked it. You got stuck as a user. As

02:44:58.180 --> 02:45:00.900
a business user. Or maybe as an individual user. Both. So,

02:45:00.920 --> 02:45:03.100
it became your favorite. Now, you will use it for a long

02:45:03.100 --> 02:45:08.800
time. Right. So, now you became a customer of that. Okay. It

02:45:08.800 --> 02:45:12.500
is possible that you liked some features. Okay. A new player

02:45:12.500 --> 02:45:14.340
has come in the market. Did you like any feature? No. We

02:45:14.340 --> 02:45:17.020
will go to him. Okay. So, in this way, you will become a

02:45:17.020 --> 02:45:20.960
customer of that. So, in this way, all these companies are

02:45:20.960 --> 02:45:26.220
LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI, Microsoft Autogen. Okay.

02:45:26.620 --> 02:45:30.040
OpenAI has also launched its agent. Okay. So, it is its. It

02:45:30.040 --> 02:45:34.780
is N8N. All are providing you. Okay. All are providing you.

02:45:35.260 --> 02:45:38.620
What is the core concept? What is the core? Agent. Okay.

02:45:38.780 --> 02:45:42.500
That you can make an agent here. Now, whom will we choose?

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:47.300
Okay. So, you are not able to say right now. Let's say, you

02:45:47.300 --> 02:45:49.560
have chosen. So, let's suppose, you are saying N8N. Rudra is

02:45:49.560 --> 02:45:53.440
saying. Brother, why should we do other? I like N8N. Okay,

02:45:53.480 --> 02:45:55.280
this beautiful. You know, we are able to make a tab,

02:45:55.600 --> 02:45:59.440
multiple nodes etc. So, I am making fun to do this, I am

02:45:59.440 --> 02:46:03.060
enjoying it and it looks like very easy. Right. Actually, it

02:46:03.060 --> 02:46:08.360
is very easy. But you have already seen that you may not

02:46:08.360 --> 02:46:10.760
like coding. So, maybe there will be some difficulty in

02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:13.180
LangChain, there will be some difficulty in Langraph. The

02:46:13.180 --> 02:46:15.840
coding part of CrewAI will have some difficulty. But when we

02:46:15.840 --> 02:46:17.280
showed you CrewAI. Then we are able to make a client.

02:46:19.540 --> 02:46:22.280
basically with the UI interface, you might have liked it

02:46:22.280 --> 02:46:25.140
more and you are liking it more than that. Now we will show

02:46:25.140 --> 02:46:28.080
you the Microsoft Autogen in the UI. Still, you will say

02:46:28.080 --> 02:46:30.760
that the internet is better, it is more convenient. So

02:46:30.760 --> 02:46:32.900
basically what happens is that why are you able to say this,

02:46:32.900 --> 02:46:34.720
how are you able to say this? When you have experienced all

02:46:34.720 --> 02:46:38.120
those things, we just show you. Let's suppose that I am a

02:46:38.120 --> 02:46:41.220
company and you are my employee. So I am forcing you to use

02:46:41.220 --> 02:46:45.780
only the language chain, no matter what happens. Even if you

02:46:45.780 --> 02:46:48.280
die while writing the code, but you have to use only the

02:46:48.280 --> 02:46:50.760
language chain. Apart from that, no one will let you use it.

02:46:51.060 --> 02:46:53.440
As a company, I am telling you, right? Why? Because I have a

02:46:53.440 --> 02:46:55.600
tie-up, my company has made a deal with the language chain

02:46:55.600 --> 02:47:00.240
that we will use your framework. So now you will be forced

02:47:00.240 --> 02:47:04.920
as a developer. You know anything else, you know that

02:47:04.920 --> 02:47:06.780
internet is better than that. What will you do as a

02:47:06.780 --> 02:47:08.880
developer? You will only use the language chain because the

02:47:08.880 --> 02:47:10.960
company has forced you. You will see the whole product stack

02:47:10.960 --> 02:47:12.760
in the programming language. You will see a lot of

02:47:12.760 --> 02:47:16.040
programming language. And in every programming language, we

02:47:16.040 --> 02:47:18.820
can do everything actually. It's not like one is bad, one is

02:47:18.820 --> 02:47:21.920
good. Speed, complexity, they are all different things. But

02:47:21.920 --> 02:47:23.860
in programming language, we can use all the programming

02:47:23.860 --> 02:47:27.220
languages. We can make anything, whatever we want. But

02:47:27.220 --> 02:47:29.360
still, we stick to one with respect to a project. It's not

02:47:29.360 --> 02:47:33.820
like we will make a mess there. So this is what happens when

02:47:33.820 --> 02:47:37.740
there are multiple competitors in the market. If your

02:47:37.740 --> 02:47:40.380
company has adopted that we are going with the crew, then

02:47:40.380 --> 02:47:43.060
you will have to go. That is your compulsion. If your

02:47:43.060 --> 02:47:46.100
company has adopted that we are going with N8n. If you don't

02:47:46.100 --> 02:47:48.600
like N8n drag and drop, let's suppose we are developers. I

02:47:48.600 --> 02:47:51.420
really like to write code. I love writing a code and

02:47:51.420 --> 02:47:53.780
debugging it. I really enjoy sitting till 4 in the morning

02:47:53.780 --> 02:47:57.560
while debugging code and building a system. And I don't like

02:47:57.560 --> 02:48:00.100
this kind of drag and drop. Because there are many people.

02:48:00.160 --> 02:48:02.500
If you go and talk to developers, coders, hardcore

02:48:02.500 --> 02:48:05.140
developers. They will say that this is fine, we will write

02:48:05.140 --> 02:48:07.960
code and do it. You will say half an hour, they will say we

02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:10.620
will also do half an hour. I have expertise in this. We will

02:48:10.620 --> 02:48:11.820
also do half an hour. It is technically possible if there is

02:48:11.820 --> 02:48:12.060
an expert.

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:21.240
So it depends upon my likes and dislikes. That we can choose

02:48:21.240 --> 02:48:23.260
this as an individual. But when you work in a company, you

02:48:23.260 --> 02:48:25.420
will not have a choice. You will say that our tie-up is with

02:48:25.420 --> 02:48:28.920
this. Do it. You will have to do it. So what do you want to

02:48:28.920 --> 02:48:32.680
know? You want to know everything. If we talk about

02:48:32.680 --> 02:48:35.580
philosophy, everyone has the same philosophy. You understood

02:48:35.580 --> 02:48:39.820
one, you understood all. Just a matter of fact. How much you

02:48:39.820 --> 02:48:41.900
have practiced. Practice little by little. It is done.

02:48:42.600 --> 02:48:46.720
Because philosophically nothing is changing here. Right. So

02:48:46.720 --> 02:48:48.880
that is the reason even in my syllabus. I have kept

02:48:48.880 --> 02:48:51.260
everything. That you need to know everything. Go to the

02:48:51.260 --> 02:48:53.640
interview tomorrow. Ask them. Okay. Do you know how to make

02:48:53.640 --> 02:48:56.520
an agent in init-in? Okay. People are saying that we made it

02:48:56.520 --> 02:48:58.240
in lang. We made it in lang change. What happens in init-in?

02:48:58.660 --> 02:49:01.320
I don't know. Something must be different. When we made it

02:49:01.320 --> 02:49:04.680
here, there was nothing. It was the same. Okay. It was very

02:49:04.680 --> 02:49:07.840
easy. So that's why what you should do and what you should

02:49:07.840 --> 02:49:09.540
know. You should know everything. You should explore

02:49:09.540 --> 02:49:13.020
everything. Right. Because you are techie. That's a skill.

02:49:13.440 --> 02:49:17.420
Right. So that you can work in something. Hope I am able to

02:49:17.420 --> 02:49:21.100
answer to your questions Rudra. Right. That we can do

02:49:21.100 --> 02:49:25.560
everything. Why are we using the internet? Yeah. Go ahead.

02:49:25.640 --> 02:49:26.920
Like Armaan. Go ahead.

02:49:30.160 --> 02:49:33.340
Yeah. Hello. Should I model? Yeah. You are able. Yes sir. I

02:49:33.340 --> 02:49:36.660
asked. We said that everything we need to know and we can do

02:49:36.660 --> 02:49:40.500
it. You said it's a crew. AI agent. We made the workflow.

02:49:41.160 --> 02:49:43.220
Yes. I am a person. We can build it at the same time.

02:49:43.700 --> 02:49:46.000
Anytime. Exactly the same. We will make it and show you

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:49.380
tomorrow. Okay. Exactly the same. Everything is possible.

02:49:49.860 --> 02:49:53.500
Okay. I am waiting for that. Okay. Whatever you think. See,

02:49:53.620 --> 02:49:56.360
it means automation. Whatever I can think, if I am able to

02:49:56.360 --> 02:50:00.080
break it down, I can build it. Yeah. Possibility, non

02:50:00.080 --> 02:50:02.820
-possibility is just a state of my mind. Maybe that will

02:50:02.820 --> 02:50:07.540
take 2 hours of time for me, but I can do it. Of course. And

02:50:07.540 --> 02:50:10.320
I think you should do it. You should try. Yeah. Why to wait

02:50:10.320 --> 02:50:13.880
for me to do everything? Because there could be millions of

02:50:13.880 --> 02:50:17.820
things which can be built. Right? Right, sir. So go ahead

02:50:17.820 --> 02:50:25.340
and build it. Yeah. Okay. Rakesh, you have a question? Yeah.

02:50:25.340 --> 02:50:31.940
Hi, sir. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Yeah. So first of

02:50:31.940 --> 02:50:36.280
all, I was connected to you. I knew Ron when you were there.

02:50:36.820 --> 02:50:40.560
Okay. Thank you. And then, today it's my very first class.

02:50:40.780 --> 02:50:43.000
Actually, I've created this one. Mm-hmm.

02:50:45.820 --> 02:50:48.120
I have decided about AI. I have gone through all your

02:50:48.120 --> 02:50:52.960
courses in the last 10-15 days, sir. And all the things,

02:50:53.040 --> 02:50:56.480
even from data engineering to all the things. And then now I

02:50:56.480 --> 02:50:59.260
am following this class. Okay. Okay. I will go through all

02:50:59.260 --> 02:51:03.640
the things in your previous recording and will try to reach

02:51:03.640 --> 02:51:14.180
here, sir. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Okay. It was my pleasure.

02:51:19.920 --> 02:51:24.980
Thank you. I am going to end this video. Again, thank you.

02:51:24.980 --> 02:51:33.300
Thank you. I was listening to you, sir. You too. Thank you,

02:51:33.300 --> 02:51:34.900
sir. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

02:52:07.740 --> 02:52:09.560
So basically what is happening is that when you put a

02:52:09.560 --> 02:52:12.540
question, then the question goes directly to the chat GPT,

02:52:12.920 --> 02:52:14.780
that is, the chat GPT that you have here, that's why you are

02:52:14.780 --> 02:52:17.240
calling twice, right? Look at the flow here, there is an AI

02:52:17.240 --> 02:52:19.880
agent, right? Look, you put a question here, okay, this flow

02:52:19.880 --> 02:52:22.760
up. Can you see my screen? Yes, yes, yes. So first go here,

02:52:23.040 --> 02:52:25.500
after going here, basically where did you go? Filtered the

02:52:25.500 --> 02:52:27.000
question. Okay, after filtering the question, where did you

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.320
go? Call the AI agent. What did you do in the agent? Call

02:52:29.320 --> 02:52:32.380
the open AI model first, okay? Correct. So that he

02:52:32.380 --> 02:52:35.000
understands the question, what to do, what kind of question

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.240
is there? So it is already written in it that do one thing,

02:52:37.340 --> 02:52:38.900
you have to search Wikipedia. So what did you do? You went

02:52:38.900 --> 02:52:41.480
to Wikipedia, okay? Now basically he will go there and pick

02:52:41.480 --> 02:52:44.780
up all the data from Wikipedia. But we have put it here, we

02:52:44.780 --> 02:52:47.000
have told the agent that when you bring the data, do one

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.640
thing, I only need 200, it is written here in the system

02:52:49.640 --> 02:52:52.940
prompt, right? Correct. Do it in 200 words, okay? So now in

02:52:52.940 --> 02:52:54.560
200 words, summarize it and answer me in bullet points,

02:52:55.080 --> 02:52:57.180
okay? So then he will pick up the data and send it to him,

02:52:57.700 --> 02:52:59.220
he will send it to the chat GPT, he will tell him to

02:52:59.220 --> 02:53:05.300
summarize this data for me. Okay. So this model itself is

02:53:05.300 --> 02:53:08.620
able to understand the questions and give the answer as

02:53:08.620 --> 02:53:11.800
well, right? Yes, no, no, that is what we had given you,

02:53:12.740 --> 02:53:15.100
right? Let's suppose that you are searching Wikipedia,

02:53:15.100 --> 02:53:17.800
right? Yes. Let's suppose that you asked about Elon Musk,

02:53:17.940 --> 02:53:23.480
okay? Now you asked basically, let's suppose about me, okay?

02:53:23.660 --> 02:53:27.720
Yes. He will not tell because neither the model knows nor is

02:53:27.720 --> 02:53:30.240
it available in Wikipedia. Correct. Because the model was

02:53:30.240 --> 02:53:32.080
trained, let's suppose yesterday. Correct. Until yesterday.

02:53:32.080 --> 02:53:34.560
Yes. Okay. And till yesterday my data was not available

02:53:34.560 --> 02:53:37.640
anywhere, okay? Today let's suppose that someone has

02:53:37.640 --> 02:53:40.860
published my Wikipedia article. Correct. So at least today

02:53:40.860 --> 02:53:42.980
he can go and pick up the data about me, right? Correct. No,

02:53:43.060 --> 02:53:45.780
no, but my question is that suppose sir, if the answer to

02:53:45.780 --> 02:53:50.240
any question is not in Wikipedia and it is in our model,

02:53:50.420 --> 02:53:54.120
then in that case, will this answer be given by the model?

02:53:54.760 --> 02:53:56.700
Yes, in that case, the answer will be given by the model if

02:53:56.700 --> 02:53:59.920
you write the system prompt in that way. Okay. That means he

02:53:59.920 --> 02:54:02.340
will not give this system prompt with the model, right? No,

02:54:02.420 --> 02:54:03.640
he will not give this one either. In this case, we are

02:54:03.640 --> 02:54:07.000
saying that you have to use Wikipedia. Correct. So now we

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:10.660
can set the priority in this that you go to Wikipedia first

02:54:10.660 --> 02:54:12.720
and if it is not in it, then… Yes, yes, yes, we do the same

02:54:12.720 --> 02:54:15.240
in agent. The meaning of agent is the same. We are

02:54:15.240 --> 02:54:17.080
explaining to him that how you have to behave. The meaning

02:54:17.080 --> 02:54:19.460
of agent is this. It is said that there is a junior below

02:54:19.460 --> 02:54:21.660
you, okay? So you are basically explaining to him that look,

02:54:22.020 --> 02:54:23.820
if this question comes, then you have to behave like this.

02:54:23.820 --> 02:54:25.180
If this person does not come, then you have to treat him

02:54:25.180 --> 02:54:27.500
like this. Correct. The agent is doing the same work here.

02:54:27.720 --> 02:54:30.600
He is not doing anything else. Okay, sir. And one more

02:54:30.600 --> 02:54:33.740
question, sir. Like now he is coming with the answer from

02:54:33.740 --> 02:54:40.640
Wikipedia. Okay. So the way in which our data is stored in

02:54:40.640 --> 02:54:43.520
Wikipedia, I think this model will be trained in that

02:54:43.520 --> 02:54:46.940
structure only then it will be picked up from there. No, no,

02:54:47.020 --> 02:54:48.600
no, no, no, no. That data is brought by the whole scrapper.

02:54:49.680 --> 02:54:53.060
Like… So then suppose here if I have a company and I have a

02:54:53.060 --> 02:54:56.380
website of my company. Yes. And we just give the URL of the

02:54:56.380 --> 02:54:58.140
website here. So it will pick up the whole HTML, CSS and

02:54:58.140 --> 02:55:03.420
bring it here. HTML, CSS and bring it here. But suppose if

02:55:03.420 --> 02:55:06.000
our data is in HTML and CSS… Okay, let me show you one

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:10.060
thing. Okay, let me show you. Here we make one by feeding

02:55:10.060 --> 02:55:15.080
RSS which reads the data. Okay. Now see what we will do

02:55:15.080 --> 02:55:17.660
here. We will take the URL of Euron. Let's suppose it picks

02:55:17.660 --> 02:55:23.000
up the URL. Okay. We put it in here. Execute the steps. What

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:28.880
happened? Custom field. Ignore SSL. Yes, ignore it. Here

02:55:28.880 --> 02:55:35.040
goes the URL. RSS read. And here we put the trigger point.

02:55:38.400 --> 02:55:41.320
Let's suppose we put the manual trigger.

02:56:10.520 --> 02:56:12.320
RSS should have this.

02:56:15.600 --> 02:56:22.970
RSS feed trigger. Every minute. No. Okay. Every minute. RSS

02:56:22.970 --> 02:56:23.890
feed trigger. Every minute.

02:56:44.990 --> 02:56:48.950
And return. Okay. From here it picked up and brought the

02:56:48.950 --> 02:56:49.470
benchmark.

02:57:09.520 --> 02:57:11.140
No, let's not do this.

02:57:29.460 --> 02:57:31.660
Surper trigger

02:57:34.410 --> 02:57:36.070
manually. Why

02:58:04.800 --> 02:58:05.800
it is not showing me?

02:58:27.880 --> 02:58:34.760
CRP API. Surp API. Okay. Here search Amazon, Baidu, Bing,

02:58:35.080 --> 02:58:43.280
eBay. Surp API. No. know there was other node as well. I

02:58:43.280 --> 02:58:51.040
have used it somewhere. Search Baidu, search Google, search

02:58:51.040 --> 02:58:58.940
YouTube. No, I don't want to do that. C-A-R-C-H, server A,

02:58:59.020 --> 02:59:04.220
install node. I

02:59:17.920 --> 02:59:20.800
think there is some issue with my node otherwise it would

02:59:20.800 --> 02:59:24.340
have given me a result even with RSS feed. No issue sir.

02:59:25.180 --> 02:59:30.900
Search API,

02:59:32.740 --> 02:59:40.100
add a workflow, create a new credential, API key, here we

02:59:40.100 --> 02:59:44.080
will give search API key.

03:00:03.230 --> 03:00:08.030
Basically what we wanted to show here is that you can do any

03:00:08.030 --> 03:00:09.050
Google search or Bing search, you can do any Google search

03:00:09.050 --> 03:00:09.450
or Bing search, you can do any Google search or Bing search.

03:00:09.450 --> 03:00:09.450
We will show you the whole assimilation of all the If you

03:00:09.450 --> 03:00:12.290
want to jump to sites and get data from there. It would give

03:00:12.290 --> 03:00:18.410
you there HTML CSS. We were doing it last night. There is

03:00:18.410 --> 03:00:24.390
some issue with node so I am not able to see

03:00:27.290 --> 03:00:33.040
It's not a big deal, within like 2-3 minutes I can show you

03:00:33.040 --> 03:00:33.240
that.

03:00:46.760 --> 03:00:52.820
RSS read. It should have been done here. One minute.

03:01:28.700 --> 03:01:33.820
Let's take some RSS feed. Give me some RSS.

03:01:41.760 --> 03:01:44.400
Okay, so let's suppose that it's BBC News, right? We have

03:01:44.400 --> 03:01:47.320
added the RSS feed URL of BBC News here. It's not available

03:01:47.320 --> 03:01:49.700
with Euron, it will give 404. We can crawl Euron like this.

03:01:50.480 --> 03:01:55.020
So as soon as we execute here, it will go here and then it

03:01:55.020 --> 03:01:59.680
will pick up all the data available on the site. So here RSS

03:01:59.680 --> 03:02:03.540
feed is enabled. RSS, XML and RSS feed are there. Let's

03:02:03.540 --> 03:02:06.840
suppose that if we want to extract data from our URL,

03:02:08.940 --> 03:02:13.340
so this is one. Here we are giving this URL and it is

03:02:13.340 --> 03:02:16.320
available as a feed. So as RSS feed, I am able to access the

03:02:16.400 --> 03:02:19.200
data. So whenever I am going to activate it, I will be able

03:02:19.200 --> 03:02:22.060
to access it. How to scrap?

03:02:30.420 --> 03:02:33.640
Yesterday we were scrapping the website of Euron and I was

03:02:33.640 --> 03:02:41.800
able to get like a HTML. Some node I have used. So basically

03:02:41.800 --> 03:02:44.140
with the help of this, as we can see we are taking data from

03:02:44.140 --> 03:02:51.380
RSS feed. And let's suppose that if we want to bring it from

03:02:51.380 --> 03:02:52.420
Euron,

03:02:55.000 --> 03:03:01.900
so what we will do is we will type simple http I think that

03:03:01.900 --> 03:03:05.680
will be much simpler. And here what we will do is we will

03:03:05.680 --> 03:03:10.680
open the website of Euron and we will put it here. Execute

03:03:10.680 --> 03:03:15.120
the steps. See, what we did is we took all the HTML data

03:03:15.120 --> 03:03:19.940
from the website of Euron. As you can see over here. Now we

03:03:19.940 --> 03:03:23.380
will ask it to do one thing. You can search keywords from

03:03:23.380 --> 03:03:27.080
here. So this data is like basically I can't read this data.

03:03:27.220 --> 03:03:30.860
Right. This data is not available. Because this is all HTML

03:03:30.860 --> 03:03:34.500
data. Which course information is available? Which course

03:03:34.500 --> 03:03:36.540
information is not available? You can bring all this

03:03:36.540 --> 03:03:41.400
basically whatever data you have read from any page of

03:03:41.400 --> 03:03:44.560
Euron. Or let's suppose we go to a course and we ask it to

03:03:44.560 --> 03:03:46.560
do one thing. Whatever data is available in this course if

03:03:46.560 --> 03:03:51.120
it is openly available then if on this request then do one

03:03:51.120 --> 03:03:54.620
thing. Pick up all its data and bring it. And explain it to

03:03:54.620 --> 03:03:58.340
me basically. See syllabus is given in it. But we can't read

03:03:58.340 --> 03:04:01.780
syllabus. Syllabus is given here. System design, end to end,

03:04:01.900 --> 03:04:05.260
hands on design this that right. So everything is given over

03:04:05.260 --> 03:04:08.240
here. But maybe I can't read this data. It is not available

03:04:08.240 --> 03:04:13.340
in my readable format. We will pass it to agent. Here we

03:04:13.340 --> 03:04:18.740
will pass it to LLM. So not even like I have to pass these

03:04:18.740 --> 03:04:21.920
things to agent. Maybe what we will do here is we will call

03:04:21.920 --> 03:04:26.900
chat model directly or we will pass it to URI. So chat

03:04:28.240 --> 03:04:31.040
OpenAI chat OpenAI

03:04:34.700 --> 03:04:39.640
OpenAI OpenAI chat model We will pass this. And here

03:04:39.640 --> 03:04:43.580
everything is already configured. So when chat received

03:04:43.580 --> 03:04:46.260
means whatever data is coming from there we will put it as

03:04:46.260 --> 03:04:52.520
input. Ok. Whatever data is coming from here Where did this

03:04:52.520 --> 03:04:56.100
come from? Delete Delete

03:05:00.750 --> 03:05:04.870
So basically we will put this in here. When data will come

03:05:04.870 --> 03:05:05.730
from here we will connect it.

03:05:08.650 --> 03:05:12.670
OpenAI OpenAI OpenAI

03:05:17.290 --> 03:05:22.750
chat model Ok. This is configured. Ok. We have done it from

03:05:22.750 --> 03:05:32.690
here. We Basic LLM chain Model This is done. When chat

03:05:32.690 --> 03:05:44.760
message Received We will break it from here. This one This

03:05:44.760 --> 03:05:45.900
one Maybe we will delete it.

03:05:49.660 --> 03:05:56.420
Execute Ok. Now here is the data. Ok. When data will come

03:05:56.420 --> 03:06:03.340
from here We will say ok. Add prompt. Do one thing. Do one

03:06:03.340 --> 03:06:03.720
thing.

03:06:06.700 --> 03:06:13.900
Extract All the Content and give me In a JSON Format. Only

03:06:13.900 --> 03:06:21.380
the Syllabus part Not a HTML Tag at all. Whatever

03:06:21.380 --> 03:06:25.620
instructions we gave it It will work according to it. Ok.

03:06:25.680 --> 03:06:31.560
Execute step. So here this mapping Connect to trigger Define

03:06:31.560 --> 03:06:33.240
below. So prompt

03:06:46.050 --> 03:06:47.530
Ok. Mapping is done.

03:06:56.580 --> 03:06:58.200
Ok. Request this this this

03:07:02.880 --> 03:07:04.160
Execute. Data came.

03:07:09.500 --> 03:07:11.860
Problem is executing in the Workflow. The workflow has an

03:07:11.860 --> 03:07:15.220
issue. Can it execute the region? But yes. Technically

03:07:15.220 --> 03:07:18.500
whatever data is coming from here We are sending it in here.

03:07:18.520 --> 03:07:23.220
And after sending Maybe I can try to attach one Set URL in

03:07:23.220 --> 03:07:31.160
between. So set. Due to this This issue will be given. Then

03:07:31.160 --> 03:07:32.040
clicking on

03:07:37.260 --> 03:07:37.780
Execute.

03:07:41.660 --> 03:07:44.480
Edit field. Close. Connect.

03:07:49.040 --> 03:07:52.180
Name. Data. Value. Data itself.

03:07:55.860 --> 03:07:58.040
Ok. Here it came. Same.

03:08:16.260 --> 03:08:20.020
Something is breaking somewhere here. But ok. This way I can

03:08:20.020 --> 03:08:22.800
try to Give an instruction to this LLM and this LLM Will do

03:08:22.800 --> 03:08:25.260
what? So this LLM will be able to like You know clean the

03:08:25.260 --> 03:08:28.280
data and then give me the output. And instead of this we can

03:08:28.280 --> 03:08:31.340
do this That we remove this from here. And after that we

03:08:31.340 --> 03:08:37.060
remove this from here We put our agent here. So as an Agent.

03:08:37.160 --> 03:08:41.340
So agent I can try To do. Click on AI agent. And then

03:08:41.340 --> 03:08:44.580
connect to a trigger node. Define below. Prompt user

03:08:44.580 --> 03:08:50.080
Message. So Fine. Let me execute The previous step.

03:08:52.830 --> 03:08:53.390
Execute.

03:09:09.880 --> 03:09:14.880
So The previous message will come here. Add prompt. System

03:09:14.880 --> 03:09:23.860
message. Give me only the Syllabus part of it. Ok.

03:09:27.920 --> 03:09:29.780
Chat model. Open

03:09:35.410 --> 03:09:40.850
AI chat model. Gemini. Let me reconnect. Connection Issue

03:09:40.850 --> 03:09:43.990
because it keeps coming. Things fail because of this.

03:09:48.050 --> 03:09:52.610
Save. Close. Back.

03:10:01.800 --> 03:10:12.880
So we have Input. Very bad. Right. And output. Yes. We

03:10:12.880 --> 03:10:15.200
removed the syllabus. That's all we wrote. Give me the

03:10:15.200 --> 03:10:19.620
syllabus part. Spelling of syllabus is wrong. So we want to

03:10:19.620 --> 03:10:24.840
show that We took a URL. Let's suppose you have a private

03:10:24.840 --> 03:10:27.460
URL. Right. And you are getting this data Which is not human

03:10:27.460 --> 03:10:30.640
readable. We brought everything. HTML, Scrap, etc. What did

03:10:30.640 --> 03:10:32.860
we do? We told the agent. We have not installed the tool

03:10:32.860 --> 03:10:36.660
yet. There is no tool here. We made an agent. We gave him

03:10:36.660 --> 03:10:41.660
LLM access. You have chat GPT access. Do one thing. Remove

03:10:41.660 --> 03:10:45.480
the syllabus and give it. He understood. He is smart. And

03:10:45.480 --> 03:10:53.620
then he gave me the output. Ok. Ok. One question. In this

03:10:53.620 --> 03:10:59.020
question. Suppose in this system The URL we have given It is

03:10:59.020 --> 03:11:02.920
of a specific website. Correct. And on that page load All

03:11:02.920 --> 03:11:07.920
the information will come That is our input. But suppose in

03:11:07.920 --> 03:11:12.320
that Suppose any other event Like on the click of a button

03:11:12.320 --> 03:11:20.420
We are getting our data All those events And every thing We

03:11:20.420 --> 03:11:24.580
have to pass such an input. Because we want to get all the

03:11:24.580 --> 03:11:28.260
information Whatever we have got on the site. Right sir. Ok.

03:11:28.480 --> 03:11:31.920
No problem. So multiple HTTP request You are saying here. So

03:11:31.920 --> 03:11:36.000
basically multiple HTTP request You have done one. Then you

03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:39.880
have done two. Second site. Third site. And after that here

03:11:39.880 --> 03:11:41.860
you have Merge node.

03:11:48.920 --> 03:11:51.640
You have to append so many nodes. So here it will create a

03:11:51.640 --> 03:11:56.360
point for you. See. Here it created a point for you. I

03:11:56.360 --> 03:12:01.520
understood this sir. My question was actually not this. My

03:12:01.520 --> 03:12:05.820
question was this. That we have taken One URL of the

03:12:05.820 --> 03:12:09.700
website. In that URL internally If you see then click of a

03:12:09.700 --> 03:12:16.000
button Event is also Embedded on it. Correct. All those

03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:20.940
things What is our If we give URL of any site Then all those

03:12:20.940 --> 03:12:23.100
things internally By understanding and Connectivity with

03:12:23.100 --> 03:12:26.760
which database Can it bring all that information at once?

03:12:27.920 --> 03:12:30.560
Yes, obviously it can bring. So basically you are saying

03:12:30.560 --> 03:12:33.220
crawling there. You are not saying anything else. Every time

03:12:33.220 --> 03:12:36.360
you click a button There is a new action call Which you have

03:12:36.360 --> 03:12:39.080
configured on your website. Correct sir. So all those things

03:12:39.080 --> 03:12:43.460
internally Yes, it is called scrapping. So there you will

03:12:43.460 --> 03:12:46.340
give one URL And then you will write constant Keep on

03:12:46.340 --> 03:12:48.740
searching this product, this product, this product And keep

03:12:48.740 --> 03:12:50.840
on doing this, this, this As you write the instructions here

03:12:50.840 --> 03:12:55.560
It will keep working the same way. Just for crawling It is

03:12:55.560 --> 03:12:59.400
generating your data. Technically it will be the same That

03:12:59.400 --> 03:13:03.420
you will hit the URL. In terms of your chrome or anything

03:13:03.420 --> 03:13:08.420
Whatever you click on the button This is the change. You are

03:13:08.420 --> 03:13:10.780
hitting the URL technically So here it is showing the same

03:13:10.780 --> 03:13:13.340
thing That multiple URL Now this dynamic is coming. In your

03:13:13.340 --> 03:13:15.040
case, basically you want to say That the dynamic will come.

03:13:15.780 --> 03:13:18.500
Where the agent will decide This is the URL, this is the URL

03:13:18.500 --> 03:13:24.040
Then go to this. Yes sir. So fine everyone.

03:13:28.720 --> 03:13:30.380
Hope all of you have enjoyed And it must have been fun in

03:13:30.380 --> 03:13:33.740
