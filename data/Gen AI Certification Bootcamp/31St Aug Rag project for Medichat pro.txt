WEBVTT

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.630
Okay, so hi everyone, good morning, I think I am audible and

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.790
visible to all of you, so please confirm me guys, yes, if I

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.290
am audible and visible to all of you. So we are going to

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.590
start with the class in next like 2-3 minutes, yeah.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.630
I know it is Sunday, so Sunday is going to be bit lazy for

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.290
all of us, but yeah, we do have a class, so,

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.900
hi sir, in fine core whenever you observe the data, it also

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.640
shows the score for each data line, so what is the score,

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.400
what is the calculation again. So basically, it try to

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.740
divide the data into a chunks or like it try to show you the

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.500
score against all the other data sets, so even it shows you

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.920
the data sets, so you can maybe try to do the comparison

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.200
directly, it is not like it is just showing you like scores,

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.000
but also it is showing you a data set, so that is the score

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.040
that I believe it is used to showcase.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.970
Sunday almost equal to Monday, yeah, for a working people,

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.090
so every day is equal to like Monday.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.820
At least till certain age. I believe you, we all should

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.120
work, I don't believe in this work-life balance culture by

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.500
the way and the discussion which happens over the internet,

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.860
because there are some discussion that we should keep over a

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.580
social media, not in a real life, so in real life, so I

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.580
believe we all should work, till a certain age, because

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.960
obviously after certain age, you will not be able to work

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:14.880
with that much of efficiency. So you should work as much as

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.660
possible. And then take a complete rest, enjoy a complete

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.860
life, maybe go for some sports, maybe try to adopt some sort

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.660
of a hobbies, this is what I believe.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.340
Thank you, thought the same, wanted to confirm with the

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.800
code, okay, fine, I used to try with the Python, still

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.680
kernel is crashing, please suggest, then kernel should not

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.020
crash in general, maybe we will have to do a VS code

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.440
reinstallation, maybe VS code, just some of the files are

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.720
corrupt because of that kernel is crashing, otherwise there

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.660
is no reason. So apart from this VS code installation and

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.540
Python dependencies, there is no reason which I say for this

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.720
crash. If your money don't work for you, then you need to

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.000
work whether it is Sunday or Monday, yeah, but money again

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.540
depends upon the ambition that you have, right, some people

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.600
are happy with 100 rupees, some people are not even happy

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.680
with 10,000 rupees, so that's a comparison we are living

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.000
into.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.350
Doing intensive learning, DSA learning, JNI, don't just

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.670
learn, I believe we have leverage with respect to an AI, so

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.870
we can try to sit, we can do a vibe coding, even yesterday

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.270
night till 4 o'clock morning, I was doing a lot of vibe

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.030
coding, I mean like I was building a lot of project, I was

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.030
working a lot of project, so yeah, you can just try to build

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.950
it, maybe without even waiting for someone, try to work on

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.790
some product, right, so that's completely fine. So fine

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.510
guys, in 2-3 minutes, we are going to start.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.960
I think you are. Your audio and video is not in sync, is it

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.900
guys, my audio and video is not in sync, Prajwal is saying

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:10.660
my audio video is not in sync, is it, no, all fine, yeah,

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.000
Prajwal, now you can see the chat, yeah, maybe because of

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.030
your net connectivity, so yeah, audio videos are perfect,

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.730
yes, how

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.160
you manage your sleep time, so mostly I used to sleep at

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.760
night, 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock, so I have given like a, you

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.280
know, instruction to my wife that. Whatever happened,

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.180
doesn't matter, just wake me up at 8 o'clock, 8 o'clock or 8

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:49.560
.30, Janshet Purao sir came to Durga Puja last year, it was

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.780
the time of Durga Puja, no, Durga Puja was almost Visarjan's

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:52.940
time,

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:00.780
he came last year after 7 years, okay, let's get started

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.120
guys, so today we are going to see a small project with

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.820
respect to RAG application, so we talked about vector

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.440
databases and we talked about APIs and all those things. But

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.220
I believe we should build a small application, so today's

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.260
application is not going to be a big one, I have a very very

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.080
big application even with respect to RAG with lot of

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.780
complexity, but I don't think that it's a correct time to

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.860
discuss about those, that kind of application in a live

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.740
class, because we are very new, we are very new to like this

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:38.220
entire generative AI and RAG and coding stuff, so maybe many

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.060
people will stop studying if I am going to discuss that kind

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.740
of a project now, but yeah, that kind of project I will

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.820
discuss for sure inside your classes, once time will come.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:52.240
So today I am going to talk about a small project basically,

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.240
so where we are going to use RAG, we are going to use a

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.100
vector database by the way and those who are not able to

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.460
understand about the RAG, I will try to give you the

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.480
explanation, so don't worry about it, we are going to use a

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.520
vector databases, so I believe we have already like talked

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.340
about a vector database. Okay. So here we are basically

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:17.380
going to use embeddings APIs and we are going to use

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:21.160
basically a LLMs, so all of these things will combine

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.360
together and then eventually we will be able to build a

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.660
final application, that's the whole idea, that's the whole

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.760
motor behind our discussion that we are going to do it

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:35.600
today. So that whatever we have studied so far, we will be

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.740
able to bring all of these things together and we will be

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.560
able to. To build something small, not a big one, something

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:47.040
is small, but yet a very, very effective one. Like I said,

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.500
so I have a lot of like a complex project, but I believe

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.500
it's not a time to, you know, discuss those project inside

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:58.040
this batch. Once time will come, obviously I'm going to talk

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.140
about those complex project as well. Again for like some of

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.600
us, even this will looks a little bit complex. So let me

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.040
share my screen guys and let's start talking about it. Maybe

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.440
a DB was pending as well. Yesterday, so I believe we were

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.680
not able to create the cluster and we can try to create the

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.400
cluster. I have already attached the connection string. So

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.560
connection string is the only thing which is required in

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.240
terms of baby DB. After that, you just save the data and

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:27.470
then search the data. That's it. Why is coding is useful in

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:30.490
which scenario? Every scenario. See why many people think

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:34.230
that that vibe coding means, you know, writing everything

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.510
from the scratch. No, that is not a vibe coding. Believe me.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:42.790
See whenever we do a product development. So basically we do

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:46.190
a product development in a phases, right? So one by one, one

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:49.810
by one, we try to build a feature. I have seen people that

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:55.170
when we talk about a vibe coding, right? So they try to, you

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:58.830
know, build all the feature together in just one single go

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:02.110
by writing one single prompt. Now that is not a correct way

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:06.370
of using a vibe coding by the way. What is the correct way

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:09.750
by the way? So correct way to use a vibe coding or correct

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:13.330
way to do a vibe coding. Is, you know, feature by feature,

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:17.230
start building it. So even in, in, in that way, you will see

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:21.370
that yes, it's working. You will be able to even debug when

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:23.410
you are trying to build something feature by feature,

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:26.130
feature by feature. And believe me, you will be able to

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.750
build up big things or you will be able to make an

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:32.770
enhancement into a very, very big things, right? If you will

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:35.630
try to build all like a hundreds of feature altogether,

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:39.630
believe me, whether you are using a cursor or maybe a

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:43.910
windsor. For me. Any other ID, it is not going to build it

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:47.550
with the perfection, right? So feature by feature or

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:51.070
breaking down things into a small, small problems. I believe

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:55.970
that's a main idea behind doing a vibe coding and if you are

00:10:55.970 --> 00:11:01.650
doing it, then yeah, then it's well and good. Yeah. Okay. So

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:02.910
let's get started guys.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:23.790
Okay. So here goes my screen. So first of all, try to open

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.370
up a VS code. Guys, everyone.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:33.230
Okay. And let me open up my scribble link.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:41.680
Okay. So here, uh, what we are going to build today. So we

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.440
are going to build a chat board by the way, right? Chat

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.400
board is one of the famous application, but this doesn't

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.860
mean that RIG or this entire generative is being used just

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.680
to build a chat bot. No, not like that. We are going to

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.920
build it, but yeah, there are multiple application that we

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.400
can try to build on top of this one. And I'm going to give

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.880
you that as a task. So don't worry, you will be able to get

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.280
challenges as well. Now today's challenge is not going to be

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.320
just a simple, clean task today's challenge is going to be a

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:12.880
project building a small one, not a big one. So here

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:23.260
medical, medical chat system we are going to technically

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:27.120
build. Now what the system will do by the way. So let's

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.940
suppose I have a record of multiple pages. Right? Maybe I

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:35.140
have a record of like a five, 10 or maybe 5,000 or 10,000

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:41.320
patients. Right. And, uh, I have to diagnose a patient maybe

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:45.220
one by one, or maybe like, uh, at a once I have to diagnose

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:49.060
all the patients. Uh, maybe I have to give a suggestion

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:53.380
about a patient or to the patient, right. And maybe I have

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:57.380
to like, uh, uh, without even reading those diagnosis report

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:00.060
because diagnosis report will be very, very lengthy. Let's

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.840
suppose, or maybe a medical history of the patients are

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.900
going to be very, very lengthy. So I don't want to read out

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:10.420
those lengthy report as a doctor or maybe as a consultant,

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:14.940
by the way, what I wanted to do is that, that my chatbot

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:18.600
system should be able to understand those documents and

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.500
eventually it should be able to give me a, uh, somebody or

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.400
maybe whatever question if I'm going to ask, maybe if I'm

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.080
looking for a solution, so it should be able to give me a

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.400
solution. Right. So this is something that we are going to

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.740
build in my today's class. So a medical chatbot, yeah,

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:25.630
I know I was in mute. Sorry. Um, so I just got a call from

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.250
one of the students, he's not able to join. So he was just

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:30.890
trying to call me repeatedly because of meeting ID. I don't

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:32.990
know. It should not ask for the meeting ID by the way, but

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:38.150
yeah, uh, okay. So basically a medical chat system, right.

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:41.810
We are supposed to design, so where, uh, I, as a consultant

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:45.270
can upload our documents as my documents as possible, and

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:48.510
then I will be able to chat with that system. Right. I will

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.010
be able to chat with that particular system. So that is a

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:54.410
kind of a system that I have to design now, how I can design

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:58.330
it, how I can do it. Let's try to understand. So obviously,

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:03.930
uh, if I have to chat with that system, so maybe I can go

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:08.130
ahead with a simple, like a document parsing approach, I

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.830
will be able to like, uh, do it and I will be able to get

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:13.470
some sort of, uh, uh, you know, uh, you know, uh, you know,

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:15.830
uh, you know, uh, reports, or maybe I will be able to get

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:19.410
some sort of a data out of those document. But again, if I'm

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:22.590
looking for a complete diagnosis, if I'm looking for a help

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:25.870
from my LLMs, if I'm looking for a LLMs world's knowledge,

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:29.630
or maybe a real time search. So unless and until it's not a

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.850
RAG application, I will not be able to do it. And this is

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:35.950
where this RAG comes into a picture. So technically, uh,

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:39.130
definition wise, what is RAG? What is this retrieval

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:42.510
augmented generation? Let's try to understand that part. So

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:48.530
what is RAG by the way? What is RAG? So RAG is basically a

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:52.150
technique, right? RAG is basically a technique. So let's

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:55.630
suppose we are chatting with a URI or maybe we are chatting

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:59.430
with some other chat system. So maybe for example, we are

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:02.950
chatting with, uh, chat GPT, maybe a cloud, maybe PopXLT,

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:06.710
anything, right? So in the general, whenever we chat with

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:09.910
those system, so directly, we try to send a query to those

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:12.790
system, right? Directly we try to send a query to those

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:16.150
system and then those system will be able to reply based on

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:19.810
their knowledge. And if they have a search capability, so

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:22.210
obviously they will be able to search over the internet and

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:24.290
then they will try to summarize it and then they will be

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:27.570
able to give the answer. This is technically any kind of a

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:33.990
chat system does, right? Any chat system does. Chat system

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:38.130
does. Now what RAG does by the way? So if I'll talk about

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:40.730
any kind of a retrieval augmented generation. This is the

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:42.510
first generation. This is the full form of RAG. So what RAG

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:47.250
does, so whenever I'm going to fire a query, right, whenever

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:51.270
I'm going to fire a query, so what RAG system does is that,

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:56.370
that it will go and it will try to look into a data or

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:59.450
precisely we try to call it as a knowledge base, right? So

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:02.210
it will try to look into the data. So let's suppose I have a

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:05.410
data, maybe HR document, maybe finance document or maybe for

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:10.050
this medical use cases, a diagnosis report of a multiple

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:13.930
patients. So whenever I try to fire a query, so it looks

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:17.890
into a data. It looks into a data first of all. And then

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:22.550
after looking into a data, it tried to basically retrieve,

00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:25.810
right? So after looking into a data, so it tried to retrieve

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:30.710
maybe a records, a top N record or top K record, you can say

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:35.030
it to try to retrieve top K record, it will try to retrieve.

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:39.450
And then after retrieving this top K record, what it does?

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:44.650
So it tried to combine this query and this retrieved data,

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:48.010
query and this retrieved information, it tried to combine

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:52.270
together, right? It tried to combine together and then this

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:57.510
will go, this will go into the LLM, this will go into LLM or

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:00.170
any other model, any other large level model, it will go

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:03.330
into LLMs, maybe for a summarization, maybe for a searching

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.910
purposes, maybe for the expansion purposes, there could be

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:09.250
any like a N number of different kind of purposes. So it

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:11.810
goes into LLMs. It goes to LLMs. And then eventually we as a

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:15.250
user will be able to get our response. So this is the

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:19.210
complete flow of any RAG application, even with agentic,

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:22.510
agentic means some, some of the things it is going to like a

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:25.550
take care of automatically. But in general, if I'll talk

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:28.350
about any kind of RAG system across the world or anything

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:31.310
that you are going to build today, tomorrow and future. So

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:34.590
this is how the process is going to work. You will send a

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:37.530
query. So here with respect to chat system, you were just

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:40.010
sending the query and then chat system was able to give you

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:43.270
the answer. But in case of RAG application, you will try to

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:46.190
send the query. It will go to data. It will look into the

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:49.730
data. It will try to retrieve a top case similar result or

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:53.270
maybe top one similar result. It will combine query plus a

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:57.350
data and it will send to the LLMs basically. Means the

00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:01.290
reason is very simple. So so we are sending this data to the

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:04.950
LLMs so that I will be able to get a structured record or I

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:08.050
will be able to get basically a structured response. That

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:09.290
was the only reason. That was the only reason. The only

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:12.590
reason behind sending our data or our query plus data to a

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:15.930
LLMs or maybe if I would like to do a some sort of a policy

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:18.890
on top of the result, right? So that is the reason we are

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:22.190
sending it to LLMs because LLMs can do it, right? LLMs can

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:25.990
do it. Maybe if I'm like looking for some sort of a

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:29.130
responses, so where it should understand the patient's

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:32.630
entire summary or maybe a history and it should be able to

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:34.970
do a diagnosis and then finally it should be able to give

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:38.390
you the suggestions as well, which is not available. Maybe.

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:41.070
But we can send this all data. So I can take a help of LLMs

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:45.350
over there, right? But whatever, whatever response it is

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:48.230
trying to give it to you. So all of these response, right?

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:52.370
Technically all of this response should come from or should

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:55.610
be derived from the knowledge base or the data which I am

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:59.530
talking about. Yeah. Data. I'm talking about now. So when I

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:03.830
said data, right, so here this is a place where this vector

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:08.670
DB vector DB comes into a picture. picture. So we have

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:12.710
studied or we have learnt about vector db and we have seen

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:15.250
that we can store anything into a vector database and

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:19.190
obviously we can try to extract a top k result out of what?

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:22.470
Out of a vector database. So this is the reason or this is

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:25.070
the place where vector database comes into a picture because

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:28.710
every time whenever I am trying to file a query, first of

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:32.230
all it will not go to llms, it will go to vector db, it will

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:36.370
try to extract a relevant record first and then and then it

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:39.730
will combine with the query and send it to the llms and llms

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:43.230
is going to do a final work, may be just a polishing, may be

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:47.770
a summarization, may be it is trying to add something as per

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:51.150
the instruction, may be it will try to like search something

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:53.770
from the internet and then attach it and then it is going to

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:56.670
give it to you as a final result. So this is something

00:20:56.670 --> 00:21:00.570
called as retrieval. Retrieval means go to the vector db,

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:04.930
retrieve something, augmented, augmented means enhancement,

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.970
enhancement and then generation. So this is where this rag

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:11.950
names comes into a picture, retrieval, augmented, generation

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:14.650
means I am not looking for the same generation, whatever is

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:17.310
like available in my data set because I know this is

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:20.230
something which is available in my data set, augment it then

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:24.790
give it to me, yes, augment it and then give it to me, as

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:28.050
simple as that. So this is the place where this entire rag

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:31.210
system comes into a picture. So wherever, wherever your

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:35.310
private data will be involved. Right? Wherever your private

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:39.170
data will be involved at that places, you will end up using

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:43.070
a rag and industry wise everywhere as a generative AI

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:45.770
application, you will be able to find out a hell lot of rag

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:49.130
application, right? Not just one, not just two, even in real

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:53.070
time, every time because whatever use cases we are trying to

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:55.570
build across our industry. So obviously we are trying to

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:59.010
build it on a industry's private data, right? My system

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:01.590
should be able to give me a responses based on the private

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:06.090
data and this is the place. This rag comes into a picture.

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:09.230
Is it making sense guys? Are we able to understand the rag?

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:15.210
Yes.

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:32.550
Yep. Okay. Fine. Okay. People are saying, please turn off

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:35.110
the chat. Okay, fine. I'm turning off a chat between each

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:37.110
and every one of you. You will be able to chat with me

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:40.130
directly then. Yeah. Otherwise it will be like a too much

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:44.470
cluttered. So I'll try to keep it on in a last. So then how

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:47.490
does chat GPT store data? Chat GPTC, there is something

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:50.530
called as memory component. So basically try to store data.

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:52.470
Try to like, uh, keep some of the memories or some of the

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:55.390
data into as a catches. And then it is based on that it is

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:58.750
trying to like, uh, give you the responses just to

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:01.630
understand you and your context. That's it. So it is not a

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:03.090
storing all of your data by the way.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:12.640
Okay. So now moving ahead, we can do so many things. I can

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:17.550
see the questions, but yeah, now query is stored in vector

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:20.670
DB. I mean like see query, you should not store into a

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:22.970
vector DB by the way, you should store a data if you would

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:25.210
like to do a logging. So in that case, you can try to store

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:28.370
query into any other databases. Not, uh, because if you are

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:31.370
storing query into a vector database that doesn't make any

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:34.570
kind of a sense, at least in a general purpose use cases,

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:36.370
right? It is not going to make any kind of a sense.

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:44.420
Yeah. Can we consider chat GPT group as a RAG system? No,

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:48.160
these are not a RAG system. These are how they don't have

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.620
access of your private data, right? Unless you're not giving

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:53.480
a private data, how it is going to be the RAG system. Chat

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.400
GPT is basically this system, the system which I have like,

00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:00.020
uh, explained it to you. So they already have like, uh, they

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:01.820
already have. They've already been trained on a huge amount

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.080
of the data. So basically it's a generational model. So

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.200
whenever you are going to fire a query, uh, it will try to

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.540
like, you know, just generate and then it is going to give

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:15.460
you the responses. Yeah. Gemini also RAG system. No, none of

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:18.440
these systems are by default RAG system. Not chat GPT, not

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:22.040
clouding, not pop-up utility, not a Gemini, not any one of

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.600
these. These are technically called as large language model.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:32.060
Yeah. Okay. Fine. So like I said, guys, uh, so like these

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:36.340
are called as basically LLM, LLM, right? LLM that we are

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.900
going to use it over here. So it has already been trained.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.160
It's a generational model that we're talking about, right?

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.680
It just generate. So based on my query, so whatever query,

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:48.060
which I'm going to fire, uh, technically it tried to convert

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:52.500
my English language or my NLP into an embeddings, embeddings

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.460
and numerical vector space. And then it is going to generate

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:59.480
a data, convert it back again into a NLP model. NLP and

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:02.900
natural language that human can understand. And then it, we

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:06.640
try to see the responses over here. RAG system is different.

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:10.480
So basically whenever we try to fire the query, it go into a

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.820
databases, it tried to extract a similar database. It

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:17.060
combines query plus the extracted data, top care result, and

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:20.580
then send it to LLM so that my LLM will be able to give an

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:24.560
answer based on the private data based on the private data,

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:28.340
which is not available to my chat GPT or maybe Gemini or

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:31.280
maybe clouding. Okay. It might be to, uh, perpex litty. Yes.

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:36.300
Okay? Now. So here today we are going to like a CS small

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:39.920
application. So what is, what is that application? So for

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:43.660
example, let's suppose I have a patient right? So I have a

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:47.960
patient number one patient number one and then I have a

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.240
patient number two, I have a basically patient number three.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.160
I have patient number four, I have a patient number five and

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:57.260
for all off these patients, right for all of these patients,

00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:00.460
I have a document. Okay. Say I have basically a report,

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:05.420
reports are available to me for all of these patients. Now

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:09.340
what will happen? So reports are available for all of these

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:14.360
patients. I am going to ingest all of these records into a

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:20.200
vector DB. So into a vector DB. I can use any of these

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:23.200
vector DB. So maybe chroma DB, maybe of Facebook as humanity

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.380
search or maybe pinecone, maybe quadrant, maybe baby at

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.620
anything right or even a Mongo DB. So this supports a vector

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:31.720
database and likewise there are hundreds other database

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:35.940
which is available in this world. So here we have a patient

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:39.080
document, patient one, two, three, four, five and we are

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:43.020
going to ingest those data into a vector DB. That's

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:47.200
completely fine. Okay. Now this is one of the process that

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:50.680
we are going to do it. Obviously if data set is available

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:54.000
into a PDF format, if it is available into a TXT format or

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.900
maybe in any other formats. I will try to process it, I will

00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:00.580
try to write a code for that. Now so once data is available

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:04.860
into a vector database, we are going to build our own chat

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:08.440
interface, a beautiful chat interface we will try to build.

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:12.920
So that we can chat with the system, right, we can chat with

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:18.360
the system and then maybe I can say that give me, give me

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:24.560
report about, report about patient one, something like this.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:27.620
Right. Maybe I can say that, that what is the problem my

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:30.360
patient one is facing. Maybe I can say that, okay, fine,

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:33.160
what is the age of this patient number one, right? I can

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.420
just ask a question in my own way. Just as a natural

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:40.020
language, I will be able to ask the questions. So whenever

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:43.000
I'm going to ask a question over here, right, whenever I'm

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.560
going to ask a question over here, what my system will do.

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:49.020
So my system, this is my query, right? This is my query by

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:51.660
the way. So whenever I'm going to ask a question. So my

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:54.660
system will immediately look into that. Okay. So vector

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:58.660
database, simple. My question will go to the vector database

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:02.940
where all these patients records are available and then as a

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:07.700
result, it is going to extract top K. Yeah. It is going to

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:12.740
extract basically top K result based on the question. So

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:15.780
whatever question which I have asked, now I will try to

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:20.700
combine this question and a top K result with respect to

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.460
this question and send it to what? So basically. So

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:27.140
basically I'm going to send it to my LLM, LLM, right? Maybe

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:30.340
a GPT model, maybe a Gemini model, any other model. So I'm

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:34.180
going to send it to LLMs and whatever instruction which I

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.660
have given that if I have given the instruction that, okay,

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.660
don't just give me the summary or don't just like try to

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:44.180
give me the police version of the retrieval, but also try to

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:47.440
give me some sort of a suggestion. So LLMs are going to give

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:51.120
me the final output and that output will be visible over

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.520
here. That output will be visible over here. That output

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.420
will be visible over here as a chat solution. So now what,

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:59.120
what is the advantage I will be able to get of this

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:02.220
particular system? So let's suppose I have a 10,000 patient

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:06.360
record, right? 10,000 patients record. I don't want to read

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.140
out all of their document because it's, it's very tough for

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:12.260
me, right? 10,000 document and let's suppose in one

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.900
document, if there are like a 10 pages, even 10 pages. So 10

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:19.260
,000 into 10, it will become a hundred K, one lakh, right?

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.120
So one lakh pages. Now no one is having a patient to, you

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.660
know, go through one lakh. How pages basically. So maybe I

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:28.300
can try to search by the patient name, patient ID, diagnosis

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.600
report, whatever, whatever comes in my mind. I can just do

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.520
it. I can just like a chat with it and my system will be

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:36.420
able to give me a response and I will be able to get the

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:39.380
policy responses right in this way. I will be able to look

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:42.500
into those one lakh pages, those hundred K pages basically,

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:46.160
right? So that is the advantages I will be able to get. So

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:49.340
whether there is a 10,000 records and going forward, maybe

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:53.200
like a 10 lakh record, it is going to work. Right?

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.780
Eventually it is going to work for me and it will be a

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.760
scalable till any kind of a limit till any kind of a extent.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:05.240
So this is the RAG based system, RAG based system we are

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.520
going to build it today inside the class. Is it making sense

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:14.100
guys? Please explain a little about the top K. I think guys,

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.740
expectations that we are setting inside the class is very

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:21.380
wrong. You should join a class regularly because when you

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.680
ask this kind of a questions, right? So it clearly shows

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:26.700
that you are not sincere about the class and you are not

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:30.160
even joining a class on a regular basis because when you say

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.020
top K, right, more than a hundred times we have discussed in

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:37.960
last three classes just about top K, yeah, just about top K.

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.700
So when you are asking the question, try to ask a genuine

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:45.720
question, obviously I will be happy to answer but when I

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.380
have already answered some question more than a hundred

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:50.560
times, you should not ask this question and I will not even

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.640
give you the answer for that.

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:57.820
Yeah, because it shows you basically you are like a

00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:01.120
seriousness and your sincerity inside the class, clearly

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:06.750
shows your sincerity inside the class, okay. So now let us

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:09.150
start building it guys, yeah, let us start building this

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:12.150
entire system bit by bit, bit by bit. Like I said, it is

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:14.510
going to be a very basic system, it is not a complex one to

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:18.050
build. Today itself we all will be able to build it, yeah,

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:20.910
we all will be able to build it.

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:27.980
So now let us start guys.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:41.960
Yeah, so just open up your VS code and then we will start

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:45.040
building this system. So first of all, go to your VS code

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:51.600
and then try to create a folder. So click on open folder and

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:58.120
then over here, so Medichat pro is the folder name which I

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:02.800
am trying to give RAG, yeah, so just give any name to the

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:07.700
folder and try to create a folder. Simple. Medichat pro is

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:09.960
the folder name which I have given. You can give your name,

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:15.740
my name doesn't matter at all. Now so here what we are going

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:20.520
to do, so we are going to step by step do the coding and I

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:24.380
will be using obviously like a vector database wise some of

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:29.400
the databases. I will be using LLM wise some of the LLMs.

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:33.920
Obviously I am going to use LLMs from a URI API, right. You

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:36.020
can try to use some LLMs from outside. That's completely

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:39.180
okay with me. I don't have any kind of an issue. I will be

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:43.340
using embedding again from a URI by the way. You can try to

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:46.280
use any other embedding. That's again not an issue at all

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.240
because we have already used it and I have already shown you

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:52.200
that how to use something like a from outside. But yeah,

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:54.860
most of the things we are going to use it from a Euron

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:57.880
ecosystem itself so that you are not going to face any kind

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:01.160
of a problem. So first of all, let's do one thing inside

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.700
this, try to create one more folder called as sample data. S

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:09.600
A M P L E. S A M P L E underscore data where we are going to

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.300
keep our data. All of these data set, we are going to keep

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:16.540
it inside this sample data. Now what kind of a sample data I

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:21.680
can try to keep? So I have this medical history PDF, right.

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:24.240
Now if I am going to show you like how this PDF actually

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.560
looks like. So let me do that.

00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:38.050
Yeah. So here I have a data set. Technically I have a PDF

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:43.010
about the patient. Yeah. Yeah. So you will be able to find

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:46.630
out a report about a patient. So it's a simple PDF that I

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:49.750
have taken. So where allergies, medication, surgery, notes

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:53.330
or age, John Dewey, history, all of these things are

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:57.510
available. So likewise, I have a multiple PDF which is

00:33:57.510 --> 00:34:00.550
available to me. So again, Janus Smith.

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:11.660
Again Michael Lee is another like patient. Emily Clark. back

00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:18.480
and then we have basically we have Patel, so these are the

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:22.380
PDFs that I have and again so inside that patient name is

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:24.500
mentioned, allergies are mentioned, medication is mentioned,

00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.940
surgery is mentioned, notes is mentioned and little bit

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:31.080
about the patient is already mentioned, so likewise I can

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:34.660
have 10,000 PDFs or maybe like a lakhs of PDFs that's

00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:38.840
completely fine, that's completely fine, so we have all of

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:42.220
these PDFs and we are going to use this particular PDF for

00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:46.260
our application, I can have maybe like a thousands of PDFs

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:48.700
that's completely fine because if it is going to work for

00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:52.540
this 6 PDFs, it is going to work for another 6,000 or even 6

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:57.340
lakh of the PDFs, right, so and these are the simple simple

00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:00.080
PDF I have taken, I have not taken like a complex PDFs where

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:03.820
I have basically images or maybe graphs, maybe some sort of

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:07.840
formulas because in that kind of a situation, so you have to

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:11.460
use a better PDF parser, yeah. You will have to use

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:14.580
basically a better PDF parser but as of now, I have just

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:18.320
taken the simple one and so that I will be able to parse it

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:22.140
with the simple library, PI to PDF, basically PDF to, PI to

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:25.840
PDF and I will be able to extract all of these data set out

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:30.980
of this one. Now let me send this entire data to all of you,

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:33.840
so it's available inside

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:38.170
midi

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:42.590
chat, so

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:08.660
I am sending you this PDF guys. Okay. So

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:55.030
I have just pinged you the drive link guys, so where this

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:58.110
PDFs are available, so you can download this PDF inside your

00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:05.230
system, yeah. Just send it, send it to you inside a chat, so

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:07.510
I think it's accessible and available to all of you now.

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:15.710
Yes, everyone, are you able to access it, are you able to

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:16.150
download it,

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:23.980
yeah, okay, fine, I can see yes, okay,

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:57.780
done everyone, so please try to create a folder inside your

00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:01.780
VSCode and keep all of it. All of these PDFs inside your

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:06.060
VSCode, yeah, just keep your PDF, just like I am keeping a

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:09.040
PDF inside my, or maybe create some other folder, that's

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.820
completely fine, just the name that I have given, done

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.220
everyone, yeah,

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:21.200
okay, done. I can see like a lot of yes over here, now, you

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.720
will not be able to see a chat conversation between each and

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:26.020
every one of you because it's like a little bit disturbing,

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.840
but yeah, I can see your chat, okay,

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:45.290
now, sure, it's not an issue, yeah. Okay. I have PDF in the

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:49.290
same data folder now, yes, copy to, fine, okay, now, let's

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:52.170
go to the next step, yeah, next step, now, what is the next

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:55.950
step, by the way, guys, so next step is to create a

00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:59.450
requirement.txt file because we are going to create a

00:38:59.450 --> 00:39:03.050
separate environment and we are going to do a separate

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:05.530
installation, separate setup with respect to this particular

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:10.170
project, right, so here, we are going to create one file, a

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:16.550
requirement.txt file, so R-E-Q-U, R-E-Q-U-I-R-E-M-E-N-T-S

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:21.710
.txt, spelling, you should keep as it is, right, no

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:27.210
uppercase, only lowercase, spelling requirements, S, S, many

00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:30.130
people used to make a lot of mistakes in a beginning, so

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:33.030
they try to keep requirement, which is not a correct one,

00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:35.630
your system will not be able to recognize it. Once you will

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:39.070
go for the installation or you will go for the deployment,

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:43.290
so requirements R-E-Q-U-I-R-E-M-E-N-T-S and again, going

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:46.090
forward, I am not going to tell you again, yes, going

00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:50.630
forward, so I am going to like just go ahead and use it, so

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:55.750
find requirements.txt is available to me, now, what I am

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:58.510
going to keep inside a requirement.txt, by the way, so

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:01.210
inside my requirements.txt, I am going to keep couple of

00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:03.570
things, so these are the things which I am going to keep,

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:07.270
guys, inside my requirement.txt. So the very first thing

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:10.370
which I am going to keep it over here is a streamlint, the

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:14.170
streamlint is for what, so streamlint is basically for a UI

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:17.710
creation, a beautiful UI interface we are going to create

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:22.670
and for that, so we are going to use a streamlint, a PDF, PI

00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:25.870
PDF, so basically these are the libraries which is going to

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:28.830
help me out in terms of processing my PDF because I am

00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:32.490
keeping my data in what data format, in a PDF data format,

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:35.330
right, there is a possibility that I could have this. So, I

00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:38.670
am going to put this entire data into maybe S3 bucket, into

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:41.830
Azure blobs, maybe into my Google Drive, there is a

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:44.450
possibility and even there is a possibility that I will be

00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:47.950
able to read out all of those data from those

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:53.110
locations because going forward, what I will do, I will not

00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:56.330
keep a data inside my local system, right, maybe I will try

00:40:56.330 --> 00:40:59.310
to keep a data into some S3 bucket, maybe into like Azure

00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:02.230
blobs, maybe into my Google Drive and then from there,

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:05.430
programmatically, I will try to read those data, not in a

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:08.050
manual way, right. I will try to keep a data in a manual

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:11.530
manner, but yeah, ideally, even in your organization, data

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:14.850
will be available somewhere in a cloud location, maybe into

00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:17.530
S3 bucket or maybe in some server, so whatever server that

00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:19.890
your company is using, so in that server, data will be

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:22.230
available, someone is going to give you the URL, user ID and

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:25.410
password or maybe an API key access and then you will be

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:29.810
able to access it, fine guys, so these are the things that

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:33.450
you have to keep inside a requirement.txt, now I have

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:35.570
already pinged you this one inside your chat, so please copy

00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:37.530
and paste, quick. Yeah,

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:44.170
okay,

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:53.480
now, so this one is done, requirement.txt is created, now

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:57.600
what is next that we have to do? So once this requirement

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:02.480
.txt is created for all of us, so let us try to create a

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:07.260
folder, one more folder called as app. or sorry, just app

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:10.480
folder, yeah, so where we are going to create a Python file

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:13.120
and we are going to keep all of these processes inside this

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:17.100
one, now inside this requirement.txt. Yeah. So I am using a

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:19.640
Facebook as similarity search database, right, as you can

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:23.520
see, a lang chain, so lang chain is basically a framework,

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:26.720
but I am not going to use a lang chain framework basically

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:30.520
for like a agentic approach, so basically I am going to use

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.840
a lang chain framework because inside a lang chain

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:36.700
framework, there are some basic and very, very simple,

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:39.580
right, a very, very simple functions are available, which

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:42.640
will help me out in terms of processing the data, generally,

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:45.580
lang chain, lang graph, LAMA indexes, all of this framework

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:49.500
has been used to, for a agentic approach, but apart from

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:52.340
that, they have already created some of the functionalities,

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:55.740
some of the functions, which is going to make my life little

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:58.460
bit easier, so instead of writing 100 line of a code, maybe

00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:01.500
in one line, I will be able to process the file, that is the

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:04.600
only reason I am going to use a lang chain, not for the

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:07.340
agentic purposes, we have not discussed about the agentic

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:09.840
approach as of now, so I am not going to use a lang chain

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:12.080
for the agentic approach and you will see, very soon you are

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:17.300
going to see it. URI AI, right. So, so far, we have been

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:21.520
using URI by writing a simple chat completion code or

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:26.480
embedding code, but we have pushed basically a URI SDK as

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:31.140
well and URI SDK is available as a, by the name URI AI, so

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:34.040
we are going to use that one and similarly, sentence

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:36.540
transformer is coming from hugging face, by the way, yeah,

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:39.580
so it is from a hugging face library, so fine, leave

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:42.900
everything as it is, create an app folder, now inside this

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:46.760
app folder, right, inside this app folder, so one by one,

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:50.860
one by one, let us start creating a file, so the very first

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:56.320
file which I will be creating over here, yeah, so the very

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:59.380
first file which I am going to create over here is called as

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:04.480
pdf underscore utils dot py file, so here I am going to

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:08.180
write a code which will help me out in terms of, you know,

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:12.180
reading a pdf file, so whatever pdf file that I will be

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:14.780
having, so it will just try to read the pdf file, it will

00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:16.540
try to extract the data. Okay. So it is a very simple

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:19.940
utility function, I am going to write it down, so here I can

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:25.400
like a call from, but before that, yeah, before that I have

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.720
a requirement dot txt file, right, I have a requirement dot

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:31.200
txt file, so before that let us do one thing, so let us try

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.900
to do the configuration of the environment, so that I will

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:36.240
be able to execute and then I will be able to, you know,

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:42.900
test it. So in the general, I suggest to everyone that try

00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:46.940
to go ahead with the python 3.10 environment, even with

00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:51.960
python 3.131211 it is going to work, but it is always better

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:57.020
to use python 3.10, it is a most compatible version, not a

00:44:57.020 --> 00:45:00.220
stable one, because even 1.3 is a stable one, but it is a

00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:03.060
compatible version with most of the tools and other

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:05.300
libraries, that is the reason why I keep on suggesting that

00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:08.620
try to use a python 3.10. Now if I have to create the

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:10.960
environment, right, how I can create the environment by the

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:14.600
way guys? So simple. I believe we have already created the

00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:18.820
environment so many times. Okay. So conda create hyphen n

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:22.300
and then python hyphen n, I can try to give maybe an

00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:26.380
environment name. So environment name is medi chat, medi

00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:30.020
chat pro, let's suppose this is the environment name I have

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:34.820
given. So conda create hyphen n and then python is equals to

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:39.440
3.10. This is the command by which I will be able to create

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:43.300
it with the conda, right? So I believe even last time, so we

00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:45.620
did the same thing. So with the help of conda, we were

00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:47.740
trying to create the environment. I think last to last class

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:52.240
itself. Now hit enter and it will start creating the

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:52.580
environment.

00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:09.240
Fine. So everyone just do it quickly.

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:33.630
Okay. So environment creation is done. I have already pinged

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:36.330
you the command, it's available inside your chat and if I

00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:39.550
have to activate that one, so simple conda activate and then

00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:41.950
whatever environment that you have given, so you have to

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:45.870
just do it and it will end up creating or it will end up

00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:48.350
activating your environment. As you can see, my environment

00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:53.470
is activated, fine. So my environment is basically

00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:56.630
activated. Medi chat pro environment is activated. Now in

00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:59.930
this environment, I'll have to install everything which I

00:46:59.930 --> 00:47:03.030
have mentioned inside my requirement dot txt file. So let's

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:06.150
do it. How I can install it? So to install each and

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:11.430
everything, so you have to write pip install, install hyphen

00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:14.390
r, hyphen r means you are trying to install everything from

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:17.550
a requirement dot txt. So pip install hyphen r requirements

00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:20.670
dot txt and it should be available in the same folder.

00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:24.410
Otherwise it will give you the issue that file not found. So

00:47:24.410 --> 00:47:28.070
pip install hyphen r requirement dot txt and in one single

00:47:28.070 --> 00:47:31.190
sort, it will try to install everything that is available

00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:34.650
inside your requirements dot txt file. So whatever is

00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:36.830
available here, it will end up installing it.

00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:54.570
So I believe everything has been installed. Done everyone.

00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:58.010
Are we able to install it? All of these commands are already

00:47:58.010 --> 00:48:02.690
available guys. Inside your chat, done,

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.790
okay, fine.

00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:16.230
Now so installation is done, right? Now close it. So once

00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:19.730
everything is done, just close it and come back to this pdf

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:22.390
underscore util dot pi file. So where I'm going to write a

00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:24.670
function, a small, very, very small function, so which will

00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:29.430
help me out in terms of reading out the pdf. So here from pi

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:36.160
pdf, from pi pdf import.

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:44.460
A pdf reader, simple,

00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:53.170
only pdf reader I need, I don't need a writer, by the way, I

00:48:53.170 --> 00:48:59.350
just have to like read the pdf, okay. Now so from typing

00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:04.550
import list and then maybe from io import

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:08.810
byte io, all of these things are not required. I'm not going

00:49:08.810 --> 00:49:11.890
to use it, but yeah, as a part of part of completion, so I'm

00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:15.550
just trying to like import each and everything. Which is not

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:19.250
going to create any kind of a harm for me. Now here I'm

00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:24.390
going to write a function, a function extract, extract text

00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:29.750
from pdf. So it is going to take a file and then it is going

00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:35.130
to use a pdf and then it will be able to extract each and

00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:38.650
everything. So as you can see, this is the function. Now it

00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:44.290
is going to take a file basically. And then it is. Let me

00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:49.330
remove this. This symbol things, yeah, okay. So basically it

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:51.630
is going to take a file, whatever file that we are going to

00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:54.890
pass this entire function. This is just a function like a

00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:59.690
doc string, which has been mentioned, okay, remove this one.

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:04.770
Now it is going to read a pdf file by using a pdf reader. So

00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:07.570
it will try to keep all of these data inside this one. Let

00:50:07.570 --> 00:50:12.170
me keep this as a simple string, not as a list, yeah. So I'm

00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:14.370
just modifying this auto completion because auto completion

00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:18.690
was incorrect according to me. Now from pages, readers dot

00:50:18.690 --> 00:50:22.690
pages, one by one, one by one, just try to read the page and

00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:30.730
here. So we can try to write text is equals to text plus

00:50:30.730 --> 00:50:39.590
pages dot extract text. Or I can say, or maybe blank, just a

00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:44.890
blank over here and then return basically a text. So return

00:50:44.890 --> 00:50:51.210
a text. By the way. So this is the simple plain code guys,

00:50:51.330 --> 00:50:53.910
which has been written. So what it will do, it will try to

00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:56.970
use this pdf reader as you can see, whatever file that we

00:50:56.970 --> 00:51:00.310
are trying to pass. So it will try to take this file, read

00:51:00.310 --> 00:51:03.510
it and page by page, page by page, page by page, it will

00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:06.850
extract the data, extract a text basically, right, it will

00:51:06.850 --> 00:51:09.670
try to extract the data. It will keep on appending it and

00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:13.350
return the final text means if I have a pdf, these many

00:51:13.350 --> 00:51:16.170
pdfs. So it will go to one of these pdfs once we are going

00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:19.490
to pass it and then one by one extract a data and finally

00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:23.990
return the text from one pdf, right, one pdf. So this is one

00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:28.670
of the small utility function that we have. Making sense to

00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:35.390
all of us guys, yeah, making sense. Do the pdfs need to be

00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:38.030
in same format, same format means I am not able to get your

00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:41.310
question by the way. Yeah. Simple pdf function that we have

00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:43.750
written over here. So this is one of the utility function.

00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:45.930
So this is one of the utility function that we have. Now

00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:50.470
what is next? So once we are able to write this utility

00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:55.830
function, maybe we can try to create one more file over here

00:51:55.830 --> 00:52:00.790
and I can give a name to this file as a CONFIG.py file,

00:52:00.970 --> 00:52:05.070
CONFIG.py file. Now here I am going to keep a configuration.

00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:08.950
Now what configuration? So I need API key. So maybe I can

00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:13.210
try to like create a variable called as URI API underscore

00:52:13.210 --> 00:52:18.590
key. And then I am going to keep my API key over here. So

00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:21.450
whatever API key that I have with respect to an URI, I can

00:52:21.450 --> 00:52:24.850
try to keep it over here. So how I will be able to create a

00:52:24.850 --> 00:52:29.450
URI API key by the way, I think we all know the game. Yeah.

00:52:29.590 --> 00:52:33.170
So I can go to your own website. I can go to URI API. I can

00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:38.110
click on API key, create API key and then give any name and

00:52:38.110 --> 00:52:41.930
a HTTP 400. What happened?

00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:52.940
Okay. Yeah. Able to create it. So this is my URI API key. So

00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:56.720
I'm like going to keep it here and whenever it will be

00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:59.940
required. So I'm going to use this API key by the way. So

00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:04.860
inside a CONFIG.py file. So simple guys, inside a CONFIG.py

00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:08.380
file, try to keep a URI API key and again, so we try to do a

00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:10.520
lot of configuration. This is just one of the configuration

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:14.020
that we are talking about as of now. But going forward, so

00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:16.700
as we will keep on involving multiple databases, so

00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:19.160
obviously my configuration is going to increase, right?

00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:22.600
Configuration is going to increase. I can try to keep it

00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:25.640
inside .env file. I can try to keep it inside a YAML file.

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:30.000
Anything is fine. Yeah. Anything is fine. And again in a

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.120
production, so maybe I can try to remove this configuration

00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:36.780
file and I can try to set a configuration in a tab which any

00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:40.540
deployment environment uses to provide. So that is also an

00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:43.020
option which is available to me. So not just one, two

00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:46.300
option. I have multiple options basically to keep my

00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:49.000
configuration. My configuration or my settings by the way,

00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:52.500
going forward. So in every like a lectures, we'll try to see

00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:55.100
something different, something different so that we'll end

00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:58.880
up using all of these, right? But this is not just a one of

00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:04.040
the way simple, okay, fine. Now close it. So CONFIG.py file

00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:07.220
we are able to create and PDF utility file we are able to

00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:13.720
create now. So let's try to create a basically one more file

00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:18.800
for our vector. So here create a new file and I'm going to

00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:26.460
name it as a vector V C T O R S T O R E V C T O R S T O R E

00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:31.300
vector store underscore UTUtils

00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:35.000
.py file. So here just try to create a vector store utility

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:39.380
file. And inside this vector store utility file, I'm going

00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:44.100
to like write a code by which it will be able to create our

00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:48.320
indexes. Indexes for Facebook as similarity search or and

00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:52.800
then it will be able to even do a retrieval of the data

00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:55.020
because these two things are required. So first of all, I

00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:57.880
have to store the data as we can see, right, we have to

00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:00.640
store the data and then I have to retrieve the data. These

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:03.160
are the two functions, two operations that we have to

00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:06.280
perform with respect to our vector databases. This is what

00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:09.360
has been mentioned over here, right? So we have to first of

00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:12.560
all store the data and then we have to retrieve the data or

00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:17.380
top K result we have to retrieve. Right, everyone, yeah, two

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:19.400
operation we have to do with respect to vector DB, right?

00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:26.540
One storage, second retrieval, yes or no,

00:55:30.090 --> 00:55:33.770
PDF format meaning, see PDFs always try to keep an

00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:38.290
unstructured data. So there is like a not even a discussion

00:55:38.290 --> 00:55:42.230
about like a format should be same or not, right? So

00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:44.470
whenever we are talking about PDF, it simply means that we

00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:47.690
are talking about a complete unstructured data. Even if

00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:49.510
tables are available. Still it's unstructured.

00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:59.500
Okay, so now we have to store our data. So for a storage we

00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:02.360
can write a function and then for a retrieval we can try to

00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:05.640
write a function. Now this is where I'm going to use a lang

00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:08.720
chain because lang chain provides you a very simple

00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:12.760
function, just one liner function which will be able to do a

00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:16.580
job which you can write maybe by using 10 line or 20 lines.

00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:19.280
We have already done that in the past, so Facebook AI

00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:22.100
similarity search is nothing new for us. And we have already

00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:25.220
used it in my past, right? In my past we have already used

00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:29.360
it. But maybe we have written 10, 20 line of a code over

00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:32.840
there to, you know, store the data, to retrieve the data, to

00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:36.440
find out top K by the way. Maybe I can use a lang chain

00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:38.960
functions which is going to make my life a little bit easier

00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:42.440
or I can go even in old way. So I already have a code copy

00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:46.620
paste simple to do the storage and to do the retrieval, to

00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:51.380
do the top K search. So here what I will do. So let's try to

00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:59.100
do the import from lang chain, lang C H A H A I N lang C H A

00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:06.990
I N lang chain underscore community, community dot vector

00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:11.590
store import chroma.

00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:15.030
You can try to import Farsi. You can try to import pine

00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:17.910
cone. You can try to import a waviate. So they are giving

00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:21.170
you all of these like a shorthand functions inside a lang

00:57:21.170 --> 00:57:25.030
chain. For all this popular databases, uh, I'm going to use

00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:28.170
technically a Facebook AI similarity search. Yeah. So I'm

00:57:28.170 --> 00:57:34.190
going to use F A I S S basically. So this will be my users

00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:36.370
by the way. So I'm just trying to import lang chain

00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:39.290
underscore community C O double M U N I T Y spelling is

00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:43.850
correct V C T U R S T U R E S. Okay. So just do the import.

00:57:44.170 --> 00:57:52.940
And then from lang chain underscore community, C O double M

00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:53.280
U N I T Y spelling is correct. And then from lang chain

00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:57.240
underscore community, try to import embeddings and maybe I

00:57:57.240 --> 00:58:00.440
can try to import a hugging face embeddings over here.

00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:10.580
Right. And, uh, yeah, so from typing, try to import a list.

00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:14.480
So I have done the import. I'm just trying to use a lang

00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:17.420
chain. So lang chain, uh, from there I'm going to use a

00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:19.740
Facebook as similarity search because Facebook as similarity

00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:22.320
search function is also available inside the lang chain. And

00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:26.320
then in terms of embedding, I can try to use URI embeddings

00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:30.000
or I can try to use a hugging face embeddings. And from

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:33.120
hugging face, I can try to use any of this given model

00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:36.360
reason is very simple why I'm going ahead with hugging face

00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:40.580
in terms of embeddings, uh, because you have a one lakh

00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:44.180
token, right? You have one lakh token per day. Obviously

00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:48.500
this embeddings is going to be one time job, but I believe

00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:50.940
we already had this kind of a discussion in our previous

00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:54.900
classes. So we have to convert anything into embeddings and

00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:57.500
we have one lakh token and let's suppose I have a 10,000

00:58:57.500 --> 00:59:00.860
documents. One lakh token will not be sufficient. Let's

00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:03.420
suppose in a single PDF itself, I have a hundreds of pages.

00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:06.220
Again, one lakh document is not going to one lakh token is

00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:09.080
not going to be sufficient. So that is the reason. So I'm

00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:11.500
showing you approach with respect to hugging face rest. I

00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:14.060
think we all know, just try to call generate embedding

00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:17.680
function, pass the data, work done as simple as that. Right.

00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:22.340
So let's do it. Oh, uh,

00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:35.340
hugging face embeddings. Yeah. So just try to import all of

00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:39.020
these and then I have to write the function. So first

00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:46.200
function is going to be create underscore F AI SS underscore

00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:49.860
index. So first of all, I have to store the data into a

00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:54.000
vector DV as per my diagram. So I have to store all of these

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:57.080
PDFs, whatever data which I'm going to read from here. So I

00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:59.760
have to store all of these data where I have to store all of

00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.800
this data into a vector DV. So for a storage, maybe we can

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:06.800
try to, uh, like, uh, write a function, right? I can try to

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:10.360
write the function. So for a storage, I have to convert my

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:13.280
data into embeddings and then I can store because vector DV

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:18.340
is going to store only embeddings. Right. Or maybe as a

01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:20.500
metadata, I can restore my original data as well. But yeah,

01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:23.200
so vector DB is basically going to store the embeddings.

01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:28.840
Embeddings. Right. So first of all, I have to read. So for

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:31.680
reading, I have already written the function. Then I have to

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:35.940
basically store those data after converting those data into

01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:39.240
an embeddings. So for our embeddings, like I said, I'm going

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:42.060
to use a hugging face embeddings. I have so many PDF

01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:45.140
documents and my one lakh token limit is not going to be

01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:50.020
sufficient. Otherwise I can try to use, uh, embedding for

01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:55.440
my, uh, URI as well. So create a Facebook AI index and here.

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:58.960
So I'm going to pass a text, right? I'm going to basically

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:02.560
pass a text inside a list of the text. You can say I can try

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:08.100
to pass and eventually it is going to convert that into an

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:11.900
embeddings into a numerical vector by using what hugging

01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:14.600
face embedding. So let's suppose I'm going to use this

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:19.080
model. So mini LM L two V, uh, or maybe like, uh, there are

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:21.720
so many models I can, I can try to use something from even,

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:22.000
uh,

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:30.210
Mr. Series. So. So there are tons of models which is already

01:01:30.210 --> 01:01:32.630
available, right? Tons of models which is already available

01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:36.230
inside hugging face. So you can feel free to use any of your

01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:39.730
model. That's completely fine. So here what

01:01:43.090 --> 01:01:46.910
I can do, so I can try to call hugging face embeddings,

01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:52.510
hugging face embeddings. I can try to call and then inside

01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:55.610
that I can try to provide a model name.

01:02:05.790 --> 01:02:11.370
Model name is this. Let me, this is not required. Yeah. So

01:02:11.370 --> 01:02:13.630
inside that I'm trying to provide basically a model name

01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:15.350
and, uh, here.

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:28.500
So embeddings, embeddings is equals to hugging face

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:31.180
embeddings. So this is the variable and this is the model

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:35.880
name which I have created. Let me check the spelling. Okay.

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:39.700
Now spelling is correct. So I'm using this one. So this is

01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:44.820
basically model which I'm going to use and then what I'm

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:50.540
going to do, so it should return, return what, R-E-T-U-R-N,

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:54.600
it should return basically what? So Facebook AI from a text,

01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:57.520
uh, Facebook AI similarity search, this is the library from

01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:00.980
a text, whatever text which I'm going to pass, whatever text

01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:04.420
I'm going to pass, it will be using this model, simple, it

01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:07.500
will be using this model and then it will be storing this

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:10.820
entire things into a Facebook AI similarity search db. So

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:14.180
just in two line guys. So one line where I'm trying to load

01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:17.780
the model, right? And another line where I'm trying to do

01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:21.900
the storage. So just in two line my work will be done and I

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:24.840
will be able to store my data into a Facebook AI similarity

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:27.520
search. That is the reason. So I have used this library,

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.640
this functionality from a langchain community because they

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:35.640
have made my life easy just in one single line, pass the

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:39.100
data and then pass the model and rest will be taken care by

01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:44.540
this library itself. Yes, everyone. Yeah. So basically

01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:48.940
someone is saying that we use index dot add now know that

01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:52.060
you use it when you are using a Facebook as an ID says

01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:56.180
library directly. I'm using this library from our language

01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:58.940
chain. So they have basically build a wrapper on top of it.

01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:01.660
So which is going to take only two things and then it is

01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:05.480
going to work exactly like same, right? Is that the same as

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:07.900
the one that we have done? If you would like to like a use

01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:11.600
that code, use it. That's completely fine. See, at the end

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:14.300
of the day I have to store something. You do my Facebook as

01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:18.100
an ID says database, right? So we previously we have used

01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:20.860
our piece of the code, a piece of the library. So which is

01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:23.680
coming directly from a Facebook AI similarity search library

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:28.460
here just to make my job easier. I'm just using a wrapper

01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:31.100
from a langchain community. Technically both are same,

01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:34.440
right? Technically both are same. So you can try to use this

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.980
one or maybe you can go ahead with the five line of a code

01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:40.360
that's up to you. So I'm trying to pass the model and then

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:43.720
I'm trying to like a store the entire data. So this is going

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:47.180
to store whenever I'm going to call this function. And if

01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:50.400
I'm going to pass the data, it will automatically convert

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:53.860
those data into vector and then the store it as simple as

01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:58.240
that. So this is one of my function. Now the second function

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:01.420
that I have to write to retrieve the data. So storage is

01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:04.940
done, right? Storage function is done. Then maybe I can

01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:08.180
write a function to retrieve the data. So RETRIVE, RETRIVE,

01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:09.900
RETRIVE, RETRIVE, RETRIVE, RETRIVE, RETRIVE, RETRIVE,

01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:13.360
RETRIVE, RETRIVE, RETRIVE, RETRIVE, RETRIVE, RETRIVE. So

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:16.560
here whenever I have to like, retrieve the data, like I have

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:20.280
to retrieve the data. So what I am supposed to do? So

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:24.620
basically I'm supposed to pass vector storage, so wherever

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:28.160
I'm storing the data. So I'm supposed to pass basically

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.700
what. I'm supposed to pass the vector storage.

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:36.520
Vector storage. So let's suppose my vector storage is like

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:39.820
this one inside our facebook as similarity search I'm trying

01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:43.380
to store the data and then I have to pass a query whenever

01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:45.880
I'm looking looking for data retrieval so query and then

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:49.300
what is the top k value which I am looking for a top k

01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:52.260
similar value which I am looking for and it is same right.

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:57.260
So whenever I will try to like send a query so my query will

01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:59.960
go to what my query will go to a vector storage and then it

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:02.680
will try to bring the top k result. This is what we

01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:05.800
understand so far and same thing we are trying to perform

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:10.480
even over here that okay go to a database with a query and

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:14.040
then try to retrieve a top k value maybe top 2, top 3, top 4

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:17.400
whatever you want so it will be able to retrieve it. So

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:20.760
vector store dot similarity search and it is going to give

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:24.160
me the final value. So these are the two function guys you

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:28.500
have to keep it inside a vector store utility. Simple I have

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:30.840
already pinged you inside the chat so you can now do a copy

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:32.220
paste yeah

01:06:36.030 --> 01:06:37.130
finally

01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:43.310
everyone so it will be able to retrieve the data. So simple

01:06:43.310 --> 01:06:45.730
independent function as of now I am just writing independent

01:06:45.730 --> 01:06:47.970
function I am not connecting any of this function by the

01:06:47.970 --> 01:06:51.030
way. Everything is just independent separate separate

01:06:51.030 --> 01:06:54.150
function utility function I am writing. So I will start

01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:56.710
connecting all of these function one by one one by one one

01:06:56.710 --> 01:07:01.030
by one as we will progress okay. So vector store utility is

01:07:01.030 --> 01:07:06.370
done by the way pdf utility is done configuration file is

01:07:06.370 --> 01:07:12.510
done by the way for us yeah now what is next yeah now what

01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:17.430
is next. So maybe we can try to create. So we would like to

01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:21.770
create a UI. UI interface let us suppose I would like to

01:07:21.770 --> 01:07:26.390
design the UI interface. Now how my UI interface will look

01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:29.870
like. So let us suppose I am trying to design the UI

01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:36.130
interface. Now on this UI interface on this side I would

01:07:36.130 --> 01:07:42.310
like to give an option to my user that upload upload pdf so

01:07:42.310 --> 01:07:45.030
that even doctors let us suppose they have a like a

01:07:45.030 --> 01:07:48.090
thousands of pdf they will be able to upload those pdf. It

01:07:48.090 --> 01:07:50.630
is going to process all of these pdf process means it is

01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:53.110
going to store into a vector dv and then I am going to give

01:07:53.110 --> 01:07:57.350
a chat interface over here. So that my doctors will be able

01:07:57.350 --> 01:08:02.630
to like you know write a query and then they will be able to

01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:05.670
see the chats in a real time they will be able to chat just

01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:09.110
like any other chat bot or any other like a even GPT just

01:08:09.110 --> 01:08:12.270
like a GPT UI interface. So maybe this is the UI interface

01:08:12.270 --> 01:08:15.010
that I would like to like a create so where I can give even

01:08:15.010 --> 01:08:18.010
an option to a doctors where they can upload the pdfs. Okay.

01:08:18.030 --> 01:08:21.270
That is cool. So to do that let us go ahead and let us try

01:08:21.270 --> 01:08:24.210
to create one file inside

01:08:27.250 --> 01:08:32.350
this app folder itself and let us name it as a ui.py file ui

01:08:32.350 --> 01:08:36.350
.py file. Now this file we are not going to do much over

01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:39.010
here. So we will just write a simple function for a pdf

01:08:39.010 --> 01:08:43.230
upload so that anyone can come and anyone can upload this

01:08:43.230 --> 01:08:45.690
pdf this this section they will be able to achieve upload

01:08:45.690 --> 01:08:48.850
the pdf. Yeah because reading part is done anyhow we are

01:08:48.850 --> 01:08:51.230
able to write the function so which will be able to read

01:08:51.230 --> 01:08:56.130
out. So here import I can write a streamlint s-t-r-e-m

01:08:57.790 --> 01:09:02.970
streamlint as a st fine just try to like do this import and

01:09:02.970 --> 01:09:14.100
then def pdf pdf underscore underscore upload right and

01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:20.600
inside this we can try to maybe write this function not this

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:23.120
it is auto completion so let me remove the unnecessary part.

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:29.520
So streamlint write title pdf uploader or maybe I can just

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:33.660
try to write over here not

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:40.140
this auto completion return

01:09:42.570 --> 01:09:51.430
r-e-t-u-r-n return so streamlint dot file uploader. So

01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:54.030
streamlint is basically library for like providing you the

01:09:54.030 --> 01:09:57.530
UI interface so here it is going to showcase to the user

01:09:57.530 --> 01:10:01.910
message. That upload the pdf file a type is equals to a pdf

01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:06.050
which I have already given and let me make it accept

01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:11.010
multiple files is equals to maybe I would like to like allow

01:10:11.010 --> 01:10:14.610
so I can make it true that yes you can accept multiple files

01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:18.010
at a time so user will be able to upload the multiple files

01:10:18.010 --> 01:10:26.190
by the way and here so I can write even help upload one or

01:10:26.190 --> 01:10:31.350
more pdf file to process. Yeah so fine so this is a simple

01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:35.130
pdf uploader I have already created so where it is going to

01:10:35.130 --> 01:10:38.590
showcase a message to the user in a UI side basically in a

01:10:38.590 --> 01:10:42.430
UI side that upload a pdf file type should always be pdf I

01:10:42.430 --> 01:10:45.410
can try to type multiple like a files for example if I would

01:10:45.410 --> 01:10:50.370
like to allow user to like you know upload a files even in a

01:10:50.370 --> 01:10:53.210
doc format even into excel format even into a vtt format

01:10:53.210 --> 01:10:57.430
even into a dot txt format I can just like keep every every

01:10:57.430 --> 01:10:59.110
file. Every extension inside the list and it will allow

01:10:59.110 --> 01:11:01.590
accordingly it will be able to pass those file automatically

01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:05.890
but yeah accept multiple files so yeah in a single go user

01:11:05.890 --> 01:11:08.610
can upload 10000 file or maybe hundreds of files that's

01:11:08.610 --> 01:11:11.450
completely fine help so this is just going to showcase the

01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:14.770
message. So again one more utility function guys I have

01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:18.250
pinged you inside your chat so keep it inside ui.py file

01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:21.890
keep it inside ui.py file. Now close everything close

01:11:21.890 --> 01:11:26.090
everything so this is done right all of these things are

01:11:26.090 --> 01:11:34.810
done. Now what we have to do so this upload will be done we

01:11:34.810 --> 01:11:38.770
will be able to store our data into a vector dv again we

01:11:38.770 --> 01:11:43.630
will be able to extract a top k result out of the query that

01:11:43.630 --> 01:11:48.770
user is going to pass now so once this entire process will

01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:51.970
be done let's suppose we are able to retrieve a top k and we

01:11:51.970 --> 01:11:55.730
are able to basically like a get a query so we are going to

01:11:55.730 --> 01:11:59.050
plus it. Right we are going to concatenate it let's suppose

01:11:59.050 --> 01:12:02.990
and then we are going to send this data to the llm to the

01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:08.510
llm right to llm so we have to write a function so where we

01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:12.730
can call basically llms and then we can pass the data and

01:12:12.730 --> 01:12:16.130
then llm should be able to give me the result right so let's

01:12:16.130 --> 01:12:19.110
try to write this function so where I will be passing this

01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:22.490
entire things to the llm then I can say okay fine so all of

01:12:22.490 --> 01:12:26.030
my utilities are done and now I can go ahead with the.

01:12:26.370 --> 01:12:29.190
Execution yeah now I can go ahead with the final execution

01:12:29.190 --> 01:12:33.710
or finally combining each and everything one by one. So here

01:12:33.710 --> 01:12:38.530
inside this app.py file right inside this app.py file so

01:12:38.530 --> 01:12:41.910
let's try to create one more file called as chat underscore

01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:49.050
utils.py fine so chat underscore utils. Now here so I am

01:12:49.050 --> 01:12:53.190
going to write a function so which is going to take a model

01:12:53.190 --> 01:12:57.330
and then eventually. Ah. It will be able to give me the

01:12:57.330 --> 01:13:01.810
reply yeah so here I am going to use uri ai by the way so

01:13:01.810 --> 01:13:05.870
uri ai and inside that lang chain we have already created

01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:09.330
lang chain and then import

01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:20.070
create chat model create chat model. So this function we

01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:22.450
have already created so this is basically our custom

01:13:22.450 --> 01:13:25.570
function from your own site. Which we have created inside a

01:13:25.570 --> 01:13:27.690
uri ai so this is not coming from the lang chain we have

01:13:27.690 --> 01:13:30.650
just made it lang chain compatible so that with the bare

01:13:30.650 --> 01:13:33.870
minimum code you can try to invoke it right you can try to

01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:37.390
invoke it. So this is the import which is required create

01:13:37.390 --> 01:13:42.430
chat model and then here so what we are going to do so we

01:13:42.430 --> 01:13:49.470
are going to basically create a function so def get chat

01:13:49.470 --> 01:13:56.090
model yeah def get chat model. So what is going to do. What

01:13:56.090 --> 01:13:59.590
this function is going to take by the way. So this function

01:13:59.590 --> 01:14:05.950
is going to take api key as a input yeah so api key as a

01:14:05.950 --> 01:14:10.630
input this function is going to take and what it is going to

01:14:10.630 --> 01:14:14.710
return right it is going to return so return create chat

01:14:14.710 --> 01:14:18.290
model api key is

01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:26.360
equals to api key. Now model. Now this is going to return a

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:29.700
add a function. So model, I have a multiple model which is

01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:32.660
accessible to me, not just one, so 29 plus model which is

01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:37.040
available inside the URI. I can try to write maybe any of

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:40.060
this model ID, how I will be able to get a model ID by the

01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:43.840
way guys. So here if you will go to introduction and if you

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:46.700
will try to click on anyone, you will be able to see a model

01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:51.020
ID. So for example if I have to use like a GPT 4.1 nano, GPT

01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:55.780
hyphen 4.1 hyphen nano, this is the model ID. So everywhere

01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:58.720
you will be able to see a model ID, for every model. So not

01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:00.980
just from here, so maybe from a Meta, from a Google,

01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:04.540
whatever model that you have to use, you have to use a model

01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:08.880
ID basically, right. So here maybe I am going to use a GPT 4

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:12.560
.1 nano or maybe 5, that's completely fine. So I can just

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:17.580
try to write the model ID over here. So GPT hyphen 4.1

01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:24.620
hyphen, not turbo, it's a nano that we have, nano. So this

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:28.480
is the model ID I can try to pass, yeah, this is the model

01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:31.000
ID. Again we all know from where we are getting the model

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.620
ID. Then we can try to set the temperature by the way. So

01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:38.260
temperature is let's suppose like 0.7, yeah, temperature is

01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:43.040
0.7, simple. Just a balanced one. I can try to keep it here.

01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:49.800
So this is going to invoke the chat model by default. So it

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:53.320
is going to invoke the LLMs. Means it is going to initialize

01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:57.180
the LLMs. Basically it is going to activate the LLM. Now

01:15:57.180 --> 01:16:00.340
once this activation will be done, right, once this

01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:03.680
activation will be done, so I have to generate the response.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:10.880
So maybe I can write another function, ask chat model, yeah,

01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:15.420
ask chat model. So what this ask chat model will do, by the

01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:19.540
way, so ask chat model will take an access of this chat

01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:23.940
model, which is going to come from here, right. So just an

01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:26.320
independent function, right. So it is going to basically

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:30.600
take this access of this one, this function. And then it is

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:33.220
going to take the prompt. Because if you have to ask

01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:36.280
anything to a GPT model or any other model, maybe Gemini or

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:39.880
maybe Lama, you have to pass a prompt. So prompt and the

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:42.680
model. So chat model will come from here. So whatever it is

01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:45.120
going to return, I am going to just pass it inside this

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:48.320
function. And this is going to call chat model dot invoke

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:52.120
with a prompt. Simple. So it is going to invoke this model

01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:55.760
with this temperature. And then it is going to give you the

01:16:55.760 --> 01:17:00.100
response, yeah, it is going to give you the response. So

01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:02.100
maybe I can try to write down in this way.

01:17:10.050 --> 01:17:16.190
So RESP, RESP UNC response is equal to this one. And then

01:17:16.190 --> 01:17:21.130
return response dot content. So whatever content that model

01:17:21.130 --> 01:17:25.750
is giving me, just give me that one only. So this is going

01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:28.670
to invoke this function, like I said. With a prompt,

01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:31.010
whatever prompt you are going to pass and then whatever

01:17:31.010 --> 01:17:33.670
response it is going to give you, it is going to return that

01:17:33.670 --> 01:17:37.210
response. Very simple. Again, we have made it very, very

01:17:37.210 --> 01:17:42.730
optimized. Invoke means doing a search related query. Invoke

01:17:42.730 --> 01:17:46.850
means whatever you are sending to chat GPT, right? So just

01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:51.830
that one. Let's suppose if I am trying to send some query to

01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:54.890
a chat GPT. This is what it will do programmatically. This

01:17:54.890 --> 01:17:57.550
is where invoke comes into picture. Invoke is an inbuilt

01:17:57.550 --> 01:17:59.470
function. Invoke is an inbuilt function. Invoke is an

01:17:59.470 --> 01:18:02.710
inbuilt function. That we have created. Yeah. Okay. So chat

01:18:02.710 --> 01:18:06.410
model dot invoke and, uh, inside that just try to give a

01:18:06.410 --> 01:18:09.970
prompt and then things will be done. So this is my chat

01:18:09.970 --> 01:18:13.310
utility guys. Chat utility again in a very, very optimized

01:18:13.310 --> 01:18:17.210
way, we are able to create it now close this one. So all of

01:18:17.210 --> 01:18:19.950
these files are done. Chat utility is done. Config is done.

01:18:20.050 --> 01:18:24.050
PDF Utility is done. UI, uh, like PDF Reader, PDF Uploader

01:18:24.050 --> 01:18:28.690
is done. A vector storage is done. So as per this diagram.

01:18:29.490 --> 01:18:32.610
functions are required, starting from, right, whatever

01:18:32.610 --> 01:18:35.930
functions are required, starting from reading a PDF,

01:18:36.170 --> 01:18:40.310
processing a data, storing it into a vector DB whenever

01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:43.930
someone is going to send a query. So I will try, I will be

01:18:43.930 --> 01:18:47.270
able to search it. I will be able to combine and then I will

01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:51.490
be able to connect with the LLMs. All of these functions in

01:18:51.490 --> 01:18:54.450
bits and pieces, we are able to do it right in bits and

01:18:54.450 --> 01:18:57.630
pieces. So almost all of these functionalities are done.

01:18:57.630 --> 01:19:00.770
Independent functionalities are done. Now it's time to

01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:03.970
combine everything, right? It's time to combine everything.

01:19:04.210 --> 01:19:08.530
So combine how? So combine story will start from here, let's

01:19:08.530 --> 01:19:11.150
suppose, right? Combine story is going to start from here.

01:19:11.230 --> 01:19:13.910
So let's suppose I will be having this UI, a beautiful UI

01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:16.770
I'm going to create and I'm going to write down over here

01:19:16.770 --> 01:19:24.570
that it's a MediChat Pro UI. It's a MediChat Pro UI. Now my

01:19:24.570 --> 01:19:27.270
whole story is going to start from this UI interface. For a

01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:31.230
user. Basically. So user will see this UI, right? And they

01:19:31.230 --> 01:19:35.110
can try to upload their PDF fine. So once they are going to

01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:39.030
upload the PDF, how process will happen in a backend? So

01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:48.290
once users are going to upload a PDF, upload a PDF, right?

01:19:48.410 --> 01:19:51.710
So once user is going to click on this button, upload a PDF,

01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:55.770
what will happen? It will go into a backend, right? It will

01:19:55.770 --> 01:19:58.810
go into a backend and then it is going to call my vector.

01:19:58.990 --> 01:20:02.270
Vector stores. So it will try to store this data into a

01:20:02.270 --> 01:20:04.290
vector store, which is technically Facebook AI similarity

01:20:04.290 --> 01:20:07.510
search for me. So technically it's a Facebook AI similarity

01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:12.390
search for me, right now. So once this flow will be done,

01:20:12.570 --> 01:20:16.550
then the user is going to search or user is going to ask a

01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:20.010
question, right? So once user is going to ask a question, it

01:20:20.010 --> 01:20:25.490
will go into a vector search and a question with respect to

01:20:25.490 --> 01:20:28.170
question. It will try to look into this vector search. It

01:20:28.170 --> 01:20:33.430
will try to retrieve a top K result, top K result. It is

01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:37.530
going to combine my question and top K. It is going to

01:20:37.530 --> 01:20:40.290
combine my question and top K and then it is going to send

01:20:40.290 --> 01:20:45.090
all of this to the LLM basically and LLM is going to give me

01:20:45.090 --> 01:20:49.450
the final output response. So I will be able to see all of

01:20:49.450 --> 01:20:52.510
these responses into my chat section. I will be able to see

01:20:52.510 --> 01:20:55.410
everything inside my chat section. So this is the flow,

01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:58.850
right? This is the flow. Okay. So all of this flow will be

01:20:58.850 --> 01:21:05.150
initiated from my UI side as of now. Yeah. So this is

01:21:05.150 --> 01:21:08.130
something that we have to do. Let's do it. Let's try to

01:21:08.130 --> 01:21:10.690
combine each and everything. So flow is clear guys. I think

01:21:10.690 --> 01:21:13.530
this is the second time I have written this flow over here.

01:21:13.850 --> 01:21:18.110
So same thing, upload the PDF, insert that into a vector DB.

01:21:18.410 --> 01:21:22.170
Then from a chat interface, ask a question. It will combine

01:21:22.170 --> 01:21:26.250
like a question plus a retrieval and then it will send to

01:21:26.250 --> 01:21:29.370
the LLMs, LLMs is going to give you the polished answer. Is

01:21:29.370 --> 01:21:30.630
it fine to all of us?

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:41.220
Yes. Okay. Fine. Now next step. So this is the complete flow

01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:45.200
that we are going to follow. So to do that, let's try to

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:48.720
create outside, outside this folder. Let's try to create a

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:55.260
file called as main.py file. Yeah. Main.py file. Now here I

01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:58.520
will be creating a UI and everything, uh, with the help of

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:01.980
Streamlint and I will be using all of these functions all

01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:04.440
together. Fine. I will be using all of these functions all

01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:09.400
together. So let's do it now. Before that, just to handle

01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:13.540
all of these packages inside this, try to create init.py

01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:16.200
file so that it will be able to allow me to access this

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:19.880
packages. So these are the packages I have created. Just try

01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:23.220
to create blank underscore underscore I N I T underscore

01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:27.100
underscore dot pi file so that it will allow me to access

01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:30.400
all of this without any kind of a hassle from outside. So

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:33.560
just try to create init, initialize file and keep it, leave

01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:37.560
it as it is, init.py file just for the package handling. Now

01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:41.200
come to the main.py file and inside this main.py file one by

01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:44.880
one, start importing all of these functions. Yeah. Start

01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:47.620
importing all of these functions. So here are the very first

01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:51.920
import that we have to do. I M P O R T import, I M P O R T

01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:59.920
import Streamlint as ST. Fine. Now from app. App is back.

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:03.140
App is basically folder name. Yeah. App is a folder name. So

01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:07.720
inside this app folder we have a UI.py file. So from app.UI

01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:13.340
right import. So what is the function that we have? So we

01:23:13.340 --> 01:23:18.080
have basically PDF uploader. So import what? So import PDF

01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:21.880
uploader. So from UI file we are able to import PDF

01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:27.960
uploader. Now from app.PDF processor, sorry, from app.PDF

01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:38.720
util. App.PDF util right import extract text app.chat import

01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:41.560
everything. So just try to import each and everything,

01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:47.830
whatever is available. So Streamlint chat message OS. So

01:23:47.830 --> 01:23:51.190
technically we have to import all of these things. So we

01:23:51.190 --> 01:23:55.810
have to go into a UI, PDF util, vector storage, vector store

01:23:55.810 --> 01:24:00.010
util, chat util, config, just import. Just import each and

01:24:00.010 --> 01:24:03.370
everything. Whatever is available to you, you can try to

01:24:03.370 --> 01:24:05.370
import it. And if you are going to click, you will be able

01:24:05.370 --> 01:24:11.710
to reach out. So here vector store utils, relevant

01:24:11.710 --> 01:24:13.330
retrieved,

01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:20.660
relevant docs. Yeah. So all of these imports you have to do.

01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:23.240
And if you have done a spelling mistake, then in that case

01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:26.880
it will like not show you the hyperlinks. Otherwise it will

01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:30.120
show you the hyperlinks. So all of this imports we are able

01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:32.680
to do the custom library that we have already created. So

01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:35.200
from there we are doing all the imports. Now once we are

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:39.540
able to do all the imports into this main.py file, then we

01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:43.740
can try to set up page configuration. So the UI interface

01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:46.220
that we are going to create inside the Streamlint. So we can

01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:48.420
try to set the page configuration. Page configuration means

01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:51.700
page title, page icon, whatever we want, we can try to

01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:55.380
create it. So I have already done that. So here Streamlint

01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:58.480
set page configuration. So page title is going to be medical

01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:02.140
chat, medical document assistant. This is the name. I'm

01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:04.320
trying to keep one small page icon so that it will look

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:08.000
beautiful. A layout should be wide. So it should be like a

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.620
full screen, initial cyber status expanded. So it will be

01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:13.480
able to expand it automatically. So this is just a page

01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:15.880
configuration. Like I said, so UI, we don't have to learn

01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:18.940
much. It's very, very easy, right? It's a predefined thing.

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:22.420
So we just have to go and use it. And then I have to

01:25:22.420 --> 01:25:27.080
maintain basically a color of these UIs interface. So to

01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:31.640
keeping that in a mind. I have added some of them. The CSS

01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:35.260
over here, styling so that, you know, message, font, text,

01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:39.200
color, all of these, I will be able to manage. So this is

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:42.240
something which I'm trying to maintain inside my Streamlint

01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:45.520
style tab. So I'm just trying to like pass this style over

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:50.060
here, uh, just a CSS just for the beautification. So this is

01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:53.400
not again a real task, I would say, right? Not a real task.

01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:56.840
And then here I'm

01:25:59.650 --> 01:26:04.280
just trying to maintain the session. And then again,

01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:08.060
styling. So this is something which I'm trying to do just

01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:11.460
for the styling purposes. As of now, no core logic has been

01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:14.680
involved, right? I'll show you the core logic. Just wait for

01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:17.640
some time. So, so far there is no core logic, which has been

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:20.260
involved. Just I'm trying to do the styling over here.

01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:22.840
Nothing much. And one by one, if you have confusion, I'll

01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:27.240
try to explain you that as well now. So now the real thing

01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:31.240
will start. So for example, this is my UI interface and

01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:34.840
here, so I have to upload the PDF, so I have to basically. I

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:38.300
will create an icon. So where it will call a PDF uploader

01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:41.400
function and then it will be, I will be able to upload a

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:46.580
PDF. Yeah, I will be able to upload the PDF. So to do that,

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:53.660
right, to do that, what do we can do? So we can write a

01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:57.860
complete streamlink logic over here and let's see what this

01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:01.480
logic says by the way. So sidebar for a document upload, it

01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:04.320
is going to create a sidebar. So with a streamlink dot

01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:06.880
sidebar, this function is already an inbuilt function. It is

01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:09.140
by default going to create a sidebar for you in a

01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:12.740
streamlink. And then I'm trying to just give a name to it.

01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:15.740
Markdown means name, just a name. So this will be visible as

01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:18.800
a message over there. So document upload and then again,

01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:22.340
upload your medical document to start chatting now. So

01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:25.960
whenever you are going to click on that upload, so

01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:28.720
technically it is calling what the function, which I have

01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:31.440
already written, yeah, the function, which I have already

01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:33.980
written, which is going to accept what kind of type type of

01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:37.380
the file PDF file where you can upload. Even a multiple

01:27:37.380 --> 01:27:40.040
file. So the function which I have written, it is going to

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:44.580
invoke that function and then it will try to upload all the

01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:49.120
data. Now once it is going to upload a data, once you are

01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:52.560
going to upload the data, then what we are supposed to do,

01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:57.820
right? So upon a success, so if uploaded file true, if

01:27:57.820 --> 01:27:59.720
uploaded file true means someone has already uploaded the

01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:04.440
file. So on success, right on a success. So what it will do?

01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:06.580
So it will try to give you the data. It will give you the

01:28:06.580 --> 01:28:10.640
button that, okay, so now you can try to start processing

01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:14.900
those data. Processing those data means start storing those

01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:18.320
data into vector DB. This is what it means, right? So

01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:20.900
whenever you are going to upload the document, we will start

01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:23.180
processing those data means we will start storing those data

01:28:23.180 --> 01:28:25.920
into a vector DB for which we have already written the

01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:29.600
function. So this is what it will do. So it will show you

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:32.180
the spinner. Spinner means just on a UI interface, it will

01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:35.080
show you like those are like a spinning wheels, by the way.

01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:41.280
Okay. Just for the user, you know, basically attraction. So

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:45.400
I have given this spinner over here. So it will spin and

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.420
will show you that, okay, fine, I'm processing your document

01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:52.560
if it is going to take some time now. So what it will do

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:56.520
internally, what is the core logic? So the core logic that

01:28:56.520 --> 01:29:00.200
it is going to call over here. So whenever you have uploaded

01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:03.780
the document, right, uploaded the document means the file

01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:07.580
that you have. It is going to call extract text from PDF.

01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:10.580
Now where we have written this function inside this PDF

01:29:10.580 --> 01:29:14.180
util. So it is going to extract a text, right? This is the

01:29:14.180 --> 01:29:17.200
function that we have written. So it will go to one file. We

01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:18.960
are going to pass a file name. Let's suppose I have uploaded

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:22.220
five files. So file number one, then two, then three, then

01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:25.480
four, then five, one by one, one by one. That's the reason.

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:28.300
So we are running into a loop. Yeah, we are running into a

01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:32.100
loop. So go to file number one, extract our data and then go

01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:36.640
to the file number two, extract data. So one by one, one by

01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:40.000
one, one by one, it will try to extract a data and from one

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.080
single file, just read all the pages inside that again we

01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:47.280
are running into a loop. So go into every file and in every

01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:50.700
file here it will go into every pages and then it will try

01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:53.100
to extract the data and finally it will return the data

01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:56.400
which is available inside the PDF. Simple, right? Simple.

01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:00.840
Here it will do and then it will not just stop over there,

01:30:00.940 --> 01:30:04.560
right? So once it will be able to extract all the text. So

01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:07.840
we are keeping all the text into where? One single list. So

01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:10.340
all the text we are trying to keep it inside one single list

01:30:10.340 --> 01:30:14.040
and then we are trying to call this lang chain based

01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:18.320
recursive character text splitter for chucking basically. So

01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:23.040
we have a very big data. So we are trying to take a chunk of

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:28.020
thousand. So one data should have thousand words at max and

01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:31.120
then there should be an overlap of 200 so that I will be

01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:33.120
able to create the context. I believe we have already done

01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:37.700
that. Chucking and then like a overlap, right? So length

01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:40.100
function is equal to length. So by default it will try to

01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:44.120
take a length of that word. So thousand words in one single

01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:46.500
chunk. Maybe I can try to increase it. I can try to decrease

01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:50.020
it. That's up to me and there will be 200 of overlap in

01:30:50.020 --> 01:30:54.100
between. So it is going to split the data. It is going to

01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:57.100
split the data. I have like a lot of records. So it is going

01:30:57.100 --> 01:31:01.380
to split the data and then one by one, one by one, one by

01:31:01.380 --> 01:31:05.940
one, it will try to store the data. So here it is calling

01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:08.980
create Facebook AI similarity search indexes from where?

01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:12.260
Again from a vector storage. So it is calling this one. It

01:31:12.260 --> 01:31:16.360
will try to store the data into a Facebook AI similarity

01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:18.760
search. So whatever function that we have written so far, we

01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:21.720
are just trying to use those functions. So it is trying to

01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:27.440
store all this data into a vector storage. Now so once it

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:31.280
will be able to store this particular data, then I am trying

01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:34.140
to initialize, a check. I am using a chat model that, okay,

01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:37.460
so get a chat model, just a model initialization. I'm not

01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:39.880
using it. I'm not passing any kind of a prompt over here.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.020
I'm just initializing it means I'm just trying to call this

01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:46.320
particular function so that my chat model will be

01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:50.820
initialized and that's it. End of the story. So now till

01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:55.020
this point, what I have done, I have basically uploaded the

01:31:55.020 --> 01:31:59.440
PDF. I have used the upload function, converted those PDF

01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:03.080
into a chunks. Okay. And I'm using a recursive character

01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:07.100
text splitter over here from a land chain. I am trying to

01:32:07.100 --> 01:32:11.020
use a Farsi indexes, which I have already created to convert

01:32:11.020 --> 01:32:13.580
something into a vector storage. And then I'm able to

01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:17.460
invoke, initialize, only initialize, right, initialize a

01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:20.320
chat model. That's it. I'm not sending any kind of a query

01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:24.860
so far, right? So till this point, till this point we are

01:32:24.860 --> 01:32:27.720
done, till this particular point we are done before sending

01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:31.180
a query. So we are done with this vector DV. Okay. And this

01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:36.520
is what this code is telling you. Now the final step, yeah,

01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:40.280
the final step. So the final step is going to be whenever

01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:43.160
the user is going to send a message because now my data is

01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:45.740
available into a vector database. So now user is going to

01:32:45.740 --> 01:32:48.100
send the message. Whenever someone is going to send the

01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:51.440
message, it is going to again convert those data into a

01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:56.340
vector space, search it, retrieve it, retrieve top K and

01:32:56.340 --> 01:32:59.820
then send it together to the LLMs. That's it. The model that

01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:02.800
I have already invoked over here, the chat model, which I'm

01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:07.900
able to invoke as per my design. So to do that, right, to do

01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:13.720
that, this is the final function we can try to call with the

01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:18.060
UI. Now what does this function says by the way? So display

01:33:18.060 --> 01:33:20.980
a chat message just to display, I'm trying to maintain the

01:33:20.980 --> 01:33:25.220
state over here. So this is nothing just like a UI things by

01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:29.360
the way. Now here, your actual things will start. Okay. So

01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:33.120
it is going to show you the interface. It is going to show

01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:36.280
you the interface over here down and it is going to ask you

01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:39.420
that, okay, fine. So ask or chat, chat, anything, chat, like

01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:42.260
ask anything inside the chat. So ask about a medical

01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:45.360
document. Now it is going to show you timestamp. So again,

01:33:45.460 --> 01:33:49.300
the UI things now here says an estate message append. So we

01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:51.480
are trying to append role is equal to user content prompt

01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:54.160
timestamp. So again, a UI things from where we are trying to

01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:59.080
append it now. So what? Aver user is going to append. So it

01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:03.700
is going to ask, here what it will do, retrieve relevant

01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:09.920
docs. I think function name is different. Okay. Let me

01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:11.400
change that function name.

01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:21.920
Fine. So here what will happen? So whenever user is going to

01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:26.780
enter any messages, yeah, user is going to mention any kind

01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:30.560
of a messages. So what will happen? It is going to go ahead

01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:33.920
with the retrieve relevant document. So it is going to going

01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:36.460
to call my retrieve relevant document. So here it is going

01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:39.780
to call my retriever. So it is already having an idea that,

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:42.120
okay, fine data is available into a Facebook as an ID search

01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:45.280
with a query means with a user message with a top K result.

01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:48.480
So it will try to search such my Facebook as an ID search

01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:53.840
databases. So here this vector store is coming from where?

01:34:53.940 --> 01:34:56.940
From the same is streamlined session. We are trying to call

01:34:56.940 --> 01:35:02.120
the vector storage simple and we are trying to pass a

01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:06.380
prompt. Now. We are able to get a prompt from there. So from

01:35:06.380 --> 01:35:09.780
the messages we are trying to send the prompt. It is going

01:35:09.780 --> 01:35:13.600
to retrieve the relevant document. As you can see over here,

01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:18.240
it is going to retrieve the document and then it is going to

01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:22.560
basically combine all of these documents or whatever

01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:26.000
document that we have. And then the main part, main thing

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:29.240
will be done by this one, this one system prompt. So here,

01:35:29.340 --> 01:35:31.800
and again, so you have to write it, write these things in a

01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:34.580
beautiful manner. So here we have written that you are a

01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:37.840
medical chat pro, intelligent medical document assistant

01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:40.700
based on the following medical document provider, accurate

01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:43.460
and helpful answer. If information is not in document

01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:47.420
clearly state that. So here we are trying to pass a medical

01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:50.200
document. Medical document will come from where? From your

01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:55.140
vector DB from your vector DB and plus we are trying to pass

01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:58.640
even a prompt prompt means user query. So as per our

01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:04.760
diagram, user query query. This one. And then this topic is

01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:08.620
search. Both we are trying to combine, right? Both we are

01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:10.900
kind of combined inside our prompt and we are sending it to

01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:14.220
what we are sending it to LLM. So this is something that it

01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:17.440
will do a system prompt, right? So we are trying to combine

01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:20.000
this. We are trying to create a system prompt and then we

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:23.820
are sending it to ask chat model. So as we all know that our

01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:27.120
chat model takes two things. One is a model access. Second

01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:30.280
is a prompt model access coming from where? From above.

01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:33.740
Yeah. We already have a model access, right? You already

01:36:33.740 --> 01:36:37.020
have a model access over here. Chat model. So we are trying

01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:39.300
to bring this chat model access from here. We are trying to

01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:42.280
keep it inside the session, right? And then we are trying to

01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:46.140
pass our system prompt and it will give me the response. It

01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:48.600
will give me the response and whatever response it is going

01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:51.260
to give it to me, I'm just trying to show you that response

01:36:51.260 --> 01:36:56.180
in a complete formatted manner. That's it. Nothing much. So

01:36:56.180 --> 01:36:59.660
our chat model. So major part is this one. Major part is

01:36:59.660 --> 01:37:03.220
this one. Even I can try to modify this. So I can, I can

01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:05.980
say, I can, while writing this prompt, I can say that, that,

01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:15.980
uh, when you are, you are giving an answer, make sure that

01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:23.340
try to take help of LLM and give me a

01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:31.600
full diagnosis of diagnosis

01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:39.930
of the problem. So it will try to give you a diagnosis of

01:37:39.930 --> 01:37:42.750
the problem. So whatever system prompt that you are going to

01:37:42.750 --> 01:37:46.010
give, uh, whatever, like, uh, things will go to LLMs, it

01:37:46.010 --> 01:37:47.930
will try to give you, and anyhow, we are sending the

01:37:47.930 --> 01:37:50.950
document and we are sending our query. Both of these things

01:37:50.950 --> 01:37:55.830
we are trying to send to our system control us. Now this is

01:37:55.830 --> 01:38:00.530
the code guys. So this will technically like, uh, the LLM

01:38:00.530 --> 01:38:05.790
input. Now let me ping you this file. I think I can't copy

01:38:05.790 --> 01:38:09.230
and paste this code. This is too much like a lengthy code.

01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:12.730
Zoom will not allow. So maybe I'll have to

01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:18.960
upload a file. Let me upload a file.

01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:30.880
Yeah.

01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:45.300
So I have just uploaded this file inside your, uh, uh, zoom

01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:48.940
chat guys. So you can try to like, uh, you know, open up

01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:52.780
this file and use it directly. This file is already

01:38:52.780 --> 01:38:56.700
available. So main.py file is available and I can try to use

01:38:56.700 --> 01:39:00.020
this particular file now. So it's time to do a testing. It's

01:39:00.020 --> 01:39:02.760
time to do a execution. And, uh, if there will be any. Kind

01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:07.980
of a issue. So maybe I'll try to fix that issue, uh, in

01:39:07.980 --> 01:39:12.320
between. So here, if I have to execute this one, uh, what is

01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:17.700
the command that I have to write? C L E R clear. Okay. So

01:39:17.700 --> 01:39:21.160
what is the command that I have to write? Any idea guys? So

01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:23.320
if I have to execute this one, what is the command that I

01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:23.640
have to write?

01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:29.140
So basically command is going to be streamlinked, it's a

01:39:29.140 --> 01:39:33.020
streamlinked code, right? Yeah. So S T R E M L I T

01:39:33.020 --> 01:39:36.060
streamlinked run. And then which file I would like to run?

01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:39.020
Main file. Yeah. And main file is calling all the other

01:39:39.020 --> 01:39:46.400
file. So streamlinked run main.py file. And if, like I said,

01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:50.180
everything is going to be fine. So cannot import a PDF from

01:39:50.180 --> 01:39:58.320
a pypdf. Okay. So there is a error, import error inside my

01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:02.720
PDF utils and anyhow, I'm not using it. So I'm removing this

01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:09.700
one. Even I'm going to remove this one, control S. Now no

01:40:11.390 --> 01:40:15.350
module name lang. So a spelling mistake, L A N G C H A I N,

01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:23.630
lang chain, uh, so here, uh, lang chain. So vector store L A

01:40:23.630 --> 01:40:29.510
N G spelling mistake, lang chain community embeddings. So

01:40:29.510 --> 01:40:36.040
this is, seems to be fixed. Execute once again. Yeah. So

01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:40.020
this is the user interface guys. This is the user interface.

01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:43.900
So I had two, uh, like a typing mistake, two typos. I have

01:40:43.900 --> 01:40:46.320
already rectified those typos as per the error, which I have

01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:50.860
seen. And this is the final UI, which I'm able to see. So

01:40:50.860 --> 01:40:55.160
anyone who is able to see this UI, by the way, yes, anyone,

01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:56.220
you

01:40:58.750 --> 01:41:01.410
know, we're saying, okay, now I'm going to like, uh, switch

01:41:01.410 --> 01:41:04.750
on the chat between all of you. So now you can chat with

01:41:04.750 --> 01:41:05.310
everyone.

01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:13.720
Yeah. Yeah. So let's check the error. Maybe you have made

01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:16.240
some different mistakes, right? So it will give you the

01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:18.600
error and then according to the error, just try to fix it

01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:24.820
fine now. So those who are not able to execute, let me do

01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:29.080
one thing. Uh, let me share a complete piece of a code with

01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:33.180
all of you into a zip file. Yeah. So let me share this

01:41:33.180 --> 01:41:37.080
entire piece of the code. You can unzip it and you can

01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:38.420
directly use it.

01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:48.700
Yeah. So midi chat. This is the code and inside that data is

01:41:48.700 --> 01:41:52.880
also available. So maybe you can try to use

01:41:56.050 --> 01:41:58.450
it directly. Just wait. I'm sending you a drive link.

01:42:04.230 --> 01:42:07.630
Okay. So here's the drive link guys, quickly download it.

01:42:08.690 --> 01:42:13.050
All of you and it's a bug free code. So I was facing some

01:42:13.050 --> 01:42:15.570
sort of issues, which I have already fixed. There was like a

01:42:15.570 --> 01:42:17.730
very minor issues, a typo you can say.

01:42:20.770 --> 01:42:24.210
How did you solve? Imported? Can I import PDF? Just by

01:42:24.210 --> 01:42:26.910
removing it. I was not using PDF. So I've just removed it.

01:42:26.990 --> 01:42:27.590
It's done.

01:42:30.660 --> 01:42:34.880
If that library itself is not available, so can't do

01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:35.920
anything, right? Remove it.

01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:47.700
Yeah. So I have already shared the entire file guys. I think

01:42:47.700 --> 01:42:50.320
you all are able to see my drive link, right? Everyone.

01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:53.780
Yeah. Just, just download it. So I have already rectified.

01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:56.960
So whatever issue, which I was like, I don't know, maybe I

01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:00.420
can see some different issues now. There is a possibility.

01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:03.760
I'll fix it. Right. But yeah. So, so far I'm able to see the

01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:08.680
UI interface at least. Yes. UI is working. Everyone. Yeah.

01:43:08.740 --> 01:43:10.740
Can we import your file directly in a VS code? Yes. Copy

01:43:10.740 --> 01:43:13.620
paste. Drag and drop. Unzip the file. Drag and drop. Or

01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:17.280
maybe just like open up my folder, the folder that you have

01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:20.600
downloaded into your VS code. Anything is fine. And if you

01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:23.540
have to run this entire application, the command is very

01:43:23.540 --> 01:43:27.460
simple. Streamlint run main.py file. So my file name is main

01:43:27.460 --> 01:43:31.880
.py file. Right? So streamlint run, streamlint, S-T-R-E-M-L

01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:37.640
-I-T, streamlint run. No module name pypdf. Just remove no

01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:40.580
module name pypdf. So install pypdf. First of all, you have

01:43:40.580 --> 01:43:43.780
to do an installation, right? That's the reason we have a

01:43:43.780 --> 01:43:47.700
requirement.txt. Here we have pypdf. So you have not

01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:51.560
installed it because of that it is telling you, I believe we

01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:54.060
all are able to understand this much of like issues and

01:43:54.060 --> 01:43:56.420
hoping that all of you will be able to resolve it.

01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:02.240
Pypdf not existing even after installing. Maybe you have

01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:04.820
installed it, but you are not using the environment. Maybe

01:44:04.820 --> 01:44:06.840
you are still using the base environment. That's the only

01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:14.660
issue. I don't see any other issues by the way. Yeah. What

01:44:14.660 --> 01:44:16.740
does streamlint session does? So basically streamlint

01:44:16.740 --> 01:44:20.680
session is trying to keep everything intact into one single

01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:24.500
chat interface or one single timestamp or you can say like,

01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:26.860
let's suppose if I'm trying to upload the PDF, if I'm trying

01:44:26.860 --> 01:44:30.500
to invoke a chat models. So each and everything it will

01:44:30.500 --> 01:44:34.240
remember. This is what session will do. It will maintain the

01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:41.160
session again. Now UI is coming. Good. Great. Yeah. Let's go

01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:44.840
ahead and test the UI. So I believe my UI interface is same

01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:49.660
as the design. Same as this one, right? So here we have a UI

01:44:49.660 --> 01:44:53.300
interface and as you can see, so we are getting an option to

01:44:53.300 --> 01:44:57.720
upload the PDF so I can try to browse the file and wherever

01:44:57.720 --> 01:45:00.140
I'm keeping a file, by the way, right? Wherever I'm keeping

01:45:00.140 --> 01:45:00.140
a file, by the way, wherever I'm keeping a file, wherever

01:45:00.140 --> 01:45:01.340
I'm keeping a file, wherever I'm trying to keep the file. So

01:45:01.340 --> 01:45:05.220
maybe I can go to that directory and in one sort because

01:45:05.220 --> 01:45:08.100
multi file upload it supports, I have already make it true

01:45:08.100 --> 01:45:12.520
if you remember, right? So just try to open up this file,

01:45:12.660 --> 01:45:16.000
six document uploaded. Now it is showing me process document

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:20.480
feature, right? So just click on this process document and

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:25.560
if there is no error, right? If there is no error, it will

01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:29.200
process the document means it will try to store everything

01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:30.860
into the vector DB,

01:45:40.180 --> 01:45:44.600
fine everyone. So it is still processing my document by the

01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:45.640
way, are

01:45:53.260 --> 01:45:55.580
they stored in local vector DB obviously. So basically my

01:45:55.580 --> 01:46:00.120
Facebook has running my local, right? I have not used any

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:01.940
cloud instances so far.

01:46:05.250 --> 01:46:10.990
Oh, so issue I have received URI chat model object has no

01:46:10.990 --> 01:46:16.330
field called as client value error. Fine. We'll fix it. Get

01:46:16.330 --> 01:46:21.570
chat. This, this, this, this, this, okay. So URI chat value

01:46:21.570 --> 01:46:27.070
error class name object has no field name. So it's a URI API

01:46:27.070 --> 01:46:35.290
key issue that it is giving me medical chat pro fine. Okay

01:46:35.290 --> 01:46:41.670
so create chat model. Let me fix it. Let me see what is the

01:46:41.670 --> 01:46:43.230
issue with this URI chat.

01:46:46.610 --> 01:46:51.010
Ensure that registered via touchpad. Class value error.

01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:54.510
Okay. URI client get

01:46:56.880 --> 01:47:02.220
chat model, create chart model URI API key. Hmm. Yeah.

01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:06.300
Document. It is able to process successfully. Now close this

01:47:06.300 --> 01:47:15.140
one, this one, this one, this one, chat utils will

01:47:20.300 --> 01:47:26.960
give you an issue. Get the chat model URI API key. Okay. Got

01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:30.940
it. It is, it is not able to like a call the API key because

01:47:30.940 --> 01:47:35.500
I have just passed this API key is equal to API key. Uh, and

01:47:35.500 --> 01:47:38.880
uh, even when I'm trying to call it inside main dot PI file,

01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:43.800
so get the chat, which was a part of session. So I'm trying

01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:45.460
to pass a API key.

01:47:48.410 --> 01:47:52.170
It should be able to invoke an API key by the way, from

01:47:52.170 --> 01:47:53.770
here, it

01:47:59.140 --> 01:48:01.700
should be into dot environment. Doesn't matter where I'm

01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:04.600
keeping it. I can keep it into dot PST file as well. That's

01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:08.040
fine. That's completely fine. Uh, the only thing which

01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:14.380
matters is I'm able to call it or not URI API key. So we had

01:48:14.380 --> 01:48:20.800
two parameter, I believe EDF chat, chat utility. So API key

01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:24.980
is equals to API key. Okay. Let me do it in this way. API

01:48:24.980 --> 01:48:28.160
key is equals to URI API key. It's a reference issue by the

01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:33.960
way. Now I believe it will be fixed. Refresh. Once again,

01:48:34.100 --> 01:48:40.700
browse the file, upload all the files in one go, process the

01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:44.920
document. Let's see. It was a reference issue. It seems it

01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:48.640
was not able to, okay. Uri chat model object has no field

01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:50.320
client changed

01:49:35.730 --> 01:49:37.170
my API key.

01:49:41.050 --> 01:49:45.110
Just a minute. It will be fixed. It's pretty much normal to

01:49:45.110 --> 01:49:47.730
get a little bit of error. How's

01:49:57.140 --> 01:49:59.400
the file? Where is

01:50:13.130 --> 01:50:16.850
the Facebook AI vector DB location local? It's inside our

01:50:16.850 --> 01:50:20.650
memory. We are not processing it. You can call Facebook AI

01:50:20.650 --> 01:50:23.790
semantic similarity search save, and then it will be able to

01:50:23.790 --> 01:50:28.630
save it. But as of now it's in memory document process

01:50:28.630 --> 01:50:31.770
successfully for me. Yeah, I believe it will be able to

01:50:31.770 --> 01:50:37.410
process successfully still getting this issue. URI chat

01:50:37.410 --> 01:50:43.510
model object has no field client changed my API key. Let me

01:50:43.510 --> 01:50:47.370
see the fixes by the way.

01:50:50.860 --> 01:50:54.660
Otherwise I'll just try to use it directly instead of using

01:50:54.660 --> 01:50:55.200
as a wrapper.

01:51:00.110 --> 01:51:04.430
Yeah. New token. So guys, try to replace your token with my

01:51:04.430 --> 01:51:07.130
token because my token will not work. I have already

01:51:07.130 --> 01:51:12.210
deactivated the previous token. This one API key by the way.

01:51:12.290 --> 01:51:17.010
Yeah. So just try to replace your API key with, sorry, my

01:51:17.010 --> 01:51:18.610
API key with your API key. Okay.

01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:32.560
If vector is stored in a memory, that means if I restart the

01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:34.940
application, I need to reupload all the files. Yes, that's

01:51:34.940 --> 01:51:38.500
true. So you can try to call persist as well, where you will

01:51:38.500 --> 01:51:41.340
not have to upload the files again and again. It's

01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:02.280
an issue with the list

01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:55.240
using the model. Okay. So seems to be pidentic issue. It's

01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:18.830
a config chat utils API key. Yeah. API.

01:53:27.050 --> 01:53:33.440
Sometimes. So because of pidentic issue, API key.

01:53:46.500 --> 01:53:54.000
Okay. So GPT 4.1 temperature, TMP fine model is equals to a

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:59.740
model temperature is equals to temperature. Okay. Let

01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:13.980
me check.

01:54:51.510 --> 01:54:56.190
I'm able to run and ask the queries. Yes. I believe most of

01:54:56.190 --> 01:54:59.350
us will be able to do it. It just a little bit of

01:54:59.350 --> 01:55:00.870
disturbance. With respect. With respect to the installation.

01:55:01.130 --> 01:55:02.310
So I'm just trying to fix it.

01:55:05.810 --> 01:55:09.250
Sir GPT Gemini gives the same facilities with the weather

01:55:09.250 --> 01:55:13.770
speed. Why do too much struggle to do the same? I mean like

01:55:13.770 --> 01:55:16.630
we are using GPT itself over here. We are not using

01:55:16.630 --> 01:55:17.270
something different.

01:55:24.020 --> 01:55:27.400
It's just about a library that we are trying to use.

01:55:36.220 --> 01:55:41.900
It's seems to be installation issue.

01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:50.950
Control Zed.

01:56:08.220 --> 01:56:12.800
Okay. Pidentic issue. So let me basically

01:56:42.020 --> 01:56:45.000
the version issue, uh, nothing much I would say. So it's

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:48.340
just a version issue that we are facing. So some of these

01:56:48.340 --> 01:56:50.380
things are compatible with compatible with some of the

01:56:50.380 --> 01:56:52.280
latest version. And because of that, you know, it will keep

01:56:52.280 --> 01:56:57.160
on giving me the issue, uh, here. So let me run once again,

01:56:57.300 --> 01:56:59.300
otherwise I'll change the version. D

01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:14.340
drive RIG sample data open process.

01:57:22.060 --> 01:57:24.760
Yeah. Most of you will be able to get it. So I believe your

01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:31.340
version is 3.12 or maybe 3.13 the latest push that we have

01:57:31.340 --> 01:57:35.380
done with respect to the URI. So I think that is compatible

01:57:35.380 --> 01:57:40.860
with the latest one, not with 3.10, 3.11 it's just a version

01:57:40.860 --> 01:57:43.140
issue. Believe me, it's just like a, I'll change the Python

01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:44.740
version. It will start working.

01:57:47.910 --> 01:57:50.370
Yeah. It's actually a version issue. So let me do it. Uh,

01:57:50.370 --> 01:57:53.650
one thing I'll change the version and then I'll run it. So

01:57:53.650 --> 01:57:54.930
terminate this one.

01:57:58.690 --> 01:58:06.490
Hmm. Terminate. Yeah. So let me do the fixes permanent fix

01:58:06.490 --> 01:58:10.250
by the way. So here I am not going to use this particular

01:58:10.250 --> 01:58:15.810
environment. So maybe I can do one thing, uh, Conda create

01:58:15.810 --> 01:58:22.610
hyphen N and, uh, I'm going to like a call Medi. Uh, this is

01:58:22.610 --> 01:58:28.270
the environment name and, uh, Python is equal to 3.12. Let,

01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:32.410
let me try with 3.12. Uh, basically, and then the hyphen Y,

01:58:32.570 --> 01:58:34.650
that's the version issue because it's giving me the pyentic

01:58:34.650 --> 01:58:38.010
error and this error says that it's a pure version issue.

01:58:41.860 --> 01:58:45.620
We keep on pushing new, new things into our SDK, right? So

01:58:45.620 --> 01:58:51.380
that's a major problem. Medi. Okay. So activated this

01:58:51.380 --> 01:58:53.240
environment, Medi environment. So which is having like a

01:58:53.240 --> 01:58:58.540
Python, uh, 3.12 and then inside this environment, STREM

01:58:58.540 --> 01:59:06.310
streamlint run main.pi file. Now let's see. Streamlint run

01:59:06.310 --> 01:59:10.650
main.pi file, browse the files, browse all the files, upload

01:59:10.650 --> 01:59:12.230
it, process the document.

01:59:17.080 --> 01:59:18.980
Hopefully this time it should not give me the issue. I've

01:59:18.980 --> 01:59:22.000
changed the Python version itself, which is compatible.

01:59:28.790 --> 01:59:31.910
Okay. So sorry, my bad. Again, I have activated the

01:59:31.910 --> 01:59:34.010
environment. I have not installed requirement.txt file,

01:59:34.090 --> 01:59:38.450
right? Oh, again, it will fail. I

01:59:41.780 --> 01:59:47.720
have not installed my requirement.txt guys. Into main.pi

01:59:47.720 --> 01:59:52.160
file. New environment. Okay. So let me install my

01:59:52.160 --> 01:59:57.960
requirement.txt. So pip install hyphen R requirements.txt.

02:00:22.130 --> 02:00:26.070
Okay. Looks done. I'll run the app.

02:00:56.860 --> 02:00:59.380
So how many of you are able to execute it guys? How many of

02:00:59.380 --> 02:01:05.000
you are able to chat with a Medi chat pro? Okay. So me.

02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:12.400
Okay. Fine. Oh, I think it's against same issues. Same

02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:15.560
client. Same client. Client issue. Client chat model object

02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:22.120
has no field underscore client. I think it should not give

02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:27.240
me an issue at least this time. Okay. Because

02:01:47.180 --> 02:01:49.400
there is no such issue.

02:03:30.390 --> 02:03:35.070
Hmm. Same pidentic issues. I'm still getting the same issue

02:03:35.070 --> 02:03:37.570
after recommendation and it gives one error executed that

02:03:37.570 --> 02:03:39.590
command not able to run it successfully. I installed

02:03:39.590 --> 02:03:42.470
dependency manually in the virtual environment.

02:04:03.660 --> 02:04:07.720
2020. 2025. This was post create

02:04:54.640 --> 02:04:55.840
hyphen n.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:04:59.460
Yeah.

02:06:25.130 --> 02:06:27.670
Python will take automatically. So it will take like a

02:06:27.670 --> 02:06:28.510
latest version of Python.

02:06:34.550 --> 02:06:37.270
Pidentic has no field caller. So basically it's a wrapper,

02:06:37.410 --> 02:06:40.770
the wrapper that we have created, it was working. So it was

02:06:40.770 --> 02:06:44.990
like already a tested code by the way. But yes, there is

02:06:44.990 --> 02:06:47.470
because of the version. So pidentic is giving an issue.

02:06:48.650 --> 02:06:50.710
That's all. That's the only reason. There is no other

02:06:50.710 --> 02:06:54.210
reason. Code is already like it will work. Don't worry.

02:07:09.720 --> 02:07:12.880
Streamlint run main.py. Sorry, my bad.

02:07:17.190 --> 02:07:21.670
It will and it should run. But yeah. So it's just a version

02:07:21.670 --> 02:07:25.310
mismatch. And because of that, when it is trying to call a

02:07:25.310 --> 02:07:29.810
URI API with the lan chain, right? So it is not able to take

02:07:29.810 --> 02:07:31.130
those parameters properly.

02:07:55.560 --> 02:07:58.800
Again, an issue with this client.

02:08:01.890 --> 02:08:07.090
Okay, we'll fix it guys. Can I chat now, try giving a new

02:08:07.090 --> 02:08:10.190
API key and see. No, it's not an API key issue. Anyhow, it's

02:08:10.190 --> 02:08:13.390
not an API key issue. It's basically a compatibility issue.

02:08:18.430 --> 02:08:22.070
Just a minute. We'll fix it. It's pretty much normal that we

02:08:22.070 --> 02:08:23.390
see on a regular basis.

02:08:37.220 --> 02:08:39.500
Yeah, for some of you it's working and again, another

02:08:39.500 --> 02:08:41.960
problem with my system is that I have hundreds of

02:08:41.960 --> 02:08:45.080
environment and since maybe like the last one, one and a

02:08:45.080 --> 02:08:48.040
half weeks, so I haven't restarted my system. So everything

02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:53.500
is in a cache. So that's another issue that is possible

02:08:53.500 --> 02:08:57.960
because of the cache issue. So it is not able to clean my

02:08:57.960 --> 02:09:00.300
environment, although I'm trying to give a new environment

02:09:00.300 --> 02:09:04.220
all the time, but still it is not able to take it. But

02:09:04.220 --> 02:09:06.240
technically it's showing me the pidentic issue, which is

02:09:06.240 --> 02:09:08.600
like catching some of the methods, some of the functions.

02:09:14.650 --> 02:09:16.490
I faced this issue many times.

02:09:55.360 --> 02:10:00.320
So that's the reason some of you are able to execute it.

02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:04.940
Some of you are not able to execute. Because of maybe a

02:10:04.940 --> 02:10:07.120
cache issue or

02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:17.620
maybe it is not able to install it correctly. So let me do

02:10:17.620 --> 02:10:18.240
it once again.

02:10:42.700 --> 02:10:45.500
Upload six file, but when I run the query, it gives me just

02:10:45.500 --> 02:10:49.180
to use the triangle button. So it will show you six files,

02:10:49.280 --> 02:10:52.740
all the six files. It's there, but it's not showing you in

02:10:52.740 --> 02:10:57.980
the same interface, but it's there. I'm going to deploy.

02:10:58.200 --> 02:11:03.350
Yeah, go ahead, deploy it. Maybe I can directly deploy it in

02:11:03.350 --> 02:11:04.510
deployment environment. I don't know. I think it will work

02:11:04.510 --> 02:11:05.670
perfectly fine.

02:11:09.410 --> 02:11:12.490
It works now. You copied the entire suggested path for the

02:11:12.490 --> 02:11:14.790
pip install requirement. Yeah, hopefully it will work. So

02:11:14.790 --> 02:11:18.430
when I was writing like a pip install hyphen R requirement

02:11:18.430 --> 02:11:21.390
or txt, right? Maybe it was not able to install all the

02:11:21.390 --> 02:11:27.350
dependencies because of my system cache issue. So I have

02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:31.150
just copied the entire suggested path. It looks like now it

02:11:31.150 --> 02:11:33.890
is installing everything. Although it should work even with

02:11:33.890 --> 02:11:37.690
the pip install hyphen R requirement or txt. We should not

02:11:37.690 --> 02:11:41.270
like a copy the entire path. This is how like things works.

02:11:41.630 --> 02:11:44.210
But yeah, so if it is getting confused, I'm giving the

02:11:44.210 --> 02:11:45.150
complete path itself.

02:11:49.500 --> 02:11:53.320
Guy, you can take a bug fixed code. Code is already bug

02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:56.960
fixed. So the code which I have given to you, right? It's

02:11:56.960 --> 02:11:57.760
already bug fixed.

02:12:03.470 --> 02:12:06.670
Yes, after correction, we will put everything on the drive.

02:12:11.460 --> 02:12:16.520
Okay looks like this time it was looking for like a complete

02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:19.520
path. Although it should work. So without even a complete

02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:28.740
path, okay, now it will work, see, copy, process the

02:12:28.740 --> 02:12:32.720
document. So code was fine guys, because of my system

02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:35.300
restart, it was not able to understand my requirement or txt

02:12:35.300 --> 02:12:39.100
installation. That's it. That was the only issue. There was

02:12:39.100 --> 02:12:43.980
no other issues code wise at least. Yeah, so I think you

02:12:43.980 --> 02:12:48.760
have seen the balloon. Yes, everyone. Yes, balloon. Yes. I

02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:52.020
think you have seen simply means that everything is up and

02:12:52.020 --> 02:12:56.960
running. Now I can I can try to chat. So tell me the name of

02:12:56.960 --> 02:13:06.740
name of all the PA ENTS patients from a document that you

02:13:06.740 --> 02:13:09.260
have. Let's see. So whether it is able to give me the name

02:13:09.260 --> 02:13:14.000
of patients or not, Oh, what is the issue now? A request

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:18.900
exception. Okay. URI API exceeded. Okay. So maximum try

02:13:18.900 --> 02:13:24.060
exceeded with this one caused by name error. Okay. So my URI

02:13:24.060 --> 02:13:29.920
API maximum try exceeded. Let's try once again. Okay. So

02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:31.980
name of the all the patients and document is Jane Smith,

02:13:32.260 --> 02:13:36.660
Carlos Mantia, John Doe and Michael Lee. Okay. So I'm able

02:13:36.660 --> 02:13:40.120
to give the get the answer. Okay. Give me some detail about

02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:44.100
Jane Smith. I'm going to write the query. Give me. Give me.

02:13:44.780 --> 02:13:50.140
Give me some. Give me some details about Jane Smith and his

02:13:50.140 --> 02:13:52.500
diagnosis.

02:13:53.560 --> 02:13:56.940
Let's see. It is such in my document. So Jane Smith is 16

02:13:56.940 --> 02:13:59.880
year old female with a medical history of type two diabetes,

02:14:00.180 --> 02:14:04.240
it is diagnosis at the age and this one. Okay. So can you

02:14:04.240 --> 02:14:11.700
tell me the, uh, you know, a cure for Jane Smith? See guys,

02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:15.000
I'm able to chat with my entire document based on the

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:16.120
provided medical document. Okay. So inside the document

02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:18.220
there is no information indicating that cure for the John

02:14:18.220 --> 02:14:20.740
Smith condition. So inside the document there is no such

02:14:20.740 --> 02:14:23.300
like information which is available for the cure. She has a

02:14:23.300 --> 02:14:26.640
type two diabetes and if I'm going to change my prompt that,

02:14:26.700 --> 02:14:29.600
okay, so if something is not available into a document, do

02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:32.500
one thing, go ahead and ask LLM and we'll go ahead and ask

02:14:32.500 --> 02:14:34.940
LLM and then it will give you the solution. So I just have

02:14:34.940 --> 02:14:38.360
to change my prompts over there. So here guys, as you can

02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:41.380
see in a very, very interactive manner, right in a very,

02:14:41.480 --> 02:14:44.340
very interactive manner. So this is my own chat bot. And uh,

02:14:44.440 --> 02:14:49.940
yeah. I'm able to chat and uh, uh, there, there is a Indian

02:14:49.940 --> 02:14:52.680
name, right? I think Priya Patel, which was mentioned. So

02:14:52.680 --> 02:15:03.580
give me a detail about Priya Patel medical history. Yeah.

02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:07.980
Let's see. Priya Patel is 40 year old female in the history

02:15:07.980 --> 02:15:10.880
of cancer diagnosis at the seven 37. See you underwent the

02:15:10.880 --> 02:15:16.680
in 2019. Okay. Fine. So it is. So you are able to give me

02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:18.600
all the responses guys from my own document.

02:15:21.630 --> 02:15:27.050
Yes everyone. So can we say that we are able to create a

02:15:27.050 --> 02:15:30.390
chat bot and now we are able to chat with our document. I

02:15:30.390 --> 02:15:33.730
can see, I have just given our medical history document and

02:15:33.730 --> 02:15:37.430
I have named it as a midi chat pro doesn't mean that I can't

02:15:37.430 --> 02:15:39.590
provide any other document. I can provide any document, any

02:15:39.590 --> 02:15:43.650
PDF. I have just changed the name as a finance assistant. I

02:15:43.650 --> 02:15:47.230
will just change the name as a maybe HR assistant. I will

02:15:47.230 --> 02:15:51.630
change our name as a company compliance assistant, right? So

02:15:51.630 --> 02:15:55.250
I can just try to upload any PDF document over here. I'll

02:15:55.250 --> 02:15:58.310
just change our name over here. Interface is going to be

02:15:58.310 --> 02:16:03.490
same and then I will be able to chat with my document. This

02:16:03.490 --> 02:16:10.030
is RAG. Yes, this is RAG. So here I'm just showing you with

02:16:10.030 --> 02:16:13.550
this medical, but technically I'm passing my document,

02:16:13.670 --> 02:16:15.830
right? So medical document, whatever document which I'm

02:16:15.830 --> 02:16:17.670
passing. I can pass finance document. Right?

02:16:20.250 --> 02:16:23.370
So, uh, right. Once and run anywhere. Yeah. Just, just

02:16:23.370 --> 02:16:26.730
change this name every time so that, you know, uh, you can

02:16:26.730 --> 02:16:29.190
just try to use the same bot again and again and again with

02:16:29.190 --> 02:16:31.530
your own document, with your own data. And even if I have

02:16:31.530 --> 02:16:34.530
like a 10,000 documents, that's completely fine. Even if I

02:16:34.530 --> 02:16:36.670
have a one lack of document or 1 million documents, that's

02:16:36.670 --> 02:16:39.850
completely fine. Right? I can even try to make it better and

02:16:39.850 --> 02:16:43.630
better. I can try to give a memory to this one. I can try to

02:16:43.630 --> 02:16:47.070
give a agentic capability to this one. I can. I can try to

02:16:47.070 --> 02:16:50.650
even log all of these information. So whatever question user

02:16:50.650 --> 02:16:53.950
is asking, right? So I can try to log question. I can try to

02:16:53.950 --> 02:16:57.530
log answer. I can try to even optimize it in terms of

02:16:57.530 --> 02:17:01.050
memory. So every time it should not go and hit my LLMs,

02:17:01.170 --> 02:17:04.650
right? Or my vector DV. So even from a catch, it should be

02:17:04.650 --> 02:17:07.910
able to take the context. So there are so many things to

02:17:07.910 --> 02:17:10.810
make it production ready, right? As of now, this is just a

02:17:10.810 --> 02:17:14.250
MVP, minimum viable product. As of now, it's just a MVP or

02:17:14.250 --> 02:17:17.690
you can say POCs, proof of concept, right? But to make it

02:17:17.690 --> 02:17:21.270
literally a industry ready, I can try to add a lot of

02:17:21.270 --> 02:17:23.970
memories over there. I can try to add a context over there.

02:17:24.770 --> 02:17:27.770
I can avoid hitting LLMs again and again. I can try to

02:17:27.770 --> 02:17:30.570
reduce a latency over there. I can try to make it available

02:17:30.570 --> 02:17:34.030
for a 10 user and 10,000 user. So I can try to achieve a

02:17:34.030 --> 02:17:37.650
scalability over here. I can try to integrate a logging over

02:17:37.650 --> 02:17:40.550
here, right? So that it will be able to log all the question

02:17:40.550 --> 02:17:43.330
and answer. So whatever question which I'm asking, it will

02:17:43.330 --> 02:17:46.190
be able to log whatever answer. Maybe I can try to

02:17:46.190 --> 02:17:49.590
configure. So as of now, I'm trying to pass a PDF, but let's

02:17:49.590 --> 02:17:53.150
suppose some user will be having a PDF, then Excel sheet,

02:17:53.230 --> 02:17:56.810
then word document, then TXT file, maybe VTT file or any

02:17:56.810 --> 02:18:00.410
other file. So I can try to configure it for all of those

02:18:00.410 --> 02:18:04.390
files, all of those files. So it doesn't matter what kind of

02:18:04.390 --> 02:18:07.610
file user is going to dump, it will be able to do it. I can

02:18:07.610 --> 02:18:10.090
even configure it. So here I'm uploading the file. I can

02:18:10.090 --> 02:18:12.690
configure it with respect to S3 bucket, with respect to

02:18:12.690 --> 02:18:16.690
blob. Maybe I can keep all of my file into a drive, right?

02:18:16.890 --> 02:18:19.810
And I will keep on uploading my drive, updating my drive. So

02:18:19.810 --> 02:18:21.710
whenever new document will come, I can upload it into a

02:18:21.710 --> 02:18:24.890
drive, maybe into a S3 bucket, I'll keep on uploading all

02:18:24.890 --> 02:18:27.870
the files and then my system should be able to give a

02:18:27.870 --> 02:18:30.690
response automatically from those. So there are so many

02:18:30.690 --> 02:18:33.850
things which we can do around it, right? To make it

02:18:33.850 --> 02:18:36.670
production ready depends upon the different use cases and

02:18:36.670 --> 02:18:39.810
this can be used even for a customer support. I can try to

02:18:39.810 --> 02:18:42.490
make it as a customer support. I can try to add a speech to

02:18:42.490 --> 02:18:45.550
text. Over here, I can try to add a speech to text over

02:18:45.550 --> 02:18:50.150
here. I can even try to, you know, uh, add a email

02:18:50.150 --> 02:18:52.290
configuration, email configuration means. So whenever there

02:18:52.290 --> 02:18:55.830
will be chat and let's suppose if I say that, okay, do one

02:18:55.830 --> 02:18:59.010
thing. So Priya Patel diagnosis is done or maybe Janice

02:18:59.010 --> 02:19:02.150
Smith diagnosis is done. Send a mail to, uh, like a Janice

02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:05.650
Smith or Priya Patel, send a mail to maybe, uh, send a

02:19:05.650 --> 02:19:08.130
WhatsApp message, send a WhatsApp message directly to a

02:19:08.130 --> 02:19:11.670
Janice Smith or Priya Patel. Then I will say that, okay,

02:19:11.690 --> 02:19:14.710
fine. This is literally. This is real time end to end. So

02:19:14.710 --> 02:19:17.770
you, doctor is just chatting, right? Doctor is just

02:19:17.770 --> 02:19:20.150
reviewing the entire document and then it is generating the

02:19:20.150 --> 02:19:22.130
solution and then immediately it will keep on sending

02:19:22.130 --> 02:19:25.750
everything to the customer or to the end user.

02:19:29.100 --> 02:19:33.020
Yes. Can our data source be hive? Anything data hive is

02:19:33.020 --> 02:19:35.480
basically a data warehousing solution, right? So which, uh,

02:19:35.620 --> 02:19:38.680
try to keep all the data set into a tables and then on

02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:41.660
technically not the tables technically into a HDFS file

02:19:41.660 --> 02:19:45.140
system and into like a chunks, it is going to store the data

02:19:45.140 --> 02:19:48.120
and at the time of processing it will call MapReduce in

02:19:48.120 --> 02:19:48.480
general.

02:19:53.480 --> 02:19:58.220
Yes. It will do service expert, uh, except surgery. Yes. All

02:19:58.220 --> 02:20:00.520
the services except surgery. Surgery can be done by a

02:20:00.520 --> 02:20:03.500
robotic, you know, our doctors, which is like happening

02:20:03.500 --> 02:20:06.920
nowadays across the world. Uh, but yeah, it can do

02:20:06.920 --> 02:20:10.620
everything, right? It can do everything. So going forward,

02:20:10.720 --> 02:20:13.280
shall we add those features guys in this one? Like a memory,

02:20:13.500 --> 02:20:17.460
like a scaling, uh, making it real times, like whenever, uh,

02:20:17.540 --> 02:20:19.860
like let's suppose I would like to send a message or mail

02:20:19.860 --> 02:20:22.500
directly, I'll just type, right? Okay. Send a mail to Priya

02:20:22.500 --> 02:20:25.480
Patel. So it, if there is a mail ID, which is available, it

02:20:25.480 --> 02:20:27.500
will send, or maybe send a WhatsApp message. I can integrate

02:20:27.500 --> 02:20:30.580
WhatsApp as well. If you remember, I don't know whether you

02:20:30.580 --> 02:20:32.540
have seen my video or not. I have already created a YouTube

02:20:32.540 --> 02:20:36.080
video. So where I'm integrating a WhatsApp. So directly with

02:20:36.080 --> 02:20:38.440
the LLMs, you can integrate a WhatsApp and then like do

02:20:38.440 --> 02:20:41.860
whatever you want. Everything is possible. Like the

02:20:41.860 --> 02:20:47.340
imagination is the only like a limit that you have. And I

02:20:47.340 --> 02:20:49.080
think this is how it works. This is how product we used to

02:20:49.080 --> 02:20:49.260
build.

02:20:52.180 --> 02:20:52.620
Yes.

02:20:55.680 --> 02:20:58.240
Agentic I'll add in a later stage because see this whole

02:20:58.240 --> 02:21:01.780
generative AI class is all about agentic. We have like so

02:21:01.780 --> 02:21:04.480
many things, like all, not so many, almost all the framework

02:21:04.480 --> 02:21:08.060
I have included with respect to agentic AI, right? So anyhow

02:21:08.060 --> 02:21:12.720
agentic will come into picture anyhow. But before that, even

02:21:12.720 --> 02:21:15.660
before adding agentic, let's suppose remove the agentic,

02:21:15.740 --> 02:21:18.320
right? So even before agentic, there are so many features

02:21:18.320 --> 02:21:20.540
that you can try to add to see this interface. This

02:21:20.540 --> 02:21:22.860
interface looks like pretty much amazing, right? It's a real

02:21:22.860 --> 02:21:25.040
time. I'm trying to maintain the session. I will be able to

02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:29.880
maintain the lot many things. Yes. Can we deal with the real

02:21:29.880 --> 02:21:32.480
time streaming data? I mean like in this case, real time

02:21:32.480 --> 02:21:34.620
streaming is not required, but yeah, you can deal with the

02:21:34.620 --> 02:21:36.900
real time streaming data. Just try to add any messaging

02:21:36.900 --> 02:21:38.660
services, Kafka or Kinesis.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:46.360
How when given read the data from the conference pages, just

02:21:46.360 --> 02:21:51.960
call the conference API. Yes. So next, so what, what I will

02:21:51.960 --> 02:21:54.900
do? So next week, right? Next week, I'll try to show you the

02:21:54.900 --> 02:21:58.400
enhancement of this one. So where I'll try to make this one

02:21:58.400 --> 02:22:01.800
public, plus I will not try to upload a data from the local.

02:22:01.940 --> 02:22:04.360
Maybe I'll do some sort of integration with two, three

02:22:04.360 --> 02:22:07.160
different, different system. So maybe from a S3 bucket, then

02:22:07.160 --> 02:22:10.460
Azure blobs, then your Google drive, right? So from multiple

02:22:10.460 --> 02:22:13.240
places. So you will keep on your different, different

02:22:13.240 --> 02:22:16.020
departments or team will keep on, you know, uploading a data

02:22:16.020 --> 02:22:19.100
on all of those locations and system will try to pull all of

02:22:19.100 --> 02:22:23.560
those data automatically. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you will be

02:22:23.560 --> 02:22:26.220
able to see from all of those environments and then you will

02:22:26.220 --> 02:22:29.100
be able to chat it. I'll try to add a memory layer over

02:22:29.100 --> 02:22:33.980
here. I'll try to add a catching layer over here. Plus I'll

02:22:33.980 --> 02:22:37.660
try to add a speech to text over here. I'll try to add a

02:22:37.660 --> 02:22:40.320
mail configuration service over here. I'll try to add a

02:22:40.320 --> 02:22:44.480
WhatsApp service over here and then like deployed everything

02:22:44.480 --> 02:22:48.080
on a real time. Plus a Facebook AI similarity search I'm

02:22:48.080 --> 02:22:51.000
using as a database. So maybe I'll try to use some of the

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.860
managed database. For example, Pinecone. Maybe I'll try to

02:22:53.860 --> 02:22:56.560
use the caveat or maybe quadrant I can try to use over here

02:22:56.560 --> 02:22:59.680
and plus logging. So whatever question that we are asking,

02:22:59.780 --> 02:23:02.540
so even that will be logged, answer will be logged so that

02:23:02.540 --> 02:23:05.300
it will be, it can be used in a later stage for an

02:23:05.300 --> 02:23:09.400
investigation purpose. Right. All of this enhancement

02:23:09.400 --> 02:23:13.740
altogether on top of this one to make it real time.

02:23:16.560 --> 02:23:21.280
Yes, everyone. Yeah. Then then you can use it across any

02:23:21.280 --> 02:23:24.540
industry, like finance industry or like any industry that

02:23:24.540 --> 02:23:26.640
you want. Customer support. Right. So let's suppose you are

02:23:26.640 --> 02:23:30.100
selling some product. Okay, fine. So like just, just build a

02:23:30.100 --> 02:23:32.200
customer support product. So whenever a customer will come,

02:23:32.340 --> 02:23:35.060
it will be able to give an answer. If it is not able to give

02:23:35.060 --> 02:23:38.080
the answer, it will generate a ticket automatically. Right.

02:23:38.140 --> 02:23:40.800
So in your admin, I can just try to create the small admin

02:23:40.800 --> 02:23:43.000
panel. So where you will be able to see all the tickets,

02:23:43.200 --> 02:23:45.480
customer detail, it's phone number, email ID, everything.

02:23:45.940 --> 02:23:48.340
Plus parallel to that, it will try to even update a customer

02:23:48.340 --> 02:23:50.640
automatically that, okay, fine. So this is the status of

02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:52.960
your ticket. If ticket is resolved. If it is not resolved,

02:23:53.140 --> 02:23:56.060
then this is the status. Everything. Everything like under

02:23:56.060 --> 02:24:01.100
the tracking and then everything with just a chat means an

02:24:01.100 --> 02:24:06.440
LP. So no need to learn coding like or your manager or

02:24:06.440 --> 02:24:09.060
anyone who is using the system. They don't have to know how

02:24:09.060 --> 02:24:11.140
the system has been built. They can just come to this UI

02:24:11.140 --> 02:24:12.880
interface, chat, simple chat,

02:24:20.040 --> 02:24:23.440
image and tablet, Excel, PPT. I mean like I can do this

02:24:23.440 --> 02:24:25.860
much. I think on top of this, you can keep on adding

02:24:25.860 --> 02:24:27.760
hundreds of different features. There can be hundreds of

02:24:27.760 --> 02:24:34.200
features that can be added. Yeah. So fine. Hope all of you

02:24:34.200 --> 02:24:39.780
are feeling happy now. Little bit. Yes. Everyone. Feeling

02:24:39.780 --> 02:24:45.440
happy. Not much, but yeah, at least a little bit. You will

02:24:45.440 --> 02:24:49.120
feel more happy like, uh, like by next week. So when I'm

02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:52.060
going to show you the enhancement, because once I will do

02:24:52.060 --> 02:24:56.840
the enhancement, it will not be a POCs or MVPs, it will

02:24:56.840 --> 02:24:59.780
become a real product, which you can use it.

02:25:04.170 --> 02:25:07.770
Yeah. But this is just a POC. Consider it as a POC running

02:25:07.770 --> 02:25:10.450
in my local system, but yeah, by next week it will not be in

02:25:10.450 --> 02:25:13.310
a local system. It will be over the cloud and cloud wise. So

02:25:13.310 --> 02:25:16.990
I'm planning to show you the deployment in AWS cloud so that

02:25:16.990 --> 02:25:19.930
I can show you the scalability. Even render is fine, but for

02:25:19.930 --> 02:25:25.280
AWS, so you all need an AWS account with a card. What is the

02:25:25.280 --> 02:25:27.480
next week agenda? I think this is what I was talking about.

02:25:27.580 --> 02:25:31.640
Right. Next week agenda, enhancement of this one. So make it

02:25:31.640 --> 02:25:36.880
like a remove it. Like just, just try to like a, you know.

02:25:36.880 --> 02:25:40.640
Uh, take it out from the POC phase or MVPs phase that that's

02:25:40.640 --> 02:25:45.980
the agenda for next week. Fine. And then once I will be done

02:25:45.980 --> 02:25:48.840
with this enhancement, uh, we'll go ahead with the agentic

02:25:48.840 --> 02:25:52.760
AI. Yeah. I think you can check your syllabus. Uh, we are

02:25:52.760 --> 02:25:55.220
going to start with agentic and then I'll add agentic even

02:25:55.220 --> 02:25:59.220
in this one. Even in this one, we'll try to add agentic.

02:26:02.150 --> 02:26:07.370
Fine. Okay. That's cool. So hope we are good for today's

02:26:07.370 --> 02:26:11.770
class. Uh. And, uh, there is no changes in a code by the

02:26:11.770 --> 02:26:14.010
way, the code which I have already shared inside a drive

02:26:14.010 --> 02:26:18.290
link, it's the same, right? So the only thing is like, uh,

02:26:18.290 --> 02:26:22.650
we have to do some sort of, uh, installation. Uh, there was

02:26:22.650 --> 02:26:25.430
that issue and, uh, we are able to fix that particular

02:26:25.430 --> 02:26:29.050
issue. So it should run in everyone's system. I'll try to

02:26:29.050 --> 02:26:31.110
upload the same piece of code even inside your dashboard

02:26:31.110 --> 02:26:36.270
and, uh, yeah. So now we are good to start with the cloud

02:26:36.270 --> 02:26:39.330
clearing. So we'll take a break for some time. And then, uh,

02:26:39.430 --> 02:26:43.070
maybe, maybe guys 10 minute of break today. Yeah.

02:26:46.740 --> 02:26:50.760
We just copied a code mostly, but if we have to come up with

02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:54.060
our own requirement and confident to use libraries, hope by

02:26:54.060 --> 02:26:59.320
end of the courses, see code is all about breaking down

02:26:59.320 --> 02:27:04.220
things into bits and pieces, right? Uh, again, it's not like

02:27:04.220 --> 02:27:06.740
whether you are doing a copy or paste or whether you are

02:27:06.740 --> 02:27:09.560
writing it by your own. It's all about. I will be able to

02:27:09.560 --> 02:27:11.240
break it. I will be able to build it.

02:27:14.730 --> 02:27:18.390
And if you think that, that, uh, you know, uh, by the end of

02:27:18.390 --> 02:27:21.410
this course, you will be able to build such kind of a thing.

02:27:21.490 --> 02:27:25.670
So even now to see the simple concept is that if you're able

02:27:25.670 --> 02:27:27.910
to build it now, or if you're able to understand it now,

02:27:28.010 --> 02:27:30.530
even by the end of the class, you will be able to, or into

02:27:30.530 --> 02:27:32.830
the course, you will be able to build it. If you are just

02:27:32.830 --> 02:27:35.630
sitting ideally and just watching this lecture as a movie,

02:27:35.770 --> 02:27:40.350
not writing even a single line by yourself, even by the end

02:27:40.350 --> 02:27:42.470
of this course, the reality is you will be able to, you will

02:27:42.470 --> 02:27:46.190
not be able to build anything. So try to activate yourself,

02:27:46.510 --> 02:27:51.090
write something or at least execute something. Yeah. That's

02:27:51.090 --> 02:27:53.590
a, that's the only thing which is going to help you out. Uh,

02:27:53.710 --> 02:27:56.830
otherwise, if you're just wondering that by the end of this

02:27:56.830 --> 02:27:59.510
course, by watching this course as a movie, I will be able

02:27:59.510 --> 02:28:03.670
to build something like this. Not possible, not in my

02:28:03.670 --> 02:28:06.550
courses, even in anyone's courses, you can go and join

02:28:06.550 --> 02:28:10.230
everywhere. You will face the same issue for me, by the way.

02:28:10.290 --> 02:28:14.050
That's great. Yeah. So I just like advice to everyone that

02:28:14.050 --> 02:28:16.770
go with the flow, execute whatever we discussed in the

02:28:16.770 --> 02:28:20.290
class, just to do it and then try to put up some like a more

02:28:20.290 --> 02:28:26.720
effort, uh, to add something like a new into this one. Any

02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:29.040
resources for streamlit? I don't think that even yesterday I

02:28:29.040 --> 02:28:31.560
told you, right, streamlit is not something which we like

02:28:31.560 --> 02:28:35.440
learn. It's a UI, simple function is given to you. Call that

02:28:35.440 --> 02:28:38.080
function for a button, for a chat window, for the interface

02:28:38.080 --> 02:28:43.300
and use it. Yeah. I mean like we should not go and learn

02:28:43.300 --> 02:28:46.680
everything. Uh, I, if I know basic of Python, that's what's

02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:51.050
more than enough, sir, when we will be covering Langchain,

02:28:51.090 --> 02:28:53.650
Langraph basic, check your syllabus. We are going through a

02:28:53.650 --> 02:28:57.190
syllabus by the way. Yeah. You will get to know everything

02:28:57.190 --> 02:29:00.630
if you'll go through your syllabus. So fine guys, we'll take

02:29:00.630 --> 02:29:04.450
a break by the way for maybe like a 10 minutes. So it's a 29

02:29:04.450 --> 02:29:08.630
past 11 IST, uh, we'll take a 10 minute break and after 10

02:29:08.630 --> 02:29:12.250
minutes, so those who will be having an issue, so they can

02:29:12.250 --> 02:29:14.190
share their screen, we can try to resolve it or maybe. If

02:29:14.190 --> 02:29:17.470
you have any kind of a doubt, so feel free to ask me agenda

02:29:17.470 --> 02:29:20.570
for next week is clear. I believe, right, what we are going

02:29:20.570 --> 02:29:23.730
to do next week. Uh, so we are going to see the enhancement

02:29:23.730 --> 02:29:27.910
of this same application plus a deployment, right?

02:29:28.210 --> 02:29:31.230
Enhancement wise, all the enhancement will be done with

02:29:31.230 --> 02:29:34.170
respect to a real time implementation. That is the kind of

02:29:34.170 --> 02:29:38.920
enhancement we are going to do it. Can we get the summary of

02:29:38.920 --> 02:29:41.940
the topic we'll discuss in a query session? I mean like why

02:29:41.940 --> 02:29:44.260
you are keeping this kind of expectation, what do you want

02:29:44.260 --> 02:29:46.520
from the mentor? You should not join the class, you should

02:29:46.520 --> 02:29:49.220
not focus for a two hour and then mentor will keep on

02:29:49.220 --> 02:29:51.660
repeating each and everything at the end of the class. Don't

02:29:51.660 --> 02:29:53.700
keep this kind of expectation. I'm not that kind of a mentor

02:29:53.700 --> 02:29:56.760
which will do this much of handholding, right? I'm not

02:29:56.760 --> 02:29:59.220
teaching to our kids. If I would have like a talk to our

02:29:59.220 --> 02:30:01.460
kids, which I'm doing it in my young year on, I could have

02:30:01.460 --> 02:30:04.500
done that, right? But here I'm assuming that people are

02:30:04.500 --> 02:30:09.380
adult and responsibly they will join the classes and they

02:30:09.380 --> 02:30:11.560
will listen to each and everything and they will not expect

02:30:11.560 --> 02:30:13.600
X, Y, Z things in every classes.

02:30:17.530 --> 02:30:21.130
Yeah. I think since last seven year, eight year precisely

02:30:21.130 --> 02:30:24.690
and more than 20,000 plus transition I'm talking about.

02:30:25.110 --> 02:30:29.090
Learners transition right from a non tech to tech, from a

02:30:29.090 --> 02:30:32.130
fresher to experienced person from a dropout and again

02:30:32.130 --> 02:30:35.570
people with the experience of 20 year from coming from a

02:30:35.570 --> 02:30:37.890
different field, they're able to make a transition. So if

02:30:37.890 --> 02:30:40.030
you're expecting that someone will do a handholding and they

02:30:40.030 --> 02:30:42.890
will teach you ABCD X, Y, Z, and then you will be able to

02:30:42.890 --> 02:30:44.950
make a transition without putting up any kind of effort.

02:30:45.190 --> 02:30:49.190
Believe me in this entire world. Even. Nobody is going to

02:30:49.190 --> 02:30:51.210
tell you that I'm going to do a handholding and you will do

02:30:51.210 --> 02:30:57.490
a transition. You will not. That's a harsh reality. Yeah. So

02:30:57.490 --> 02:31:02.390
just accept it, align yourself with this reality as soon as

02:31:02.390 --> 02:31:07.170
possible. Believe me, uh, you will get all the advantages.

02:31:08.650 --> 02:31:11.770
Otherwise you will just keep on imagining that, okay, maybe

02:31:11.770 --> 02:31:14.190
I can do a transition. I can get a package of one car or 50

02:31:14.190 --> 02:31:18.750
lakh, which is, which never happens. It's not that easy.

02:31:23.450 --> 02:31:26.970
I asked about the query session somebody only a query

02:31:26.970 --> 02:31:30.130
session somebody means which one, uh, query session,

02:31:30.310 --> 02:31:36.500
somebody, somebody of this entire lecture, I think it's the

02:31:36.500 --> 02:31:39.380
wrong expectation. Yeah. Okay. But yeah, you can, you can

02:31:39.380 --> 02:31:41.160
ask me question. Anyhow, we have a doubt in the session,

02:31:41.300 --> 02:31:43.760
right? So feel free to ask me any kind of a question. I'm

02:31:43.760 --> 02:31:46.240
like a happy to answer all this, like all of your questions.

02:31:47.660 --> 02:31:51.300
It's hard to spend two hour again after the class. That's

02:31:51.300 --> 02:31:55.100
the reason we have a doubt. Clearing. Yeah. If you're not

02:31:55.100 --> 02:31:57.760
able to understand anything, you have a doubt clearing.

02:32:02.020 --> 02:32:05.420
Okay. Fine guys. We'll take a break now. Not 10 minutes of

02:32:05.420 --> 02:32:08.740
only five minutes of break. So it's a 32 past 11 and after,

02:32:08.860 --> 02:32:13.760
uh, like a 37 past 11 so we are going to start the doubt

02:32:13.760 --> 02:32:15.620
clearing with that. Thank you so much. Everyone. Those who

02:32:15.620 --> 02:32:18.780
is not having a doubt, they can drop off. I think agenda for

02:32:18.780 --> 02:32:21.880
my next week is set and those who is having a doubt. Be

02:32:21.880 --> 02:32:27.280
here. We'll take a question one by one. Last closing. Now,

02:32:27.380 --> 02:32:31.080
no, uh, we have a doubt clearing, so not closing glass,

02:32:31.240 --> 02:32:32.280
taking a break for five minutes.

02:37:59.770 --> 02:38:03.030
Okay. So fine. Everyone we are back. So those who's having

02:38:03.030 --> 02:38:07.130
any kind of a doubt, please raise your hand and uh, one by

02:38:07.130 --> 02:38:10.050
one, you can start asking your doubts or you can share your

02:38:10.050 --> 02:38:16.230
screen so that I can fix your bugs. Uh, so Akash was having

02:38:16.230 --> 02:38:21.590
question. So Akash, he has not raised hand. Arun. Armaan.

02:38:21.590 --> 02:38:28.410
Vipin. Akash. Yeah. Akash. Yeah. Yeah. First of all, let's

02:38:28.410 --> 02:38:33.390
go ahead with Akash. Yes. Akash. Tell me. So actually, I

02:38:33.390 --> 02:38:37.110
think you took my question wrongly. So I've been sharing

02:38:37.110 --> 02:38:40.610
with you for a long time and I'm really liking your way of

02:38:40.610 --> 02:38:43.410
teaching. It's fine. It's fine. Akash. You can ask your

02:38:43.410 --> 02:38:46.670
question. That's the reason I was asking. Like, uh, so we

02:38:46.670 --> 02:38:49.250
have like two hours of class and then two hours off for that

02:38:49.250 --> 02:38:53.090
doubt clearing session. So for that clearing session, like

02:38:53.090 --> 02:38:56.290
generally, I'm not able to spend that much time. And so if

02:38:56.290 --> 02:38:59.750
we can have a kind of summary for that, because sometimes,

02:38:59.890 --> 02:39:04.090
uh, in the dark learning system, also, I think that, uh, you

02:39:04.090 --> 02:39:07.630
might be like discussing some of the, uh, good topics and,

02:39:07.750 --> 02:39:12.070
uh, maybe I should go through that. I'll be talking about

02:39:12.070 --> 02:39:16.570
your doubt, only your doubts. Okay. So generally, I thought,

02:39:16.610 --> 02:39:19.750
like, if you are like explaining some thoughts that kind of.

02:39:19.750 --> 02:39:23.010
Can be useful for me or something like that. So if I have a

02:39:23.010 --> 02:39:25.430
summary, then I can go through the complete lecture for that

02:39:25.430 --> 02:39:28.730
session. So with that intent, I was just saying, but yeah,

02:39:28.770 --> 02:39:32.770
it's not necessary to do for sure. You can ask your doubts

02:39:32.770 --> 02:39:36.510
and I will be like getting a doubt. Don't worry. Yep. Right

02:39:36.510 --> 02:39:39.110
now. I don't have any doubts. So yeah, this was the only

02:39:39.110 --> 02:39:42.350
thing I was having. So I was trying to learn from other

02:39:42.350 --> 02:39:45.470
thoughts. So instead of spending two hours, like if I can

02:39:45.470 --> 02:39:48.830
spend, uh, just go through a summary and then I can spend

02:39:48.830 --> 02:39:52.510
two hours. I think, uh, for the recording session, maybe

02:39:52.510 --> 02:39:58.250
that would be useful. Okay. Okay. As you wish. So classes

02:39:58.250 --> 02:40:04.390
for all of you. Yeah. Okay. So, uh, the question, uh, thanks

02:40:04.390 --> 02:40:08.630
for taking session today, sir, I have some bunch of notes

02:40:08.630 --> 02:40:11.790
today. Uh, so the regarding the rack, uh, rack, uh,

02:40:11.830 --> 02:40:15.510
processing part, right. Uh, so when we write the query, uh,

02:40:15.630 --> 02:40:19.330
when we send the query to the letter DB, right. Mm-hmm. So

02:40:19.330 --> 02:40:23.390
is it, is it implicitly to convert the embedding and, uh,

02:40:23.710 --> 02:40:27.510
uh, pitch the result from, uh, with a DB or how does that

02:40:27.510 --> 02:40:30.490
happen? Uh, yeah. So whenever we are trying to send a

02:40:30.490 --> 02:40:34.010
prompt, right. So by default, this is going to convert my

02:40:34.010 --> 02:40:38.410
prompt into a embeddings and then it is going to, so first

02:40:38.410 --> 02:40:41.910
of all, based on my query, basically my prompt, it will try

02:40:41.910 --> 02:40:44.370
to convert that into embedding. And then it will try to

02:40:44.370 --> 02:40:47.410
search into a vector DB. It will try to bring all the

02:40:47.410 --> 02:40:51.230
document. Related to my query. And then here we are writing

02:40:51.230 --> 02:40:53.970
a system prompt, right. Let me share my screen once again.

02:40:54.170 --> 02:40:57.110
So here we are writing a system prompt. So here you can see

02:40:57.110 --> 02:40:59.470
that, that it is trying to attach my prompts. Plus it is

02:40:59.470 --> 02:41:02.390
trying to attach the document document, which is able to

02:41:02.390 --> 02:41:07.670
retrieve it from the, from the vector DB. This one. Yeah. So

02:41:07.670 --> 02:41:10.030
preparing this prompt and then finally I will be able to get

02:41:10.030 --> 02:41:13.730
the answer. This is the flow. So the context is nothing but

02:41:13.730 --> 02:41:17.330
a purely raw documents or is kind of that vector something.

02:41:17.530 --> 02:41:20.350
Uh, yeah. I mean, it's kind of the embedding values. So

02:41:20.350 --> 02:41:23.770
embedding values. So whenever I'll try to, you know, uh,

02:41:23.950 --> 02:41:26.790
like, uh, give a prompt, like I said, it will try to convert

02:41:26.790 --> 02:41:30.030
into embeddings and then embeddings itself. It will try to

02:41:30.030 --> 02:41:33.010
extract from the, uh, basically like a vector DB and

02:41:33.010 --> 02:41:36.510
eventually it will try to convert that into a plain text

02:41:36.510 --> 02:41:42.430
here. Okay. So plain text. So plain text. Okay. So in this

02:41:42.430 --> 02:41:46.770
case, uh, but, uh, we don't have any explicit according for

02:41:46.770 --> 02:41:59.710
the, uh, context. All right. It's, the, uh,

02:41:59.710 --> 02:42:07.130
it's

02:42:07.130 --> 02:42:08.510
good for the Islamic Fellowship or for the, for the, the

02:42:08.510 --> 02:42:10.890
rest, you know, uh, for the Sanghaز bloodline. Is that okay?

02:42:10.890 --> 02:42:12.170
It doesn't help. Who's, who's got every kind of idea, right.

02:42:12.710 --> 02:42:13.770
What, this is the only way we know where it.. You took this

02:42:13.770 --> 02:42:16.990
by the name of punk, Franky sub Just like Okay. be sending

02:42:16.990 --> 02:42:20.710
again to those prompt plus those value will be sending into

02:42:20.710 --> 02:42:24.310
the okay exactly but everything is implicit okay so yeah

02:42:24.310 --> 02:42:27.970
yeah yeah so and the next thing server regarding the

02:42:27.970 --> 02:42:31.650
scalability purpose right for example let us think we have

02:42:31.650 --> 02:42:35.150
this one application small application uh we install in our

02:42:35.150 --> 02:42:38.310
local right uh for example let us say we have the different

02:42:38.310 --> 02:42:41.810
server across us or different different countries like this

02:42:41.810 --> 02:42:46.810
so i wanted to make it one global chatbot so in this case uh

02:42:46.810 --> 02:42:50.390
i wanted to implement the same application across the system

02:42:50.390 --> 02:42:54.250
right three servers so do we need to make one uh load

02:42:54.250 --> 02:42:58.250
balancer and uh so do we need to control like this or how

02:42:58.250 --> 02:43:01.310
are the how how is the system processing in behind so

02:43:01.310 --> 02:43:04.570
basically we can try to add a cdn content delivery network

02:43:04.570 --> 02:43:09.390
plus we can try to add a load balancer so if there is a one

02:43:09.390 --> 02:43:11.990
if let's suppose we have configured one server and one

02:43:11.990 --> 02:43:14.790
server is not able to entertain all the queries let's

02:43:14.790 --> 02:43:14.970
suppose we have configured one server and one server is not

02:43:14.970 --> 02:43:16.250
able to entertain all the queries there are like a hundred

02:43:16.250 --> 02:43:18.410
people who is trying to hit my system so what is the

02:43:18.410 --> 02:43:21.350
responsibility of a load balancer so load balancer will try

02:43:21.350 --> 02:43:24.430
to just process everything in parallel so it will try to

02:43:24.430 --> 02:43:27.530
send a one user request to one server then another user

02:43:27.530 --> 02:43:29.690
request to another server so whichever server will be

02:43:29.690 --> 02:43:32.870
available so in that way the entire system will not just

02:43:32.870 --> 02:43:35.070
rely on one single server it will rely on the multiple

02:43:35.070 --> 02:43:38.430
servers so basically load balance of load balancer is to

02:43:38.430 --> 02:43:42.150
distribute your entire workload this is where load balancer

02:43:42.150 --> 02:43:47.650
comes correct so in this case when the picture come when the

02:43:47.650 --> 02:43:51.570
cdn comes into the picture cdn for a content delivery

02:43:51.570 --> 02:43:53.910
basically so cdn so let's suppose we are trying to deliver

02:43:53.910 --> 02:43:57.230
this content into a multiple regions so what will happen so

02:43:57.230 --> 02:43:59.950
in a respective reason it will try to do some sort of a

02:43:59.950 --> 02:44:03.390
cache and just to do a faster query so just to like allow

02:44:03.390 --> 02:44:07.150
user to reach out to my system in a easiest possible way

02:44:07.150 --> 02:44:10.290
without let's suppose i'm having a server in india and you

02:44:10.290 --> 02:44:14.090
are trying to hit the server from a usa right so for usa

02:44:14.090 --> 02:44:17.830
people indian server will be very very far so what if if i

02:44:17.830 --> 02:44:21.150
if i can try to replicate my server same indian server into

02:44:21.150 --> 02:44:25.130
a usa region into a uk region in australia region so my

02:44:25.130 --> 02:44:28.210
content will be available in all of those regional servers

02:44:28.210 --> 02:44:30.870
and whenever user will come and they will try to hit my

02:44:30.870 --> 02:44:33.670
server so they will try to get a response from their local

02:44:33.670 --> 02:44:36.390
server and this is where this content delivered network cdn

02:44:36.390 --> 02:44:40.190
comes into a picture to make it faster yeah yeah you got it

02:44:40.190 --> 02:44:43.870
that point so then uh on top of the same question right when

02:44:43.870 --> 02:44:47.670
we make one global chat over there let us uh for the load

02:44:47.670 --> 02:44:51.130
for the distribution perspective it's not distribution for

02:44:51.130 --> 02:44:54.210
the server maintenance perspective we are maintaining the

02:44:54.210 --> 02:44:57.430
multiple system two or three system yes so for example so we

02:44:57.430 --> 02:45:00.310
are getting the server uh i am the i am in the usa location

02:45:00.770 --> 02:45:03.850
i am asking a number of questions uh we have added the

02:45:03.850 --> 02:45:06.790
multiple features in behind it's like for channel memory

02:45:06.790 --> 02:45:11.250
features or like this everything which is a common address

02:45:11.250 --> 02:45:16.130
the server so my question is that whatever uh maybe when we

02:45:16.130 --> 02:45:19.250
ask the query uh the particular server at the time the

02:45:19.250 --> 02:45:23.810
server was down so my questions will be sending into the

02:45:23.810 --> 02:45:26.850
another server because of i think with the help of the load

02:45:26.850 --> 02:45:31.130
balancer yes so by the time right by the time uh we added

02:45:31.130 --> 02:45:34.930
some channel memory features in the those so my entire

02:45:34.930 --> 02:45:38.710
history will be lost right so if i ask any question i can

02:45:38.710 --> 02:45:41.730
interact for the one of them no so when we try to talk about

02:45:41.730 --> 02:45:44.490
the caching so basically it try we can try to do a caching

02:45:44.490 --> 02:45:47.270
on a client side itself so there is a server side and there

02:45:47.270 --> 02:45:49.730
is a client side so if i am trying to implement a caching on

02:45:49.730 --> 02:45:52.970
a client side so basically it will be on your browser and if

02:45:52.970 --> 02:45:55.430
you will check your browser like a consumption of your

02:45:55.430 --> 02:45:57.570
memory of your local system memory you will be able to see

02:45:57.570 --> 02:46:01.090
that that we are consuming maybe a 10 mb of space or 20 mb

02:46:01.090 --> 02:46:04.170
of space in your local itself so everything will be

02:46:04.170 --> 02:46:07.550
available in your local if you've got it if it is in a

02:46:07.550 --> 02:46:10.410
client side if it is on our server side so obviously if one

02:46:10.410 --> 02:46:13.010
server is down and if we are not persisting it again on a

02:46:13.010 --> 02:46:15.430
server side there is something called as in memory and there

02:46:15.430 --> 02:46:17.350
is something called as persistent so if we are trying to

02:46:17.350 --> 02:46:20.050
persist your memory on a server side so obviously it will be

02:46:20.050 --> 02:46:22.430
available so even if one server is down there will be a

02:46:22.430 --> 02:46:25.670
replica of it it will try to give a it will try to take a

02:46:25.670 --> 02:46:27.790
memory reference from some other servers from a replica

02:46:27.790 --> 02:46:31.950
server basically so so for those kind of scenario will we

02:46:31.950 --> 02:46:35.490
make it additional customization for example let us say we

02:46:35.490 --> 02:46:41.270
have some local cache right in browser do we need to do we

02:46:41.270 --> 02:46:44.470
need to write any code explicitly or nothing like oh yeah we

02:46:44.470 --> 02:46:46.750
can we can try to add a radius over there we can try to add

02:46:46.750 --> 02:46:49.210
a radius over there on a server side so that we'll be able

02:46:49.210 --> 02:46:52.910
to maintain the complete state on even on a server yeah yeah

02:46:52.910 --> 02:46:55.030
part of the server side would be okay but our client side

02:46:55.030 --> 02:46:59.290
i'm asking our local browsers so we are we are already

02:46:59.290 --> 02:47:01.570
maintaining a session over here right so in a stream lead

02:47:01.570 --> 02:47:03.870
session yeah will be available so that's the reason so we

02:47:03.870 --> 02:47:07.190
have implemented a session this one correct yeah session

02:47:07.190 --> 02:47:11.070
state right so this session state yeah it opened one page in

02:47:11.070 --> 02:47:15.970
the web ui right this is only pointing to the specific page

02:47:15.970 --> 02:47:19.470
session state or whatever a specific application page

02:47:19.470 --> 02:47:23.370
basically the url that you are trying to hit yes sir so but

02:47:23.370 --> 02:47:26.430
in real-time application we have multiple pages right it's

02:47:26.430 --> 02:47:31.450
not only one if we will be web ui part but the domain domain

02:47:31.450 --> 02:47:35.410
is going to be only one right so the domain has only yes

02:47:35.410 --> 02:47:37.470
correct yeah so it has the only one yeah i'm so application

02:47:37.470 --> 02:47:40.290
is running on a particular domain on a particular port

02:47:40.290 --> 02:47:42.510
number so with respect to that it uses to maintain the

02:47:42.510 --> 02:47:45.610
session so now inside that domain doesn't matter how many

02:47:45.610 --> 02:47:48.010
pages you are going to browse it will be able to deliver

02:47:48.010 --> 02:47:53.450
okay so are you saying that we have we can make it session

02:47:53.450 --> 02:47:57.390
state uh with respect to of the domain right it's not record

02:47:57.390 --> 02:48:00.670
for the multiple pages but as much one domain when we

02:48:00.670 --> 02:48:03.770
customize the application one domain has the multiple pages

02:48:03.770 --> 02:48:09.150
around 10 pages or 12 pages any possibility to maintain the

02:48:09.150 --> 02:48:12.790
state for across the pages or do we need to maintain the

02:48:12.790 --> 02:48:16.210
state for the domain level just just try to maintain the

02:48:16.210 --> 02:48:18.570
state for the domain label and it will be able to bind all

02:48:18.570 --> 02:48:24.130
the pages okay okay so okay so those scope will be until uh

02:48:24.130 --> 02:48:26.630
application uh running time right until the application

02:48:26.630 --> 02:48:30.810
until the application is live yes yeah so this is also

02:48:30.810 --> 02:48:33.850
alternative for the cache right session state maintaining

02:48:33.850 --> 02:48:38.290
this alternative technical technically it's a caching okay

02:48:38.290 --> 02:48:42.230
okay and and one more question sir for the local cache right

02:48:42.230 --> 02:48:45.450
local server cache a local browser do we need to write any

02:48:45.450 --> 02:48:48.770
code over there or to maintain that because redis is okay

02:48:48.770 --> 02:48:52.530
for server level i'm asking for the local uh machine level

02:48:52.530 --> 02:48:55.110
right we want to know session state is going to session

02:48:55.110 --> 02:48:57.230
state is going to maintain everything see we are trying to

02:48:57.230 --> 02:48:59.710
load our vector storage once we are trying to load a chat

02:48:59.710 --> 02:49:02.810
model only once but throughout the session this will be

02:49:02.810 --> 02:49:08.170
available okay this is only for local it's not per this is

02:49:08.170 --> 02:49:12.570
only for local only for the server yes okay yeah if we want

02:49:12.570 --> 02:49:15.810
to go with the server uh we would prepare with the radius

02:49:15.810 --> 02:49:21.950
yes yes yeah yeah yeah then next question that uh so when we

02:49:21.950 --> 02:49:25.730
upload the data this data custom data into web right maybe

02:49:25.730 --> 02:49:30.350
any manager services what you said it uh so how do we

02:49:30.350 --> 02:49:33.750
compromise with the security so basically any of the data

02:49:33.750 --> 02:49:37.950
will be transferred right here and there yes so anyhow data

02:49:37.950 --> 02:49:42.330
is going into your own databases it's not going into sales

02:49:42.330 --> 02:49:45.970
databases so the credential that you are trying to put the

02:49:45.970 --> 02:49:48.870
encryption that you are trying to use to convert a data you

02:49:48.870 --> 02:49:51.390
have to think about that so maybe i can try to encrypt a

02:49:51.390 --> 02:49:53.990
data then i can try to send those data maybe i can try to

02:49:53.990 --> 02:49:57.950
attach maybe a security layer security layer means maybe i

02:49:57.950 --> 02:50:00.070
can try to attach authentication layer on top of my

02:50:00.070 --> 02:50:04.010
databases so that without auth so as of now it's just a in

02:50:04.010 --> 02:50:06.110
memory db that we are trying to use facebook has semantic

02:50:06.110 --> 02:50:08.830
search in memory db we are trying to use it but let's

02:50:08.830 --> 02:50:11.330
suppose if i'm trying to integrate some of the db for

02:50:11.330 --> 02:50:14.090
example quadrant or baviot or pine cone but with the

02:50:14.090 --> 02:50:17.390
credentials if i'm trying to use it so in that way it will

02:50:17.390 --> 02:50:23.780
not be compromised okay got it got it okay uh so uh in this

02:50:23.780 --> 02:50:27.760
case uh uh for the security level do we set up only

02:50:27.760 --> 02:50:31.540
authentication would it be sufficient or encryption is also

02:50:31.540 --> 02:50:34.980
mandatory to transfer the data authentication we can try to

02:50:34.980 --> 02:50:38.800
do it in a multiple way so we can try to attach maybe a api

02:50:38.800 --> 02:50:41.280
key with that we can try to authenticate we can try to

02:50:41.280 --> 02:50:44.460
attach ssl over there with that we can try to like you know

02:50:44.460 --> 02:50:48.380
add another label of security so depends how you are

02:50:48.380 --> 02:50:51.200
building the application but yeah in any way it will be like

02:50:51.200 --> 02:50:54.480
if you are adding any kind of authentication it will be

02:50:54.480 --> 02:50:58.520
secured okay so we will go to make some additional

02:50:58.520 --> 02:51:02.840
customization and to perform the security exactly so until

02:51:02.840 --> 02:51:08.520
we cannot meet it everything is yes yeah okay okay yeah so

02:51:08.520 --> 02:51:11.600
these are my questions sir and i think you you are very well

02:51:11.600 --> 02:51:15.160
deep dive in today's session so it was so much impressive

02:51:15.160 --> 02:51:17.660
and thank you for your session just just wait for the next

02:51:17.660 --> 02:51:21.000
class we'll make it real time yeah let's see i'm waiting for

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:25.580
those that yeah yeah okay rupees go ahead with your question

02:51:25.580 --> 02:51:32.100
yes money so my question is we are already using the hugging

02:51:32.100 --> 02:51:36.540
phase embedding and we uh we we store the vector store in

02:51:36.540 --> 02:51:40.460
the in memory so how can i check the save possible my vector

02:51:40.460 --> 02:51:43.520
values and how can i check my the vector values what the

02:51:43.520 --> 02:51:46.700
vector values i have so basically you won't be able to check

02:51:46.700 --> 02:51:51.440
it directly you have to like uh call a fasi save so once it

02:51:51.440 --> 02:51:54.960
will be saved over here you will be able to check it so next

02:51:54.960 --> 02:51:58.080
class we are going to save in the cloud dv then we can i'm

02:51:58.080 --> 02:52:00.060
not even yeah i'm not going to i'm going to remove this

02:52:00.060 --> 02:52:02.580
facebook as similarity search i'm going to use a cloud-based

02:52:02.580 --> 02:52:05.080
database so over there clearly it will be visible that okay

02:52:05.080 --> 02:52:09.180
fine this was my text this is my embeddings and uh we check

02:52:09.180 --> 02:52:13.020
the shape on so what the vector shape exactly exactly see

02:52:13.020 --> 02:52:15.820
vector shape depends upon the model that we are using for

02:52:15.820 --> 02:52:20.800
example uh here we are trying to use basically this model

02:52:20.800 --> 02:52:25.220
now if you will go and search this model uh let's suppose if

02:52:25.220 --> 02:52:28.440
i'm going to google and if i'm trying to search this

02:52:28.440 --> 02:52:32.500
particular model by default shape will be available to you

02:52:32.500 --> 02:52:35.560
so if you'll come over here so somewhere you will be able to

02:52:35.560 --> 02:52:39.840
see the shape in a model description that what is the

02:52:39.840 --> 02:52:49.620
embedding shape it is going to provide uh 768 yeah yeah and

02:52:49.620 --> 02:52:53.620
and so also one more thing um uh what i am feel like i am

02:52:53.620 --> 02:52:57.080
struggling most of time to generate the prompt like system

02:52:57.080 --> 02:53:00.860
prompt i can generate what the good prompt i can how can i

02:53:00.860 --> 02:53:05.240
write the good prompt to get the good outputs just write all

02:53:05.240 --> 02:53:08.480
the use case all the process whatever comes in your mind and

02:53:08.480 --> 02:53:11.920
that will come with experience so all the edge cases we try

02:53:11.920 --> 02:53:16.840
to write inside the prompt okay and one more thing uh can we

02:53:16.840 --> 02:53:21.360
use the vector db for the entity type solutions before i am

02:53:21.360 --> 02:53:25.120
using the splink and other things to resolve that one of my

02:53:25.120 --> 02:53:28.140
use case sorry what was that can you please repeat once

02:53:28.140 --> 02:53:31.460
again identity realization or entity resolution to create

02:53:31.460 --> 02:53:35.500
the my cdp uh golden customer copy records where no

02:53:35.500 --> 02:53:38.420
duplicate records are available the customer customer

02:53:38.420 --> 02:53:45.300
details for deduplication right yeah yeah in my case uh in

02:53:45.300 --> 02:53:48.640
the uh e-commerce website where the i get the customer

02:53:48.640 --> 02:53:51.780
information from the different different of the sources and

02:53:51.780 --> 02:53:55.300
that might be duplicates and there is some use case where

02:53:55.300 --> 02:53:58.840
the customer fuzzy matching on the customer name some email

02:53:58.840 --> 02:54:02.120
or email on the cosine similarities phone number on the

02:54:02.120 --> 02:54:05.280
cosine similarity so somehow we can manage that and is

02:54:05.280 --> 02:54:08.000
giving the good result 80 percent of the records can be

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:11.940
unique but it's a very slow is the processing i am using the

02:54:11.940 --> 02:54:16.220
spark to process that data but is very slow so can i use in

02:54:16.220 --> 02:54:21.460
such case the vector dv to resolve uh in use case to uh get

02:54:21.460 --> 02:54:24.700
some result on the deduplication things it can be handled

02:54:24.700 --> 02:54:28.280
the big data things uh yes yeah it will be it will be able

02:54:28.280 --> 02:54:31.100
to handle it so by default if you are trying to convert your

02:54:31.100 --> 02:54:34.040
data into a vectors and then if you are trying to check

02:54:34.040 --> 02:54:37.240
every time whenever you are trying to insert so based on the

02:54:37.240 --> 02:54:39.580
similarity search and that too based on the semantic

02:54:39.580 --> 02:54:42.560
similarity search right so based on the meaning of the data

02:54:42.560 --> 02:54:45.200
similarity search it will be able to identify and it will be

02:54:45.200 --> 02:54:49.160
able to remove semantic we can get by the overlapping when

02:54:49.160 --> 02:54:53.640
we trying to do the correct semantic means meaning wise so

02:54:53.640 --> 02:54:56.540
whenever meaning is same maybe your entire sentence is not

02:54:56.540 --> 02:54:59.320
same maybe your keywords are not same by the way right means

02:54:59.320 --> 02:55:01.700
the word that you are using inside the sentence is not same

02:55:01.700 --> 02:55:05.000
but yeah meaning wise if it is like a same it will be able

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:08.320
to even remove that part that is pretty much achievable with

02:55:08.320 --> 02:55:12.720
the help of vector db in the easiest possible manner okay

02:55:12.720 --> 02:55:16.180
okay and by default whenever you are trying to use a pine

02:55:16.180 --> 02:55:18.080
cone or whenever you are trying to use a facebook as

02:55:18.080 --> 02:55:22.240
similarity search it does that okay okay thanks so i try

02:55:22.240 --> 02:55:25.820
with that and come with my use case yeah yeah sure thank you

02:55:25.820 --> 02:55:32.260
yeah thanks uh next question uh arun please go ahead

02:55:36.840 --> 02:55:39.500
yes sir uh sir i'm having some um

02:55:42.160 --> 02:55:47.040
entering the command for kunda create uh minus in the uh

02:55:47.040 --> 02:55:50.980
medi chart no python 3.0 it is giving some error actually so

02:55:50.980 --> 02:55:55.000
uh yeah please share this screen uh ranjith in between go

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:58.040
ahead with the question yeah i think i have the same

02:55:58.040 --> 02:56:04.580
question regarding this community live in community i was

02:56:04.580 --> 02:56:07.920
not paying attention i was which is somewhere else so how

02:56:07.920 --> 02:56:11.680
did you resolve this issue because i have done similar kind

02:56:11.680 --> 02:56:16.640
of work but never had this issue before uh basically sir we

02:56:16.640 --> 02:56:19.380
have we have actually not resolved that issue from a

02:56:19.380 --> 02:56:22.060
language community it was not even a language and community

02:56:22.060 --> 02:56:25.180
issue by the way it was actually an issue with my

02:56:25.180 --> 02:56:27.660
installation so whenever i was trying to run this

02:56:27.660 --> 02:56:31.680
requirement or txt right so because of the cache issue in my

02:56:31.680 --> 02:56:34.880
system just in my system maybe if i'm going to restart my

02:56:34.880 --> 02:56:37.760
system it will work as it is it will not it won't give me

02:56:37.760 --> 02:56:42.060
the issue but yeah so since there is uh like my system i

02:56:42.060 --> 02:56:44.340
have not started since very long time and there was a catch

02:56:44.340 --> 02:56:47.340
issue and because of that it was not able to understand my

02:56:47.340 --> 02:56:49.880
environment properly it was not able to get the complete

02:56:49.880 --> 02:56:53.380
folder name so what i have done so i have just like executed

02:56:53.380 --> 02:56:56.140
each and everything with that complete folder name as you

02:56:56.140 --> 02:57:00.180
can see here let me show you that part uh the execution that

02:57:00.180 --> 02:57:02.740
i have done so it was just an installation issue by the way

02:57:04.140 --> 02:57:09.220
for me i every day i restart my computer not once but many

02:57:09.220 --> 02:57:12.380
times because i don't keep because again it's just a catcher

02:57:12.380 --> 02:57:15.020
issue so maybe you are starting restarting and maybe it is

02:57:15.020 --> 02:57:18.060
not able to take it so what i have done see here just just

02:57:18.060 --> 02:57:21.980
try to focus here so i'm trying to provide a path for python

02:57:21.980 --> 02:57:26.960
exe but you are sharing okay i'm not sure okay fine let me

02:57:26.960 --> 02:57:30.180
share my screen yeah so see what i have done uh it was a

02:57:30.180 --> 02:57:34.080
very like a easy fixes so here i have given a complete path

02:57:34.140 --> 02:57:37.040
for python.exe and then i'm writing pip install requirement

02:57:37.040 --> 02:57:40.460
.exe same thing so for many people right many people you

02:57:40.460 --> 02:57:43.060
have seen a chat that they were just doing like a pip

02:57:43.060 --> 02:57:45.580
install hyphen r requirement or txt and it was working right

02:57:45.580 --> 02:57:48.980
because it was not cached and it was able to understand the

02:57:48.980 --> 02:57:52.200
python environment in my system because of catch issue or vs

02:57:52.200 --> 02:57:54.520
code issue it was not able to understand it so i have given

02:57:54.520 --> 02:57:58.140
a fully qualified path over here to identify the python and

02:57:58.140 --> 02:58:02.180
that that eventually fixed my issue so so you think in my

02:58:02.180 --> 02:58:07.800
machine also we'll have the exactly yes can you ping this

02:58:07.800 --> 02:58:11.960
path let me try this my path is different see my party user

02:58:11.960 --> 02:58:15.800
and my username is basically school right yeah your username

02:58:15.800 --> 02:58:18.160
will be different your username is not going to be same as

02:58:18.160 --> 02:58:22.680
mine so wherever wherever you have this python.exe in a

02:58:22.680 --> 02:58:25.280
current environment see this is my current environment which

02:58:25.280 --> 02:58:28.340
i have tested right so this is my environment now how to

02:58:28.340 --> 02:58:30.260
find out this environment in a windows machine let me show

02:58:30.260 --> 02:58:35.820
you that part so basically see just go to your seat majorly

02:58:35.820 --> 02:58:39.560
c drive right majorly c drive so go to your c drive inside c

02:58:39.560 --> 02:58:42.040
drive you will be able to find out user folder now inside

02:58:42.040 --> 02:58:45.700
you will be able to find out your own name for me it's a

02:58:45.700 --> 02:58:48.880
school that i have given as a name right but your will be

02:58:48.880 --> 02:58:52.300
different so just go to your user name now inside that you

02:58:52.300 --> 02:58:56.600
will be able to find out environment environment folder so

02:58:56.600 --> 02:59:02.880
just go to that environment folder where is my e

02:59:06.060 --> 02:59:08.820
sorry school and then anaconda inside that there is a

02:59:08.820 --> 02:59:14.000
anaconda so here is anaconda three right inside anaconda

02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:16.560
three there is a envs folder environment folder so whatever

02:59:16.560 --> 02:59:18.800
environment which i'm going to create it will keep all the

02:59:18.800 --> 02:59:22.680
environment folder inside this one so environment here and

02:59:22.680 --> 02:59:25.920
then inside this see i have so many 64 environments right

02:59:25.920 --> 02:59:28.440
what is the environment which i have created for this

02:59:28.440 --> 02:59:35.040
project so test sudh i believe or test so so test this one

02:59:36.060 --> 02:59:39.320
su ds let's suppose i have created on 31st this one right so

02:59:39.320 --> 02:59:43.220
at 1106 so i'll go over here inside that i will be having a

02:59:43.220 --> 02:59:47.140
python.exe file see here is a python.exe file right okay so

02:59:47.140 --> 02:59:50.380
just you have to copy this path along with the python.exe

02:59:50.380 --> 02:59:53.720
and then hyphen m it will work simple and then write your

02:59:53.720 --> 02:59:57.340
people install the copy.txt okay yeah let me try it now yeah

02:59:57.340 --> 03:00:03.600
yeah hi okay fine sir uh now

03:00:10.360 --> 03:00:16.000
see um my question is see all the examples what we have done

03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:20.220
is for the unstructured data right so if i got a structured

03:00:20.220 --> 03:00:25.700
data like rdbms or something if i want to write english and

03:00:25.700 --> 03:00:29.300
get a result out of that one right so what kind of an

03:00:29.300 --> 03:00:34.220
architecture or framework we can use first of all first of

03:00:34.220 --> 03:00:37.440
all for a embedding search see what we are trying to do with

03:00:37.440 --> 03:00:40.040
respect to a vector database over here so we are trying to

03:00:40.040 --> 03:00:42.620
convert everything as a numerical value technically

03:00:42.620 --> 03:00:46.720
embedding then we are trying to do a cosine similarity we

03:00:46.720 --> 03:00:49.980
are trying to do a matching right so that try to bring those

03:00:49.980 --> 03:00:53.200
record which is matching with my query technically this is

03:00:53.200 --> 03:00:55.860
what we are trying to achieve yeah now let's suppose if i'm

03:00:55.860 --> 03:00:58.700
talking about the dbms rdbms relational database management

03:00:58.700 --> 03:01:02.180
system we are using mysql msql db2 something like that or

03:01:02.180 --> 03:01:05.520
postgres we are trying to do that now over there it doesn't

03:01:05.520 --> 03:01:10.240
support a vector matching right it will always go ahead with

03:01:10.240 --> 03:01:13.480
a sequential search line by line row by row row by row row

03:01:13.480 --> 03:01:16.560
by row based on the schema design that i have so you will

03:01:16.560 --> 03:01:19.820
not be able to do a this kind of embedding or this kind of a

03:01:19.820 --> 03:01:22.720
vector search but still let's suppose for example i have a

03:01:22.720 --> 03:01:26.540
data into my uh rdbms system so what i have to do is that

03:01:26.540 --> 03:01:29.500
that parallel to so whenever some data will come into my

03:01:29.500 --> 03:01:34.140
rdbms system i can try to bind it into my vector database so

03:01:34.140 --> 03:01:38.000
it will be able to store all of those file into rdbms

03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:40.580
parallel to it it will try to store everything into a vector

03:01:40.580 --> 03:01:46.080
database as well making sense okay yeah and then if

03:01:46.080 --> 03:01:48.740
something is available into my vector database i can do the

03:01:48.740 --> 03:01:52.120
exact same thing right because rdbms is not going to show

03:01:52.120 --> 03:01:54.520
you a vector uh it is it is not going to allow you for a

03:01:54.520 --> 03:01:57.460
vector like a base search it is going to be a sequential

03:01:57.460 --> 03:02:04.960
search yeah i have seen uh in few few uh examples where you

03:02:04.960 --> 03:02:08.660
know if you write in english people are able to you know

03:02:08.660 --> 03:02:14.920
convert those into you know uh sequel and even the uh the

03:02:14.920 --> 03:02:19.680
relationship between the tables are also being you know that

03:02:19.680 --> 03:02:24.360
example is completely different and you have seen that

03:02:24.360 --> 03:02:28.200
example i have already taught that example i think i have

03:02:28.200 --> 03:02:31.380
discussed that example let me show you that this example is

03:02:31.380 --> 03:02:34.720
already available that you're talking about personally i

03:02:34.720 --> 03:02:38.180
have discussed that example that is different see the

03:02:38.180 --> 03:02:41.040
example that you are talking about that you are going to ask

03:02:41.040 --> 03:02:45.220
some question in a normal plain english right yeah just with

03:02:45.220 --> 03:02:49.360
the chat and then it tried to convert your chat basically

03:02:49.360 --> 03:02:52.500
into a sql query i think this is what you are talking about

03:02:52.500 --> 03:02:55.920
yes yes yeah that is different see we are talking here we

03:02:55.920 --> 03:02:59.020
are trying to talk about the data matching right over there

03:02:59.020 --> 03:03:02.380
based on the llms or based on the query that i'm going to

03:03:02.380 --> 03:03:03.580
ask to the llms so it was talking about the data matching

03:03:03.580 --> 03:03:04.080
and i think it was talking about and then it was will try to

03:03:04.080 --> 03:03:07.240
access all the schema design, whatever table that you have

03:03:07.240 --> 03:03:09.120
inside the table, whatever the schema structure that you

03:03:09.120 --> 03:03:12.220
have, and then it will try to form the query out of it. And

03:03:12.220 --> 03:03:15.980
I have already discussed as a practical example. Let me show

03:03:15.980 --> 03:03:20.840
you that in one of my class. So crew, AI, agentic, AI

03:03:20.840 --> 03:03:24.360
development, find, yeah. So are you able to see 24th my SQL

03:03:24.360 --> 03:03:25.600
power data retrieval assistant?

03:03:28.800 --> 03:03:31.400
Are you able to see my screen? Okay. I think, I think my

03:03:31.400 --> 03:03:34.200
screen is not visible. I'm not sharing. Are you able to see

03:03:34.200 --> 03:03:40.170
my screen now? Yeah. Yeah. Now. So in this lecture, if you

03:03:40.170 --> 03:03:42.990
will download ready to use code is already available and

03:03:42.990 --> 03:03:46.530
ready to use lecture is also available SQL power data

03:03:46.530 --> 03:03:52.010
retrieval assistant. Now, if I'm going to ask, I think my

03:03:52.010 --> 03:03:56.470
screen will be like a black, right? Yes, sir. It is black.

03:03:56.650 --> 03:04:02.370
It is. It is black because of that DRM system. Let me do one

03:04:02.370 --> 03:04:07.850
thing. Okay. Okay. Let me, let me share. Let me share this

03:04:07.850 --> 03:04:12.070
one with all of you. So just open it up, open it up and it

03:04:12.070 --> 03:04:14.170
is again amazing application and that to real time

03:04:14.170 --> 03:04:15.930
application, which I have taught in my class, previous

03:04:15.930 --> 03:04:19.610
generative AI lecture. So just, just try to like open it up.

03:04:19.710 --> 03:04:23.930
I have integrated a real time SQL system. I'm trying to ask

03:04:23.930 --> 03:04:27.230
a query just as a plain English. It is able to generate a

03:04:27.230 --> 03:04:31.130
query and then it is technically able to, you know, hit your

03:04:31.130 --> 03:04:34.450
databases. So this application is different. It's not a RIG

03:04:34.450 --> 03:04:37.490
application by the way. It's a simple plain English means

03:04:37.490 --> 03:04:40.690
LLMs to SQL query conversion that, that is something that I

03:04:40.690 --> 03:04:42.930
have used over here. I have already been to the lecture

03:04:42.930 --> 03:04:46.950
link. Yeah. Got it. I, I will look into it. So basically,

03:04:46.950 --> 03:04:50.370
you know, the, this approach is better or the other one, you

03:04:50.370 --> 03:04:54.230
know, parallelly storing both in DB as well as the vector

03:04:54.230 --> 03:04:59.910
DB, which one will be better architect. Can you please

03:04:59.910 --> 03:05:03.650
repeat once again? So what I'm saying, uh, you previously

03:05:03.650 --> 03:05:05.570
said, you know, along with storing, you know, along with

03:05:05.570 --> 03:05:09.530
storing the data in RDBMS, you have to store it, uh, as an

03:05:09.530 --> 03:05:13.410
embedding in vector and then, you know, uh, go with their

03:05:13.410 --> 03:05:18.330
solution, right. Initially. So that solution or the, the one

03:05:18.330 --> 03:05:22.310
that you shared, uh, in a few minutes back, which one do you

03:05:22.310 --> 03:05:26.210
think, uh, if we are hitting a RDBMS, which will be

03:05:26.210 --> 03:05:29.950
architecturally, I think, I think you are not able to

03:05:29.950 --> 03:05:32.210
interpret a difference between these two, see these two

03:05:32.210 --> 03:05:34.550
applications are different. It's a complete different

03:05:34.550 --> 03:05:36.230
application. The application that we are talking about in

03:05:36.230 --> 03:05:38.530
one application, the application that you are saying, so

03:05:38.530 --> 03:05:40.990
whether you are going to ask a question in English and

03:05:40.990 --> 03:05:44.470
automatically it will convert that into a sequel, right? So

03:05:44.470 --> 03:05:46.970
over there, we are not doing a data matching by the way,

03:05:47.050 --> 03:05:51.050
over there. So we are trying to provide a complete schema to

03:05:51.050 --> 03:05:55.170
my LLM. So LLMs are going to understand my schema, only

03:05:55.170 --> 03:05:58.610
schema design, not data, only a table structure. It is able

03:05:58.610 --> 03:06:01.350
to understand and based on my query, it is trying to

03:06:01.350 --> 03:06:06.370
generate a SQL query. Okay. Okay. Got it. I think, I think

03:06:06.370 --> 03:06:09.130
that this, this example is already available. Maybe quickly

03:06:09.130 --> 03:06:12.110
I can run it and I can try to show it to you. Shall I show

03:06:12.110 --> 03:06:15.570
it to you guys, all of you by running it in my system? Yes,

03:06:15.590 --> 03:06:19.130
sir. Please. Uh, okay. Because video will be black because

03:06:19.130 --> 03:06:27.490
of the DRM thing. Let me, let me do it. So 24th May SQL

03:06:27.490 --> 03:06:31.310
power data retrieval, May, June, July, August. Okay. It's

03:06:31.310 --> 03:06:34.470
four months back. I have discussed. Let me check. So where

03:06:34.470 --> 03:06:35.150
is the code?

03:06:38.010 --> 03:06:41.430
There must be a code or maybe I can download it.

03:06:50.220 --> 03:06:53.020
Every kind of application I have already discussed in my

03:06:53.020 --> 03:06:55.080
previous class and same I'll do it in your class as well.

03:06:55.140 --> 03:07:04.220
Don't worry. So Yeah. So we can do this for SQL only. So if

03:07:04.220 --> 03:07:06.820
we, if we query in natural language and we want to answer in

03:07:06.820 --> 03:07:10.500
Python, then it's possible. Yes. Obviously it's possible.

03:07:10.700 --> 03:07:17.280
Yes. Okay. See school download SQL open folder down.

03:07:19.250 --> 03:07:19.950
So

03:07:33.640 --> 03:07:41.260
maybe I'll have to go ahead with some configuration on fig.

03:07:41.420 --> 03:07:49.020
This is fine. And then no API key. Okay. At that point of

03:07:49.020 --> 03:07:52.540
time, API key was different.

03:07:57.000 --> 03:07:59.660
And that too. So the application that I have shown in my

03:07:59.660 --> 03:08:01.940
class, so it was able to understand multiple languages,

03:08:02.100 --> 03:08:04.380
Hindi, English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese,

03:08:04.480 --> 03:08:07.660
Telugu, Tamil, Marathi. This is how we have built it. So you

03:08:07.660 --> 03:08:10.500
don't have to even ask a question in a, you know, English

03:08:10.500 --> 03:08:13.380
language. You can ask your question in all of these given

03:08:13.380 --> 03:08:17.580
languages, multi-language system we have discussed. So chat

03:08:17.580 --> 03:08:21.380
completion. This is fine. Model name, database URI is fine.

03:08:21.900 --> 03:08:27.240
I just have to replace my API key here. Let me replace it.

03:08:27.600 --> 03:08:34.680
Okay. On fig URI API key, environment API

03:08:41.430 --> 03:08:44.890
key, control S. Okay.

03:08:47.130 --> 03:08:54.710
And the utils, it's cool, SQL alchemy URI model API key, API

03:08:54.710 --> 03:09:03.410
URL fine, requirement fine, main is fine. Okay. So here,

03:09:03.610 --> 03:09:13.390
Streamlint run. Okay. And main.py file or app.py file. So

03:09:18.760 --> 03:09:22.500
this is basically the interface and you can try to choose

03:09:22.500 --> 03:09:24.720
the language. For example, if I'm choosing like English,

03:09:24.900 --> 03:09:27.220
plus I have added one more thing. So even you can try to

03:09:27.220 --> 03:09:31.160
speak and then you can try to ask a question. So I can type

03:09:31.160 --> 03:09:40.880
a question over here that give me a detail about database.

03:09:41.600 --> 03:09:47.740
Okay. So here, this is not up address, no host. Okay. So

03:09:47.740 --> 03:09:55.860
database, I have to again reconfigure. So environment, I was

03:09:55.860 --> 03:10:07.140
using Polar Azure, NeoDB I was using. Okay. So NeoDB, I have

03:10:07.140 --> 03:10:11.900
to quickly configure my database. NeoDB. So

03:10:59.710 --> 03:11:03.390
technology wise, you have used the same chat configuration.

03:11:03.390 --> 03:11:05.230
So not your on-premise 받아, complete earlier in Radi ant

03:11:05.230 --> 03:11:05.230
temper para.

03:11:12.970 --> 03:11:13.810
So,

03:11:40.140 --> 03:11:44.860
when you create database, you search your database again.

03:11:44.860 --> 03:11:47.940
You add two numbers to run. You look for the code. You store

03:11:47.940 --> 03:11:49.720
sano vit x. Somehow, you can run the code yourself. Only for

03:11:49.720 --> 03:11:49.760
the people who look to do more. Okay.

03:12:36.880 --> 03:12:41.400
You log into S 있었, create a user. You fix it.doing

03:12:43.250 --> 03:12:44.910
lots of things together. And then, what should you do? You

03:12:46.410 --> 03:12:52.190
loop. owner this launch is archived okay fine copy

03:12:56.510 --> 03:13:01.640
snippet my vs code well

03:13:15.850 --> 03:13:19.530
okay so neo is fixed

03:13:24.040 --> 03:13:24.840
by

03:13:31.020 --> 03:13:36.460
the way this one is acquired by databricks you know right uh

03:13:36.460 --> 03:13:42.800
sorry i mean neon is part of databricks now as a they are

03:13:42.800 --> 03:13:47.240
using as a late base yeah yeah so yes i have a table over

03:13:47.240 --> 03:13:50.300
here so yes my last time table that i have created it's

03:13:50.300 --> 03:13:54.240
already there okay good so i've just like uh replaced my

03:13:54.240 --> 03:14:00.000
server api of my neon dv it should work now is

03:14:03.870 --> 03:14:14.450
my application running refresh it give me a list of a list

03:14:14.450 --> 03:14:17.170
of all the database

03:14:18.830 --> 03:14:23.590
again address no such host is known background error now

03:14:41.670 --> 03:14:47.010
it's running as you can see and uh hopefully yeah okay so

03:14:47.010 --> 03:14:52.730
not found url chat completion fine this url i have to change

03:14:52.730 --> 03:14:57.110
so i'm able to connect with neo dv i just have to do little

03:14:57.110 --> 03:15:01.610
bit of modification with respect to my configuration

03:15:03.370 --> 03:15:09.870
fine so this one code example

03:15:14.220 --> 03:15:18.750
chat completion okay

03:15:23.960 --> 03:15:26.480
so cls run again

03:15:30.230 --> 03:15:34.870
list of all the databases

03:15:43.400 --> 03:15:47.960
so select name from sqlite master user type is equal to

03:15:47.960 --> 03:15:52.060
table and error running query sql select from this one

03:15:52.060 --> 03:16:01.320
background on this table okay so tell me about customer

03:16:01.320 --> 03:16:02.960
table yeah

03:16:11.630 --> 03:16:15.390
so see uh basically i have just asked the question tell me

03:16:15.390 --> 03:16:18.490
about the customer table right and uh automatically what it

03:16:18.490 --> 03:16:20.650
is trying to do so this is trying to create a query

03:16:20.650 --> 03:16:24.370
automatically right query automatically and then from my db

03:16:24.370 --> 03:16:27.710
which is a newer db by the way neon db by the way and from

03:16:27.710 --> 03:16:31.870
that db it is able to fetch a data for me so again maybe i

03:16:31.870 --> 03:16:35.850
can try to ask a very very complex query from this one so

03:16:35.850 --> 03:16:41.470
let me check my db uh if i have to ask a very complex

03:16:41.470 --> 03:16:43.590
question you will be able to see that it is able to form

03:16:43.590 --> 03:16:48.730
even a very complex query for me let me close so many tabs

03:16:48.730 --> 03:16:50.270
are open this

03:16:54.010 --> 03:16:56.330
one is medi chat pro where

03:17:12.560 --> 03:17:16.720
is my new db by the way yeah here so we have a order table

03:17:16.720 --> 03:17:25.520
so fine give me a order table or order item give me a list

03:17:25.520 --> 03:17:32.760
of uh like a order items which price is more than 150 okay

03:17:32.760 --> 03:17:36.360
so let me write a complex query give me a

03:17:39.620 --> 03:17:43.000
order order which value

03:17:44.950 --> 03:17:53.790
is value is more than 150. let's see it will be able to form

03:17:53.790 --> 03:17:56.710
all of this query filtration it will be able to do it and

03:17:56.710 --> 03:18:00.330
then finally it will be able to face the record so see this

03:18:00.330 --> 03:18:01.130
is the complex query table so now let's see the given

03:18:01.150 --> 03:18:03.290
generated i think this is what you are talking about right

03:18:03.290 --> 03:18:07.570
right write a simple like english and not just english see i

03:18:07.570 --> 03:18:10.050
have given you multiple options tamil telugu marathi bengali

03:18:10.050 --> 03:18:13.290
arabic german hindi and even you can try to like you know

03:18:13.290 --> 03:18:16.050
speak just say something that okay fine i'm looking for this

03:18:16.050 --> 03:18:18.970
data from this table it will be able to so i have asked a

03:18:18.970 --> 03:18:21.390
query and see the query it is able to form i mean even

03:18:21.390 --> 03:18:25.230
showing you the query so this operation is different so here

03:18:25.230 --> 03:18:28.250
if you look into my code base or maybe just go through the

03:18:28.250 --> 03:18:31.010
lectures you will be able to understand because over there i

03:18:31.010 --> 03:18:33.410
have already explained step by step each and everything so

03:18:33.410 --> 03:18:37.090
over there we are giving an access of schema and based on

03:18:37.090 --> 03:18:39.570
the schema understanding it is trying to like understand

03:18:39.570 --> 03:18:43.430
this ln or this particular nlp and it is trying to

03:18:43.430 --> 03:18:46.050
understand the schema and based on that it is trying to form

03:18:46.050 --> 03:18:49.730
the query now this query it is going to hit to my db because

03:18:49.730 --> 03:18:52.750
at the end of the day my db don't understand this part right

03:18:52.750 --> 03:18:56.410
my db only understand the query that's a borderline with my

03:18:56.410 --> 03:18:59.510
db so technically it is trying to create the query and it is

03:18:59.510 --> 03:19:02.830
trying to send this query to my db and whatever data this

03:19:02.830 --> 03:19:05.910
query is returning i'm able to see those data and this is

03:19:05.910 --> 03:19:10.230
how it's a llm powered sql system so where you don't have to

03:19:10.230 --> 03:19:13.850
know about the sql so basically when you will execute this

03:19:13.850 --> 03:19:16.630
entire things right you will feel like uh do i need to learn

03:19:16.630 --> 03:19:20.310
sql this is the kind of feeling you will be able to get and

03:19:20.310 --> 03:19:23.590
doesn't matter like how complex your query is it will be

03:19:23.590 --> 03:19:28.830
able to like perform the operation yeah still the rag kind

03:19:29.530 --> 03:19:32.910
of you know uh similarity search we won't be able to because

03:19:32.910 --> 03:19:38.130
still it will be limited to sql syntax right uh because

03:19:38.130 --> 03:19:41.190
because that is that is a need right with respect to us see

03:19:41.190 --> 03:19:44.110
both the use cases are different cases is completely

03:19:44.110 --> 03:19:46.830
different and this use case is different so here you have to

03:19:46.830 --> 03:19:50.330
filter the data right now in case of a rag you are trying to

03:19:50.330 --> 03:19:53.830
match a data similarity between the data so use case itself

03:19:53.830 --> 03:19:55.850
is different so whatever use case that you are trying to

03:19:55.850 --> 03:19:58.990
solve you have to like a allowing yourself accordingly

03:19:59.530 --> 03:20:03.430
correct see uh since you have shown the neon db i just want

03:20:03.430 --> 03:20:06.690
to ask one more question and then i will stop see uh

03:20:06.690 --> 03:20:11.310
databricks acquired this neon db so when they acquired it

03:20:11.310 --> 03:20:15.710
what they are saying like we are acquiring neon to build the

03:20:15.710 --> 03:20:21.330
next wave of a agents okay so as part of a agents they are

03:20:21.330 --> 03:20:27.370
saying agents will create this uh dbs in neon right so that

03:20:27.370 --> 03:20:29.610
part i didn't get because once we have all these things

03:20:29.610 --> 03:20:29.610
let's do the handling with the some element in the appear so

03:20:29.610 --> 03:20:31.570
we want to run a query to build a new to this as we have we

03:20:31.570 --> 03:20:34.710
are doing the same thing over here so if i would like to

03:20:34.710 --> 03:20:38.150
create a db automatically if i would like to ingest a data

03:20:38.150 --> 03:20:40.970
automatically and if i would like to run a query on top of

03:20:40.970 --> 03:20:43.490
automatically everything is possible here in the same

03:20:43.490 --> 03:20:43.890
application

03:20:59.530 --> 03:21:01.910
it will try to create a data type it will try to create a db

03:21:01.910 --> 03:21:05.030
it will try to create the relationship basically in between

03:21:05.030 --> 03:21:07.590
so one to one one too many or whatever er diagram that you

03:21:07.590 --> 03:21:10.350
have right so we'll try to configure each and everything

03:21:10.350 --> 03:21:13.230
automatically and then set up your entire db you don't have

03:21:13.230 --> 03:21:19.030
to do anything you don't just have to chat okay right this

03:21:19.030 --> 03:21:24.980
is the application which i'm showing you as of now okay uh

03:21:24.980 --> 03:21:30.160
next question please uh now yeah sure you can share your

03:21:30.160 --> 03:21:31.320
screen yeah yeah

03:21:35.740 --> 03:21:38.180
yeah go

03:21:39.430 --> 03:21:42.470
ahead i think arun is sharing his screen yeah yeah sir i'm

03:21:42.470 --> 03:21:46.810
getting this error actually i am trying to uh hit this uh

03:21:46.810 --> 03:21:51.190
command actually initially whenever uh you have given that

03:21:51.190 --> 03:21:55.830
command right to check it konda is not installed that's the

03:21:55.830 --> 03:22:02.450
issue so of so konda you have to install first or maybe you

03:22:02.450 --> 03:22:04.610
can go ahead with the python just give me a remote control

03:22:04.610 --> 03:22:07.910
i'll fix the issue yeah sir

03:22:09.990 --> 03:22:15.090
can you yeah i can access your system now okay

03:22:17.300 --> 03:22:20.060
so yeah in

03:22:50.900 --> 03:22:53.560
between so i can take a query from arman yeah go ahead

03:22:53.560 --> 03:22:54.800
please hello

03:22:57.270 --> 03:23:03.970
sir uh are you here yeah excuse me i have a similar

03:23:03.970 --> 03:23:10.570
requirement like just to show that uh the query sql thing

03:23:10.570 --> 03:23:14.230
similarly i have some some requirement i am looking for a

03:23:14.230 --> 03:23:20.050
chatbot so which uh gives the details about uh uh the test

03:23:20.050 --> 03:23:23.810
failure okay actually we we store uh every day we run

03:23:23.810 --> 03:23:27.890
thousands of test case and we store it in mango db okay so

03:23:27.890 --> 03:23:32.530
just i want to create uh this similar kind of chatbot so and

03:23:32.530 --> 03:23:36.550
uh just i want to ask some question what are the failures in

03:23:36.550 --> 03:23:41.450
this specific and what are the crash messages reported in

03:23:41.450 --> 03:23:48.510
the build so is it a good way uh we should use a react or

03:23:48.510 --> 03:23:54.210
it's a simple just to show uh the sql power no no i i think

03:23:54.210 --> 03:23:56.910
i think you didn't get the things which i was trying to

03:23:56.910 --> 03:24:00.010
explain see rag is diff so are you talking about the sql

03:24:00.010 --> 03:24:05.350
system that i have shown or the yeah i have i i have similar

03:24:05.350 --> 03:24:08.970
requirement of the sql system kind of a requirement right

03:24:09.190 --> 03:24:13.850
correct correct yes see that is not a rag by the way if that

03:24:13.850 --> 03:24:17.590
so whenever i'm trying to fire a query for example it's a

03:24:17.590 --> 03:24:21.210
mongodb or maybe a cassandra maybe some sort of a sql

03:24:21.210 --> 03:24:25.650
databases right now those databases never understands your

03:24:25.650 --> 03:24:30.750
english language simple correct now so what i do so i will

03:24:30.750 --> 03:24:35.330
try to send a query to a llm basically and to a llm i'll

03:24:35.330 --> 03:24:39.810
give an access of that database or maybe a table access give

03:24:39.810 --> 03:24:42.550
an access means what access of a schema or whatever

03:24:42.550 --> 03:24:44.630
collection that i have whatever document that i have i'll

03:24:44.630 --> 03:24:48.690
just try to give an access right now what my llm will do on

03:24:48.690 --> 03:24:52.810
behalf of me so instead of i writing a query my llm will

03:24:52.810 --> 03:24:55.290
write a query because now my llm is having a schema access

03:24:55.290 --> 03:24:58.010
or they understand the entire databases or tables or

03:24:58.010 --> 03:25:01.970
collection inside it right okay so now be writing a query my

03:25:01.970 --> 03:25:05.250
llm is writing a query on behalf of me by understanding a

03:25:05.250 --> 03:25:08.550
schema and then it is trying to fire it is trying to hit a

03:25:08.550 --> 03:25:13.270
database again by writing a query itself just the only the

03:25:13.270 --> 03:25:16.470
only matter of fact is that that previously you were writing

03:25:16.470 --> 03:25:21.190
it now lm is writing it okay so previously you were supposed

03:25:21.190 --> 03:25:24.170
to understand the sql query you have to learn the sql query

03:25:24.170 --> 03:25:27.530
and maybe let's suppose a sql query length is 100 lines

03:25:27.530 --> 03:25:31.030
right if it is a very very complex sql query so again you

03:25:31.030 --> 03:25:33.710
have to be mastered into a sql query you have to understand

03:25:33.710 --> 03:25:36.590
a schema and everything like database design and everything

03:25:36.590 --> 03:25:39.230
you have to understand now with the help of llms you don't

03:25:39.230 --> 03:25:41.950
have to even know sql it's completely fine if you don't know

03:25:41.950 --> 03:25:45.630
sql that's okay because my llms are writing those sql

03:25:45.630 --> 03:25:50.530
queries for me okay so thank you maybe i'll go through that

03:25:50.530 --> 03:25:56.250
yeah and that is not a rag yeah rag means so there is a data

03:25:56.250 --> 03:25:59.190
and then there is a query we are trying to do a matching

03:25:59.190 --> 03:26:03.190
between my query and the data that okay so this is my lm

03:26:03.190 --> 03:26:05.910
natural language query and there is a data which is

03:26:05.910 --> 03:26:08.790
available in my vector databases now if i have to perform a

03:26:08.790 --> 03:26:11.990
rag operation so before that i have to extract a relevant

03:26:11.990 --> 03:26:15.830
document which is already available to my vector dv so

03:26:15.830 --> 03:26:17.790
basically based on the cosine similarity or equilateral

03:26:17.790 --> 03:26:21.530
distances or maybe ip or so it will try to extract these

03:26:21.530 --> 03:26:23.790
things extract the data first and then it will send to the

03:26:23.790 --> 03:26:27.470
lms lm will just try to rephrase it so both situation is

03:26:27.470 --> 03:26:30.270
different both the use cases are completely different all

03:26:30.270 --> 03:26:34.410
together okay sir so i i think the the drag is very helpful

03:26:34.410 --> 03:26:39.830
uh while implementing the known issues yes yeah so yeah yeah

03:26:39.830 --> 03:26:43.630
yeah so currently we are using the fuzzy match i think uh

03:26:43.630 --> 03:26:47.470
the rag will help huh wherever you are using fuzzy matches

03:26:47.470 --> 03:26:52.390
so obviously rag is like uh on another into okay on another

03:26:52.390 --> 03:26:55.650
label not just a improvement it will be able to give you a

03:26:55.650 --> 03:26:59.810
beautiful result as compared to fuzzy match okay sir i i

03:26:59.810 --> 03:27:03.070
will try that yeah just a today by looking at your tool

03:27:03.070 --> 03:27:07.070
session i got many ideas hopefully yeah we'll try to

03:27:07.070 --> 03:27:10.050
implement some wait for it wait for my next class many

03:27:10.050 --> 03:27:12.910
people will get an idea for the product they will say okay

03:27:12.910 --> 03:27:16.470
let's let's launch some some product and let's start selling

03:27:16.470 --> 03:27:20.210
it let's start generating some revenue out of it thank you

03:27:20.210 --> 03:27:23.050
sir thank you for the questions it is very good and i can

03:27:23.050 --> 03:27:27.290
easily understand yeah and i hope you're enjoying it i hope

03:27:27.290 --> 03:27:33.230
you all will do it do and learn it really really yeah the

03:27:33.230 --> 03:27:38.050
real one yes obviously yeah thank you thank you yeah okay so

03:27:38.050 --> 03:27:42.150
in between uh uh aruni your installation is going on so fine

03:27:42.150 --> 03:27:49.110
uh please go ahead with your question vipin uh arman please

03:27:49.110 --> 03:27:51.330
go ahead with the question if you have any arslan please go

03:27:51.330 --> 03:27:55.310
ahead with the question if you have any sound like yourself

03:27:57.510 --> 03:28:03.930
my question my question is um one is that we were talking

03:28:03.930 --> 03:28:09.470
about the sequel so the thing is that we have as we promote

03:28:09.470 --> 03:28:14.910
it in chat gpt that we have the advantage there is that he

03:28:14.910 --> 03:28:19.090
has access and he himself understands that we don't have to

03:28:19.090 --> 03:28:22.690
give things basically what you have done is yes look what

03:28:22.690 --> 03:28:25.690
you have done is you have given him access to the schema

03:28:25.690 --> 03:28:28.550
schema means all the columns of the table so the column has

03:28:28.550 --> 03:28:32.470
been given access to the data type and that's all we need to

03:28:32.470 --> 03:28:37.710
see right yes that's it so that access is near lalim so what

03:28:37.710 --> 03:28:39.910
is lalim doing that your prompt is converting your prompt

03:28:39.910 --> 03:28:43.170
into a query and it is hitting the query with the database

03:28:44.070 --> 03:28:47.730
but sir why does it generate only one query when we give

03:28:47.730 --> 03:28:51.330
prompt to chat gpt then it gives us a lot of queries this

03:28:51.330 --> 03:28:54.790
stuff writes only one no no no so we gave a condition here

03:28:54.790 --> 03:28:58.570
we told him that from this table i have to get the data

03:28:58.570 --> 03:29:04.290
where the value should be more than this ok so the schema

03:29:04.290 --> 03:29:06.570
that he has access to according to that he will give access

03:29:06.570 --> 03:29:12.050
to only one query means the correct query basically so my

03:29:12.050 --> 03:29:17.770
today's is that our our framework their syntax will not be

03:29:17.770 --> 03:29:22.450
read from the basic like lang chain no we will read from the

03:29:22.450 --> 03:29:27.210
basic all of them will read from the basic ok we will read

03:29:27.210 --> 03:29:34.010
that now yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes

03:29:37.310 --> 03:29:43.090
yes yes yes yes yes yes

03:29:56.470 --> 03:30:03.990
rotator we just have to enable that feature

03:30:18.830 --> 03:30:23.730
Arun, I think I'm not able to access your screen. I'm not

03:30:23.730 --> 03:30:24.590
able to do this next.

03:30:27.690 --> 03:30:35.470
Just next, next again. Yeah, please go ahead. Can I share my

03:30:35.470 --> 03:30:39.250
screen? Yeah, sure. You can share the screen. Ramesh, in

03:30:39.250 --> 03:30:41.910
between, please go ahead with the question. Yeah, just one

03:30:41.910 --> 03:30:45.150
question, sir. Actually, there is one limitation when I try

03:30:45.150 --> 03:30:49.910
to upload the document in a Stimulate Web UI, right? It is

03:30:49.910 --> 03:30:54.550
only allowing 150 MP. So how can we expand the size? Is

03:30:54.550 --> 03:30:57.430
there any limitation over there? Yeah, so in a Stimulate

03:30:57.430 --> 03:31:00.230
configuration that I have done, right? So over there, you

03:31:00.230 --> 03:31:02.530
can try to increase or decrease. Over there, we can try to

03:31:02.530 --> 03:31:06.490
pass the parameter. So where, sir? Where do we need to pass

03:31:06.490 --> 03:31:10.850
it? Let me show you that. Let me streamline.

03:31:13.150 --> 03:31:15.890
So why did they restrict the size, sir? Is there any

03:31:15.890 --> 03:31:17.910
possibility? By default, it's a parameter which has been

03:31:17.910 --> 03:31:19.570
given. Input limit.

03:31:26.640 --> 03:31:30.420
So we're not able to see your screen, yeah. Oh, okay. Just a

03:31:30.420 --> 03:31:35.580
minute. I think someone is sharing his screen. Arun is

03:31:35.580 --> 03:31:38.880
sharing his screen. Yeah, Arun. Just a minute. So, Arun,

03:31:38.880 --> 03:31:41.580
just do one thing. Close this one. I think Anaconda

03:31:41.580 --> 03:31:44.780
installed. Right. Yeah. And close your VS Code. Open up VS

03:31:44.780 --> 03:31:49.900
Code once again. Close this. Close your VS Code. Yeah. Now

03:31:49.900 --> 03:31:51.520
open up your VS Code once again. Launch it.

03:32:08.700 --> 03:32:11.160
The command prompt, you know, is PS.

03:32:17.820 --> 03:32:22.880
Sir, do you have the access to my system now? Just a minute.

03:32:25.910 --> 03:32:29.810
This is pointing to PowerShell, sir. Actually, do we need to

03:32:29.810 --> 03:32:32.530
change it to command prompt? Even in PowerShell, it will

03:32:32.530 --> 03:32:35.670
work. PowerShell also should. Yeah, it should generally

03:32:35.670 --> 03:32:44.390
works. So, conda create-n test python.

03:32:46.070 --> 03:32:49.810
Conda is not recognized as an external or internal command.

03:32:50.030 --> 03:32:54.650
Okay, fine. Let's do the fixes then. Your

03:33:23.450 --> 03:33:29.910
user and anaconda3 scripts conda bin. Fine. So I have. So

03:33:29.910 --> 03:33:36.650
you have to add it inside your environment. Oh, oh, oh, oh,

03:33:36.650 --> 03:33:37.150
C

03:33:42.820 --> 03:33:49.400
drive and then user, anaconda,

03:33:54.710 --> 03:33:57.510
anaconda3,

03:33:58.030 --> 03:34:03.270
okay. So anaconda3, okay.

03:34:23.310 --> 03:34:25.110
Just click on environment variable. I'm not able to click.

03:34:25.270 --> 03:34:33.510
Okay, sir. Yeah. Now, so you have to add. So just click on

03:34:33.510 --> 03:34:38.190
path. Let me check if I'm able to do it or not. No, I'm not

03:34:38.190 --> 03:34:42.770
able to do it. Yeah, click on path. Click on edit. Yeah. Now

03:34:42.770 --> 03:34:46.730
add the path, the path which I have copied. In the last,

03:34:46.750 --> 03:34:48.950
last line, last line, line that you are able to see, right?

03:34:50.270 --> 03:34:53.110
Edit text. No, no, no, just last line. Click last line. It

03:34:53.110 --> 03:34:57.730
will give you the permission for edit. Edit text. Yeah,

03:34:57.770 --> 03:35:05.870
okay. Control V, right? No, no, no, no, no. Cancel. Click on

03:35:05.870 --> 03:35:16.970
path. Edit. Edit. Click on new. Paste. Now go back again.

03:35:19.010 --> 03:35:21.770
Like, okay, right? No, leave it. Leave it as it is. Leave it

03:35:21.770 --> 03:35:25.810
as it is. Go back to the folder. This one. Go back to the

03:35:25.810 --> 03:35:27.990
folder, anaconda3 folder. The folder which has been opened.

03:35:29.090 --> 03:35:32.350
Yeah. Now go to the script directory. Scripts, S-C-R-I-P-T

03:35:32.350 --> 03:35:34.530
-S. Yes, that one. Copy path.

03:35:37.310 --> 03:35:44.270
Yeah. Go back once again. New. Edit. Go back once again.

03:35:46.870 --> 03:35:51.310
Conda bin. Just go back one step. One step. Conda bin. First

03:35:51.310 --> 03:35:54.850
one. The first, first, first. Yeah. Copy path.

03:35:58.520 --> 03:36:05.860
Now, again, new. Paste it. Okay. Click on okay. Click on

03:36:05.860 --> 03:36:10.000
okay. Okay. Now close your VS code. Now I can access VS

03:36:10.000 --> 03:36:17.080
code. Close VS code. Open it once again. Okay. Now it should

03:36:17.080 --> 03:36:19.860
be able to recognize. Now type conda over here.

03:36:23.700 --> 03:36:26.840
Hmm. Now conda is working fine. Now write conda create

03:36:26.840 --> 03:36:32.180
hyphen in. Conda space create hyphen space hyphen in space.

03:36:33.180 --> 03:36:37.000
Any name. Conda create. Conda create. No, no, no, no, no,

03:36:37.000 --> 03:36:39.100
no, no, no, no. Let me, let me write it down. Leave it.

03:36:39.140 --> 03:36:43.800
Leave it. Conda create C-R-E-A-T. Conda create C-R-E-A-T.

03:36:43.800 --> 03:36:48.680
Conda create hyphen N test environment and then Python. Now

03:36:48.680 --> 03:36:55.440
it will work. It will work every time now. Okay. So, yeah.

03:36:55.520 --> 03:36:58.220
So once you are able to create this test environment,

03:36:58.420 --> 03:37:02.620
activate it, install requirement or TXT. Okay. And run it.

03:37:03.500 --> 03:37:09.180
All will work. Okay. Yeah. Hello. Yeah. So again, Ramesh,

03:37:09.340 --> 03:37:11.940
you have asked me a question, right? That how I will be able

03:37:11.940 --> 03:37:16.640
to like set this. Basically like a maximum path or maximum

03:37:16.640 --> 03:37:19.860
like a file path, right? You have maximum, maximum size.

03:37:20.000 --> 03:37:23.280
Yeah. Okay. So there are multiple ways by the way. So even

03:37:23.280 --> 03:37:26.100
we can try to set to this size. Let me share my screen.

03:37:27.320 --> 03:37:29.860
There is my sharing part. Okay.

03:37:32.980 --> 03:37:40.120
I can share, so I'm just sharing my screen. I think my

03:37:40.120 --> 03:37:45.220
screen is visible, right? Yes. Loading is visible. Okay. So

03:37:45.220 --> 03:37:51.660
here, whenever you are executing this Streamlint, so let's

03:37:51.660 --> 03:37:54.560
suppose if I'm trying to execute, one thing is I can set it

03:37:54.560 --> 03:37:58.020
in the file itself. Let's suppose if I have not done that

03:37:58.020 --> 03:38:01.200
setup. So what I can do, I

03:38:04.400 --> 03:38:08.120
can write Streamlint run app.py, right? And then I can write

03:38:08.120 --> 03:38:13.540
server maximum upload size and I can give my own size. Yeah.

03:38:13.720 --> 03:38:17.940
So this is. 1024 is MB or what about that one? So 1024 is in

03:38:17.940 --> 03:38:21.860
MB. Actually, yeah. MB. Yeah. So you can try to give as

03:38:21.860 --> 03:38:24.500
many, like whatever, like a number that you want. That's

03:38:24.500 --> 03:38:27.380
completely fine. It will be able to take it. Fine. So this

03:38:27.380 --> 03:38:30.140
is basically, this is basically a command. So this is one of

03:38:30.140 --> 03:38:32.740
the way at the time of running the entire code. The other

03:38:32.740 --> 03:38:35.080
ways I can try to fit it inside the code itself. I can try

03:38:35.080 --> 03:38:39.300
to do like, you know, code it inside the file itself. So

03:38:39.300 --> 03:38:44.600
that is the way. So, yeah. If we process, you know, even

03:38:44.600 --> 03:38:48.080
though the process of video file, is it efficient approach?

03:38:48.320 --> 03:38:52.820
Can we upload the video file over the UI part is not

03:38:52.820 --> 03:38:54.960
possible, right? Can we load it into the file and back?

03:38:55.240 --> 03:38:58.140
Yeah, you can, you can upload it from a direct, like a one

03:38:58.140 --> 03:39:02.220
hour video or a two hour video, right? Is it good to advise

03:39:02.220 --> 03:39:06.680
to upload into? Oh, no, if it is a very, very long, then

03:39:06.680 --> 03:39:09.240
there is a possibility that your server will crash or even

03:39:09.240 --> 03:39:11.480
your client will crash and it will be overloaded

03:39:11.480 --> 03:39:14.740
unnecessarily. So it's always advisable to keep it in some

03:39:14.740 --> 03:39:18.860
like a drive or maybe into a S3 bucket. Okay, we can

03:39:18.860 --> 03:39:22.920
maintain in back end and process the. Exactly. Yeah. So, so

03:39:22.920 --> 03:39:25.260
that, you know, load will go on the server directly. It will

03:39:25.260 --> 03:39:30.450
not like a come on your client side. Okay. Okay. Sure. And

03:39:30.450 --> 03:39:32.890
sir, and one more question, right? And the, now a day also,

03:39:32.950 --> 03:39:36.130
when we look at any managed services, right? Any, for

03:39:36.130 --> 03:39:39.810
examples, let us take with the Databricks platform or

03:39:39.810 --> 03:39:43.490
Fabrics platform, everything, if they can be integrated with

03:39:43.490 --> 03:39:49.550
some LLM, right? A co-pilot or a genie or something. So, but

03:39:49.550 --> 03:39:52.750
right now we are studying this kind of the courses to

03:39:52.750 --> 03:39:56.070
customize everything, but they have already built to attach

03:39:56.070 --> 03:40:00.350
the application, right? And how efficient can we focus, can

03:40:00.350 --> 03:40:05.130
we work on a customer at the end of the day, if company is

03:40:05.130 --> 03:40:07.670
building a product, so you will end up building from the

03:40:07.670 --> 03:40:11.370
scratch. Many companies are not using this tools and it's

03:40:11.370 --> 03:40:13.970
not nothing new that tools are available now, even five

03:40:13.970 --> 03:40:16.470
years back. So when we were trying to implement a big data,

03:40:16.590 --> 03:40:19.370
there was something called. As Informatica, which was

03:40:19.370 --> 03:40:22.010
already available, right? But it's still, we were building a

03:40:22.010 --> 03:40:25.050
complete pipeline from the scratch, even for our ML flow or

03:40:25.050 --> 03:40:27.250
even from a machine learning. So there was a tool which was

03:40:27.250 --> 03:40:30.270
already available, but it's still, we were using like our

03:40:30.270 --> 03:40:33.470
own tool because most of the time you will be able to find

03:40:33.470 --> 03:40:37.250
out that you can't directly fit this entire solution in your

03:40:37.250 --> 03:40:41.090
environment for your customization. And especially when you

03:40:41.090 --> 03:40:44.610
are working in a product side. So like having a tool is

03:40:44.610 --> 03:40:47.690
nothing new tool was available even 10 years back. Okay.

03:40:47.690 --> 03:40:49.550
Okay. And you can't even find out for time, uh, like based

03:40:49.550 --> 03:40:52.410
on the problem that we were facing or we were solving tool

03:40:52.410 --> 03:40:55.910
was available all the time. Right. But there is a limitation

03:40:55.910 --> 03:40:59.750
of the tool. It provides you a very least customization and

03:40:59.750 --> 03:41:02.950
it always binds your organization and it will always try to

03:41:02.950 --> 03:41:07.330
keep you dependent on that organization. What if you will

03:41:07.330 --> 03:41:10.550
go, let's suppose I'm a, I'm a, like a big bank, right? And

03:41:10.550 --> 03:41:13.330
what if I'm relied upon, like completely upon our different

03:41:13.330 --> 03:41:15.910
services provided by different vendors? What if that vendor

03:41:15.910 --> 03:41:20.830
will go down? What I will do in that case. Okay. Yeah.

03:41:20.910 --> 03:41:23.350
Right. Yeah. The business, we cannot depend on them.

03:41:23.490 --> 03:41:26.770
Exactly. So tool tool was available even 10 years back. If

03:41:26.770 --> 03:41:29.310
you'll go and check tool was available in all the segment,

03:41:29.410 --> 03:41:31.970
all the technology, all the stack that we were using, but

03:41:31.970 --> 03:41:34.290
still we were building everything from the scratch. And even

03:41:34.290 --> 03:41:38.470
today we are doing the same thing. Yeah. So why I'm asking

03:41:38.470 --> 03:41:42.410
this question when we, uh, uh, propose some idea from my end

03:41:42.410 --> 03:41:45.830
something, but no, I am working for some Microsoft customer

03:41:45.830 --> 03:41:49.010
and they have already built. A lot of, uh, uh, juice

03:41:49.010 --> 03:41:52.150
services, managed services to integrate all the AI over

03:41:52.150 --> 03:41:54.870
there. When I go with this kind of the customer application,

03:41:55.210 --> 03:41:59.770
they will also, uh, uh, no, they will also tell us, uh, we,

03:41:59.890 --> 03:42:02.730
we have this kind of functionality available, which is

03:42:02.730 --> 03:42:05.510
available already. They are telling like this. So I think,

03:42:05.550 --> 03:42:10.550
how can I, uh, know, uh, how can I tell the, uh, no, uh,

03:42:10.550 --> 03:42:14.630
productive use case. So see, just tell them, just tell them

03:42:14.630 --> 03:42:17.910
a long-term and sort them. Go on. Right. So what if. If, uh,

03:42:18.150 --> 03:42:20.930
X, Y, G company will discontinue with the services because

03:42:20.930 --> 03:42:24.810
every company title on the services and if services is not

03:42:24.810 --> 03:42:29.430
adopted by many, so it simply means that, that, uh, they are

03:42:29.430 --> 03:42:32.210
not able to generate the revenue. So obviously they will try

03:42:32.210 --> 03:42:34.830
to duplicate those services, right? There is a possibility.

03:42:35.210 --> 03:42:38.730
Uh, let's suppose if it is a security heavy application that

03:42:38.730 --> 03:42:41.010
you are building. So again, you have to rely on their

03:42:41.010 --> 03:42:44.170
security. You can't build your own layer, right? Let's

03:42:44.170 --> 03:42:47.530
suppose your customer is pretty much demanding. Means they

03:42:47.530 --> 03:42:49.410
will keep on demanding a new feature, new feature, new

03:42:49.410 --> 03:42:52.610
feature. So again, you don't, uh, again, so generally what

03:42:52.610 --> 03:42:55.790
happens? So let's suppose if I rely on a third party or any

03:42:55.790 --> 03:42:58.810
X, Y, G services. So obviously they will not customize it

03:42:58.810 --> 03:43:00.830
according to me, right? Because they are building it as a

03:43:00.830 --> 03:43:03.830
product, but my customer is very much demanding. Right.

03:43:05.150 --> 03:43:08.830
These are the points. Uh, basically you have to like, uh,

03:43:08.970 --> 03:43:11.710
put up in front of your client or customer or maybe your

03:43:11.710 --> 03:43:14.830
management. So whenever you have convincing it, not from a

03:43:14.830 --> 03:43:16.610
tech side, it's just like a, you know, a. You know,

03:43:16.630 --> 03:43:20.190
diplomatic points you have to put up so that it can

03:43:20.190 --> 03:43:23.530
convince. And yeah, this is the real issue that we face. So

03:43:23.530 --> 03:43:26.030
it's not nothing new. So we all are aware about that, that

03:43:26.030 --> 03:43:28.770
someday we are going to face the issues. That's the reason.

03:43:28.850 --> 03:43:31.490
So many people see even chat, GPT is available. Poverty is

03:43:31.490 --> 03:43:34.350
available. Everything is available. How many companies are

03:43:34.350 --> 03:43:37.770
using it directly? Majority of companies trying to retrain

03:43:37.770 --> 03:43:40.530
or find you now their own model. They're trying to host it

03:43:40.530 --> 03:43:42.990
in their own environment because they say that because

03:43:42.990 --> 03:43:46.070
sometimes we are getting a new that know whatever chat that

03:43:46.070 --> 03:43:49.110
you are doing. The chat GPT, it's basically exposed if you

03:43:49.110 --> 03:43:51.730
are using a deep sea. So all your data set data is going

03:43:51.730 --> 03:43:54.890
into a China server, right? So we keep on getting this kind

03:43:54.890 --> 03:43:57.170
of fun news, even with respect to chat GPT, we keep on

03:43:57.170 --> 03:43:59.790
getting recently. We got the news, right? That, uh, no, your

03:43:59.790 --> 03:44:02.090
data is compromised. So your data is actually available.

03:44:03.010 --> 03:44:05.330
Yeah. Even though you have switched off your data sharing

03:44:05.330 --> 03:44:08.770
inside a chat GPT console, but it's still, it is, it is able

03:44:08.770 --> 03:44:12.230
to like a, keep your data. So, uh, and every company is

03:44:12.230 --> 03:44:15.310
aware about it. So any big organization will not rely upon

03:44:15.310 --> 03:44:18.290
these like a service. It says directly, they will always try

03:44:18.290 --> 03:44:21.470
to build, even when they do a tire with chat GPT, right?

03:44:21.590 --> 03:44:25.510
They ask them to build it in their environment. See chat GPT

03:44:25.510 --> 03:44:28.130
is the one who is going to deliver, but they're not going to

03:44:28.130 --> 03:44:31.170
offer the same services that they are offering to us. They

03:44:31.170 --> 03:44:34.070
will try to build a custom application for them. And then

03:44:34.070 --> 03:44:36.450
they will, because bigger nation will never be able to rely

03:44:36.450 --> 03:44:40.670
on these services. Never means literally never. Okay. Okay.

03:44:40.690 --> 03:44:43.990
Got it. And I, by seeing this, right? Uh, so nobody, this

03:44:43.990 --> 03:44:47.330
technology started going. Uh, I think it's very much

03:44:47.330 --> 03:44:52.030
trending, uh, but even though also, uh, in our writing, uh,

03:44:52.250 --> 03:44:54.770
actually previously we were working on the mystery learning

03:44:54.770 --> 03:44:58.590
is completely human based analytics. And, uh, do we have

03:44:58.590 --> 03:45:01.670
the, do we give the scope or that in future, uh, if you are

03:45:01.670 --> 03:45:04.930
going to learn on the machine learning or, uh, you should, I

03:45:04.930 --> 03:45:07.590
think everyone, everyone should learn machine learning, deep

03:45:07.590 --> 03:45:09.870
learning, computer vision, NLP. If you would like to keep

03:45:09.870 --> 03:45:12.850
yourself relevant for a very, very long time, if you're just

03:45:12.850 --> 03:45:15.670
learning a piece and then like, uh, you know, just upcoming

03:45:15.670 --> 03:45:17.990
technology, believe me, you will not be able to survive for

03:45:17.990 --> 03:45:24.010
a long time. Core is important always, always. Got it.

03:45:24.010 --> 03:45:26.710
Actually LLM, uh, condense the, all the things, right? It is

03:45:26.710 --> 03:45:30.250
a ready-made models. Uh, we can mostly leverage, uh, most of

03:45:30.250 --> 03:45:33.150
the functionalities, but how much, uh, if you are going to

03:45:33.150 --> 03:45:36.050
learn the machine learning going forward, how much will be,

03:45:36.110 --> 03:45:39.390
uh, we are, uh, how much, uh, will be productive. So

03:45:39.390 --> 03:45:42.390
actually can we get the, uh, some record month, which is

03:45:42.390 --> 03:45:45.670
later on machine learning. See, whenever someone is. Asking

03:45:45.670 --> 03:45:49.810
you to do a multiplication of 13 into four, right? Every

03:45:49.810 --> 03:45:53.170
time we don't like, uh, call 30 into four, but whenever we

03:45:53.170 --> 03:45:55.870
try to like, uh, call 30 into four, or we try to solve some

03:45:55.870 --> 03:45:57.930
equations, obviously we are trying to use those basic

03:45:57.930 --> 03:46:01.250
mathematics. Right. And basic understanding that we had. So

03:46:01.250 --> 03:46:03.030
it's not like every time you will end up using things

03:46:03.030 --> 03:46:06.290
directly. Right. Most of the times, these things are going

03:46:06.290 --> 03:46:10.610
to help you out to understand the bigger picture. Okay.

03:46:10.690 --> 03:46:13.830
Okay. But anyhow, that there are some record month, uh, if

03:46:13.830 --> 03:46:16.270
you go to study machine learning as well. Right. A lot of, a

03:46:16.270 --> 03:46:18.430
lot of requirement, a lot of, not some, some requirement, a

03:46:18.430 --> 03:46:20.590
lot of requirement is even like, uh, there because companies

03:46:20.590 --> 03:46:25.570
are building product, right? So in case of product building,

03:46:25.730 --> 03:46:29.050
you have to like, uh, dig deeper and you have to understand

03:46:29.050 --> 03:46:31.010
the basic, then only you will be able to build the product.

03:46:31.350 --> 03:46:34.650
Otherwise you will end up building the wrappers. Correct.

03:46:34.790 --> 03:46:40.250
Correct. So even though this kind of a genetic, uh, uh, is,

03:46:40.390 --> 03:46:43.170
uh, no, it's not, it is not going to combine or dominate the

03:46:43.170 --> 03:46:45.470
machine learning, but there are some, there are. There are

03:46:45.470 --> 03:46:48.630
more requirements for the, not at all. Not at all. The base

03:46:48.630 --> 03:46:52.630
will be always like a relevant, not at all. Relevant. Got

03:46:52.630 --> 03:46:55.730
it. Got it. Okay. Yeah. Okay, sir. Thank you. Thank you so

03:46:55.730 --> 03:47:01.830
much. Okay. So next, uh, so yes, can share the screen and in

03:47:01.830 --> 03:47:05.050
between that is, please go to the question. Yeah. Hi. Hi.

03:47:05.350 --> 03:47:09.390
No, this lecture was very good. I understand that the

03:47:09.390 --> 03:47:13.530
concept subtract. Thank you for that. Thank you. Yeah. Uh,

03:47:13.530 --> 03:47:17.150
and, uh, my question is. Uh, uh, can you, can I get this

03:47:17.150 --> 03:47:21.350
code so that I can, uh, I have a doubt in the code or I can

03:47:21.350 --> 03:47:23.890
share my screen. Yeah, you can share the screen. I can

03:47:23.890 --> 03:47:27.190
resolve it now. So yeah, please share the screen. So first

03:47:27.190 --> 03:47:29.850
of all, the suggests, uh, share the screen please. And then

03:47:29.850 --> 03:47:33.850
the race, uh, in between, uh, teach you a personal giant to,

03:47:33.890 --> 03:47:35.510
uh, by the name, teach you, please go to the question.

03:47:38.640 --> 03:47:46.200
Vishnu. Yeah. Yes. So you can share the screen in between.

03:47:46.360 --> 03:47:50.620
Uh, let me share my screen. Uh, I was missing you from issue

03:47:50.620 --> 03:47:55.020
with, uh, code and, uh, finally I fixed it. Okay. Uh, system

03:47:55.020 --> 03:47:59.300
is, uh, uh, working fast. Okay. Now this, uh, how do I get

03:47:59.300 --> 03:48:02.380
prompted the name? Just like, uh, uploaded the document and

03:48:02.380 --> 03:48:08.240
a system to ask about John to medicalists, giving some

03:48:08.240 --> 03:48:12.600
permission about John. So is it fine? Right. Is it up and

03:48:12.600 --> 03:48:17.140
running? Yes. Yes. Yeah. And also I have one doubt. Uh, I. I

03:48:17.140 --> 03:48:20.480
have created a virtual environment inside the, uh, the

03:48:20.480 --> 03:48:24.900
folder. Uh, I'm in my date, right? Is it a good practice or

03:48:24.900 --> 03:48:28.700
do I need to create an, uh, See, Right. No, no, no, it's

03:48:28.700 --> 03:48:31.800
fine in local system. You, anywhere you can create it. So it

03:48:31.800 --> 03:48:36.040
doesn't matter at all. This is my project folder. Uh,

03:48:39.640 --> 03:48:42.300
That's okay. And that's okay. You can create any drive, any

03:48:42.300 --> 03:48:46.600
folders in a local doesn't matter at all. Can I create a

03:48:46.600 --> 03:48:48.480
virtual environment? You know, inside the project folder, is

03:48:48.480 --> 03:48:51.780
it that, is that, is it good practice environment inside the

03:48:51.780 --> 03:48:53.780
project folder? If you have to create, then you have to go

03:48:53.780 --> 03:48:56.860
with the Python command, not a conda conda, always try to

03:48:56.860 --> 03:48:59.580
create inside the Anaconda folder, which is a part of your

03:48:59.580 --> 03:49:02.680
installation inside the C drive. Uh, if you have to like,

03:49:02.700 --> 03:49:05.340
uh, create a virtual environment inside a project folder,

03:49:05.540 --> 03:49:09.420
then it's a Python command. So V and V is the command Python

03:49:09.420 --> 03:49:11.780
V and V, and then environment name that creates a folder

03:49:11.780 --> 03:49:14.660
inside your local directory project directory. Technically.

03:49:15.480 --> 03:49:20.700
Okay. I created. Created by using conda only. Okay. Is that

03:49:20.700 --> 03:49:25.620
okay? Right? Yeah, that's okay. That's okay. Yes. Okay.

03:49:25.740 --> 03:49:29.600
Okay. Now it's working. Okay. Amazing. Amazing. Yeah. Thank

03:49:29.600 --> 03:49:35.780
you. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. Uh, sorry, you are now

03:49:35.780 --> 03:49:38.660
shifted to attendees. Yeah. Uh, no, there is, I can see it.

03:49:38.660 --> 03:49:43.780
Yeah. Uh, so, uh, so then should, this is the prompt is, uh,

03:49:43.860 --> 03:49:48.060
prompt, uh, uh, user has given. Hmm. Hmm. And we are

03:49:48.060 --> 03:49:51.320
upending to the session and we are displaying the prompt and

03:49:51.320 --> 03:49:55.220
directly. We are going to, uh, retrieve a relevant docs.

03:49:55.620 --> 03:49:58.520
Exactly. From vector DV. Where are we converting into vector

03:49:58.520 --> 03:50:02.240
this prompt? We are not converting into a vector. So, okay.

03:50:02.320 --> 03:50:05.640
Where we are converting into a vector. See, just go to the

03:50:05.640 --> 03:50:09.020
retrieved, relevant document function. Go there. Click,

03:50:09.100 --> 03:50:12.260
click on that. Yeah. Go there. Yeah. So now here we are

03:50:12.260 --> 03:50:15.480
trying to use a language chain library. This is the rapper,

03:50:15.560 --> 03:50:19.200
which I was talking about. So if you are not using a

03:50:19.200 --> 03:50:21.740
language chain, then you will go with a conventional way.

03:50:21.800 --> 03:50:24.240
Conventional way means, so we have already written a code

03:50:24.240 --> 03:50:27.420
for Facebook as humanity search. So where we were trying to

03:50:27.420 --> 03:50:30.940
extract the embedding, and then we were trying to map that

03:50:30.940 --> 03:50:33.700
embedding with that text. This is what we have done. Right.

03:50:33.960 --> 03:50:37.860
Correct. Yeah. To like, like reverse conversion. So whatever

03:50:37.860 --> 03:50:40.220
embedding it is able to fetch. So let's try to convert that

03:50:40.220 --> 03:50:43.140
embedding into a text. And this is what we have seen. I'm

03:50:43.140 --> 03:50:46.180
technically, or in an ideal way that should go to them.

03:50:46.280 --> 03:50:52.140
Okay. Like a GPT is yes. Yeah. Now to avoid that middle

03:50:52.140 --> 03:50:55.280
thing. So basically this has been taken care of by your

03:50:55.280 --> 03:50:57.140
language. And this is the rapper, which has been written by

03:50:57.140 --> 03:51:00.080
a language. And so we'll, it will try to extract the

03:51:00.080 --> 03:51:05.100
embeddings. It will try to convert those embeddings into the

03:51:05.100 --> 03:51:09.700
sentence, and then it will try to, uh, like, uh, give you

03:51:09.700 --> 03:51:12.400
the responses. So this retrieved relevant document is

03:51:12.400 --> 03:51:15.880
actually retrieving. The is handled by the library. That is

03:51:15.880 --> 03:51:18.840
what you are trying to say. Exactly. Yeah. It's, it's a

03:51:18.840 --> 03:51:21.600
rapper. It's a rapper. So instead of writing five, 10 line

03:51:21.600 --> 03:51:24.120
of a code, just in one line, I'm able to do the same task.

03:51:24.620 --> 03:51:28.920
Okay. So my second question is, uh, let's say I'm targeting

03:51:28.920 --> 03:51:34.600
finance industry, you know, right. Where, uh, data more

03:51:34.600 --> 03:51:39.040
often numbers, uh, instead of this kind of thing, I build a,

03:51:39.040 --> 03:51:41.820
if I build a rapper to give them, let's say they want to,

03:51:41.820 --> 03:51:47.320
uh, take a last year's financial status before. In that

03:51:47.320 --> 03:51:50.620
case, it will fail because in the end, we are, uh, we are

03:51:50.620 --> 03:51:54.160
retrieving only chunks. So the data may be, it might be in

03:51:54.160 --> 03:51:57.020
bigger table format because you know, the accounts, right.

03:51:59.020 --> 03:52:02.600
How, how do we implement those kinds of situations? See, in

03:52:02.600 --> 03:52:05.220
that case, try to increase, first of all, a chunk size,

03:52:05.440 --> 03:52:08.160
second, try to increase the overlap. So as of now, my chunk

03:52:08.160 --> 03:52:12.140
size is what? Thousand. Right. My overlap is 200. Basically.

03:52:12.340 --> 03:52:15.820
Right. To bind a different, different. Chunks. So maybe I

03:52:15.820 --> 03:52:17.880
can try to go ahead with a bigger chunks. I will try to go

03:52:17.880 --> 03:52:20.100
ahead with the similar kind of overlap. That's completely

03:52:20.100 --> 03:52:24.080
okay. And plus here, the K value that we are giving a top K

03:52:24.080 --> 03:52:27.740
result, right? The top K result that we are giving over

03:52:27.740 --> 03:52:30.680
here. So we can try to maintain top K is equal to 10. I

03:52:30.680 --> 03:52:33.600
don't think that beyond 10, uh, any data will exist. It will

03:52:33.600 --> 03:52:36.960
be able to fetch almost all the data with respect to your

03:52:36.960 --> 03:52:40.200
query, because at the end of the day, my major worry is to

03:52:40.200 --> 03:52:43.720
extract all the record from my original data, all the

03:52:43.720 --> 03:52:45.240
relevant record with respect to my data. My query, right?

03:52:45.260 --> 03:52:48.360
That is the only worry that I have. Correct. Yeah. So I can

03:52:48.360 --> 03:52:51.260
try to handle it with the help of big chunk size, similar

03:52:51.260 --> 03:52:53.900
kind of overlap to 1,800, even a hundred overlap will work.

03:52:54.000 --> 03:52:56.560
And then here, the top K result that we are trying to

03:52:56.560 --> 03:52:59.780
extract. So maintain it as a 10, if 10 is not working, 10 is

03:52:59.780 --> 03:53:02.220
giving you maybe 90% accuracy. So in that case, go ahead

03:53:02.220 --> 03:53:06.840
with 15, 17. So in that case, I have to compromise my LLM

03:53:06.840 --> 03:53:11.740
cost, right? Because you have to compromise LLM, LLM API

03:53:11.740 --> 03:53:17.500
cost. Yeah, obviously there is always like a upside and

03:53:17.500 --> 03:53:20.240
downside of everything, right? So obviously if data size is

03:53:20.240 --> 03:53:24.920
big, so obviously you will end up consuming more tokens, you

03:53:24.920 --> 03:53:26.900
will end up consuming more tokens. That's the only fact,

03:53:27.020 --> 03:53:29.780
right? So again, if you have to reduce that part, don't use

03:53:29.780 --> 03:53:33.200
any like an API based LLM, host your own LLM in your own

03:53:33.200 --> 03:53:37.760
server, I've already, already shown that part as well. So in

03:53:37.760 --> 03:53:40.680
my YouTube video, if you'll go and check, so, uh, I have

03:53:40.680 --> 03:53:42.140
followed that, uh, how to install LLM in your own server.

03:53:42.140 --> 03:53:45.900
All that, uh, GPT models. Okay. So I already shown that and

03:53:45.900 --> 03:53:49.320
even documentation has been attached. Yes. Yes. Uh, yeah.

03:53:49.460 --> 03:53:52.780
And, uh, my next question is, uh, let's say, uh, till now we

03:53:52.780 --> 03:53:56.400
are one side of a vector search, right? So if you go a real,

03:53:56.460 --> 03:54:00.160
real scenarios, let's say working in e-commerce based

03:54:00.160 --> 03:54:05.720
companies, let's say I'm building a customer chart board.

03:54:06.020 --> 03:54:10.240
Technically the customer can ask a questions related about a

03:54:10.240 --> 03:54:13.080
product, a question related. About, you know, uh, uh,

03:54:13.080 --> 03:54:17.240
product cancellation positions, so he can ask about his

03:54:17.240 --> 03:54:22.500
order history. My data is, uh, you know, uh, uh, might be

03:54:22.500 --> 03:54:24.920
available in different sets. It might be available in the

03:54:24.920 --> 03:54:28.020
SQL database. It might be available in a document for true.

03:54:28.240 --> 03:54:31.860
Yes. So in that case, like how do I identify, because now,

03:54:31.960 --> 03:54:35.600
uh, if I follow this lecture, you showed it to separate

03:54:35.600 --> 03:54:39.100
things. One is for SQL separately for SQL. One, one is

03:54:39.100 --> 03:54:43.100
unstructured data. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. We cannot expect

03:54:43.100 --> 03:54:46.320
user, you know, uh, he can ask any question, but in that

03:54:46.320 --> 03:54:48.880
case, how, how do we handle it? Okay. So let's suppose I

03:54:48.880 --> 03:54:51.560
have a data into SQL DB, the example, which I have shown it

03:54:51.560 --> 03:54:53.700
to you, right? Yes. And let's suppose I have a knowledge

03:54:53.700 --> 03:54:56.040
base knowledge basement. So all your policies, cancellation

03:54:56.040 --> 03:54:58.480
policies, order policies, and all those things. And let's

03:54:58.480 --> 03:55:01.360
suppose in a SQL. So I have basically user detail, order ID,

03:55:01.460 --> 03:55:03.440
and everything is available because obviously that will be

03:55:03.440 --> 03:55:06.160
available into some structured database, right? Into a SQL

03:55:06.160 --> 03:55:09.280
database. So what user has ordered, and then your policies

03:55:09.280 --> 03:55:11.620
will be available into some document basically. Right.

03:55:11.800 --> 03:55:14.780
Document based database, or maybe like just, we have

03:55:14.780 --> 03:55:17.560
uploaded the PDF in that manner. So here, when we are trying

03:55:17.560 --> 03:55:19.640
to configure the prompt, if you remember, we have configured

03:55:19.640 --> 03:55:23.700
the system prompt, right? Yes. Yes. Yeah. So basically we

03:55:23.700 --> 03:55:26.880
can try to configure a system prompt inside a system prompt.

03:55:27.000 --> 03:55:30.480
We can clearly state that, that if user is asking about a

03:55:30.480 --> 03:55:34.680
cancellation or any kind of a transactional activities, I

03:55:34.680 --> 03:55:38.440
can write a prompt in that way that if user is trying to ask

03:55:38.440 --> 03:55:42.560
for any kind of a transactional activities, first of all, go

03:55:42.560 --> 03:55:47.740
and check policies in my document, right? And if it is

03:55:47.740 --> 03:55:50.600
aligned with the policies, then try to perform the

03:55:50.600 --> 03:55:53.580
transaction. For example, let's suppose user is asking about

03:55:53.580 --> 03:55:57.460
the user order status, right? Order status. So, okay. It's a

03:55:57.460 --> 03:56:00.180
policy company policy that, okay, fine. So I can share order

03:56:00.180 --> 03:56:03.180
status with you. Yeah. So it will look into the policy

03:56:03.180 --> 03:56:05.680
document first of all, as per my prompt, and then it will

03:56:05.680 --> 03:56:09.020
try to generate a SQL query and based on the user ID, or

03:56:09.020 --> 03:56:11.340
maybe it will ask customer ID or something. Right. From the

03:56:11.340 --> 03:56:13.640
customer itself, and then it will try to look into the order

03:56:13.640 --> 03:56:16.400
table or order status table, and then it will try to fetch

03:56:16.400 --> 03:56:18.460
those records from the SQL and then show it to the user

03:56:18.460 --> 03:56:20.860
that, okay, fine. So this is the order status, not in a

03:56:20.860 --> 03:56:23.520
tabular format, in a layman format, basically, right? The

03:56:23.520 --> 03:56:27.720
way user is going to like it. Uh, then if user is asking for

03:56:27.720 --> 03:56:29.760
the cancellation. So again, it will try to check that when

03:56:29.760 --> 03:56:33.000
user has ordered, uh, this, this one, like what was the

03:56:33.000 --> 03:56:35.360
order status date? How, what is the cancellation policies?

03:56:35.600 --> 03:56:37.980
Let's suppose we have a seven days cancellation policies. We

03:56:37.980 --> 03:56:40.600
have a 24 hour cancellation policies. Whether this is

03:56:40.600 --> 03:56:42.920
matching. Matching with this or not. And then automatically

03:56:42.920 --> 03:56:45.300
it will try to perform the operation that, okay, fine. So

03:56:45.300 --> 03:56:49.180
cancel it, initiate the refund from the DB. So all of this

03:56:49.180 --> 03:56:53.580
multi database instances is possible. Uh, hopefully I'm

03:56:53.580 --> 03:56:56.520
going to show you this example in next class itself. That

03:56:56.520 --> 03:56:59.220
how we are communicating with the multiple databases. The

03:56:59.220 --> 03:57:02.140
only thing which matters over here is the writing a prompt

03:57:02.140 --> 03:57:06.400
and giving an access to a DB along with the, like a, maybe a

03:57:06.400 --> 03:57:09.160
vector DB, maybe a document based DB, and maybe a SQL based.

03:57:09.320 --> 03:57:13.980
DBS. And right. Configuring a prompt. Okay. So, uh, so in

03:57:13.980 --> 03:57:18.000
this case, uh, can I use like, uh, uh, isn't routing? I am

03:57:18.000 --> 03:57:21.740
not, uh, I haven't discussed the agents, right? So I'll not

03:57:21.740 --> 03:57:24.740
talk about this one with respect to the agents with agents.

03:57:24.920 --> 03:57:29.120
It will be more efficient basically because see agent when

03:57:29.120 --> 03:57:31.980
I'll teach you agent, right? So generally people think that

03:57:31.980 --> 03:57:34.580
agent is something new concept. No, actually it's not a new

03:57:34.580 --> 03:57:37.260
concept. Basically we, we write a function. Let's suppose we

03:57:37.260 --> 03:57:39.460
have written a function to look into the document. Where is

03:57:39.460 --> 03:57:40.540
it? We have written a database. We have written a function

03:57:40.540 --> 03:57:43.440
to look into the SQL based databases, right? And we have

03:57:43.440 --> 03:57:45.680
written the function to understand the user queries in a

03:57:45.680 --> 03:57:48.340
layman way. So we have written multiple such kind of a

03:57:48.340 --> 03:57:51.580
different, different functions, right? Now what happens is

03:57:51.580 --> 03:57:54.680
that, that those functions are normal, like function, right?

03:57:54.840 --> 03:57:57.800
But inside that function, we try to attach a doc string.

03:57:58.180 --> 03:58:00.240
Even in a normal function, we are attaching a doc string,

03:58:00.360 --> 03:58:03.260
right? And we try to say that, okay, fine. You are a

03:58:03.260 --> 03:58:06.180
function. You can do this, this, this, this, this. Now when

03:58:06.180 --> 03:58:10.420
we say agent. Okay. You can do any kind of action. So

03:58:10.420 --> 03:58:13.480
automatically out of my 10 functions, it will try to choose

03:58:13.480 --> 03:58:16.360
one of the function automatically, right? Let's suppose user

03:58:16.360 --> 03:58:19.480
call for cancellation. So automatically it will like see

03:58:19.480 --> 03:58:21.560
that, okay, fine. So which function has been like a

03:58:21.560 --> 03:58:23.460
maintained for the cancellation of the order or which

03:58:23.460 --> 03:58:25.320
function has been maintained to give in the order status,

03:58:25.880 --> 03:58:30.040
right? Or maybe order tracking. So this is something called

03:58:30.040 --> 03:58:32.940
as agent. Technically it's just a function with a prompt

03:58:32.940 --> 03:58:35.440
means with the LLM access function with the LLM access is

03:58:35.440 --> 03:58:38.800
technically called as agents. And that is that kind of

03:58:38.800 --> 03:58:41.480
agent. We are going to write a lot because this entire

03:58:41.480 --> 03:58:44.680
generative itself is all about agentic, but even without

03:58:44.680 --> 03:58:48.760
agentic, we can solve this problem that I'll show you next

03:58:48.760 --> 03:58:53.540
week without even taking agents in a picture because by

03:58:53.540 --> 03:58:55.880
taking agent in a picture, anyhow, we have to discuss that

03:58:55.880 --> 03:59:00.680
part. Yes. Yes. Uh, yeah. Yeah. So my next question is, uh,

03:59:00.820 --> 03:59:04.040
so we are uploading the multiple documents in this rack

03:59:04.040 --> 03:59:07.440
system, right? Hmm. Hmm. So let's say my one document is

03:59:07.440 --> 03:59:12.820
having around 10 to 20 pages. Hmm. Hmm. Uh, so, uh, so in

03:59:12.820 --> 03:59:16.760
that way, uh, uh, let's say a patient, uh, uh, this is about

03:59:16.760 --> 03:59:20.660
a patient summary, right? Okay. Okay. 10, 10 pages, PDF

03:59:20.660 --> 03:59:24.920
about the patient and another patient, the 10 P uh, 10 pages

03:59:24.920 --> 03:59:30.280
summary, a patient name will be exist on the top of the PDF

03:59:30.280 --> 03:59:33.760
and everywhere I will mention he is suffering from this.

03:59:33.800 --> 03:59:39.160
Right. And he has to use this medication now when I do the

03:59:39.160 --> 03:59:44.280
chunking. So how does this chunking, uh, make, uh, make sure

03:59:44.280 --> 03:59:47.780
that, uh, this, uh, this record is belongs to this patient

03:59:47.780 --> 03:59:50.720
that this record is. Yeah. Let me tell you that part. Uh,

03:59:50.880 --> 03:59:53.900
maybe I can, I can even show you that part. Uh, so a study

03:59:53.900 --> 03:59:58.120
night itself, uh, uh, I was working on that set of, let me

03:59:58.120 --> 03:59:59.880
share my screen. I'll.

03:59:59.880 --> 04:00:05.220
you practically how this is going to happen uh by showing

04:00:05.220 --> 04:00:06.540
you my database by the way

04:00:20.580 --> 04:00:25.120
so meanwhile i'll stop my uh yeah i'm like i'm going to

04:00:25.120 --> 04:00:26.020
start sharing my screen

04:00:33.320 --> 04:00:38.200
let me answer to your question practically so i think my

04:00:38.200 --> 04:00:42.200
screen is visible yeah yes yes okay so see i had a multiple

04:00:42.200 --> 04:00:44.840
documents my use case was very simple so i had a document

04:00:44.840 --> 04:00:47.100
called as deep learning basic i had a document called as

04:00:47.100 --> 04:00:49.380
machine learning guide i had a document called a sample

04:00:49.380 --> 04:00:51.180
document i think you are able to see my the name of the

04:00:51.180 --> 04:00:54.620
document yes yes yeah plus i have a document with gmt

04:00:54.620 --> 04:00:57.900
something something something right and then likewise so as

04:00:57.900 --> 04:01:00.160
you can see the numbers number is two number is then three

04:01:00.160 --> 04:01:02.500
three three three three the number will be nine nine nine

04:01:02.500 --> 04:01:05.900
nine so i have a multiple document now how it is able to

04:01:05.900 --> 04:01:08.960
understand that all this data set belongs to only one

04:01:08.960 --> 04:01:12.000
document so whenever i do a checking right so basically it

04:01:12.000 --> 04:01:16.620
is trying to let me click over here and now here what is the

04:01:16.620 --> 04:01:22.420
total check that you are able to see uh total tensor here my

04:01:22.420 --> 04:01:25.360
cursor just follow my cursor what is that five five five

04:01:25.360 --> 04:01:28.540
what is the meaning of this meaning of this one is just for

04:01:28.540 --> 04:01:31.460
one document right it has created how many chunks zero one

04:01:31.460 --> 04:01:35.420
two three four right so internally it is able to maintain a

04:01:35.420 --> 04:01:37.960
relation that all this zero one two three four belongs to

04:01:37.960 --> 04:01:40.440
which document only one document which is deep learning

04:01:40.440 --> 04:01:44.400
basic text yeah got it got it right so how it is able to

04:01:44.400 --> 04:01:47.620
maintain the names yeah yes so this is how this is how this

04:01:47.620 --> 04:01:49.400
is how it happens so everywhere you will be able to see the

04:01:49.400 --> 04:01:52.580
same thing now click over here now click on total chunks so

04:01:52.580 --> 04:01:54.980
one by one one by one see all the this is the total chunk

04:01:54.980 --> 04:01:59.580
from this one only one document yeah got it yeah thank you

04:01:59.580 --> 04:02:03.880
thank you so much yeah thanks okay next question please hi

04:02:03.880 --> 04:02:08.080
sudhanshu i'm vishnu yeah please go ahead vishnu for the

04:02:08.080 --> 04:02:12.180
previous question i guess like for relational database there

04:02:12.180 --> 04:02:17.600
is an extension called pg vector that we can store in into

04:02:17.600 --> 04:02:20.300
vectors i guess nowadays everyone is giving you a vector

04:02:20.300 --> 04:02:25.460
storage and vector search so you can just search whether

04:02:25.460 --> 04:02:27.680
it's available or not if it is available just go ahead

04:02:27.680 --> 04:02:30.820
meaning is not going to change right nowadays like i said so

04:02:30.820 --> 04:02:34.840
every database is giving you yeah yeah one more question

04:02:34.840 --> 04:02:37.860
actually i was building an a application for indian

04:02:37.860 --> 04:02:42.820
government rules okay so for every rule there will be a

04:02:42.820 --> 04:02:46.940
different chapters and different sections and sections so

04:02:46.940 --> 04:02:50.200
while i was doing chunking right so i tried fixed level

04:02:50.200 --> 04:02:54.180
chunking recursive chunking semantic chunking so with those

04:02:54.180 --> 04:02:57.520
tankings when an user ask any question like what is section

04:02:57.520 --> 04:03:01.540
six or what is section seven so i was not getting a relevant

04:03:01.540 --> 04:03:06.840
information so i tried agentish thinking so i had given my

04:03:06.840 --> 04:03:11.260
data to an llm so i told llm to split my data into different

04:03:11.260 --> 04:03:17.420
chunks a json file so every object should be a text and with

04:03:17.420 --> 04:03:21.420
the text there should be a metadata metadata will be like

04:03:21.420 --> 04:03:24.740
from which section it came from or which subsection it came

04:03:24.740 --> 04:03:31.240
from or which act it came from I was getting some good

04:03:31.240 --> 04:03:35.780
results with that okay but a problem here is if I use LLM

04:03:35.780 --> 04:03:41.700
means to pass let's say thousands are 2000 PDF so every act

04:03:41.700 --> 04:03:47.100
we around 100 or 200 pages it will be more costly for me hmm

04:03:47.100 --> 04:03:52.460
so other than that can I use any NLP technique to extract

04:03:52.460 --> 04:03:57.300
the information into JSON format with the metadata with

04:03:57.300 --> 04:04:04.880
metadata no I believe the better way to do like I think you

04:04:04.880 --> 04:04:06.900
can go ahead with this kind of a checking the checking that

04:04:06.900 --> 04:04:09.860
we I have done and even I am trying to show you this one

04:04:09.860 --> 04:04:13.640
right so let's suppose I am trying to use some chroma DV

04:04:13.640 --> 04:04:17.040
right so by default it is able to maintain the relation

04:04:17.040 --> 04:04:19.780
between the entire document so let's suppose your section 6

04:04:19.780 --> 04:04:22.860
is available here section 4 is available here section 3 is

04:04:22.860 --> 04:04:26.500
available here but it is going to treat this entire chunk as

04:04:26.500 --> 04:04:29.880
a part of only single document right only the single

04:04:29.880 --> 04:04:34.220
document so I think in this way it will be like and in this

04:04:34.220 --> 04:04:36.720
way it will be like a much more relevant I don't think that

04:04:36.720 --> 04:04:39.480
you will lose a context of any kind of a sections over there

04:04:39.480 --> 04:04:43.120
even without maintaining much of a meta information from

04:04:43.120 --> 04:04:46.240
your side because by default it is able to maintain that

04:04:46.240 --> 04:04:49.980
okay fine so all of this like things belongs to only one

04:04:49.980 --> 04:04:52.440
file system see this is the meta that it is able to maintain

04:04:52.440 --> 04:04:55.400
right so all of these things belongs to only one file system

04:04:55.400 --> 04:04:58.080
right so all these chunks belongs to only one file so I

04:04:58.080 --> 04:05:01.100
think this is more than enough to handle this let's say when

04:05:01.100 --> 04:05:06.140
user ask any question like what is section 6 6 right so how

04:05:06.140 --> 04:05:09.380
it retrieved the data from so basically it will it will try

04:05:09.380 --> 04:05:12.020
to check that where section 6 is available right so let's

04:05:12.020 --> 04:05:14.380
suppose sections 6 is unavailable in let's suppose I have a

04:05:14.380 --> 04:05:18.160
multiple document right so this is a document 5 chucks is

04:05:18.160 --> 04:05:20.540
equal to one document then 4 chuck is equal to one document

04:05:20.540 --> 04:05:23.180
3 chuck is equal to one document and then multiple chuck is

04:05:23.180 --> 04:05:25.960
equal to one document let's suppose I am able to find out a

04:05:25.960 --> 04:05:29.460
section 6 in any of this chuck right any of this chucks I am

04:05:29.460 --> 04:05:33.520
able to find out basically like a one of the document now it

04:05:33.520 --> 04:05:35.900
will be able to understand that okay fine this truck is a

04:05:35.900 --> 04:05:38.920
part of this entire document so let's try to extract let's

04:05:38.920 --> 04:05:42.480
suppose I am doing top 4 top 10 so if Section 6 is a part of

04:05:42.480 --> 04:05:45.640
this one, it already knows from its meta information that

04:05:45.640 --> 04:05:48.960
this chuck is a part of which file. See my file name, file

04:05:48.960 --> 04:05:52.980
name is same, for all of this chuck, 4 chuck or for this 5

04:05:52.980 --> 04:05:55.600
chucks file name is same. So it will be able to understand,

04:05:55.700 --> 04:05:59.680
so it will try to always retrieve those data set which is

04:05:59.680 --> 04:06:03.700
near to this file or which is a part of this file and this

04:06:03.700 --> 04:06:06.200
is something which it is doing over here. See it is trying

04:06:06.200 --> 04:06:08.600
to show you a nearest neighbor, a top 3 by default it is

04:06:08.600 --> 04:06:10.700
trying to show you. So it is coming from technically the

04:06:10.700 --> 04:06:15.910
same file system. It is technically coming from the same

04:06:15.910 --> 04:06:18.510
file system. See even if you are going to click, it is

04:06:18.510 --> 04:06:23.350
hovering in the same files. So section 6 let's suppose

04:06:23.350 --> 04:06:25.630
partially available in one, partially available in something

04:06:25.630 --> 04:06:27.750
different, it will be able to fetch everything by the way.

04:06:28.950 --> 04:06:32.490
So I think this is the best way to do a chucking and very

04:06:32.490 --> 04:06:38.170
cost effective way by the way. Actually I was new to U-Run,

04:06:38.310 --> 04:06:42.130
so this is my second class I guess. So I don't know how you

04:06:42.130 --> 04:06:48.590
did this. So you just used any chunking strategy here or you

04:06:48.590 --> 04:06:51.610
just gone with the recursive chunking. Let me show you the

04:06:51.610 --> 04:06:57.350
code. Yesterday night, so like yeah, this is my

04:06:57.350 --> 04:07:01.250
configuration U-Run docs data preprocessor.

04:07:03.900 --> 04:07:07.040
This is my preprocessor.

04:07:08.940 --> 04:07:15.100
I was working on one of. This one and yeah. So this is my

04:07:15.100 --> 04:07:20.940
checking method and if you are able to see this one, I'm not

04:07:20.940 --> 04:07:25.200
doing anything different over here. Yeah, I'm not doing

04:07:25.200 --> 04:07:28.820
anything different, but when I'm trying to store it inside

04:07:28.820 --> 04:07:31.900
the vector, so at that point of time, first of all, my

04:07:31.900 --> 04:07:34.840
vector DB selection is important whenever I'm trying to

04:07:34.840 --> 04:07:39.100
store this chunks and second of all, so I'm just trying to

04:07:39.100 --> 04:07:44.360
use a data preprocessor. So which is going to handle this

04:07:44.360 --> 04:07:49.940
entire chunks and it is able to create a file, means

04:07:49.940 --> 04:07:53.000
technically a metadata. So technically I'm just playing with

04:07:53.000 --> 04:07:57.120
the meta information, nothing much. Just playing with the

04:07:57.120 --> 04:07:59.040
meta information. So with the help of just a meta

04:07:59.040 --> 04:08:02.780
information, I'm able to create a relevance in between.

04:08:05.040 --> 04:08:06.880
That's the only strategy which I have followed and it's

04:08:06.880 --> 04:08:10.480
working well for me by the way. Okay. Yeah. Can I just share

04:08:10.480 --> 04:08:12.880
the screen? I will just show you the data, how it looks

04:08:12.880 --> 04:08:16.280
like. I think you can get an idea of it. Yeah, sure. So you

04:08:16.280 --> 04:08:19.160
can share your screen in between. So I can take questions

04:08:19.160 --> 04:08:25.860
from Amit, Armaan, Nares, Rupesh. Yeah. Anyone? Hello. Hi

04:08:25.860 --> 04:08:30.100
Sudhoch. Yeah. Hi. Go ahead please. Yeah. Actually I forgot

04:08:30.100 --> 04:08:32.480
to ask one more question. Yeah. Vishnu, you can join as a

04:08:32.480 --> 04:08:36.080
panelist. Yeah. Please, please go ahead. Yeah. Yeah. So we

04:08:36.080 --> 04:08:40.320
are using Streamlit, right? Hmm. Streamlit, does production

04:08:40.320 --> 04:08:45.120
ready applications uses Streamlit? See you can build a

04:08:45.120 --> 04:08:48.640
production ready application, but it's not advisable, go

04:08:48.640 --> 04:08:51.420
ahead with a React. That will be better. React, right.

04:08:51.440 --> 04:08:55.740
Because what was coming into my mind, let's say I parallel,

04:08:55.860 --> 04:08:59.000
I want to build the application, the can write application.

04:08:59.260 --> 04:09:02.360
So in that case, Streamlit won't work because in the end I

04:09:02.360 --> 04:09:05.560
need APIs, right? No, so API is a backend part, right?

04:09:05.840 --> 04:09:09.180
That's why. Streamlit is the frontend part. Now this

04:09:09.180 --> 04:09:12.800
Streamlit, how directly it is calling functions without

04:09:12.800 --> 04:09:17.440
APIs, correct? No. See, Streamlit is just a UI. At the end

04:09:17.440 --> 04:09:20.440
of the day, I can call the APIs inside the Streamlit or

04:09:20.440 --> 04:09:23.420
anywhere. That's completely fine. Correct. The problem is

04:09:23.420 --> 04:09:27.420
Streamlit exists in the Python code. So it is a part of our

04:09:27.420 --> 04:09:30.620
Python backend. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

04:09:30.620 --> 04:09:32.640
no, no, no, I think you are going in the wrong direction.

04:09:32.760 --> 04:09:36.540
See, it's just going to create the UI interface. UI,

04:09:36.600 --> 04:09:39.760
correct. On a click of button, you are trying to call some

04:09:39.760 --> 04:09:42.680
functions, right? Some function that is, which is existing

04:09:42.680 --> 04:09:46.700
in Python. Now that function can be available in any

04:09:46.700 --> 04:09:49.700
language as an API. What is the meaning of API? Right? So by

04:09:49.700 --> 04:09:53.140
the hit of API, so we are trying to call some function. Yes.

04:09:53.420 --> 04:09:56.020
In some other languages, maybe Python, maybe Java, maybe

04:09:56.020 --> 04:10:00.300
something else. Yeah. So basically you are trying to attach

04:10:00.300 --> 04:10:03.020
with that button here, you are trying to attach a function

04:10:03.020 --> 04:10:06.440
directly, which is written in a same file. Right. But that

04:10:06.440 --> 04:10:09.120
doesn't mean that you can't call the APIs on the hit of

04:10:09.120 --> 04:10:11.460
button, call the APIs simple. This is how real-time

04:10:11.460 --> 04:10:15.240
development happens. Right. Got it. Got it. Thanks. Yeah.

04:10:15.960 --> 04:10:19.400
Okay. Yeah. I think you have a screen sharing access. Yeah.

04:10:19.480 --> 04:10:26.460
Yeah. Yeah. So can you see my screen? Not yet. Oh, sorry.

04:10:28.480 --> 04:10:34.880
Yeah. If you can, I can't see your screen. Yeah. I had

04:10:34.880 --> 04:10:39.760
shared my screen. Yeah. Now I can see it. Yes. So this is a

04:10:39.760 --> 04:10:43.440
act called right to information act. Okay. So let's say this

04:10:43.440 --> 04:10:47.720
is section five. Okay. And this is subsection one. So five

04:10:47.720 --> 04:10:53.080
one. So I was trying to split chunks like this. Okay. Okay.

04:10:53.120 --> 04:10:57.020
So this is my text and this is my metadata. Okay. So

04:10:57.020 --> 04:11:04.740
chapter, section, subsection is 5.1. Then act rule name. No.

04:11:04.740 --> 04:11:08.580
No idea. I think, I think you are going in a very, very

04:11:08.580 --> 04:11:12.380
lengthy manner. No. Okay. Because unnecessarily you are

04:11:12.380 --> 04:11:15.240
trying to extract the section subsection and then tomorrow

04:11:15.240 --> 04:11:17.220
someone will come and they will try to put some different

04:11:17.220 --> 04:11:20.100
criteria. There is a very high possibility. Right. Uh, that.

04:11:20.220 --> 04:11:24.880
Okay. Let's say, let's say user will question like, let's

04:11:24.880 --> 04:11:30.100
say, what is section, uh, 5.1, 5.1. Yes. Yeah. So without

04:11:30.100 --> 04:11:32.960
the metadata, we can't extract that information. Right. No,

04:11:33.080 --> 04:11:37.540
we can extract it. We can do it. See when a user is asking 5

04:11:37.540 --> 04:11:41.340
.1. So 5.1 is somewhere available inside your data. Forget

04:11:41.340 --> 04:11:44.760
about meta. Right. See the, see the text, see the text that

04:11:44.760 --> 04:11:47.460
you are trying to maintain. So in that one, it's already

04:11:47.460 --> 04:11:50.060
available. It's a part of your original document. It's

04:11:50.060 --> 04:11:52.040
already available that, okay, fine. There was something

04:11:52.040 --> 04:11:55.360
called as 5.1. So whenever you will try to do a vector

04:11:55.360 --> 04:11:58.040
matching, it will be able to find out the relevancy with

04:11:58.040 --> 04:12:02.540
that. So if we split our chunk, let's say, how can we do

04:12:02.540 --> 04:12:05.340
that? How can we split chunk like this? So this is, let's

04:12:05.340 --> 04:12:08.200
say this should be one chunk, right? Or I can keep

04:12:08.200 --> 04:12:10.940
everything in a one chunk. You can keep everything, you

04:12:10.940 --> 04:12:13.700
know, forget about one chunk. You can't control that part.

04:12:13.980 --> 04:12:16.820
See, you can't because you are giving a chunk size. You have

04:12:16.820 --> 04:12:19.280
a control over the chunk size, right? You never know that,

04:12:19.280 --> 04:12:22.200
that when chunk size will intersect, which line or which

04:12:22.200 --> 04:12:25.260
board basically. Okay. Yeah. So you have a control over the

04:12:25.260 --> 04:12:29.060
chunk size. Just do one thing. Maintain a metadata the way I

04:12:29.060 --> 04:12:31.840
am maintaining with a file name, file path, file type, and

04:12:31.840 --> 04:12:34.660
like a chunk number that, okay, fine. So this chunk is from

04:12:34.660 --> 04:12:36.980
the same file automatically to be able to find the

04:12:36.980 --> 04:12:44.340
relevance. Actually, I had deployed my model, so I had taken

04:12:44.340 --> 04:12:48.500
domain name for this. So I was building this application

04:12:48.500 --> 04:12:53.640
from the scratch. So I tried semantic chunking here. When I

04:12:53.640 --> 04:13:01.800
ask any question, like who is returning officer, I just

04:13:01.800 --> 04:13:06.060
started with the election rules in India. So when I ask a

04:13:06.060 --> 04:13:09.160
question like who is returning officer, so it is getting

04:13:09.160 --> 04:13:14.960
some information. It is from actually, I had not added means

04:13:14.960 --> 04:13:18.720
resource information here. So I want to add, let's say a

04:13:18.720 --> 04:13:23.240
user want to know from which act it came from or which topic

04:13:23.240 --> 04:13:27.420
it from like, so I was trying to add that metadata below

04:13:27.420 --> 04:13:30.980
also. So for that also, I was not getting how to add it.

04:13:31.360 --> 04:13:35.300
Okay. So how to add basically like this source information,

04:13:35.680 --> 04:13:40.180
right? Yeah. Source information. Hmm. Got it. Got it. Okay.

04:13:40.260 --> 04:13:43.140
I think I can share my entire code with you. Let me show you

04:13:43.140 --> 04:13:46.640
that. I'm not, I'm running the application. See, even if

04:13:46.640 --> 04:13:48.960
you're going to give me your file right now itself, I can, I

04:13:48.960 --> 04:13:53.520
can do it now. So basically I have customized in such a way

04:13:53.520 --> 04:13:55.580
that I can pass any files that I want and then it will be

04:13:55.580 --> 04:13:57.520
able to load it. See, it's loading the document and it will

04:13:57.520 --> 04:14:00.900
give you a source as well. So see what I have done. Uh, so

04:14:00.900 --> 04:14:02.860
basically this is a generic system I was trying to create so

04:14:02.860 --> 04:14:05.940
that I can teach inside my class. Uh, right. And, uh, I have

04:14:05.940 --> 04:14:08.780
made it like, I have made sure that a user can pass any kind

04:14:08.780 --> 04:14:12.400
of a data now. So you, I have already given a place over

04:14:12.400 --> 04:14:14.980
here and again, I'm just trying to customize it in such a

04:14:14.980 --> 04:14:18.060
way that, that, uh, instead of keeping a data here, so user

04:14:18.060 --> 04:14:20.260
can keep a data into some like a direct driver directory.

04:14:20.440 --> 04:14:22.520
And then from there it will be able to fit. So if you're

04:14:22.520 --> 04:14:25.780
going to give me your file now, I can even test it now. So

04:14:25.780 --> 04:14:29.960
here, uh, let's suppose if I'm going to ask a question that,

04:14:29.980 --> 04:14:34.000
who are you? Who is Sudhanshu Kumar? Right. Who is Sudhanshu

04:14:34.000 --> 04:14:37.580
Kumar? Tell me about him. Tell me about him. And basically

04:14:37.580 --> 04:14:40.800
this is your class recording, right? This is technically

04:14:40.800 --> 04:14:43.760
your class recording, uh, that I have used. And maybe I have

04:14:43.760 --> 04:14:47.000
given my introduction in the beginning so that, so see, uh,

04:14:47.120 --> 04:14:50.740
it is able to extract based on the, uh, provided transcript

04:14:50.740 --> 04:14:52.560
context. Sudhanshu Kumar appears to be a prominent

04:14:52.560 --> 04:14:55.540
individual. I have not given my introduction. So whatever it

04:14:55.540 --> 04:14:58.340
was able to understand, it is able to extract that. Plus I

04:14:58.340 --> 04:15:02.580
have given, uh, like a one more. Prompt to my system that,

04:15:02.620 --> 04:15:05.000
okay, try to do the elaboration. I'll show you my prompt.

04:15:05.140 --> 04:15:07.820
It's a very, very linear. And I believe you are looking for

04:15:07.820 --> 04:15:11.260
this option source, right? See, yeah. From where it is

04:15:11.260 --> 04:15:14.040
fetching that information. So from these many, uh, like a

04:15:14.040 --> 04:15:17.300
document in a real time, it is fetching. So for every query

04:15:17.300 --> 04:15:19.180
you are going to fire, it is going to show you that. Okay,

04:15:19.180 --> 04:15:21.880
fine. So what is the relevancy from where, like, uh, it is,

04:15:21.880 --> 04:15:25.360
uh, able to fetch this, uh, entire things and, uh, you will

04:15:25.360 --> 04:15:28.240
be able to run it. Plus I already mentioned inside my

04:15:28.240 --> 04:15:31.860
instruction. That try to even like a summarize it all, all

04:15:31.860 --> 04:15:34.440
of these things. Even I have mentioned that try to go for

04:15:34.440 --> 04:15:37.900
the Google search. So just go for the relevant Google

04:15:37.900 --> 04:15:41.720
search. Yeah. You know, it will be able to like, uh, fetch

04:15:41.720 --> 04:15:45.800
all the information from everywhere. Uh, so that like, it

04:15:45.800 --> 04:15:49.760
will become a trustworthy source for me. Yeah. For the

04:15:49.760 --> 04:15:53.960
source information, I thought not to add the text file or

04:15:53.960 --> 04:15:57.600
text file and also the relevant chunks. Also. Let's say I

04:15:57.600 --> 04:16:01.840
had knew the, uh, chunks, right? So, uh, so let's say

04:16:01.840 --> 04:16:05.220
government rules means if, uh, that chunks are passed to

04:16:05.220 --> 04:16:08.100
tell LLM means it will summarize the information. Let's say

04:16:08.100 --> 04:16:11.960
the user wants the exact content of the, let's say section

04:16:11.960 --> 04:16:16.600
six that I want to provide in the source information. That

04:16:16.600 --> 04:16:20.200
is also fine. So here anyhow, I'm retrieving it, right? See,

04:16:20.340 --> 04:16:23.620
it is able to summarize based on what it is able to

04:16:23.620 --> 04:16:26.400
summarize based on the retrieval from retrieval from this

04:16:26.400 --> 04:16:31.080
one. Right? So this retrieval directly to the user, if I'm

04:16:31.080 --> 04:16:33.440
able to showcase this one, it simply means that I'm able to

04:16:33.440 --> 04:16:35.780
retrieve it. And if I'm able to retrieve it, so the raw

04:16:35.780 --> 04:16:38.880
information just create a one more tab and like, so that,

04:16:38.900 --> 04:16:43.620
okay, fine. So this is the raw information. Okay. I got you.

04:16:43.660 --> 04:16:47.200
Uh, I will go through that code once and I will try it once.

04:16:47.420 --> 04:16:52.980
Yeah. Yeah. You can, you can take my code, uh, like, uh, uh,

04:16:52.980 --> 04:16:55.480
and then use it. Uh, it will be easy pieces off for you. I

04:16:55.480 --> 04:16:59.580
believe. So this could, I have not shared with anyone, so

04:16:59.580 --> 04:17:01.620
maybe I can, I can share and see the prompt, which I'm

04:17:01.620 --> 04:17:04.060
maintaining the system prompt, which I'm maintaining and see

04:17:04.060 --> 04:17:09.280
the user prompt, which I'm maintaining here. Oh, okay. So

04:17:09.280 --> 04:17:12.040
all the age cases, technically, uh, why I'm showing you this

04:17:12.040 --> 04:17:14.640
prompt so that you can understand that I'm maintaining all

04:17:14.640 --> 04:17:19.920
the edge cases over here. Okay. Got you. Yeah. Please share

04:17:19.920 --> 04:17:23.300
that code. So I will try with my data once. Okay. Okay.

04:17:23.460 --> 04:17:26.620
Fine. So I was thinking of discussing this project inside

04:17:26.620 --> 04:17:29.040
your class. Then I thought that this will be very lengthy

04:17:29.040 --> 04:17:32.500
and little bit tough project. Maybe many people will face an

04:17:32.500 --> 04:17:35.100
issue. And again, for this kind of project, I can't go and

04:17:35.100 --> 04:17:38.020
write code line by line. So I thought that, okay, fine.

04:17:38.060 --> 04:17:45.580
Let's discuss something, something simpler, but yeah,

04:17:45.680 --> 04:17:47.860
this, I think this will solve your problem, the problem that

04:17:47.860 --> 04:17:49.980
you are facing. Right. It will solve your problem directly.

04:17:50.620 --> 04:17:55.980
So take this particular next class. Take this project in

04:17:55.980 --> 04:17:59.880
next class. See Armaan, I can, I can discuss even project

04:17:59.880 --> 04:18:03.340
heavier than this one. The problem in a class is that so

04:18:03.340 --> 04:18:07.020
when you are teaching right as a mentor, so, uh, there will

04:18:07.020 --> 04:18:09.520
be some people. So who will expect that? No mentor is

04:18:09.520 --> 04:18:12.880
supposed to, even if I upload code on our GitHub, sorry, on

04:18:12.880 --> 04:18:15.860
our YouTube, right. Uh, without explaining a big, big code

04:18:15.860 --> 04:18:18.880
repository, people say that, no, you are just doing copy and

04:18:18.880 --> 04:18:21.560
paste. I mean, like you are not writing code line by line.

04:18:21.560 --> 04:18:24.380
This can be done by chat GPT itself. I can do it without

04:18:24.380 --> 04:18:26.800
chat GPT. Why I should join your class. I mean like this

04:18:26.800 --> 04:18:30.340
kind of a feedback is very much natural for us. Right. We,

04:18:30.420 --> 04:18:34.780
we used to get it practically how 10,000 line of a code

04:18:34.780 --> 04:18:37.000
anyone can come and discuss. I don't even remember. Right.

04:18:37.040 --> 04:18:39.540
It took maybe like a 48 hour of time for me to build it.

04:18:41.100 --> 04:18:45.100
Yeah. But yeah, people in a class, they will be having a

04:18:45.100 --> 04:18:47.460
different expectation. Maybe there will be some set of

04:18:47.460 --> 04:18:49.460
people who understand how development happens, so they will

04:18:49.460 --> 04:18:52.020
not retaliate. But yeah, majority of people, they will say

04:18:52.020 --> 04:18:54.960
that, no, my mentor has like just copy and pasted the code.

04:18:57.400 --> 04:19:01.100
Copy and pasting the code is not easy. So you need to

04:19:01.100 --> 04:19:04.020
understand it. People will not understand, right. You

04:19:04.020 --> 04:19:06.760
should, as a mentor, you can't go and say the same thing

04:19:06.760 --> 04:19:09.160
again and again. That's a problem with a mentor. Just try to

04:19:09.160 --> 04:19:12.460
take one. First while building my project, I did the same

04:19:12.460 --> 04:19:15.520
thing, copy and paste. So I didn't know what I did also.

04:19:16.040 --> 04:19:20.080
Yeah. I started learning what I am doing step by step. Then

04:19:20.080 --> 04:19:23.100
only I got to know everything. Exactly. Exactly. But many of

04:19:23.100 --> 04:19:25.160
you will not understand. So that's, that's a problem as a

04:19:25.160 --> 04:19:28.020
mentor. Once you will take some classes, right. You will

04:19:28.020 --> 04:19:32.160
feel it. Yeah. Because of that. So sometime I avoid, you

04:19:32.160 --> 04:19:35.920
know, discussing a very, very big project, a very, very good

04:19:35.920 --> 04:19:39.420
project, which I already have, which I'm using it. Yep.

04:19:39.660 --> 04:19:44.100
Okay. But yeah, I'll share this. I'll share this code.

04:19:44.340 --> 04:19:47.680
Right. Just like, I have also maintained the readme file, so

04:19:47.680 --> 04:19:50.360
I don't think that you will face any kind of issue. Just to

04:19:50.360 --> 04:19:55.220
replace our API key and your chroma API key, two things and

04:19:55.220 --> 04:19:59.940
it will work. Simple. For storing JSON files, which database

04:19:59.940 --> 04:20:04.860
is good Sudhanshu, I think quadrant is good. No. Anyhow, it

04:20:04.860 --> 04:20:06.800
is going to break down into a vectors, right? So if you have

04:20:06.800 --> 04:20:08.780
to store directly a JSON file, then go with the document

04:20:08.780 --> 04:20:13.680
data, document DV, Mongo or something. Okay. Got you. Thank

04:20:13.680 --> 04:20:19.040
you. Yeah. Sudhanshu Rupesh again here. Can I? Yeah.

04:20:20.520 --> 04:20:24.680
Sudhanshu, currently we are using the URI API and that one.

04:20:24.860 --> 04:20:29.020
Can we refer, can you give some sample code where we can

04:20:29.020 --> 04:20:33.300
refer directly some free model like MISTRA and other things

04:20:33.300 --> 04:20:39.140
we can use in the same fashion? Yeah, I can do that. So see

04:20:39.140 --> 04:20:41.260
MISTRA, open source model you are talking about, right? So

04:20:41.260 --> 04:20:43.280
first of all, you have to host an open source model

04:20:43.280 --> 04:20:47.940
somewhere. In the OLAMA you are saying? Or we can

04:20:47.940 --> 04:20:52.300
inferencing the model from the hugging phase or somewhere

04:20:52.300 --> 04:20:55.780
and then we can use. Yeah. So basically you have to host the

04:20:55.780 --> 04:20:58.300
model. So whenever you say hugging phase, right? So there

04:20:58.300 --> 04:21:01.840
are two ways. One way is to, by using a hugging phase, you

04:21:01.840 --> 04:21:05.200
download the model in your local, right? And then you do the

04:21:05.200 --> 04:21:08.580
inferencing. Or second approach is you use the hugging phase

04:21:08.580 --> 04:21:10.940
serve basically. So where you are going to pay for the

04:21:10.940 --> 04:21:14.020
hugging phase GPU and then black model is already hosted

04:21:14.020 --> 04:21:16.700
there. And then you do inferencing with the help of APIs.

04:21:16.820 --> 04:21:20.900
Okay. The third approach is host a model on your CPU on your

04:21:20.900 --> 04:21:23.100
GPUs and then do the inferencing which I have already shown

04:21:23.100 --> 04:21:28.120
in one of my YouTube video. Can I get the difference for

04:21:28.120 --> 04:21:31.440
that video? Okay. Maybe I can show you that part. Let me

04:21:31.440 --> 04:21:33.740
show you now itself. So I have shown you two approaches,

04:21:33.920 --> 04:21:36.260
even API approach I have shown it to you and even a chat

04:21:36.260 --> 04:21:42.040
approach I have shown it to you. So where is a Euron? Let me

04:21:42.040 --> 04:21:45.420
show. And plus I have attached the documentation. So almost

04:21:45.420 --> 04:21:50.280
all the ways. Like possible ways I have discussed,

04:21:50.880 --> 04:21:57.660
where is a YouTube channel

04:22:01.950 --> 04:22:13.400
with your own GPT API. Yeah. So in this one, so what I'm

04:22:13.400 --> 04:22:17.240
doing, so basically I'm using this hyper stack, one of the

04:22:17.240 --> 04:22:20.820
GPU provider. You can use any other basically. And here I'm

04:22:20.820 --> 04:22:22.980
showing you a step by step. Plus I have even maintained the

04:22:22.980 --> 04:22:25.160
documentation here. If you'll go through the documentation,

04:22:25.440 --> 04:22:28.260
you will be able to find out that how you will be able to

04:22:28.260 --> 04:22:30.720
host GPT and if you're able to host GPT means you can host

04:22:30.720 --> 04:22:33.760
any model. Any model means literally any model. So how you

04:22:33.760 --> 04:22:38.060
can host a GPU, a GPT and then how you will be able to

04:22:38.060 --> 04:22:44.000
expose that model with the help of VLLM library as an API so

04:22:44.000 --> 04:22:47.460
that anyone and everyone can access it. Means anyone and

04:22:47.460 --> 04:22:49.800
everyone can do the inferencing. This is what I'm saying.

04:22:49.960 --> 04:22:51.560
Yeah. So the way you are doing, the way you are doing

04:22:51.560 --> 04:22:54.020
inferencing with a UV, right? Is that similar? Yeah. Yeah.

04:22:54.080 --> 04:22:57.560
Yeah. So this is, this is one of the example and it's a very

04:22:57.560 --> 04:23:00.200
simple step. If you'll go through this, so step number one,

04:23:00.300 --> 04:23:03.720
two, three, four, and in a fifth step, you will be able to

04:23:03.720 --> 04:23:07.880
basically expose your model and then run the VLLM server. So

04:23:07.880 --> 04:23:11.180
see it is running and then I will be able to go through this

04:23:11.180 --> 04:23:14.220
URL and just as a chat completion or even as a curl, right?

04:23:14.280 --> 04:23:18.380
Even as a curl, I will be able to access it. Same. So if you

04:23:18.380 --> 04:23:21.000
are able to do one example, means all the model in this

04:23:21.000 --> 04:23:22.800
entire world, you will be able to host it in a similar

04:23:22.800 --> 04:23:26.160
manner in any GPUs, right? Not just with this one. This is

04:23:26.160 --> 04:23:28.940
one of the example which I have shown. The second example

04:23:28.940 --> 04:23:33.720
which I have shown over here. So this one, so inferencing

04:23:33.720 --> 04:23:37.600
120 billion parameter model, but with the chat system,

04:23:37.760 --> 04:23:41.160
right? So here you will be able to find out the chat system.

04:23:41.260 --> 04:23:45.180
See with the chat. So here no API access. Directly I have

04:23:45.180 --> 04:23:47.760
integrated with the Ulama. And then like with the help of

04:23:47.760 --> 04:23:50.900
like a chat system, open a web UI, I'm able to access the

04:23:50.900 --> 04:23:54.400
model. I'm able to like a chat with it. So this is

04:23:54.400 --> 04:23:57.420
applicable if you are looking for like a chat GPT solution

04:23:57.420 --> 04:24:00.500
or alternative of chat GPT. But if you are looking for

04:24:00.500 --> 04:24:03.060
anything custom, custom means, so you just have to host the

04:24:03.060 --> 04:24:05.120
model and through API, you have to access it. Then go with

04:24:05.120 --> 04:24:07.600
this approach because this is the approach that will be like

04:24:07.600 --> 04:24:11.780
most of the time you will end up using. Okay. Okay. And it's

04:24:11.780 --> 04:24:15.260
available there. Yeah. Like I said, simple step. One, two,

04:24:15.300 --> 04:24:23.370
three, four. Done. Yeah. Yeah. I try. Yeah. Okay. So, uh,

04:24:23.570 --> 04:24:28.690
okay. Next person, please. I want to decide. Yeah. So I want

04:24:28.690 --> 04:24:32.330
to understand that user prompt session that where internally

04:24:32.330 --> 04:24:36.990
that it is converting the embeddings into the context and

04:24:36.990 --> 04:24:40.450
directly sending us on the front end. Can you share that

04:24:40.450 --> 04:24:43.630
code part, please? Which one? Which one? Which one? The code

04:24:43.630 --> 04:24:48.950
part. Can you share? Open that code. Uh, this one? No, no,

04:24:48.950 --> 04:24:53.430
sir. Current class. Current class. Okay. So this is the code

04:24:53.430 --> 04:24:57.970
Medichat. Okay. Yeah. Main, main node. Okay. Come down. So

04:24:57.970 --> 04:25:02.870
this one medical document context. Up, up, up, up, up. Yeah.

04:25:03.390 --> 04:25:09.270
Yeah. Yeah. A bit down context. Line number. This one. Okay.

04:25:09.370 --> 04:25:11.710
This one. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. I need to

04:25:11.710 --> 04:25:15.030
understand, like we are converting the problem to query

04:25:15.030 --> 04:25:18.190
byusing the relevant of function. And after that we are

04:25:18.190 --> 04:25:20.930
providing a system prompt. And then what does this context

04:25:20.930 --> 04:25:24.850
that it is the embeddings converted back into the exactly so

04:25:24.850 --> 04:25:27.250
inbending, converted it back into the NLP, natural language.

04:25:27.890 --> 04:25:31.650
Going down later happening? Yeah, it is happening. It's been

04:25:31.650 --> 04:25:33.710
handled by this one, so it is and it has been handled by

04:25:33.710 --> 04:25:36.310
your language and this is the reason we are using this

04:25:36.310 --> 04:25:42.290
vector DB this one. Ok. so till yesterday till day before

04:25:42.290 --> 04:25:45.170
yesterday so when we were like last last classes we were

04:25:45.170 --> 04:25:48.730
doing it by writing a code right yes sir now here i'm using

04:25:48.730 --> 04:25:50.770
a library this is where this library comes into picture so

04:25:50.770 --> 04:25:53.310
this library is taking care of all of these things on behalf

04:25:53.310 --> 04:25:56.530
of me i'm just reducing the number of line of code over here

04:25:56.530 --> 04:26:02.070
answer one thing sir when we prompt this medichat a query

04:26:02.070 --> 04:26:04.850
that give me the patient's name who doesn't have any

04:26:04.850 --> 04:26:08.750
allergies so it is giving us only two results but when i

04:26:08.750 --> 04:26:12.590
cross check the document one one name which is john that is

04:26:12.590 --> 04:26:15.450
also considered in that category so why that is happening

04:26:15.450 --> 04:26:18.450
sir just change this one just change this one system problem

04:26:18.450 --> 04:26:21.710
just uh command it with all the edge cases and say that that

04:26:21.710 --> 04:26:24.690
i always try to scan all the documents whatever i have

04:26:24.690 --> 04:26:27.850
uploaded and then try to give me the answer or try to

04:26:27.850 --> 04:26:31.530
summarize the answer okay and one thing said before this

04:26:31.530 --> 04:26:34.450
class now i tried to build an analogy by myself by where we

04:26:34.450 --> 04:26:37.190
can upload a document and chat with the specific document

04:26:37.210 --> 04:26:40.710
not with this specific ui just a basic one so what i did

04:26:40.710 --> 04:26:44.890
that i uploaded my account information and i asked them to

04:26:44.890 --> 04:26:49.610
summarize the spendings so it is able to fetch the numbers

04:26:49.610 --> 04:26:52.570
on which they spend the amount but is not able to calculate

04:26:52.570 --> 04:26:56.510
it properly so that can be handled in the system prompt that

04:26:56.510 --> 04:26:59.490
can be handled also in the system prompt yes so like you can

04:26:59.490 --> 04:27:01.990
you can try just the edge cases see system problems just try

04:27:01.990 --> 04:27:05.430
to like write as much as possible and then if you have to

04:27:05.430 --> 04:27:08.290
make it better and better then try to to segregate

04:27:08.290 --> 04:27:10.650
everything as an agent so one agent just for doing the

04:27:10.650 --> 04:27:12.990
calculation one agent for like a retrieving the data so in

04:27:12.990 --> 04:27:15.950
this way we can go ahead but yeah in a system prompt i think

04:27:15.950 --> 04:27:19.730
you can control a lot system and user prompt the way i am

04:27:19.730 --> 04:27:22.550
doing it see for this example the code base which i was

04:27:22.550 --> 04:27:30.980
showing uh where is the code base uh the rag app not

04:27:46.240 --> 04:27:51.960
this one chat utils main.py where

04:27:57.040 --> 04:28:01.080
is my chat utils chat utils main

04:28:12.280 --> 04:28:13.620
system where

04:28:40.180 --> 04:28:45.040
is my screen which i was trying to showcase uh

04:28:46.930 --> 04:28:50.990
store 11 clients yeah

04:28:53.010 --> 04:28:56.190
so see the way i am trying to configure by like a system

04:28:56.190 --> 04:28:58.750
prompt and i am trying to configure my user prompt right lot

04:28:58.750 --> 04:29:03.230
depends upon this lot so you can control so many things over

04:29:03.230 --> 04:29:07.170
here itself you okay the way the way i am writing our use

04:29:07.170 --> 04:29:10.790
cases right uh edge cases you can say so if you have

04:29:10.790 --> 04:29:13.430
mentioned each and everything precisely it will be able to

04:29:13.430 --> 04:29:17.530
handle if not then obviously it will like hallucinate okay

04:29:17.530 --> 04:29:22.650
okay sir can you share your support please yeah i'll just

04:29:22.650 --> 04:29:26.530
upload this code base into uh like uh your dashboard itself

04:29:26.530 --> 04:29:29.950
once i'll upload the recording yeah okay one more thing i

04:29:29.950 --> 04:29:32.690
want your perspective on this so let's say sir you introduce

04:29:32.690 --> 04:29:37.270
a term called wipe coding in the first lecture so let's say

04:29:37.270 --> 04:29:40.530
considering an example if a person knows the basics yeah

04:29:40.530 --> 04:29:43.410
just a basic you have not practiced any ds or any complex

04:29:43.410 --> 04:29:47.670
kind of stuff so while uh attending this kind of a class and

04:29:47.670 --> 04:29:51.410
doesn't know where to start by doing and then with the help

04:29:51.410 --> 04:29:54.310
of ai doing the wipe coding starting somewhere and building

04:29:54.310 --> 04:29:59.190
coding is a very last step any one of us should fall into

04:29:59.190 --> 04:30:02.570
and even coding is a very last thing that we do in our

04:30:02.570 --> 04:30:06.030
organization so whenever we build anything uh so before that

04:30:06.030 --> 04:30:10.690
we try to do the design architecture lld hld break down the

04:30:10.690 --> 04:30:15.070
problem into a small small chunks if that is clear then come

04:30:15.070 --> 04:30:18.210
to vibe coding generally what people does is that that they

04:30:18.210 --> 04:30:20.710
just like open up this tool cursor or maybe windsurf or

04:30:20.710 --> 04:30:24.150
something like this and they just start giving a prompt that

04:30:24.150 --> 04:30:27.130
build this build that this that did that that is not a

04:30:27.130 --> 04:30:29.930
correct way of doing a live coding even right feature by

04:30:29.930 --> 04:30:33.090
feature that okay build this feature then build this feature

04:30:33.090 --> 04:30:37.030
try to use this into this one right so if you are going to

04:30:37.030 --> 04:30:40.170
give instruction in this way uh believe me your application

04:30:40.170 --> 04:30:43.610
will be better now to do that to get into that label

04:30:43.610 --> 04:30:46.650
obviously you must be having a complete core understanding

04:30:46.650 --> 04:30:49.210
and that will come with experience unless you have not built

04:30:49.210 --> 04:30:51.550
a project uh you will not be able to get the imagination

04:30:51.550 --> 04:30:56.210
because maybe basically trying different projects in a

04:30:56.210 --> 04:31:00.410
particular domain exactly exactly yeah so try to solve not a

04:31:00.410 --> 04:31:02.790
project as you try to solve multiple different problems or

04:31:02.790 --> 04:31:06.650
maybe someone else has already right now try to refactor

04:31:06.650 --> 04:31:11.830
those problem in your own way okay for example let's say you

04:31:11.830 --> 04:31:15.310
are building a feature right and you are iterating over that

04:31:15.310 --> 04:31:18.070
feature multiple times to get the correct one so there is

04:31:18.070 --> 04:31:22.390
nothing harm in that right see iteration is not like going

04:31:22.390 --> 04:31:24.790
with a blind iteration again i have seen that okay fine so

04:31:24.790 --> 04:31:27.790
you are not able to do this correct it i mean like that is

04:31:27.790 --> 04:31:30.250
not a correct instruction by the way you have to give a

04:31:30.250 --> 04:31:34.130
precise instruction that this is what i'm looking for use

04:31:34.130 --> 04:31:37.770
this and do this just like your junior developer right your

04:31:37.770 --> 04:31:39.710
junior developer don't understand doesn't understand many

04:31:39.710 --> 04:31:42.210
many things so basically as a senior developer as a lead

04:31:42.210 --> 04:31:44.590
what i do i try to break down the problems i say that okay

04:31:44.590 --> 04:31:48.150
fine i'm looking for only this right precisely this color

04:31:48.150 --> 04:31:52.430
this pixel this font size means only this font size with

04:31:52.430 --> 04:31:56.830
this screen with this button and on click it should do only

04:31:56.830 --> 04:32:00.530
this if you are able to drill down your problem till this

04:32:00.530 --> 04:32:03.710
label vibe coding will be you effective otherwise vibe

04:32:03.710 --> 04:32:07.810
coding will be like just generating some random code piece

04:32:07.810 --> 04:32:10.870
of code most of them i've seen that they are literally just

04:32:10.870 --> 04:32:14.250
pasting the error and fix exactly that's not a correct way

04:32:14.250 --> 04:32:16.390
see that is not a correct way to build any product and then

04:32:16.390 --> 04:32:19.610
you will end up not building anything and again it will just

04:32:19.610 --> 04:32:22.710
end up generating some scrap code which which you can't use

04:32:22.710 --> 04:32:25.210
it which you can't even fix it basically so that's the

04:32:25.210 --> 04:32:27.310
reason many people started saying that that vibe coding is

04:32:27.310 --> 04:32:29.650
not effective this that i mean like you are not taking

04:32:29.650 --> 04:32:32.350
things in a proper manner you are thinking that system will

04:32:32.350 --> 04:32:35.990
get into your brain and whatever you are imagining it will

04:32:35.990 --> 04:32:38.610
be able to take out all your emotion automatically and then

04:32:38.610 --> 04:32:42.250
build it i'm like how you don't have a neural links between

04:32:42.250 --> 04:32:46.850
your brain and this uh vibe cooler right right so you have

04:32:46.850 --> 04:32:50.150
to drill down the way you drill down things since and ages

04:32:50.150 --> 04:32:53.230
since many many decades we are building software right the

04:32:53.230 --> 04:32:56.470
way the pattern that we are following just try to give the

04:32:56.470 --> 04:33:00.850
same pattern ai will do the work otherwise ai is not like

04:33:00.850 --> 04:33:03.410
that smart where it will get into a brain extract all the

04:33:03.410 --> 04:33:06.970
idea and then you know build something for you which people

04:33:06.970 --> 04:33:11.530
are trying nowadays i believe so let's say as you have

04:33:11.530 --> 04:33:16.270
shared the assignment so you there are many new questions

04:33:16.270 --> 04:33:20.190
and challenges are there so i you have thought that we have

04:33:20.190 --> 04:33:24.710
to about an rj application we have to follow a specific flow

04:33:24.710 --> 04:33:30.910
so a new question comes and uh i have no idea about so by

04:33:30.910 --> 04:33:34.750
being precise to the ai about that question i can start

04:33:34.750 --> 04:33:38.470
somewhere and i can reach to an input right yeah yeah yes

04:33:38.470 --> 04:33:44.750
okay thank you thank you thanks okay another question for me

04:33:44.750 --> 04:33:48.210
guys or shall we close amit sahid rupees you have questions

04:33:48.210 --> 04:33:50.790
one last question for me sir yeah please go ahead i have one

04:33:50.790 --> 04:33:54.750
question for me yeah yeah go ahead please go ahead i have a

04:33:54.750 --> 04:33:56.530
small question thanks for the session today

04:34:00.750 --> 04:34:05.010
question is that right now we are using the eu the uri api

04:34:05.010 --> 04:34:08.750
keys to to do the work suppose i am thinking to deploy my

04:34:08.750 --> 04:34:11.630
own model like a following up the previous question which

04:34:11.630 --> 04:34:14.590
one of the our colleague asked actually suppose i'm trying

04:34:14.590 --> 04:34:18.630
to deploy our own model on our local machine like i have a

04:34:18.630 --> 04:34:22.650
good machine like a 30 gb ram or like a 40 gb or 60 gb of

04:34:22.650 --> 04:34:26.150
ram so i can deploy that 20 billion parameter uh through the

04:34:26.150 --> 04:34:30.690
ulama so if i do that how can i connect those that

04:34:30.690 --> 04:34:32.390
application with my python application

04:34:36.190 --> 04:34:39.630
okay ulama integration you can do it with the open web ui

04:34:39.630 --> 04:34:42.970
through open web ui ulama integration so which by which you

04:34:42.970 --> 04:34:46.830
will be able to do the basically chatting inferencing we can

04:34:46.830 --> 04:34:50.670
do that let's suppose you have to use your model in this

04:34:50.670 --> 04:34:53.790
application are application right right you can't you can't

04:34:53.790 --> 04:34:59.250
do it directly so for that you can use a vllm yes this is

04:34:59.250 --> 04:35:01.630
what i have shown you right the documentation the video i

04:35:01.630 --> 04:35:04.690
have shown you two videos one videos where i'm using open

04:35:04.690 --> 04:35:08.470
web ui and under the hood it's a ulama right so where i'm

04:35:08.470 --> 04:35:11.010
able to influence the model the second application and for

04:35:11.010 --> 04:35:13.230
that documentation which i have shared with you so over

04:35:13.230 --> 04:35:16.450
there i'm using model but with the help of vllm i'm exposing

04:35:16.450 --> 04:35:19.830
it to the external world for the optimized inferencing and

04:35:19.830 --> 04:35:22.490
now anyone can consume it as an api the way you are

04:35:22.490 --> 04:35:25.850
consuming uri now okay great great so are we going to have

04:35:25.850 --> 04:35:28.650
going to have any kind of similar exercise so that we can

04:35:28.650 --> 04:35:30.690
i'll show you i'll show you in a class as well and you don't

04:35:30.690 --> 04:35:33.050
have to wait just go ahead document is already uploaded you

04:35:33.050 --> 04:35:36.530
can do it maybe today itself okay thank you so much i will

04:35:36.530 --> 04:35:38.730
do it just uh just a five step very simple step i have

04:35:38.730 --> 04:35:41.590
already simplified it so you don't have to worry thank you

04:35:41.590 --> 04:35:45.370
so much thank you so much yeah thanks yeah yeah amit with

04:35:45.370 --> 04:35:49.910
the question sir can you hear me yeah i can hear you

04:35:59.450 --> 04:36:01.650
sir mcp

04:36:08.150 --> 04:36:09.550
basically

04:36:13.530 --> 04:36:18.970
mcp mcp mcp mcp

04:36:21.550 --> 04:36:36.910
mcp mcp mcp mcp mcp mcp mcp mcp mcp mcp mcp

04:36:43.670 --> 04:36:52.550
mcp mcp mcp and attach it to any LLM provider or any other

04:36:52.550 --> 04:36:58.190
tool. So, in both the ways, technically it is a function

04:36:58.190 --> 04:37:00.970
execution. Even if you are doing REG, you are calling the

04:37:00.970 --> 04:37:04.710
MCP function. The method is different, that's it. The

04:37:04.710 --> 04:37:06.950
protocol is different. You are not doing any different work.

04:37:09.370 --> 04:37:15.250
My second question is, can we store the vector data in NAS

04:37:15.250 --> 04:37:21.190
and use it if it is too much in TB? Yes, you can do it in

04:37:21.190 --> 04:37:23.870
NAS. Why not? At the end of the day, it is also a storage

04:37:23.870 --> 04:37:29.950
unit. And can we retrieve it from inside by asking the

04:37:29.950 --> 04:37:33.570
query? You can access it. It will remain in your network,

04:37:33.910 --> 04:37:39.010
local or global. Okay. Yes, you have to do it locally. Yes,

04:37:39.010 --> 04:37:41.990
exactly. It is in your local network. So, if it is working

04:37:41.990 --> 04:37:44.770
in my local system, it will also work there. It is nothing

04:37:44.770 --> 04:37:52.780
different. Okay. And my third question is, which scalable

04:37:52.780 --> 04:37:55.920
tool do we use in production? For Kubernetes or Terraform or

04:37:55.920 --> 04:38:00.240
any other production? Generally, use Kubernetes. It will be

04:38:00.240 --> 04:38:04.300
good. It is actually good. It is basically headache-free.

04:38:05.700 --> 04:38:11.240
And it is also usable in Terraform. Yes. Sorry? Yes, why

04:38:11.240 --> 04:38:14.280
Terraform is used? It is used for scalability, right?

04:38:14.620 --> 04:38:20.080
Exactly. It is used for that. Yes. Okay. Yes. And all the

04:38:20.080 --> 04:38:27.640
architectures of BlackBox, GPT, GPT, are they all written in

04:38:27.640 --> 04:38:36.200
Python or C++? It is pure Python. Yes. LLML. Yes. Many are

04:38:36.200 --> 04:38:38.200
written in C and C+. Many are written in C++. Many, those

04:38:38.200 --> 04:38:42.320
who are on the trading level, are written in Python too.

04:38:42.800 --> 04:38:45.720
Majorly, they are written in lower level only. If you see.

04:38:45.960 --> 04:38:50.500
For a faster fast execution processing. Exactly. Okay. Okay.

04:38:50.540 --> 04:38:55.100
Okay. Yes. Thank you, Bhajji. Okay. Yes. Dev go ahead with

04:38:55.100 --> 04:38:55.320
the question.

04:38:59.480 --> 04:39:00.560
Yes, Dev, you have a question?

04:39:03.810 --> 04:39:06.410
Okay, so fine guys. It was a very very long class. Thank you

04:39:06.410 --> 04:39:09.130
so much. Take care everyone. And see you again in my next

04:39:09.130 --> 04:39:11.690
lecture Saturday. And I believe I have already set the

04:39:11.690 --> 04:39:13.350
agenda for my next lecture. class what we are going to

04:39:13.350 --> 04:39:15.470
discuss so we are going to see the enhancement of the same

04:39:15.470 --> 04:39:17.770
project that we have discussed in my today's class and with

04:39:17.770 --> 04:39:20.770
that thank you so much everyone take care see you again in

04:39:20.770 --> 04:39:22.010
the next lecture thank you
