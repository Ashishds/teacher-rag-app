00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.620
okay so hi everyone i think i'm visible and audible right to

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.000
all of you so if you can hear me uh please ping me yes or no

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.660
good morning by the way and happy weekend to all of you yeah

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.880
okay

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.540
so i am audible and visible to all of you so let's start

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.260
with the class today we are going to talk about a very very

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.700
interesting project not project i would say uh use cases

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.860
obviously so we are going to discuss again with respect to

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.360
agents so i believe we were talking about the agents so

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.400
we'll try to see some of the agents in action we'll try to

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.920
understand that how we can create one of our agents and then

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.240
how we'll be able to make it work with the help of a

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.480
framework called as lang graph so i think last week i was

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.220
talking about a lang chain framework plus i have even given

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.380
you an idea a fair understanding about the agent that what

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.580
technically the agent is and uh how it is going to work same

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.920
thing we are going to extend with this particular framework

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.460
and with the help of uri api so obviously we'll try to do it

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:33.300
yeah uh so shall we start guys everyone yeah with the agents

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.420
so

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.280
basically today we are going to create a agents uh which

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.700
will be able to process uh bills basically so we try to

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.180
receive a lot of like uh invoices so the agents which i'm

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.500
going to create today so that agent will be able to process

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.960
the invoices we'll talk about the entire flow just in a step

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.760
-by-step manner today i have joined the class okay so

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.700

plus i have also given a interview uh detailed project

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.460
report and many more things right inside this particular

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.380
batch and generally this batch happens on uh monday and

is a discussion which is going to happen today and tomorrow

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.060
for this generative AI boot camp batch at what time so i

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.000
have already made an announcement inside a group so at 4 pm

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.200

and obviously we will try to discuss about this interview

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:36.040
things inside our classes inside the lectures itself so

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.740
those 200 interview questions has already been shared if you

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.380
will go inside this batch you will be able to download it uh

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:46.080

questions uh from my side basically so basically i'm going

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.520
to talk about my own version of those 200 interview

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.380
questions this is what i'm trying to say over here so it

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:06.620
will be better if you guys can join this particular lecture

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:10.740
uh because i know you have an access of this entire batches

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.440
you must be having a your own plus so you can join this

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.340
particular batch you can join this uh interview discussion a

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:21.900
200 questions interview discussion most probably uh by today

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.820

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:28.060
questions if not then obviously i'm going to take some of

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:31.620
the classes in uh upcoming days and by the way where i'm

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.320
going to finish this 200 but yeah I think it is going to be

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.740
a very very fruitful discussion for all of you in terms of

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:41.480
doing a interview preparation simple right in terms of doing

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.300
a interview preparation it is going to be a fruitful one uh

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:50.840
this is one second is we have already started a dsa with

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.600
python bootcamp with is a lecture so we have already done

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.120
the inauguration of this batch so from today onwards we are

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.560
going to start the actual lecture so you can join that one

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:04.100
plus we have this build development bootcamp in hindi not in

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.520
english so in hindi so again this is another announcement

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:11.400
plus next week so there will be this ai ml masters so a lot

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.840
of batches right a lot of batches so based on your interest

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.040
you can like go and join but yeah maybe you can try to join

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.740
this interview bootcamp i think that will be better at least

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.860
these two classes today's class and tomorrow's class so that

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:26.300
it will be kind of a revision for all of you those who are

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:30.700
already aware about the generative ai are those who are not

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.480
aware about those terms so maybe you will get to know about

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:37.620
it simple right anyhow i'm not going to discuss some concept

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.760
in detail inside this batch because this is the interview

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.600
batch so it's just a question answer kind of a session we

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.420
are going to conduct as simple as that so this was the

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:52.340
announcement now coming back to our lecture like i said so i

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:56.580
am going to talk about agents by the way yeah so i'm going

00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:00.220
to talk about basically agents how agents actually works and

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:04.380
basically what kind of agent we are going to create let's

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:08.300
let's try to discuss each and everything so i believe in my

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.540
previous lecture i have already talked about the agents we

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:14.000
have already created our agents basically with the help of

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.840
lang chain like i said so this class is going to be the

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:21.200
extension of the previous classes our agentic ai classes so

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.200
today what we are going to do so today we are going to

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:30.380
create a agents by the way not just one single agent but we

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:34.340
are going to create a multiple agent in my today's class so

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:38.660
where this agents will be responsible for doing a different

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.720
different different different different different kind of a

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:45.300
task for me with respect to a particular project obviously

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:50.100
right with respect to the project obviously over here so now

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.780
what kind of a project we are going to discuss let's start

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.280
financial start talking about it by the way shall we start

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.740
guys what

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.920
is lang chain okay great uh i think you should watch the

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.820
previous lecture not

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.520
understood then watch it twice in that case because

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.060
this is how you will be able to understand can

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.980
you revise it i think i have already spent enough amount of

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:39.040
time uh so just to make you understand what is a lang chain

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.160
it's not possible navneet and i believe you should focus

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.240
more on a class because the kind of a question you were

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:48.820
asking even last class and asking now i don't think that um

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:53.860
it's it's

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.240
a good way and you are you are like focusing inside the

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:00.400
class so please do it yeah it's for you not for me okay

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.600
let's start so basically uh what we are going to do guys so

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.840
we are going to create again our agents now what kind of

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:11.600
agent we are going to create so we keep on receiving a lot

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.880
of invoices so let's suppose uh there is a place right there

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.360
is a place where i will keep on receiving a multiple

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.640
different different different different invoice yeah

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:26.040
multiple different different different invoices over here or

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.460
you can say a bills so i'll keep on receiving a different

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:33.180
different kind of a bills over here uh what is agent kiai

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.320
and navneet is asking again so navneet if you are here to

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:41.020
disturb a class then i have an option to you know uh remove

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:45.940
you from the class so please don't do it i remember your

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.440
name and the kind of a question that you were asking in a

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:52.540
past and i think most of us remember you right from our

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:56.940
multiple classes don't do it yeah i don't allow those like

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:02.840
things you know inside a class next question and you will be

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:08.200
gone from the class permanently uh and i think many of us

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:13.080
remembers you from the previous discussions see they saying

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.180
yes okay uh so fine

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:25.980
yes we all remember your name by the way the action will be

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:30.280
taken okay so you see guys uh basically uh let's suppose we

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:34.240
are receiving a lot of invoices yeah a lot of invoices so we

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:37.840
have to basically create a system right we have to basically

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:42.400
create a system uh which will be able to watch a particular

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:47.500
place so for example in a xyg folder in any folder or maybe

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.540
in any directory or maybe in any location maybe on a s3

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:54.880
location or anywhere right i am receiving a lot of invoices

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:58.860
invoices means uh basically a screenshot snapshot basically

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:01.860
snapshot of the invoices i am receiving so someone is like

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.620
taking a snapshot and then someone is sending the invoices

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:08.760
or maybe uh there is a digital print of the invoices which

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.460
is available in a particular folder and again so this folder

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:16.400
has been configured in such a way that people will keep on

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:21.180
you know sending the invoices on a daily basis yeah so let's

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:25.520
talk an example of a maybe a small store right a small store

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.780
or maybe even a bigger store so where people will come they

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:31.200
will try to purchase something and then invoice will be

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.400
generated and obviously they have to keep a log of all the

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.500
invoices because it will be maybe unstructured one right so

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.580
they have to like you know send an invoice to their owner on

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:44.360
a whatsapp number or somewhere maybe maybe somewhere right

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:50.120
so we have to send them uh invoices now once invoices will

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:55.060
be available here so we have to build a system which will

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.880
come to this particular folder means which will keep on

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.220
watching this particular folder yeah keep on watching this

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:06.480
particular folder or this particular location it will try to

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.340
so first of all what it should do so basically it should be

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:17.960
able to watch the folder watch the folder for any once any

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:22.400
new invoice will arrive so what it should do so once any new

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:26.120
invoice will arrive so basically it should try to read the

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:29.740
invoices right read the invoices maybe invoices will be

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:34.660
available in a png format or maybe svg format or maybe in a

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:39.340
jpeg format or jpeg format jpeg or maybe in a jpg format

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:42.860
format or maybe into a PDF format invoices will be available

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.140
it should be able to read it now once it will be able to

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:49.960
read it right once it will be able to read it then obviously

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:53.060
it should be able to perform a OCR operation optimal

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:57.100
character recognition so basically whenever we like try to

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:02.040
read any kind of you know document like as an image right as

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.740
an image so that is technically an OCR so we have to use a

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:09.240
OCR library and then we have to like you know extract all of

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:13.220
those data because if data is available in an image format

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:16.080
you will not be able to process it by using a pipe video

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:19.240
processor or any other processor so we will try to like you

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.740
know implement the OCR and then we will try to extract all

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:26.360
of those data now once you will be able to extract those

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:30.020
data so maybe we have to do some sort of a cleaning of those

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:36.500
data yeah we have to do a cleaning of those data now once we

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:40.500
will be able to do a cleaning of data. those data then maybe

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:45.280
we can try to do some sort of a data validation yeah data

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:45.940
validation

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:51.900
data validation now once I will be able to do some sort of a

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:56.060
data validation so maybe we can try to you know format a

00:17:56.060 --> 00:18:04.500
data format a data format a data and once we will be able to

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:09.680
do a data formatting in a like a well manner then maybe we

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.620
can try to do some sort of a insertion of the data so

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.220
insertion of the data where maybe into some databases maybe

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:20.240
into a SQL system maybe into some no SQL system and then

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.300
maybe we can try to send a notification

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.640
right so it should this system should keep on running right

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.760
this agent which I am talking about so the system should

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.480
keep on running. And it should keep on running. And it

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:42.540
should keep on watching this particular folder. So whenever

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:45.640
there will be a new data arrives or whenever there will be a

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:49.020
new invoice arrives so obviously it should follow the exact

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:53.520
same process without any kind of a human intervention yeah.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.400
So whatever location I have configured so it should keep on

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.840
watching this particular location and it should keep on

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:02.520
doing this entire things at the end of the day it has to

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.080
clean it and it has to insert it inside a SQL system so that

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:10.000
I can go into a SQL system I can build any kind of a

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.940
dashboard that's a parallel pipeline that's a different

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.880
pipeline right so maybe I can build a dashboards which can

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.100
represent the sales and which can represent the revenue or

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:23.440
any other key matrixes which I want or maybe I can just go

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.700
to a database I can query the database right that okay what

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.800
was the total order how many people have ordered how many

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:34.000
invoices are there what was the total order values what was

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.220
a date what kind of a revenue which I have done on this

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.580
particular data. All those things right all those things so

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:45.080
that is the parallel process but at the end of the day I

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:49.300
want this system to be configured in such a way that keep on

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.620
watching this place simple keep on watching this particular

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:56.800
place and process it right process it. Now obviously it

00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.180
looks like a programming problems right I can write a Python

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.900
code for this step this step this step this step all of

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:08.240
these step and I can do it that that's cool. And. There are

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.620
different ways of working. We will end up doing over here.

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:14.700
Right. Nothing different. But here so we are going to take

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:18.920
our agent tech AI approach so where I'm going to create our

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:23.080
watcher agent. I'm going to create this reading agent. I'm

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:26.340
going to create this OCR agent. I'm going to create this

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.960
cleaning agent. I'm going to create this data validation

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:32.540
agent. I'm going to create this formatting data agent. I'm

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:35.480
going to create the insertion data agent and then maybe a

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.600
notification agent. agent as we all know that agent TK is

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.800
nothing but automation plus plus right automation plus plus.

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:45.980
So here obviously I am going to use an agent I am going to

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:49.120
define a different different kind of a task for a different

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:53.240
different particularly an agent and every agent

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:57.580
independently will work and they will try to follow the next

00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.940
process. We are going to connect an agent in such a way that

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:04.800
every agent will do their task. For example watcher agent

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.520
will keep on watching right keep on watching it will do a

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.340
task and then forward it to the next one then the next one

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.420
then the next one then the next one. So in an autonomous

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:18.040
manner so it will keep on running it will keep on working.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.840
So I'm going to attach those agent in such a way I'm going

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:26.180
to connect those agent in such a way that it will just keep

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:29.940
on doing its own job as simple as that right. So basically

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.920
I'm trying to talk about a multi agent task. A multi agent

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:36.980
system where every agent will be responsible for doing its

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:40.760
own job that's it and then I will be doing a configuration

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:44.700
of those agent that okay you do this you do this you do this

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.880
that's it you don't have to worry about like after or before

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.900
this is your task this is the input that you will get this

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:54.600
is the output that you have to produce and end of the job.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.940
But yes you should keep on doing it for like a infinite time

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.820
right you should keep on doing it for the infinite time. So

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:05.580
that whenever there will be a data I must be able to get the

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:09.700
response. So technically I will not be interested in any of

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.880
this middle processes once I am going to configure it. I

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.400
will be interested into my final data which is available

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:20.460
into maybe a sequel system or maybe a no sequel system

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:25.300
anywhere right. But that will be my area of interest fine

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:30.440
that will be my area of interest at the end of the day. So

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.520
are you able to understand this. So this entire things guys

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:37.500
yeah the application that I'm talking about I believe this

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.820
is again a real time application you can like write it down

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:44.360
inside your resume easily right with respect to the many

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.980
different different cases even with respect to the legal

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:49.320
case you can write it down with respect to the finance case

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.740
you can write it down in every company we try to process a

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:56.500
lot of invoices and every invoice will not be a digital

00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:00.000
invoice which will be inserted into a databases. Majority of

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.700
the invoices will be maybe a digital invoice. Maybe a

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:05.480
digital print or maybe a physical one. So we just take a

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:09.860
snapshot and then we try to process it right. So again this

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:13.140
is a kind of a use cases which I'm going to talk about which

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:18.420
you can try to fit in anywhere in any industry right. Not

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:22.260
just in one process maybe you are like working on some book

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.880
processing system. So where people are sending you the image

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.140
of the books and the pages you are trying to process it so

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.900
that there can be many use cases. And again. So you can try

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:35.700
to fit in this particular use case in any industry in any

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:39.460
domain because it's just like that yeah. So let's start

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.980
creating it guys. Now what kind of things we are going to

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:46.680
use. So obviously I need a LLM access right without LLM I

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:51.960
can't like you know create an agent because agent needs LLMs

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.960
right. I believe we are pretty much clear on that part. So

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:58.860
we have a URI for a LLM provider part number one part number

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:02.740
two we can try to use any of this framework. I can try to

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:05.480
use a lang chain I can try to use a lang graph framework I

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:09.020
can try to use a crew AI I can try to use a auto gen I can

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:12.480
even use edit and I can create it without even writing a

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.960
single line of code just by doing a drag and drop right.

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.880
That is possible. I can use even a crew AI studio so where I

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.820
don't have to do anything I can just go chat and then it

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:23.960
will try to configure each and everything I just have to set

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:28.520
the parameter. So any agentic AI system will be able to

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:31.180
create this this kind of a system. It's a very simple thing.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.340
Simple as simple as that and it will be able to solve this

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:37.760
particular task. So today I will be using a lang graph by

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.700
the way yeah I will be using a lang graph. So basically like

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.200
I have already given you the introduction that lang graph is

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.760
another framework so where you can go and you can try to

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:51.200
create a graph style agent. So basically what is the meaning

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.720
of a graph. Let me give you a little bit of explanation. So

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:58.140
in a graph you will be able to find out majorly two things.

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.880
The very first part is a node. Right. Very first part is a

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:09.820
node and the second part is edge yeah node and edge. So in

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.500
any graph right in general I am not just talking about the

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:15.300
lang graph by the way I am just talking about the graph as

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:19.280
an entity. So in any graph you will be able to find out a

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:22.440
node and you will be able to find out the edges. Now what is

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:26.440
the meaning of this node. So basically node is nothing but

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.540
yeah.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:36.120
So basically. So basically this node is nothing but I can

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:41.200
try to maybe declare it as a unit which understands maybe a

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.520
logic which do some sort of a task. So this is basically

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:48.500
called as node. The round one which I have created right the

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.000
round one which I have created is actually called as node

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.880
and what is edge by the way. So edge is nothing but a

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:57.300
connection right. Maybe a directional connection I can try

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.140
to create over here. So basically edge is nothing but a

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:03.320
connection. That how one node is connected to the other.

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.380
Another node means I will do this task whatever has been

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:09.680
defined and then I will try to do this task. Now I will just

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.540
follow this particular approach yeah. So this is something

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:14.920
called as node and this is something called as edges. Edges

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:18.700
are nothing but entity which will try to connect or which

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.820
will try to create a flow in a layman way. If I have to say

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:25.180
the same thing then edges are nothing but kind of a

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:28.060
direction right that okay fine. So after doing this do this

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:31.520
do this do this. So basically lang graph follows a similar

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:36.800
kind of approach. And in terms of a lang graph it allows you

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.520
right it allows you to create a different different kind of

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:43.740
a nodes and then you know like connected right connected in

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:46.940
any sequence that you want. So you can try to create a fork

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.820
you can try to create maybe a joins you can you can do

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:52.760
anything any kind of a graph any kind of you know complete

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.360
pipeline you will be able to create in case of a lang graph

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.560
and it's going to be pretty much easier than the lang chain

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.140
implementation. This is something that you will be able to

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:06.500
find out. But yeah so the core philosophy is that create a

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:10.180
node. Node means what these nodes may be a watcher node may

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:13.900
be a read node OCR node cleaning node all those nodes just

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.980
try to create these kind of a nodes and then connect it in a

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:20.780
particular flow that okay after doing this do this do this

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:23.720
do this do this so that my system will end up doing all of

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:28.480
these things. And here when I say node I am basically

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:32.380
referring to a agents right I am technically referring to a

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.660
agents. I am just referring to the agents over here as

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:38.500
simple as that I am just referring to the agents. Now what

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:42.260
is the agents nothing again a kind of a function a kind of a

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:45.240
intelligent function so which is going to you know use maybe

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.680
an AI or maybe some sort of a tools tools means again a

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.700
function which will be able to use and then it is going to

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:56.700
process or it is going to perform some sort of a like a task

00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:01.760
for me yeah so with the help of lang graph let's try to

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:05.120
create this agent. We have our entire things and we have our

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:10.280
lms right and we have our lms and we have a basically like a

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:14.460
framework lang graph so we just have to use that framework

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:17.760
and then we have to perform this entire operation so here

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:22.040
just try to open up a vs code first of all guys step by step

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:28.620
we will do it so here maybe I can try to create a new folder

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:42.440
lang graph invoice. Yeah, so this is the folder which I'm

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:45.500
creating, you can create a folder of your own name. That's

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:49.860
completely okay with me. Now here so once you are able to

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:53.240
create this folder, right, so we have to do a environment

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:56.520
setup, right. So just like any other project environment

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.740
setup we try to do. So maybe you can do a conda installation

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:02.660
and then you can do an environment setup. Or maybe you can

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:04.760
just like you know, go ahead with the press environment

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:08.540
setup as for your like as you wish as simple as that. So

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:11.720
maybe you can go ahead with the Python environment setup. So

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:15.080
Python m invoice hyper environment. So this is something

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:18.720
which I'm going to create. Just do it. I'm pinging you. I

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.260
believe environment setup is something that we all know we

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:24.620
already we have done that more than 10 times. So I don't

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.860
think that there should be an issue with respect to the

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:29.700
environment creation. So use conda, use Python, whatever you

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:34.360
want, just create the environment and then just try to

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:37.860
activate this environment. So invoice, invoice

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:48.440
environment. environment slash script, scripts

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:55.230
slash activate,

00:29:55.590 --> 00:30:00.210
yeah, so it will able to activate the environment simple. So

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:03.230
create the environment and activate the environment for now.

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:06.010
Now once you will be able to create the environment and

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:08.530
activate the environment, then you have to perform some sort

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:12.030
of installation over here, some libraries. So quickly just

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:15.710
install these libraries guys, I'm pinging you in a chat. So

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:21.070
let me, attendees can chat with host and panelists, okay.

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:26.590
Now so everything will be available in one single place. So

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:30.710
fine, pip upgrade, that's fine. Now let's try to install a

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:34.930
couple of things, pip install easy OCR. So basically easy

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:38.470
OCR is a library, which I'm going to use to perform an OCR,

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:40.770
which will try to read the images and then eventually it

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:44.390
will try to extract the data. Now. Now easy OCR is not a

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:49.190
best one. You can try to use even a best one, but yeah, easy

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:52.050
OCR is one of the freely available solution. You can even

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:54.530
try to use a treasure act. You can try to use even Amazon

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:59.370
OCR, there are like a snow lab OCR. So there are so many

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:01.130
different, different OCR library, which is already

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:03.850
available. Some are free, some are paid. If something is

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:06.470
paid, obviously they are going to give you the better one.

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:10.450
But yeah, I think easy OCR is going to do the job for me at

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:13.610
least for now. Yeah. So just try to install easy OCR,

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:16.990
pillow, secret, utils, all of these things you have to

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:21.410
install. So pinging you once again, install it.

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:29.580
Just back to back configure this entire system guys. Means

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:32.740
I'm just trying to create the new environment. So create it

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:33.860
quickly.

00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:51.800
Yeah. So are you doing guys, everyone, invoice environment

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.060
is another folder. Obviously whenever you are going to

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:56.780
create the environment, right, with the help of Python. So

00:31:56.780 --> 00:32:00.000
it is going to create the invoice. Guys. I'm not expecting

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.760
this kind of a question because I think we all know how to

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.420
create the environment. We have already done that so many

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:06.020
times, right?

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:14.390
Can we not work with the previous? Yeah. You can select

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:17.250
previous environment. That's okay with me. I don't have any

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:20.150
issue. Yeah. If it is going to give you any issue, then you

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:22.790
have to do the installation. So I don't have technically any

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:25.370
kind of issue with respect to your previous environment. You

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:29.450
can just go and work. Generally I prefer to use a new

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:34.670
environment every time. Like, you know, I do the project.

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:40.110
Simple. Why don't we keep it in a requirement.txt? We'll do

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:43.290
it. I think we have already done that in the past. We'll do

00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:48.510
it. As of now, it doesn't matter if we are not going for the

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:48.930
deployment.

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:57.370
Okay. So let me check why it is taking time, but yeah, just

00:32:57.370 --> 00:33:00.430
do the installation quickly. Fine. This installation is done

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:03.890
now. So you have to install a URI AI. This is again

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:08.490
important for everyone. Yeah. So just try to install a URI

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:13.090
AI. Then you have to install Pandas. So just install Pandas

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:15.110
inside your environment. Yeah.

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:26.270
Once Pandas will be installed, then if

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:32.600
you are into a Windows machine, then just try to install a

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.120
Torch. So Torch is important for doing like, or for running

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:42.980
this OCR library. Just a supporting one. Okay. So just do

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:46.520
all of this installation. Guys. And let me know. I think I

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:50.440
have already pinged you all the libraries which you have to

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.900
install. You can maybe keep it inside requirement.txt,

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.840
install it one sort and maybe you can, you know, one by one,

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:00.060
go ahead and install it. You can use a previous environment.

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:04.640
I don't have any issues. I just want you to keep your

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.780
installation ready. That's it. That's the only need. Apart

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:11.060
from that, there is no need from my side. So whether you are

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:14.440
using a new environment, you're using the old one. Let me

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.440
know. It literally doesn't matter. Yeah. It doesn't matter

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:21.260
at all. Okay. So this is the environment that we have. We

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:24.440
have already created that environment. Now let's do one

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:28.780
thing. So let's try to create a Jupyter notebook over here.

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:31.760
Right. We'll do a code in a Jupyter notebook. So here

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:35.180
invoice processor

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:41.400
.ipynv. So now this is the Jupyter notebook, which I'm going

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.820
to create and I'm going to select a kernel. Okay. So

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:49.320
basically Python invoice environment. Yeah. So this is the

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.540
environment which I have created. So I'm going to select

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.480
this environment for this Jupyter notebook. I believe we all

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.680
know how to select the particular environment. And then if

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.340
something will be missing, I will end up installing inside

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:05.500
the same environment. Simple. Okay. Now. So this Jupyter

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:08.240
notebook has been created. Now one more thing I can, I can

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:10.960
try to do over here so I can try to create a folder.

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:15.020
Basically. I can try to create a folder over here. So where

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:18.600
I'm going to create all the invoices. Yeah. I'm going to

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:23.120
keep all the invoices. So new folder. And then let's name

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:28.540
this folder as a invoices folder. And here, so I'm going to

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:32.800
keep a couple of invoices for now. For example, uh, maybe

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:36.280
I'm going to keep these invoices over here. Now what is

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:38.640
there inside this invoices? So these are basically a

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.980
pictures as you can see, right? It's a PNG format. And, uh,

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:45.060
these are the, some of the invoices I have kept over here.

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:48.260
Some of the invoices, right? So again, I have used a Python

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:51.560
code to generate this invoice, but, uh, you can try to keep

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:54.520
any of your invoices, uh, of your choice. That's completely

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:58.320
fine with me. That's completely okay with me. Yeah. So some

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:02.240
of the invoices I'm going to keep it here. Now let me see if

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:09.140
I can share this, uh, things with all of you. So otherwise

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:12.740
I'll give you a code. You can try to create the invoices for

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:18.260
our testing purpose. So here copy

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.680
path, let me check.

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:50.930
Yeah. So I've just pinged you one of the invoice inside your

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:55.390
Jupyter notebook, uh, file invoice sent successfully invoice

00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:59.710
number two. So you can see invoice number two, uh, you can

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:03.410
see invoice number three and you can see invoice number

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:07.110
four. So from your zoom chat, you can download all of these

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:10.970
invoices. Fine. This is just a sample invoice. You can keep

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:14.190
invoice of your choice. Uh, I don't have any kind of a issue

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:16.670
in the same, maybe in a same format or similar kind of a

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:21.610
data. So this is just a invoice. Now this is basically a

00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:24.330
folder invoices folder, which I have created. Now this

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:26.770
folder in a later stage, you can try to replace it with the

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:29.870
S3 bucket. Maybe you can replace it with the Google drive.

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:34.270
That's completely fine. But as of now, so I'm trying to keep

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:37.270
this folder and you can say, this is a lake, which I have

00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:41.410
created. Inside a lake, data will keep on coming, invoices

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:45.050
will keep on coming. And what my system will do. So my

00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:48.690
system will keep on watching this, uh, basically a folder,

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:52.590
this particular location. And in a later stage, if you are

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:55.570
going to configure maybe a S3 location, maybe if you are

00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:58.890
going to configure, uh, like, uh, some blob, Azure blob

00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:01.490
location, or maybe some other location that's completely

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:05.330
fine. But as of now, my system will keep on watching this

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:08.070
particular location. And, uh, whenever. There will be a

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:12.590
invoice, it will start the process as per the flow. So there

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:15.550
will be a watcher watcher agent will keep on watching a

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:19.030
particular location regularly. And when there will be like,

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:23.770
you know, uh, some sort of, uh, like, uh, uh, new invoices.

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:27.310
So obviously I'm going to process it and I will avoid

00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:31.810
duplicates. So I don't want to, you know, process, uh, in,

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:34.810
uh, things, right. I don't want to process, uh, things where

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:37.050
there should be a, or there will be a duplicate. So

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:40.730
basically. I will avoid processing any kind of a duplicate

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:44.130
one. It simply means that, that I'll try to keep a track of

00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:48.370
all the invoices, which I have already processed, right. So

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:51.150
that I will not end up processing the invoices with the same

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:54.610
name at least. So for deduplication, I can do a name

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:57.190
comparison for now in a later stage, maybe you can do a

00:38:57.190 --> 00:39:00.050
exact data comparison as well that that's up to you, but

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:02.750
yeah, that's a simple fundamental logic that we are going to

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:06.890
follow over here. Okay. Now let's start. So like I said. So

00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:09.710
there will be a watcher, watcher will keep on watching a

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:13.290
particular location. So in my case, as of now, this is the

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:15.970
location, this invoice folder is a location, which it will

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:19.990
keep on watching all the time, right. All the time. Okay. So

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:23.950
let's start doing a code now. So this is my Jupiter notebook

00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:28.690
and, uh, here, this is a little bit code heavy system, uh,

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:32.770
but yeah, I thought of, you know, discussing this entire

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:35.570
system with all of you so that you all will be able to get

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:40.210
up. Fair understanding about, uh, you know, something in a

00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:43.210
real time, otherwise, uh, people, you know, people try to

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:46.850
say, or people try to showcase just an example of, uh, maybe

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:50.030
something which is doing a research, which is trying to do

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:54.430
just a search, which is, which is not like, um, you know, in

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:58.550
sync with the real time things. So here, right. So here,

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:03.430
what we can do, so let's try to, uh, one by one, one by one.

00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:07.870
So let's try to perform an operation. But, uh, before going

00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:11.790
ahead with the operation, uh, we need a API key, right? We

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:14.870
need a API key. So without API key, I will not be able to

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:19.430
use our LMS. So to get an API key, maybe I can go to, uh,

00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:24.510
URI and, uh, here. So from a URI API, so I can try to create

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:28.750
the API key. Let me delete all my, uh, previous keys.

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:37.840
Yeah. So create API key and, uh, here, so is my API key.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:41.500
I'll just copy it. And maybe I'll just try to keep it here.

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:44.920
Right. I'll just try to keep it here, uh, because I'm going

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.700
to need it. I'm going to need it so that, uh, you know, I

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:51.740
can try the, I can use the LLMs, uh, for maybe any kind of

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:55.980
our purposes from a URI. Okay. Now, once this is done,

00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:00.540
right, once this is done, then try to do an import of these

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:04.220
libraries, JSON, time, SQLite. So database wise, I'm going

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:07.780
to use a SQLite, uh, basically you can try to use any kind

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:11.580
of a SQL system. You can try to use maybe a MongoDB or any

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:15.240
other databases. I don't have any kind of a problem with any

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:18.120
of these. So it's your wish where you would like to store

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:23.500
the invoice data. Then import typing, dictionary, any list,

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:28.120
import a regex. I'm going to use a easy OCR for doing a OCR

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:31.900
processing, but a easy OCR is not the only library. There

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.320
are other like a 10 different, different library. You all

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:37.480
will be able to find out. So you can use any of those

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:40.720
libraries. That's completely fine. And I will be using a

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:44.280
land graph from the URI itself because inside the URI, there

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:48.140
is a SDK for a land graph, which is already available to me,

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:52.220
uh, which is required to create an object of a land graph.

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:55.500
And then like, you know, create a nodes and then try to,

00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:59.300
we'll, we'll try to process it. So this is the import that

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:03.360
we have to do now after execution. So it will try to install

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:07.740
the IPYNB kernel in between. So maybe you can try to.

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:08.940
Execute this one.

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:17.000
Yeah. Done guys. Till this step. So this is the kind of a

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.200
code heavy system. I'm not going to write a code that's a

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.680
region like line by line, but yeah, you all will be able to

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:23.020
understand just a Python code, right?

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:35.850
Okay. SQLite is technically a in-memory databases. So

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:38.890
basically you don't have, you don't need a MySQL system.

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:42.990
SQLite itself will be able to install. We have already done

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:47.390
the installation and just, we have to use it. Fine. Okay.

00:42:47.490 --> 00:42:53.690
Fine. Now, so once this is done, right, once this is this

00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:57.190
particular things is done, then let's go ahead and let's try

00:42:57.190 --> 00:43:01.290
to create a couple of variable over here. So variable wise,

00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:05.130
so API key API key wise. So just try to keep your API key

00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:09.830
and then model. So GPT 4.0 nano. So let me use this API key

00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:11.210
by the way.

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:19.710
So API key is this and then model. So just keep your own API

00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:24.470
key guys. URI API key, mine will be different and yours will

00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:27.410
be different. So just try to create a variable URI API key

00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:31.190
and then try to keep a model. You can try to keep any of

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:33.970
these model. I don't have any issues. URI provides you a

00:43:33.970 --> 00:43:37.710
multiple model access and any chat completion model is going

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:41.210
to work for me. Fine. So this is something that you have to

00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:46.330
keep. Now once this variable is done, so URI API key and

00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:49.750
this model is done, then what you have to do? So maybe you

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:52.430
can try to create a couple of more variables, couple of more

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:55.270
variables wise input directory. So which directory is the

00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:57.070
input directory? So whatever directory that you have

00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:59.410
created. So I have created invoice directory in my cases.

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:04.730
Just keep it over here. Then database path. So database path

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:09.110
wise. So basically it should create a invoice dot SQLite

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:12.490
databases so that you can go and you can try to query it,

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:16.970
right? You can try to query it. So this is my database like

00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:19.130
which I am going to create. And this is my database. And

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:24.010
then basically I'm going to create a processed log.

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:27.650
Processed log means a kind of a file I'm going to create. So

00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:30.750
which will keep track of all the processed things. So

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:33.750
whatever data which I have already processed, it will keep

00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:38.010
track of all of those things. And then I'm going to create

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:41.030
another variable called as polling second. Polling second

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:44.310
means what? So I'm going to create a watcher. So watcher

00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:48.450
will keep on watching in every five seconds. Right. So it

00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:52.710
will not like do the streaming of the like, you know, kind

00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:56.810
of a feedback from the particular folder, but it will go and

00:44:56.810 --> 00:44:59.730
it will keep on watching after five seconds that okay after

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:02.750
five seconds it will keep on checking. Right. So this is the

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:04.690
polling second. These are just a variable. I have not

00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:06.630
written any kind of a code, but yeah, this is just a

00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:12.710
variable that we need. So create it and leave it fine. And I

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:14.750
believe I have already explained you the meaning of this

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:20.310
entire variable. Now. So. So here, just try to call mkdir

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:23.630
input directory. So if input directory doesn't exist, means

00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:26.570
if invoice directory doesn't exist, it will create one. But

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:30.530
in my cases, I have already created the invoice directory.

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:33.810
So exit okay. True. So if it is already available, it will

00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:37.030
not create it. If it is not available, it will create it as

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:41.930
simple as that. So till this point, is it done for us, for

00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:45.110
every one of us? Yeah. Anyhow, this code will be shared. So

00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:47.770
just try to focus on understanding the entire code part. I

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:51.270
think code is just like a story that we are trying to write

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:54.410
as per the discussion that we have already done over here.

00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:59.210
Right. So code part will not be that difficult. Okay. Now.

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:06.310
Right. So now let's like, like start taking a function. So

00:46:06.310 --> 00:46:08.510
there will be a lot of like a Pythonic function that we are

00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:12.150
going to write it down. One by one, one by one, one by one.

00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:16.030
Like I said, so this is the code heavy system. Little bit of

00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:19.670
code heavy system. Right. So I'm just like going to give you

00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:21.990
the explanation of each and everything, but not at all

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:24.770
difficult to understand. It's literally like very, very easy

00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:25.250
to understand.

00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:45.520
Okay. So here these variables are done. These imports are

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:51.440
like done. Now what we will do. So one by one, one by one,

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:55.760
one by one, we will start creating the function. But before

00:46:55.760 --> 00:47:01.080
that, let's do one thing. So let's talk about a node. As we

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:05.560
are going to create basically a graph, right? So I talked

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:09.640
about a graph. Graph is nothing but node and ages, right?

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:12.840
Graph is nothing but node and ages. So here I have given

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:16.960
node one, node two, node three, kind of a name. But in

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:21.000
reality, so this is the node which I'm going to create. So

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.160
there will be a watcher node, right? So there will be a

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:26.960
function. So which will keep on watching. There will be a

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:30.140
OCR node. There will be a cleaning node. There will be a

00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:33.080
extract node. There will be a validate node. There will be a

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:37.460
persist node and there will be a notify node. So these are

00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:40.620
the separate, separate, separate, separate nodes which I'm

00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:44.560
going to create. And then what I will do. So I will try to

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:48.160
connect these nodes. How I'm going to connect this

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:52.000
particular node. So to connect this particular node, I'm

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.380
going to take a help of this one, ages. So we have a pair,

00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:59.700
right? We have a pair over here. Now how it is going to

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:03.160
work. So we have, let's suppose our watch node, as you can

00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:06.940
see, we have a watch node over here. Now

00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:14.730
yeah. So let's suppose we have a watch node over here, watch

00:48:14.730 --> 00:48:19.870
node now. So we have a OCR node over here, OCR node over

00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:23.550
here. So watch node is connected to a OCR node by this one.

00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:27.330
Yeah. So we are creating a pair. Then we have a OCR node,

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:31.430
OCR node is next connected to a clean node. So OCR node will

00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:35.490
be connected to basically a clean node. Now clean node will

00:48:35.490 --> 00:48:38.710
be connected to an extract node. So let's suppose clean node

00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:42.670
and it will be connected to the extraction node. Now we have

00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:45.230
extract node, extract node will be connected to the validate

00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:48.470
node. So extract node will be connected to the validate node

00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:51.330
and then validate node will be connected to the persist

00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:54.430
node. So validate node will be connected to the persist node

00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:57.770
over here and then persist node will be connected to the

00:48:57.770 --> 00:49:02.130
notify node. Persist node. connected to the notify node. So

00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:05.350
this is how we can try to create the independent nodes or

00:49:05.350 --> 00:49:07.850
you can say an agent we are going to create or function we

00:49:07.850 --> 00:49:10.830
are going to create. And this is how this entire things will

00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:14.250
be connected to each other. As simple as that. Yeah. So this

00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:17.050
entire things will be connected to the each other. Simple.

00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:21.510
Yeah. Simple. It will be connected to each other. So and

00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:26.270
yeah, so every node is going to do its own work. We can even

00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:29.070
try to create a node, something like this, that from one

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:32.250
node it is like doing this task as well as it is doing this

00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:35.870
task from this node. It is going here, going here. So in

00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:39.370
whatever way I want, I can try to configure this entire node

00:49:39.370 --> 00:49:42.670
just with the help of these pairs. Right. So this is

00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:45.810
basically a list of the tuples as you can see we have

00:49:45.810 --> 00:49:50.710
created. So where we are giving these nodes and yes, it by

00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:54.030
land graph system will be able to understand all of these

00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:58.650
things. So these are the technically nodes I'm going to

00:49:58.650 --> 00:50:01.790
create. And then this is how I'm going to connect each and

00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:06.970
every node that I have with me. Okay. Fine. And then every

00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:11.930
node is going to perform its own task. Simple. Yeah. So

00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:14.770
every node. So we are going to run the pipeline and after

00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:17.590
running the pipeline, so every node will be responsible for

00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:22.270
doing its own piece of the task one by one, one by one. Not

00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:26.170
to do that. Obviously. We have to create these nodes. So

00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:28.950
unless and until I'm not going to create these nodes, I will

00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:32.970
not be able to perform any of these operation. Yeah. So I

00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:36.190
have to create these nodes. So technically I have to create

00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:41.210
a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So technically I have to create seven

00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:45.490
different different agents over here. Once my seven agents

00:50:45.490 --> 00:50:49.210
are ready, then I'll call this one. I'll just like, you

00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:52.790
know, define the relationship in between these seven nodes.

00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:56.730
Or you can say a seven agents in a graphical manner and then

00:50:56.730 --> 00:51:01.370
I will run it. I'll try to test it. I'll run the entire

00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:03.990
pipeline. That that's technically something that we have to

00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:09.930
do. Okay. So let's keep it somewhere. Yeah. Let's keep it

00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:12.950
somewhere now. So these are the node that I'm going to

00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:16.290
create now one by one, one by one. So let's start defining

00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:20.390
the, you know, nature of all of these nodes or, you know,

00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:24.190
the work of this. This are processes of this entire node.

00:51:24.370 --> 00:51:27.590
Let's let's try to define that particular part in a first

00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:33.330
place. So here, right. So here we have to create so many

00:51:33.330 --> 00:51:35.730
different, different kinds of functions one by one, one by

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:39.510
one. We'll like try to create it without any kind of

00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:42.920
difficulties. Yeah.

00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:54.480
So first function that I would like to discuss over here is

00:51:54.480 --> 00:52:00.730
something called as load scene function. So this is a, I'll

00:52:00.730 --> 00:52:06.530
keep it everything before this, this one. Okay. So I would

00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:09.570
like to discuss this load scene function. Now what this load

00:52:09.570 --> 00:52:12.510
scene function is trying to do. So load scene function will

00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:17.090
try to check basically that what an all file which has been

00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:20.410
processed. So if there is a file which has been already

00:52:20.410 --> 00:52:23.890
processed, so I will not try to process it. So this is

00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:26.670
something that this load function load scene, so I'm just

00:52:26.670 --> 00:52:30.910
trying to like keep this entire code as a modular. Code as a

00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:33.850
functional code so that you can just change one of these

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:36.770
function and then you can try to work on other function. So

00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:39.390
basically this load scene, so load scene is going to just

00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:43.110
look into the file. So there will be a file it is going to

00:52:43.110 --> 00:52:46.290
create when I'm going to run it called as process log name I

00:52:46.290 --> 00:52:49.510
have already given, right? So process.json, it is going to

00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:52.910
create it over here and whenever it will try to process the

00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:56.790
file, it will keep on saving a file name inside this JSON

00:52:56.790 --> 00:53:00.450
and it can keep on doing the comparison. As of now. It has

00:53:00.450 --> 00:53:03.090
been processed. So it has not created the file. So it says

00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:07.510
that that if not OS dot part exist for a process log process

00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:11.510
log means this one. So if process log doesn't exist in that

00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:15.390
case, return set empty. So return empty set means there is

00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:18.910
like nothing. Otherwise try with the open process log in a

00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:23.470
read mode and then try to read a JSON file. This is what I

00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:25.930
have written over here that try to read the JSON file and

00:53:25.930 --> 00:53:29.290
then whatever data is available, give it to me. What data

00:53:29.290 --> 00:53:32.230
will be available? Obviously a file name inside this

00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:35.210
particular file. So whatever like invoices that we are

00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:38.850
processing invoice one, two, three, four. So file name will

00:53:38.850 --> 00:53:41.330
be available so that I will get to know. So this is nothing

00:53:41.330 --> 00:53:44.710
but it is just trying to show me or just trying to like send

00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:48.430
me all the data which is available inside the process log.

00:53:48.730 --> 00:53:55.170
Okay that's fine. Now so here there is another function

00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:58.510
supporter function that we have over here which is called as

00:53:58.510 --> 00:54:02.170
save scene. So now what the save scene will do by the way.

00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:07.050
So save scene will try to write the current set of processed

00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:11.630
file name simple. So it will try to open up a file as you

00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:14.670
can see with open, open what? Open this file. This file,

00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:18.010
right? Processed JSON file. Just try to open it up and then

00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:21.550
try to perform the write operation and what it is supposed

00:54:21.550 --> 00:54:25.650
to write. So JSON not dump. Just try to write the scene one.

00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:28.470
So whatever like a file that you have opened, just try to

00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:30.670
write the scene one. Okay fine. So this is something that I

00:54:30.670 --> 00:54:34.250
have seen. So write it down inside this particular file

00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:37.190
system. So this is again one of the supporting function that

00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:38.970
I have created. Just a supporting function. These are not

00:54:38.970 --> 00:54:41.370
the, not the agent. We need some sort of a supporting

00:54:41.370 --> 00:54:45.050
functions. I'm just creating that particular part. Okay. Now

00:54:45.050 --> 00:54:51.750
so just try to call this scene things over here. Now once

00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:55.710
this is done, right, once this is done, then we have to

00:54:55.710 --> 00:55:01.310
create a function which will try to create a table, table

00:55:01.310 --> 00:55:05.930
inside my databases so that I will be able to store some of

00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:08.810
the file into the structured format. I can try to use a

00:55:08.810 --> 00:55:12.030
MongoDB. So in that case I don't have to create this schema,

00:55:12.250 --> 00:55:15.170
but yeah, like I said, so I'm going to use a SQL databases.

00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:19.190
So if I have a SQL databases, so obviously I need it. Yeah,

00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:22.510
I need it. So there is a function called as ensure schema.

00:55:22.830 --> 00:55:26.850
Now what it will do, so it will try to call SQL dot correct

00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:30.570
database path. So database path is what? So DB path I have

00:55:30.570 --> 00:55:33.710
already given invoice dot SQLite. So it is going to create

00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:36.470
this database once I'm going to call it as of now, there is

00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:38.970
no database which will be available as you can see, there is

00:55:38.970 --> 00:55:42.050
no such databases called as invoice dot SQLite, but after

00:55:42.050 --> 00:55:44.270
some time you will be able to see it, right? It is going to

00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:48.530
create a database for me and inside that I'm going to get

00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:52.130
the table. So SQLite dot correct DB path instead of using

00:55:52.130 --> 00:55:55.350
the SQLite, you can try to use any MySQL system. I don't

00:55:55.350 --> 00:55:57.610
have any kind of issue. We have already used it in the past.

00:55:57.610 --> 00:56:01.170
Even you can go ahead with the Mongo DB. In that case, you

00:56:01.170 --> 00:56:03.710
don't have to create the schema. As we all know that in case

00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:06.210
of Mongo DB, it's a document based databases. So without

00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:09.030
even creating the schema, you can try to store the data and

00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:11.870
then you can try to query the data. If you would like to

00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:14.650
store into a vector database format, you can go ahead and

00:56:14.650 --> 00:56:17.670
you can do it. I don't have any issue again. So whether it's

00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:20.950
a SQL system, whether it's a no SQL system or whether it's a

00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:25.270
vector system, it works fine for me, right? I just had to

00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:29.010
store my data. Now here, so SQLite, I'm creating a

00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:31.150
connection over here after creating the connection,

00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:34.850
connection dot execute this one. So cursor technically, and

00:56:34.850 --> 00:56:37.610
this is nothing but it is going to create that table. So I'm

00:56:37.610 --> 00:56:40.990
creating a table. So where I'm giving a ID, which will be

00:56:40.990 --> 00:56:43.790
like automatically generated one, then I'm giving a file

00:56:43.790 --> 00:56:46.610
name. File name is nothing but file name of this invoices,

00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:50.430
which I'll try to extract by the way from the data and the

00:56:50.430 --> 00:56:56.390
vendor number, date, tool currency, raw JSON text. So all of

00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:59.930
these, it is, it is going to insert. So this is just a

00:56:59.930 --> 00:57:02.790
schema creation. This is just going to create the table for

00:57:02.790 --> 00:57:06.270
me. And then, so table name is what table name is a invoices

00:57:06.270 --> 00:57:09.430
table, I N V Y C S invoices table. It is going to create,

00:57:09.570 --> 00:57:14.790
and then I will be able to add the data one by one, one by

00:57:14.790 --> 00:57:19.290
one, one by one. Simple, right? Simple. So, okay. Uh, so

00:57:19.290 --> 00:57:22.570
this, uh, is schema creation is done, right? Schema creation

00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:25.370
is done. As you can see. Now it has created the DB. Right?

00:57:25.410 --> 00:57:28.250
This is basically a database invoice dot SQLite. It's a

00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:31.410
database. I can query this database. I can, I can even check

00:57:31.410 --> 00:57:34.730
that, uh, what in all tables are available inside this

00:57:34.730 --> 00:57:38.210
database is maybe with the help of Python or even with the

00:57:38.210 --> 00:57:41.530
help of CMD with the help of CMD. If I have to check this

00:57:41.530 --> 00:57:46.010
database, I can, I can simply, uh, like, uh, uh, copy the

00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:50.890
path and maybe I can try to, you know, uh, open up a command

00:57:50.890 --> 00:57:53.990
prompt. If I'm using windows, uh, if you're using like a

00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:56.570
cell, so you can try to use this. This one, you can just go

00:57:56.570 --> 00:58:05.470
to this path in, in whatever path you have. So I can even

00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:08.930
check and even you can try to use a Python. So let's suppose

00:58:08.930 --> 00:58:13.710
this is the path where my database is. So I can just do a

00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:20.290
CMD, open up this location and then S Q L L I T E three and

00:58:20.290 --> 00:58:23.370
then database name. So my database name is basically invoice

00:58:23.370 --> 00:58:34.650
SQLite. I N V O I C E. Okay. Dot S Q L I T E S Q yeah.

00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:41.530
So as you can see, I'm into this SQLite console and if I

00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:44.350
have to check the table, so the table is available or not, I

00:58:44.350 --> 00:58:48.150
can simply say dot T A B L E S dot tables. So yeah, inside

00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:51.330
this database where I have logged in invoice dot SQLite,

00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:54.450
this table is available, right? Invoices table is available.

00:58:54.590 --> 00:58:57.710
It has already created this table. This is what I have done,

00:58:57.750 --> 00:59:00.970
right? So invoices table, I have already created, as you can

00:59:00.970 --> 00:59:03.310
see right inside, which one inside this particular

00:59:03.310 --> 00:59:07.610
databases. So this is basically a CMD approach, right? CMD

00:59:07.610 --> 00:59:10.470
approach to access any SQLite databases. So go to a

00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:13.490
particular location or give a fully qualified path, your

00:59:13.490 --> 00:59:16.270
wish, and then you can go and you can try to check your

00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:21.050
SQLite. It's a in mobile DB as we all know. Otherwise you

00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:24.330
can go just go ahead and try to use any SQL system or like a

00:59:24.330 --> 00:59:30.430
no SQL system. I'm okay with it. Okay. So here, right, we

00:59:30.430 --> 00:59:33.590
are able to basically create a schema. We are able to create

00:59:33.590 --> 00:59:39.930
the table inside this one. Now this is done. Then next one

00:59:39.930 --> 00:59:45.410
is that we have to define a variable for a easy OCR. So OCR,

00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:48.990
easy OCR dot reader, read always in English, GPU is equal to

00:59:48.990 --> 00:59:52.710
false. So that even without a GPU, it will be able to work.

00:59:52.850 --> 00:59:55.750
So this is just a object I'm trying to create for an OCR.

00:59:56.130 --> 00:59:59.310
Nothing else. Nothing much. Yeah. Nothing much. So object

00:59:59.310 --> 01:00:03.330
creation is done for an OCR. So wherever I have to do a

01:00:03.330 --> 01:00:05.770
optimal character organization, wherever I have to process

01:00:05.770 --> 01:00:09.230
the images, I'll just use this particular object OCR object.

01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:14.430
Okay. This is fine. This is done. Now, uh, I need basically,

01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:20.390
uh, LLMs, right? I need a LLM access by the way. Now to get

01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:24.070
an LLM access, I can use, like I said, so I can use maybe

01:00:24.070 --> 01:00:27.650
some external LLMs or maybe I can use a URI. Okay. So for

01:00:27.650 --> 01:00:30.630
inside a URI, we have already done the import just for the

01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:33.730
land graph. I can directly try to use this land graph, uh,

01:00:34.050 --> 01:00:40.330
for like a former URI itself. Yeah. So basically this is the

01:00:40.330 --> 01:00:43.750
one which is going to help me out in terms of creating a

01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:47.630
land graph object with the help of URI. Yeah. With the help

01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:49.810
of URI, this is something which is going to help me out in

01:00:49.810 --> 01:00:52.930
terms of creating the land graph object. So API key, it's

01:00:52.930 --> 01:00:56.190
coming from above model coming from above variable. You can

01:00:56.190 --> 01:01:00.150
change the model name here. You can change the API key. It

01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:02.590
will work, right? If I would like to use some other model, I

01:01:02.590 --> 01:01:06.950
can, I can go ahead and I can try to use it. So now clean

01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:13.590
graph night, uh, land graph is not installed. Okay. I think

01:01:13.590 --> 01:01:18.370
I have missed installing a land graph. I'll do it now. So

01:01:18.370 --> 01:01:19.550
pip install land graph.

01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:29.460
Yeah. Just do it guys. Just install it. I'll give you the

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:32.100
code. Don't worry. I'll give you the like a code for the

01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:35.120
entire step. First of all, just try to understand. Yeah.

01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:39.700
Okay. So land graph installation is done land graph is not

01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:43.300
installed. Okay. Let me restart the kernel.

01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:58.990
Okay. This import is done. This is done. This is done. Okay.

01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:02.230
Now it looks like after doing a restart of the kernel, uh,

01:02:02.350 --> 01:02:05.870
it's working, right? It's working. So land graph object, I

01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:08.230
will be able to create it with the help of URI itself

01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:11.530
because we have already created that. SDK for this one.

01:02:12.210 --> 01:02:17.430
Okay. Now, so once we are able to create an object of this

01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:21.990
land graph, now we are good to go ahead with a node

01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:26.650
creation. What kind of a node? All of these nodes, right?

01:02:26.730 --> 01:02:29.990
Whatever like, uh, that is going to perform. So now we can

01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:34.470
try to create it. Uh, maybe we can try to create node as an

01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:37.850
agent. Maybe we can try to keep a node as a tool means just

01:02:37.850 --> 01:02:40.470
a simple function. So in either way, it depends upon. The

01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:44.070
need I can just go ahead and I can try to create it. Okay.

01:02:44.310 --> 01:02:48.730
So let me show you, uh, by creating just one of the node. So

01:02:48.730 --> 01:02:52.170
here, what I will do, so I'll just try to like, uh, create

01:02:52.170 --> 01:02:55.530
one node with the help of this, this one clean graph object,

01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:59.910
which I have created. And uh, this is pretty much simple in

01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:04.690
case of land graph, see this object dot add AI node. That's

01:03:04.690 --> 01:03:09.850
it. Right. So like, uh, so this, uh, object clean graph

01:03:09.850 --> 01:03:13.390
object. It means you need a land graph object dot AI node.

01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:17.370
And then instruction we have written over here, right? That

01:03:17.370 --> 01:03:20.450
what is the name of this node? So name of this node is

01:03:20.450 --> 01:03:24.270
technically clean node. And then what you will do, right?

01:03:24.330 --> 01:03:28.110
What you will do. So you clean a noisy OCR to the plain

01:03:28.110 --> 01:03:32.350
text, keep a fact, no guessing, keep table row readable,

01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:35.950
right? And then there will be an OCR text. So anyone who is

01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:39.310
going to pass our OCR text. Okay. So let's suppose if I'm

01:03:39.310 --> 01:03:43.250
using a easy OCR, I'm able to extract those data from the

01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:46.050
easy OCR with the help of easy OCR. So I'm extracting a

01:03:46.050 --> 01:03:51.410
data. Now once I'm able to extract those data, I'm trying to

01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:56.030
pass this entire things to my node, which is having a LLM

01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:59.710
access. So technically I'm passing those data to the LLM so

01:03:59.710 --> 01:04:03.250
that now LLM will be able to process it. And finally LLM

01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:07.910
will be able to, uh, you know, uh, do this task. Okay. So

01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:10.870
this is like a instruction, right? So what is the node name?

01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:13.550
Node name is basically clean the node name I have given. You

01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:15.750
can try to change this name. That's completely okay with me.

01:04:16.070 --> 01:04:19.810
And this is something that it will try to do. And if it is

01:04:19.810 --> 01:04:22.050
giving you some sort of a hallucination, so maybe you can

01:04:22.050 --> 01:04:25.930
try to change this entire writer or instruction, right? So

01:04:25.930 --> 01:04:28.790
this is what this entire thing is do. So basically I'm

01:04:28.790 --> 01:04:32.290
reading the entire data, just an unstructured one, right?

01:04:32.350 --> 01:04:35.590
Just like a raw data. I'm trying to read with the help of

01:04:35.590 --> 01:04:38.770
easy OCR and passing that to them. So this is the node. This

01:04:38.770 --> 01:04:43.510
clean node will try to clean my data set, clean my data set

01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:46.530
means whatever format in which I'm looking for. So it is

01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:50.090
going to create it. So this is one of the node. So clean

01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:53.030
graph entry point is clean. Exit point is clean. So it's an

01:04:53.030 --> 01:04:56.890
independent node, which I'm trying to look for, which I'm

01:04:56.890 --> 01:05:01.790
trying to create. So now I will be having one single node,

01:05:01.950 --> 01:05:06.490
one single node, clean node, right? Clean node. What it will

01:05:06.490 --> 01:05:12.110
do? So it will take input. Input as what? Raw data. Raw data

01:05:12.110 --> 01:05:15.930
from where? So OCR basically extractor. So whatever OCR

01:05:15.930 --> 01:05:19.130
extractor that we have. So it will try to take a raw data

01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:22.230
from there. It will try to send inside the clean node, clean

01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:24.790
the data, format the data as per the instruction which has

01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:29.130
been given. And finally I will be able to get my output. I

01:05:29.130 --> 01:05:32.430
will be able to get my final formatted data because

01:05:32.430 --> 01:05:38.310
obviously LLM can do it. Right? LLM can do it. So this is

01:05:38.310 --> 01:05:41.950
what one of the node looks like. Very easy. Right?

01:05:42.090 --> 01:05:45.550
Technically it's just a one single line of the code. I have

01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:48.430
given the name, I'm giving the instruction. That's it.

01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:54.830
Right? So easy to create a node inside a lang graph

01:05:54.830 --> 01:05:58.550
basically. Right? So in this particular, like a lang graph,

01:05:58.730 --> 01:06:02.790
it's very, very easy to create a node at the end of the day.

01:06:02.790 --> 01:06:06.030
Plus you can, you can just try to call and you can try to

01:06:06.030 --> 01:06:09.870
like a, you know, like a check lot of things with respect to

01:06:09.870 --> 01:06:12.750
this particular node. Everything is given you as a function

01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:17.270
in case of a lang graph. Okay. So this is one of the node.

01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:22.850
Now I'm going to create a second node over here. Yep. I'm

01:06:22.850 --> 01:06:27.030
going to create a second node over here. Let me create a

01:06:27.030 --> 01:06:31.230
second node. Now what the second node will do. So see. To

01:06:31.230 --> 01:06:34.650
create a second node again, you can use like a same object

01:06:34.650 --> 01:06:38.130
or I have just like created a different object. And if you

01:06:38.130 --> 01:06:41.970
would like to use a different model for this node, you can

01:06:41.970 --> 01:06:44.390
do that as well. That's the reason I have kept it separate

01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:46.730
because there are many people who will end up asking a

01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:50.210
question that can we try to use a different, different AI

01:06:50.210 --> 01:06:53.690
model? Because let's suppose some model, some node, right?

01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:57.270
Some node is trying to do a chat completion. Some node is

01:06:57.270 --> 01:07:01.050
will try to hit a AI model. Ah. Some node will try to

01:07:01.050 --> 01:07:04.010
generate the images. Some node will try to hit the AI model,

01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:07.830
which will try to generate the embeddings or maybe, maybe

01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:10.130
text to speech or a speech to text, something like that,

01:07:10.170 --> 01:07:14.710
right? So basically every node inside a graph is an

01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:18.870
independent process. You can try to define its own model.

01:07:19.110 --> 01:07:22.630
It's just up to you, right? It's just up to you. Or maybe

01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:25.590
you can try to use a shared object variable, which you can

01:07:25.590 --> 01:07:28.090
use for all the nodes. So here I have just created a

01:07:28.090 --> 01:07:31.150
separate independent object itself. You can try to give a

01:07:31.150 --> 01:07:33.510
different model name. You can try to use a different model,

01:07:33.590 --> 01:07:39.510
excuse me, if you want, right? If you want, you can try to

01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:42.090
use a different model. That's like a completely up to you.

01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:44.990
Now what this node is trying to do. So again, process

01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:47.890
simple. I have given the name. So name of this node is going

01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:52.190
to be extract what it will extract this much, right? So I

01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:55.250
have given a complete clear instruction that from a clean

01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:58.510
text, so let's suppose you are able to receive a clean data

01:07:58.510 --> 01:08:02.270
from this one. This particular node. So from a clean text,

01:08:02.370 --> 01:08:06.150
return a strict JSON with the key exactly like a vendor

01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:11.330
number date, total currency line item, unknown clean text,

01:08:11.490 --> 01:08:14.590
right? So I'm saying that that, okay, from the clean text

01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:17.830
means whatever data, which I will be giving you, right? So

01:08:17.830 --> 01:08:20.530
I'm going to do a mapping of this node. So this mode mapping

01:08:20.530 --> 01:08:23.690
with this node. So after cleaning a data, it will go here

01:08:23.690 --> 01:08:28.670
and it will try to like do the complete formatting of the

01:08:28.670 --> 01:08:32.550
data. Because I have to store this data into a sequel

01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:35.350
system, a sequel light. So obviously I need a proper

01:08:35.350 --> 01:08:38.830
formatting so that I will be able to parse it. If I have to

01:08:38.830 --> 01:08:42.330
store the same data maybe into a Mongo DV, I would not have

01:08:42.330 --> 01:08:45.750
even thought about the extraction or the formatting of the

01:08:45.750 --> 01:08:49.330
data because in Mongo DV I can just store it in a document

01:08:49.330 --> 01:08:52.910
format. But when I have to store the data into a sequel

01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:56.350
system and again, I don't have to do any kind of a work,

01:08:56.410 --> 01:08:59.950
right? My elements are there. I have just given a

01:08:59.950 --> 01:09:03.170
instruction in a plain English text. So I just have to write

01:09:03.170 --> 01:09:06.630
the English basically over here, right? English lines over

01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:11.610
here and everything will be done by whom? By LLMs, right? By

01:09:11.610 --> 01:09:14.990
LLMs. So whatever model I'm going to select. So again, I'm

01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:17.790
not writing any logic. As you can see, there is no logic

01:09:17.790 --> 01:09:20.970
over here. It's just a plain, simple English. And with the

01:09:20.970 --> 01:09:24.450
help of plain, simple English, it is, it is, it is going to

01:09:24.450 --> 01:09:28.190
work for me. So fine. This is another node. Extract node,

01:09:28.410 --> 01:09:32.590
which we have created. So clean node is done. Then we are

01:09:32.590 --> 01:09:35.890
able to create another, like a node called a stack node. We

01:09:35.890 --> 01:09:39.310
have not attached it yet. Yeah. We have not attached it yet.

01:09:39.450 --> 01:09:43.150
So it's just a, uh, like, you know, an independent node that

01:09:43.150 --> 01:09:50.370
we have created over here. As simple as that. Yeah. Uh,

01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:54.910
still this point, fine guys, everyone, any advantage of

01:09:54.910 --> 01:09:58.230
using SQLite over a no SQLite, vector DL? DB. It's just a in

01:09:58.230 --> 01:10:02.150
memory. You don't have to go for the setup like quickly. You

01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:07.470
can use it apart from that, like it's just a use case use

01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:14.510
case wise. Okay. Now, uh, so this is done to node where we

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:18.250
are like, uh, able to create it over here. Now we'll have to

01:10:18.250 --> 01:10:21.810
create a different, different, different, different kind of

01:10:21.810 --> 01:10:24.790
a node, right? We have to create a different, different kind

01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:28.510
of a node. And, uh, this, these nodes basically, technically

01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:31.570
we have to create like these nodes. We have created a

01:10:31.570 --> 01:10:34.910
basically, uh, extraction node. We have created a, uh, clean

01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:39.510
node, which is using, uh, LLM by the way, we can try to use,

01:10:39.650 --> 01:10:43.830
uh, like, uh, other nodes as well, a node, which will try to

01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:48.510
execute the OCR, the node, which will try to watch, uh, all,

01:10:48.610 --> 01:10:52.190
all such kind of a nodes. We can keep on creating it. Uh.

01:10:52.190 --> 01:10:56.910
But to create those nodes, I need some helper function just

01:10:56.910 --> 01:11:00.110
to make this entire code perfect. So I have implemented

01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:04.570
those helper function so that that will, this will like a

01:11:04.570 --> 01:11:11.210
look real by the way. So this is one of the function. So

01:11:11.210 --> 01:11:15.650
here, uh, basically this function pick text, what, what it

01:11:15.650 --> 01:11:18.350
does. So it will try to take input as a plain string, uh,

01:11:18.650 --> 01:11:22.890
and then it is going to return you, uh, basically like, uh,

01:11:23.090 --> 01:11:26.330
it is, it is going to return you as a final string after

01:11:26.330 --> 01:11:29.190
doing some sort of a processing in between. So this is what

01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:33.090
it is going to. So basically it is trying to check that if

01:11:33.090 --> 01:11:36.850
it is an instance of X means if it is like this data, then

01:11:36.850 --> 01:11:40.210
return that one. If not, then just try to do a filtration

01:11:40.210 --> 01:11:44.110
and then try to return. So this is one of the supporting

01:11:44.110 --> 01:11:47.370
function which has been implemented. It was required for my

01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:50.250
data set, the data set, which I'm trying to process. Then

01:11:50.250 --> 01:11:53.610
there is something called as JSON. So basically it will try

01:11:53.610 --> 01:11:56.830
to take the JSON and then it will try to like a check that

01:11:56.830 --> 01:12:00.390
whether it's a, uh, like a kind of a JSON, which I was

01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:04.330
looking for. If it is yes, then return it. If not, then

01:12:04.330 --> 01:12:08.190
parse it. So this is again a, another like a function that

01:12:08.190 --> 01:12:13.390
we have used over here. And there is something I have

01:12:13.390 --> 01:12:15.790
implemented. So I was getting some sort of a error. So

01:12:15.790 --> 01:12:18.470
because of that, I have done the implementation of

01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:21.390
heuristic. This one, this is just a private. You can say a

01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:24.230
function which has been implemented. So this is nothing but

01:12:24.230 --> 01:12:28.850
a fallback function I have created. So if network is going

01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:32.650
to fail, means if it is hitting my URI API and my URI API is

01:12:32.650 --> 01:12:36.810
not available in that case, what to do, right? In that case,

01:12:36.910 --> 01:12:39.710
what to do? So this is just a, as you can see, it's a

01:12:39.710 --> 01:12:42.810
private function or you can say a protected function which I

01:12:42.810 --> 01:12:46.390
have created again, just as a fallback function. I have

01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:48.510
created, these are just a supporter function guys, these are

01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:50.950
just a supporter function. So that my code should not crack

01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:56.270
in between. Nothing related to agents or like a graph that

01:12:56.270 --> 01:12:58.370
we are trying to create a line graph that we are trying to

01:12:58.370 --> 01:13:01.070
understand. It's just related to this particular use cases.

01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:04.650
I was getting some error. So I have just implemented it just

01:13:04.650 --> 01:13:07.590
to like do a double check. Okay. So these are just a helper

01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:11.370
function. Now let's go ahead and back to back, do one thing,

01:13:11.450 --> 01:13:15.110
create this nodes, this entire nodes one by one, one by one

01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:20.190
or create this nodes. Yeah. This nodes. So clean node, we

01:13:20.190 --> 01:13:23.290
have already created extract node. We have already created.

01:13:23.410 --> 01:13:26.670
So these two nodes are done. Yeah. These two nodes are done.

01:13:27.250 --> 01:13:31.290
Let's create a OCR node. What OCR node will do? Nothing.

01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:34.410
It's just a function. OCR node is what? OCR node is

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:37.810
technically a function. So it will try to read a data,

01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:41.410
right? It will try to read a data and then it will try to

01:13:41.410 --> 01:13:44.710
perform the OCR. So OCR object we have already created. If

01:13:44.710 --> 01:13:48.990
you remember above, it was basically an OCR object. Which

01:13:48.990 --> 01:13:52.290
has been created easy OCR dot reader, right? So easy OCR

01:13:52.290 --> 01:13:54.830
object is already created. So what I will do and what this

01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:59.050
node will do. So this node OCR dot read text from the file

01:13:59.050 --> 01:14:02.350
path. So whatever file path will be provided to this node,

01:14:02.530 --> 01:14:06.070
right? To this OCR node, whatever file path will be

01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:10.410
provided. It will just read it, perform the OCR and then

01:14:10.410 --> 01:14:14.910
send you the final data. So whatever OCR it is going to,

01:14:14.930 --> 01:14:17.830
whatever data it is going to extract, it is going to return

01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:21.190
that data. So this is just a small node which will do the

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:25.010
OCR operation for me. So OCR node is done. Clean node I have

01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:28.770
already created. Extract node I have already created. So

01:14:28.770 --> 01:14:34.450
these three nodes has been done. Now what is next? So it's

01:14:34.450 --> 01:14:42.750
time to call the clean node with the fallback. So here clean

01:14:42.750 --> 01:14:46.490
node, I'm just trying to call it with the fallback. So here

01:14:46.490 --> 01:14:51.890
what it will do? So it will try to call a clean graph and

01:14:51.890 --> 01:14:56.490
then call run and it will try to call the OCR text means it

01:14:56.490 --> 01:14:59.870
is going to send all the OCR text over there and then what

01:14:59.870 --> 01:15:05.450
it will do? So it will try to again like pick the text. So

01:15:05.450 --> 01:15:08.390
this is again my supporter function which I have created. So

01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:10.850
it is going to pick the text and then after picking up the

01:15:10.850 --> 01:15:13.710
text, it will try to do the cleaning as per the instruction

01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:16.830
which I have given inside the pick text and finally it is

01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:19.890
going to return it. So this is again like cleaning node I

01:15:19.890 --> 01:15:22.250
have created with all the exception handling. Again I was

01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:24.450
getting a lot of issues with respect to this cleaning. So

01:15:24.450 --> 01:15:28.450
like I have handled some of the exceptions over here. That

01:15:28.450 --> 01:15:31.010
was the only reason behind like making this code little bit

01:15:31.010 --> 01:15:35.590
lengthy. Otherwise this code is not that lengthy. Now so for

01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:38.170
cleaning we have created this node again for the extraction.

01:15:38.410 --> 01:15:42.390
So there is like again we are going to check with respect to

01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:45.730
the pick text and then we are trying to return the raw JSON.

01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:49.790
So this is what extract will do. Now once this is done,

01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:53.990
cleaning and extraction is done, then we have written a

01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:57.670
validation node. Now what validation node will do? So it

01:15:57.670 --> 01:16:01.690
will try to validate all the entities, the data that we are

01:16:01.690 --> 01:16:04.910
receiving. The data that we are receiving so it is just try

01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:08.590
to validate. So it is going to validate a vendor, a number,

01:16:08.910 --> 01:16:14.310
a date, a currency. So if this data set is available or not.

01:16:14.490 --> 01:16:17.770
So we are just trying to check is available or not. Apart

01:16:17.770 --> 01:16:20.690
from that we are not checking anything else, right. Anything

01:16:20.690 --> 01:16:23.930
else. Maybe you can write a more validation. So maybe data

01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:26.230
type validation or any other kind of validation if you want

01:16:26.230 --> 01:16:28.390
you can write it down. But as of now it is just trying to

01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:32.250
check that whether data is available or not. So this is

01:16:32.250 --> 01:16:35.510
basically a validation node that we are able to create. So

01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:38.990
validate is done, OCR is done, clean is done, extract is

01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:41.670
done, validate is done. Validate is just validating if it is

01:16:41.670 --> 01:16:45.250
null or not. If it is null then do this otherwise don't do

01:16:45.250 --> 01:16:51.330
this. Okay. Now so once this part is done, right, once this

01:16:51.330 --> 01:16:56.130
part is done then we have a node persist. So let's try to

01:16:56.130 --> 01:17:01.450
create a persist node over here. Now so what this persist

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:05.650
node will do obviously this is going to check that whether I

01:17:05.650 --> 01:17:09.350
have already processed this data or not. If I have already

01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:12.210
processed this data then do this otherwise don't do this

01:17:12.210 --> 01:17:15.830
kind of a thing, right. So and it is going to persist. This

01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:19.370
is the final data. So persist means what? So persist will

01:17:19.370 --> 01:17:22.350
try to persist the or store the data. So here I am just

01:17:22.350 --> 01:17:26.350
trying to call sqli.connect and then cursor db execute and

01:17:26.350 --> 01:17:29.390
insert. So here as you can see we are inserting the actual

01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:33.610
data set, persisting something into the SQL databases. So

01:17:33.610 --> 01:17:36.870
find persist node is done which is going to store the data.

01:17:37.190 --> 01:17:41.030
As of now just try to understand this as a story, right. And

01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:46.010
then what you have to do? So then you have to basically

01:17:46.010 --> 01:17:51.350
create a notify. So it is going to send me a notification.

01:17:51.510 --> 01:17:54.870
So as of now I am like going to get the notification into my

01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:58.330
console. So I am just doing a print over there but in real

01:17:58.330 --> 01:18:01.870
time you just have to remove this print and replace this

01:18:01.870 --> 01:18:05.130
print with a log maybe or maybe with the mail notification.

01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:07.970
So I think we already know how to attach a mail notification

01:18:07.970 --> 01:18:11.530
system. We have already attached it in my past. So maybe you

01:18:11.530 --> 01:18:13.890
can try to attach a mail notification system. You can attach

01:18:13.890 --> 01:18:16.010
a whatsapp notification system. Anything that you want,

01:18:16.150 --> 01:18:18.510
right. You can try to attach it over here. That is up to

01:18:18.510 --> 01:18:21.190
you. As of now notification wise I am just sending you

01:18:21.190 --> 01:18:23.890
notification in a print. Means console you will be able to

01:18:23.890 --> 01:18:27.590
see something. So okay this notify function is done. Means

01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:33.410
technically this node is created for me. So this node

01:18:33.410 --> 01:18:37.030
notify. So persist it will store notify. It will try to

01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:42.150
notify like it will try to like notify it to me. Okay. So

01:18:42.150 --> 01:18:48.350
this is done right. Once this part is done then this part

01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:51.650
will come into a picture because now all the nodes are

01:18:51.650 --> 01:18:55.470
created. Yeah. All the nodes are technically created for me.

01:18:55.650 --> 01:19:00.490
Now once all of these nodes are created for me, right. Once

01:19:00.490 --> 01:19:04.390
all of these nodes are created for me, now it's time to run

01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:07.650
the pipeline. Means attach each and everything together and

01:19:07.650 --> 01:19:12.190
then run the final pipeline for this. Okay. So this is

01:19:12.190 --> 01:19:15.310
basically our entire like processes that we are talking

01:19:15.310 --> 01:19:19.910
about. So if we have to run the pipeline I can simply okay

01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:23.970
let me remove this part. Yeah. So this is basically run the

01:19:23.970 --> 01:19:26.350
pipeline function. Now this is the main function right where

01:19:26.350 --> 01:19:28.490
we are aggregating everything. Whatever we have written

01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:32.570
above we are like trying to use everything over here. So

01:19:32.570 --> 01:19:35.350
what we are trying to call first of all, first of all we are

01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:39.590
calling a OCR node. Then we are calling a cleanup node. Then

01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:43.930
we are calling a extraction node. Right. Then once it will

01:19:43.930 --> 01:19:46.890
be able to give me the extraction. So we are trying to parse

01:19:46.890 --> 01:19:50.930
in a JSON format. We are trying to do a validation. Then we

01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:53.630
are calling a persist node and then we are trying to call

01:19:53.630 --> 01:19:58.950
the notify node over here so that it will be able to run

01:19:58.950 --> 01:20:03.510
this entire pipeline one by one, one by one, one by one.

01:20:03.790 --> 01:20:06.510
Automatically it will try to run it. Yeah. Automatically it

01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:09.930
will try to run this entire pipeline. Okay.

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:16.260
A watch node. I'll talk about it. Just just wait. Right. So

01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:18.520
just wait. I'll show you how we are like, you know,

01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:22.300
implementing a watch node by the way over here. So here this

01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:25.360
is just a run the pipeline, not a watching one by the way.

01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:30.260
Yeah. So we are running the pipeline means after this watch.

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:34.400
So we are running the entire pipeline. Yeah. Running the

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:36.680
entire pipeline. This is what this function will do. And

01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:39.260
this is the main function. Right. It will call OCR. It will

01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:42.780
call clean. It will call extract. It will call like a JSON

01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:46.460
safe output, node validation, node process notify each and

01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:49.520
everything one by one, one by one, one by one. It will keep

01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:52.980
on calling and it will, it will try to run it. Okay. Fine.

01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:57.080
Now this is just a independent function I have created. Now

01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:01.500
the main job will start basically, right? Main job will

01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:05.680
start. So here we have to run this entire system infinitely,

01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:09.400
right? My system should be up and running for the infinite

01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:14.140
time. And it should keep on watching this particular folder

01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:17.080
location. Yeah. This particular folder location. It should

01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:20.260
keep on watching because as of now, these files are

01:21:20.260 --> 01:21:23.420
available. That's completely okay. But whenever there will

01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:27.280
be a new file automatically, it should pick that file and

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:31.620
then it should store the data into my SQL databases after

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:35.300
doing all of these operation, right? Maybe LLM based

01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:38.520
operation I'm trying to do. Maybe just a OCR based operation

01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:41.760
I'm trying to do. Right. Which I have written over here,

01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:45.460
what it should do. So it should be able to like call this

01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:48.460
entire things and automatically it should be able to process

01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:53.540
this entire node, right? So the function which I'm, which I

01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:55.980
have created and which I'm calling it as a node. So it

01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:58.720
should be able to process each and everything one by one,

01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:02.760
one by one, one by one. Okay. That's cool. Let's do it then.

01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:07.160
Yeah, let's do it. So basically what we can do, we can try

01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:12.220
to call our final user. So we can call this unit while true

01:22:12.220 --> 01:22:14.480
and we all know that while true will run in an infinite

01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:18.240
loop, right? So while true will always try to run in an

01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:22.120
infinite loop and what we are trying to do, so we are trying

01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:25.680
to call our input directory. What is our input directory?

01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:28.680
This invoice directory we are trying to call, right? This is

01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:31.480
my input directory. I'm trying to call over here and we are

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:34.840
trying to check that if file name is available in a dot PNG

01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:41.600
format, JPG format or JPEG format. Right. Continue. Fine. If

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:46.360
file name in scene, scene means, so if you remember in a

01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:49.540
beginning we have written a function, right? We have written

01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:55.320
basically a function. Now if file name is available inside a

01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:58.380
scene, if scene is saying that, okay, this file name is

01:22:58.380 --> 01:23:01.380
available, means there will be a file which will be created

01:23:01.380 --> 01:23:04.400
over here as per the scene function process dot JSON file,

01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:09.380
which will be created now, right? So if it is already inside

01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:13.040
a scene. Then again, continue, continue means start from the

01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:17.420
beginning, fine? Start from the beginning. So if file is not

01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:20.640
available in this format, again, continue. If file is

01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:23.580
already in scene, again, continue means start again, right?

01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:26.640
Because that file is not either not available or file is

01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:30.700
already seen. Otherwise what you have to do, right?

01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:34.400
Otherwise call the run pipeline. So this is how it will

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:37.360
watch. It's a very simple watcher that we have created. We

01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:40.880
are running something in an infinite loop, right? And we are

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:43.800
doing a polling by the way, right? So here I'm trying to

01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:47.400
call time dot sleep polling sec. So basically it system will

01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:49.800
sleep for five seconds and then it will wake up once again

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:52.220
after five seconds. Then again, we'll go and check. Then

01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:55.320
again, we'll go and check. So technically it is calling this

01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:57.680
run pipeline for a file. The function that I have already

01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:00.980
created, which is calling the node, yeah, which is calling

01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:04.420
technically a node one by one, one by one. It is technically

01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:08.000
trying to call the node. Now some nodes are basically an LM

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:13.080
based node. Some nodes are basically a OCR based node or

01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:15.320
maybe just a simple normal function, which I have created

01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:18.240
over there. Nothing, nothing more than that. Yeah, nothing

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:22.720
more than that over here. So this is going to run the

01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:26.160
pipeline and it will keep on watching it if everything goes

01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:29.860
well. And finally it will be able to process the data and

01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:33.260
we'll be able to store the data into my database. Let's run

01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:38.680
it and let's see. Yeah. So. It looks like that. It is able

01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:42.140
to pick invoice number one, as you can see, it is able to

01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:46.580
pick my invoice number one, uh, completed things, inserted

01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:51.100
row in ID one, then it is able to pick invoice number two.

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:54.380
Uh, then it is able to pick my invoice number three, as you

01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:59.040
can see, uh, completed, um, now it looks like that. Yeah, it

01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:02.140
is able to pick invoice number three over here. It is able

01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:05.340
to pick invoice number five. Invoice number four was not

01:25:05.340 --> 01:25:08.640
available, I believe inside my invoice system. Right. And

01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:11.680
these are the data which it is able to extract. And I think,

01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:16.280
uh, inserted into a ID, row ID. So inserted into a databases

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:19.740
and it's still, this process is running, right? Still this

01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:21.900
process is running as you can see, right? It's still, this

01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:24.840
process is running. So what I will do, I'll just go to my

01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:27.940
database. I'll just go to my database. I'll try to check

01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:31.060
that whether I have a data or not. So select a star from,

01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:34.820
uh, what was my table name? So I believe my table name was,

01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:43.700
uh, this one. Invoices. Right. So yeah,

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:47.040
it looks like that when I have written select a star from

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:51.320
invoices. So this is one data, two data, three data and four

01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:55.040
data. So data is available, right? So it is, it is able to

01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:59.320
process the invoice and invoice number, a date, which was

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:02.060
available inside the invoice, a total like, you know,

01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:05.540
invoice value, uh, which currency, which was available a

01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:08.020
line item. So all of these things, it is able to process,

01:26:08.140 --> 01:26:10.960
right? I can. I can even go and I can try to cross check

01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:13.580
that. Okay. So whether I'm able to process this invoice or

01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:16.860
not, it looks like I'm able to process it. Right. And it's

01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:19.000
still, this system is running, right? This system is

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.520
running, uh, like after five seconds, we'll keep on checking

01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:27.280
my folder. Yeah. Folder. So just for the testing purpose,

01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:31.860
just for the testing purpose, uh, let's do one thing. Let's

01:26:31.860 --> 01:26:39.720
create a one file called as invoice generator.ipy2. Yeah.

01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:42.940
Invoice generator. So just for the testing purpose, this

01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:46.140
one, uh, so I have already created a invoice generator,

01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:49.920
basically a Python code. What it will do, it will generate

01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:52.600
the invoice simple, right? It will not do anything

01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:55.440
different. It will just try to generate the invoice as many

01:26:55.440 --> 01:27:00.380
as you want. So let me give like a ratio over here. So start

01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:02.860
generating an invoice from invoice number six to invoice

01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:05.360
number 10. As of now, we have one, two, three, four, five

01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:08.360
invoice. Now this is just a invoice generator, right? I have

01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:12.460
already given the instruction. Now execute it. See now I

01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:15.980
have more invoices, right? Now see it will start processing.

01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:19.540
So now it has like, because it's, it's running, right? It's

01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:23.920
running into a infinite loop and it will keep on like, uh,

01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:26.780
you know, processing the invoice automatically as soon as

01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:30.160
it. So I have created something like this kind of an agent,

01:27:30.260 --> 01:27:33.140
right? This kind of a graph I have created a different,

01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:36.280
different node I have created and this is running for the

01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:39.400
infinite time, right? It will keep on watching a particular,

01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:42.920
like a folder. And whenever there will be a data, it will

01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:46.360
try to process it and it will always avoid. See I told you,

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:48.900
right? There will be a process.json it is going to create.

01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:51.540
So it is trying to keep track of all the files. So this file

01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:53.000
I have already processed. This file I have already

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.180
processed. This file I have already processed. So that it

01:27:55.180 --> 01:27:57.740
will be able to check on a seek that, okay, this file is

01:27:57.740 --> 01:28:01.100
already available. So let's not process this file so that it

01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:04.380
will try to avoid like processing a duplicate file with the

01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:07.180
file name. As of now, validation check is only file name.

01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:10.300
Maybe you can try to put some different kind of a validation

01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:13.580
check. And now if I'll go and check my database, so yeah,

01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:17.440
like a data must be available. So see invoice till invoice

01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:21.480
eight data is available, right? Data is available. Whatever

01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:24.620
information was available inside the invoices, it's now

01:28:24.620 --> 01:28:28.240
available into my data basis. Now same data. I can send it

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:31.280
anywhere. Right? I can, I can just store it anywhere. Uh,

01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:35.920
but yeah, I'm able to, uh, see the data set and my system is

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:43.280
up and running. So this is the whole, uh, system, everyone

01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:48.620
that kind of a system we are able to create, uh, where it's

01:28:48.620 --> 01:28:52.400
doing OCR, it's running in a real time. It's continuously

01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:55.540
running. It's continuously watching right where we have used

01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:58.940
a land graph node component. As of now, there is something

01:28:58.940 --> 01:29:02.260
called as land graph run component as well. So where you

01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:05.080
don't have to call in this way. So maybe you can just call

01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:07.400
land graph run and it will run the entire pipeline. So, but

01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:10.140
here I have just created my custom one. I'll show you that

01:29:10.140 --> 01:29:12.800
part as well. Yeah, I'll show you that part as well. So land

01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:16.620
graph run count component where graph will run itself. We

01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:19.380
can even print those graphs like with the help of maybe a

01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:22.220
graph or some other libraries, we can try to print it. But

01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:27.560
uh, yeah, successfully we are able to, uh, complete one use

01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:31.360
cases, right? And still it's running. I'll go, I'll create

01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:36.400
maybe like a, uh, more invoices this time. Maybe like 11

01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:42.600
till. Uh, 50 and uh, yeah, it will create a invoice and my

01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:46.200
system will process it. So now I have so many invoices as

01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:50.420
you can see, right? 50 invoices kind of, and a system is

01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:52.500
processing those invoices automatically.

01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:59.580
Yeah. So it's working, right? It's working. It's like a

01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:03.100
processing those invoices one by one, one by one, one by

01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:07.320
one. So it's kind of an agent which will like, uh, you know,

01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:13.960
keep on, uh, watching things. In the same way, we can

01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:17.480
extract the PDF table info by using OCR techniques. Yeah.

01:30:17.660 --> 01:30:20.440
OCR is an independent one, right? Wherever you have like a

01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:25.080
image format, you can use OCR wherever you have a PDF,

01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:28.980
right? Again. So when we talk about PDF, right? So there are

01:30:28.980 --> 01:30:32.220
different kinds of a PDF which exist, a PDF where you can

01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:36.020
try to scrap the data, a PDF where inside a PDF there is an

01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:40.060
image, uh, in that case a PI PDF kind of a reader. A reader

01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:42.200
will not be able to read those data. So what do you have to

01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:43.920
do? You have to extract as an image. Then you have to

01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:47.800
perform the OCR on top of that. OCR is technically been used

01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:51.540
for like a images, whatever data is available in an image

01:30:51.540 --> 01:30:54.740
format which you can't copy, paste, drag and drop. So in

01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:59.600
that case, call OCR. Will it process handwritten invoice

01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:03.140
also? Yes, it will be able to process handwritten invoice

01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:06.460
also. Easy OCR is having that capability. So even if you

01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:09.640
have some handwritten OCR, it will be able to do it.

01:31:15.810 --> 01:31:19.770
Yeah. So this is one of the, so I was just trying to show

01:31:19.770 --> 01:31:24.050
you this use cases so that, you know, uh, uh, we, we all

01:31:24.050 --> 01:31:27.650
will be able to get some sort of a flavor with respect to a

01:31:27.650 --> 01:31:31.450
reality and we can, you know, try to, uh, mention it, uh,

01:31:31.490 --> 01:31:34.950
mention it inside our like a resume. We can, we can try to

01:31:34.950 --> 01:31:38.230
expand it for like till any extent, right? Till any extent.

01:31:38.290 --> 01:31:42.550
And in every node that I'm talking about in every node, so

01:31:42.550 --> 01:31:45.250
like I said, guys, uh, I'll even show you. So here I'm

01:31:45.250 --> 01:31:47.170
calling a simple plane function, right? I'm attaching

01:31:47.170 --> 01:31:50.990
everything in a sequence. I can even run this entire node

01:31:50.990 --> 01:31:53.710
directly with the help of land graph APIs. That is also

01:31:53.710 --> 01:31:56.470
possible, right? That is also possible because connection I

01:31:56.470 --> 01:31:58.910
have already done, right? So it will like call this agent,

01:31:59.010 --> 01:32:02.130
that agent, and we'll keep on running. It will be more like

01:32:02.130 --> 01:32:05.690
this call itself. So I have just shown you this part. Okay.

01:32:06.810 --> 01:32:10.690
So, uh, in every node, there is a lot that can be done in

01:32:10.690 --> 01:32:13.990
every node that I have created. Literally lot means lot can

01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:16.590
be done because every node comes with its own problem.

01:32:17.170 --> 01:32:19.610
Right? And then you have to like, uh, you know, solve those,

01:32:19.690 --> 01:32:24.370
uh, problems. So we can, we can like, uh, do it. Okay. Let

01:32:24.370 --> 01:32:27.770
me stop this run. So see, since last seven minutes it's

01:32:27.770 --> 01:32:31.190
running and it will keep on running up and running like for

01:32:31.190 --> 01:32:34.970
the infinite time, by the way. Now let me do one thing. Let

01:32:34.970 --> 01:32:38.070
me share first of all, this entire code base with all of you

01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:45.460
so that now all of you can execute it. So let me bundle it

01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:51.560
up. Compress to a zip file. Yeah. So even invoices are

01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:54.220
available. My environments is also available, so you don't

01:32:54.220 --> 01:32:56.960
have to do any kind of a setup with respect to environment.

01:32:57.180 --> 01:32:59.480
Just activate my environment. It will work.

01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:07.800
It's a big one because of environment guys, because I

01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:10.280
believe most of the spaces has been taken by environment

01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:13.400
itself. This, this fold, these folders, you

01:33:17.050 --> 01:33:19.130
can remove your key. I'll delete my key.

01:33:28.650 --> 01:33:31.170
How to handle use of anything. I'll show you that part.

01:33:31.290 --> 01:33:35.850
Anything also I'll show you. Don't worry. Just sit tight. So

01:33:35.850 --> 01:33:37.870
many examples we are going to, we are just getting started

01:33:37.870 --> 01:33:42.350
with agent TKI guys. So I think I'll show you so many real

01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:46.150
time example. Even I was working on one of the example, uh,

01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:50.590
for my own use cases. So where, you know, uh, uh, social

01:33:50.590 --> 01:33:54.690
media content creators, scheduler, uh, analyzer basically

01:33:54.690 --> 01:33:58.330
and content posting. So basically what I was trying to

01:33:58.330 --> 01:34:00.190
create is that, that, uh, let's suppose there is an

01:34:00.190 --> 01:34:03.890
Instagram, Twitter or something. Right. So it will, uh, go,

01:34:04.110 --> 01:34:06.810
it will try to understand my account to basically, it will

01:34:06.810 --> 01:34:11.330
try to understand my user. And then based on that, and plus

01:34:11.330 --> 01:34:14.730
it will try to understand a latest trend into a market. So

01:34:14.730 --> 01:34:18.550
based on that, it will try to create the content content in

01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:21.470
terms of a write-ups in terms of a motivational content, in

01:34:21.470 --> 01:34:24.310
terms of a tech content, it will try to create, or maybe

01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:27.750
images and posted, it will try to create carousel and then

01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:32.650
it will try to check that. What is the best suitable time

01:34:32.650 --> 01:34:38.470
for my, uh, user or for my account to post it? Because every

01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:41.510
account will be having a different, different, like a

01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:44.570
suitable, you know, a reachability right time, a schedule.

01:34:44.770 --> 01:34:48.690
So it will go and it will like, uh, try to check it. And

01:34:48.690 --> 01:34:51.750
then after checking it right after like checking these

01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:55.130
things, uh, what it will do, it will post a content

01:34:55.130 --> 01:34:57.930
automatically. So it will keep on engaging my account

01:34:57.930 --> 01:35:01.630
automatically. Okay. So again, multiple agents. So many

01:35:01.630 --> 01:35:06.010
different, different agent altogether. Can we use same use

01:35:06.010 --> 01:35:08.150
case in Langchain? Yes, you can use same thing in a

01:35:08.150 --> 01:35:11.110
Langchain. You can try to same thing in a Lama indexes, Lang

01:35:11.110 --> 01:35:14.070
graph. I have already shown you even in Lang graph. So you

01:35:14.070 --> 01:35:17.150
can just call a Lang graph itself, Lang graph object itself,

01:35:17.230 --> 01:35:20.150
which I have not done. I have just like a used, uh, like a

01:35:20.150 --> 01:35:24.470
two nodes where I've used a URI based, uh, Lang graph, LLM

01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:30.190
only. Right. So yeah, lot can be like, uh, done.

01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:45.740
Okay. So now the file size is like very, very big. I believe

01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:50.480
it's a four 94 MB. It seems, let me upload this file

01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:56.020
somewhere. It's mostly because of, uh, installation.

01:37:03.660 --> 01:37:08.240
Okay. So here is a drive link. Everyone, I think, you know,

01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:12.580
you are able to access the drive link. So everything is

01:37:12.580 --> 01:37:15.360
there. Invoice generator is there. Invoice processor is

01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:18.140
there. Everything is there. Right. Everything is there

01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:24.100
inside the, uh, same folder. Yeah. So, so that you can, you

01:37:24.100 --> 01:37:27.340
know, keep the, create the invoices and then you can like a

01:37:27.340 --> 01:37:28.360
test it. Uh,

01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:41.440
it's better if you can remove the environment file. I think

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:44.100
it's better to keep it because, uh, it's just a foreign MB.

01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:48.400
So not a big one. Uh, uh, we all are having like a good

01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:50.960
internet connection and you can just use the same

01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:52.960
environment. You don't have to even do an environment

01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:55.980
installation. So just activate this environment. So this

01:37:55.980 --> 01:38:01.840
folder. Dot, uh, basically a script dot activate. Yeah. So

01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:04.620
you will be able to activate it. So no need to do an

01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:07.680
installation. If it is working in my system, it will work

01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:10.020
even in your system. Simple.

01:38:17.650 --> 01:38:25.550
Now, so this is one of the simple system that we have

01:38:25.550 --> 01:38:31.740
created with respect to Lang graph. Now,

01:38:34.430 --> 01:38:35.790
let me show you something.

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:44.480
There is a platform called as crew AI. Yeah. There is a

01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:47.780
platform called as crew AI. Now I'll even show you like, uh,

01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:50.500
there is a deployment session if you'll go and check your

01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:53.460
syllabus. So there is a deployment session. So where, uh, a

01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:57.120
lot of like a deployment pipeline has been there. Uh, we'll

01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:00.020
try to talk about that. But before that, let's talk about

01:39:00.020 --> 01:39:03.940
this. Another platform called as crew AI, right? Now I can

01:39:03.940 --> 01:39:08.340
solve the exact same problem inside a crew AI, right inside

01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:12.880
a crew AI and not just that. So crew AI is giving you a crew

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:16.820
AI cloud, which is available in a beta mode. As of now, it's

01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:21.380
not available in a production grade mode, but you can go and

01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:26.580
you can do an experimentation even now, right? Even now. So

01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:31.140
here, uh, what it does. So basically it is going to give you

01:39:31.140 --> 01:39:34.000
the interface. Again, it's not a matured one. I have already

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.740
tried and based on my experience, it's not a mature one. And

01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:41.380
again, they are like, uh, saying that. It's available into

01:39:41.380 --> 01:39:45.080
a, uh, beta mode. So obviously we have to respect that

01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:49.300
particular part and, uh, here, right? So here you can come

01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:52.940
and you can try to automate a task and basically you can

01:39:52.940 --> 01:39:57.100
automate a task just with a chatting, right? Just with a

01:39:57.100 --> 01:40:00.240
chatting, you will be able to automate a task. For example,

01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:03.400
uh, I have to create the similar things, right? Uh, the

01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:05.940
things which I have created, uh, now in, inside a land

01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:12.860
graph. So I want to create a. Uh, full pipeline for

01:40:12.860 --> 01:40:22.860
processing my invoice by using, by using some of the OCR,

01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:33.040
uh, best one available in market, uh, it should take, or it

01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:41.640
should keep on watching my Google drive. Location where I

01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:47.600
will keep on getting my, uh,

01:40:49.700 --> 01:40:58.490
invoices and it should be able to read it, clean

01:41:00.630 --> 01:41:11.790
it, process it, and finally store it in, let's suppose

01:41:11.790 --> 01:41:20.470
MongoDB, MongoDB so that I can query. And I can see the

01:41:20.470 --> 01:41:28.430
report report, do it for me. So basically this is just, uh,

01:41:28.510 --> 01:41:31.930
like a prompt, which I have given, right? And the crew AI

01:41:31.930 --> 01:41:34.970
it's, it's available in beta, like I said, but yeah, maybe

01:41:34.970 --> 01:41:37.590
in a couple of months you will be able to find out that it

01:41:37.590 --> 01:41:41.390
will be out of beta and, uh, believe me, it's our next

01:41:41.390 --> 01:41:43.870
powerful thing, which I can see in terms of creating the

01:41:43.870 --> 01:41:47.130
agents, right? The way they are like, uh, trying to build

01:41:47.130 --> 01:41:51.170
it. And just see the power of it. So I have just given a

01:41:51.170 --> 01:41:54.530
prompt, I have just defined my entire use cases. Uh, I can

01:41:54.530 --> 01:41:58.070
even try to like, uh, modify it and what it will start

01:41:58.070 --> 01:42:02.410
doing, it will start creating an agent node C automatically

01:42:02.410 --> 01:42:05.430
it has started creating these things, right? So in case of N

01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:09.450
eight N still you have to go, you have to drag and drop, and

01:42:09.450 --> 01:42:11.250
then you have to select the task. You have to select the

01:42:11.250 --> 01:42:14.870
agent. Then you have to attach the tool calling on top of

01:42:14.870 --> 01:42:17.050
that, which I'll show you all again. It's an easy one,

01:42:17.110 --> 01:42:19.170
right? It's a very, very easy one, even with respect to N

01:42:19.170 --> 01:42:23.830
eight N. Uh, but here, even without doing it, I can do it

01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:27.210
right. Even without right. A drag doing a drag and drop. It

01:42:27.210 --> 01:42:30.850
has started creating the, you know, uh, agent, uh, agent,

01:42:30.850 --> 01:42:33.770
which will try to go to my drive, Google drive. I can just

01:42:33.770 --> 01:42:37.430
click, I can that configure it, or I can log in. Then this

01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:40.750
is for invoice processing, data extractor, stores manager,

01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:45.050
invoice, a report generator, right? And for all of these

01:42:45.050 --> 01:42:47.630
agents, these are the tasks, right? It has started creating

01:42:47.630 --> 01:42:51.550
the task the way we do it with the help of code. Not just

01:42:51.550 --> 01:42:54.050
that they have given you a download option. You can download

01:42:54.050 --> 01:42:57.790
even a raw code. So in this, this, this manner, right? The

01:42:57.790 --> 01:43:00.630
way we are writing a code, you can download the same code

01:43:00.630 --> 01:43:04.010
for crew AI and then code wise modification. If you would

01:43:04.010 --> 01:43:06.590
like to download a code for this, and then you can do the

01:43:06.590 --> 01:43:09.350
modification or just chat with it to the modification or

01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:12.570
drag and drop, and then do the modification or do some sort

01:43:12.570 --> 01:43:17.250
of a addition, right? So basically. Uh. The agent creation

01:43:17.250 --> 01:43:22.550
with vibe coding and plus it's, it's basically, they're

01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:25.010
trying to give you a code solution. They're trying to give

01:43:25.010 --> 01:43:27.790
you a no code solution. Plus they're trying to give you a

01:43:27.790 --> 01:43:31.490
vibe code, all three in one places, right? So that, you

01:43:31.490 --> 01:43:34.630
know, whatever ways it suits you, uh, you can just go and

01:43:34.630 --> 01:43:38.710
you can, you know, try to create your entire, uh, automation

01:43:38.710 --> 01:43:41.930
plus plus technically that is a meaning of agentic AI. Hope

01:43:41.930 --> 01:43:45.490
now you understand that part, right? So you can do your

01:43:45.490 --> 01:43:48.670
automation plus plus. You can like, uh, run it anywhere you

01:43:48.670 --> 01:43:52.750
want and then get your task like done. Yeah. See, it's, it's

01:43:52.750 --> 01:43:56.030
doing it right. So Google drive, then the OCR, then data

01:43:56.030 --> 01:43:58.570
extractor, I'll have to, obviously it will not work in a

01:43:58.570 --> 01:44:02.090
single go. I just have to like do the configuration, like

01:44:02.090 --> 01:44:05.070
that is that configuration is required. But what I'm trying

01:44:05.070 --> 01:44:08.630
to show you is that where we are moving in, even in terms of

01:44:08.630 --> 01:44:11.650
creating the agents, right where we are moving. So here we

01:44:11.650 --> 01:44:14.410
have written like a hell lot of a code and then like, uh,

01:44:14.530 --> 01:44:17.630
without even writing a code, just by doing, uh, you know,

01:44:17.650 --> 01:44:22.270
uh, vibe coding, uh, we are able to do it and it's in a

01:44:22.270 --> 01:44:24.750
beta, right? Just wait for two to three months. It will be

01:44:24.750 --> 01:44:28.650
out of beta, right? It'll be out of beta. Not just that I

01:44:28.650 --> 01:44:31.210
have actually tested it and let's suppose some tools are not

01:44:31.210 --> 01:44:34.410
available, right? It creates, it writes its own custom tool

01:44:34.410 --> 01:44:38.210
as well. Yeah. I have always also done that kind of a

01:44:38.210 --> 01:44:42.170
testing with respect to this crew AI and it was, it was able

01:44:42.170 --> 01:44:44.330
to let, let's suppose they have given you a limited number

01:44:44.330 --> 01:44:48.130
of tools. Maybe. It will be out of beta. I will be having

01:44:48.130 --> 01:44:50.750
more and more tools, right? Just like I, and it is having.

01:44:50.950 --> 01:44:54.810
So anytime is having given you multiple tools, but the

01:44:54.810 --> 01:44:57.750
beautiful things which I was able to find out with respect

01:44:57.750 --> 01:45:01.330
to the screw AI is that, that, uh, if some tools are not

01:45:01.330 --> 01:45:04.770
available, it's okay. It will, it is creating an ad hoc

01:45:04.770 --> 01:45:07.850
custom tool for me, right? Tool means function. Basically

01:45:07.850 --> 01:45:10.710
functionality is for me. It is, it is like creating it, run

01:45:10.710 --> 01:45:14.390
the automation so I can, I can watch the automation. So here

01:45:14.390 --> 01:45:16.770
it is asking me that, okay. What are the Google drive path?

01:45:17.010 --> 01:45:20.090
Give me the MongoDB connection string, uh, give me the

01:45:20.090 --> 01:45:23.910
MongoDB database. Maybe give me the MongoDB collection. So

01:45:23.910 --> 01:45:28.230
if I'm going to give each and everything, uh, it, it can

01:45:28.230 --> 01:45:31.070
like, you know, do the job for me. Yeah. It can do the job

01:45:31.070 --> 01:45:35.010
for, uh, me by the way. So maybe I can, I can try to give

01:45:35.010 --> 01:45:39.090
each and everything to it and then, uh, it can do the task.

01:45:39.170 --> 01:45:43.010
Yeah. There is like a possibility that it will be able to do

01:45:43.010 --> 01:45:45.610
the task for me. Obviously. Obviously it needs the

01:45:45.610 --> 01:45:49.070
authentication. So in the next run, it will look for the

01:45:49.070 --> 01:45:52.170
authentication. It will like try to make it better and

01:45:52.170 --> 01:45:53.510
better as

01:45:56.460 --> 01:45:59.260
of now. Let me like, uh, give something random.

01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:10.580
So your automation is now running. Execution has started

01:46:10.580 --> 01:46:13.980
and, uh, here you can even see it visually that, okay, it's

01:46:13.980 --> 01:46:17.420
running and one by one, one by one, it will go from, see one

01:46:17.420 --> 01:46:20.740
node. This is now a running node, right? This is a running

01:46:20.740 --> 01:46:24.360
one, uh, calling this particular agent watching. So this is

01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:27.760
completed, then this is completed, uh, one by one, one by

01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:30.300
one, a test mode it's running, right? So one by one, it will

01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:33.820
like run it, uh, it will like, uh, tell you that, okay, I

01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:37.080
have started this job and again, I can precisely watch it

01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:39.460
basically. So I have started this job that I have called

01:46:39.460 --> 01:46:42.740
LLMs basically, right? What I have done with respect to the

01:46:42.740 --> 01:46:46.320
LLMs, uh, so if you will be able to like, you know,

01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:49.920
understand that part, then, uh, what kind of a task it has

01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:53.140
completed. So it has gone to this folder and yeah, it is

01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:56.180
able to read. My file, as you can see, right? It is, it is

01:46:56.180 --> 01:46:59.140
able to read my files, right? It is, it is able to basically

01:46:59.140 --> 01:47:01.240
read my files, whatever, like files, which is available

01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:04.760
inside my Google drive. It has done that in like, uh, in

01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:08.940
that way. Uh, so like, uh, extracting the invoices out of

01:47:08.940 --> 01:47:13.080
this one, calling the tools over here, one by one, one by

01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:18.060
one, and then data storage manager, right? And finally it

01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:21.220
will be able to store the, uh, data, which it will not

01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:26.000
because I have not given the correct. Uh, like, uh, MongoDB

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:30.340
URL over here, but yeah, it is, it is able to do it. So it,

01:47:30.380 --> 01:47:32.840
it took almost like a two, three hour of time for me to

01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:35.820
prepare a code, right? And that too, with the help of, uh,

01:47:36.020 --> 01:47:39.440
like, uh, GPTs and all those system, right? This, this

01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:44.100
entire code now here, like two minutes, I don't have to even

01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:47.340
worry about the code, right? I can even call like, uh, like

01:47:47.340 --> 01:47:49.920
if I would like to add maybe some notification system that

01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:53.660
add WhatsApp, add maybe a Gmail over here. Yeah. It will

01:47:53.660 --> 01:47:56.720
just try to add it in no time. No time is literally no time.

01:47:57.460 --> 01:48:00.780
In a second of time, it will be able to add that part. If I

01:48:00.780 --> 01:48:03.380
would like to add a couple of more features, it will do it

01:48:03.380 --> 01:48:08.040
for me, right? So this is like a places we are moving where

01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:11.120
your imagination, your imagination is the only like, I know

01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:16.040
the bottleneck, otherwise there is no water link.

01:48:33.140 --> 01:48:36.940
Yeah. And like I said, so you have like a option to download

01:48:36.940 --> 01:48:40.560
a code, so it will give you the complete code as well. See,

01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:42.460
it is giving you the complete code. I have already

01:48:42.460 --> 01:48:44.760
downloaded it. I have already tested it, uh, for the

01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:48.060
multiple things, uh, from my site. So I'm already aware

01:48:48.060 --> 01:48:52.740
about it. Now if I'm going to ask this one that, uh, add a

01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:55.680
crew so

01:48:57.890 --> 01:49:07.920
that I can send a notification over, over WhatsApp, telegram

01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:18.820
and mail. Once. File. Is processed and, uh, okay.

01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:21.640
So process, like let's, let's suppose if I would like to add

01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:26.240
that node over here, it will, it will add it and

01:49:34.660 --> 01:49:38.400
I can click on everything. I can, you know, try to, uh,

01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:41.920
like, uh, give all the access. So for example, if I would

01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:44.260
like to give an access for uploading a file, downloading a

01:49:44.260 --> 01:49:48.900
file, getting a folder, moving a folder. So everything is

01:49:48.900 --> 01:49:51.500
available with me. I can just like go and I can try to give

01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:55.160
any kind of access that I want, uh, to a particular node and

01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:57.680
to a particular tool, basically, because this is technically

01:49:57.680 --> 01:50:01.160
a tool, right? I can, I have all the options to, you know,

01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:04.420
configure the LLM setting, uh, because the tool, right? So

01:50:04.420 --> 01:50:08.080
some LLM, it is trying to call a, so I can, I can play with

01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:10.860
all of those agent setting. I can try to play with those,

01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:16.160
right? Uh, so every option is under my control as simple as

01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:19.280
that, right? So. Everything I am controlling over here, uh,

01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:22.980
and everything I can try to like, uh, configure it in, in my

01:50:22.980 --> 01:50:28.600
own way, the way I want. Yeah. So as you can see now, it is

01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:32.180
like, uh, trying to create a notification system for me. So

01:50:32.180 --> 01:50:35.500
where I will just configure a sender email ID and maybe like

01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:39.320
a receiver email ID I can do, and it will keep on, you know,

01:50:39.340 --> 01:50:44.460
sending a notification for me. Enable coding. Yeah. Now it

01:50:44.460 --> 01:50:46.820
will start creating the custom tool. So it has asked for the

01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:49.580
enable coding, right? Now you will be able to find out that

01:50:49.580 --> 01:50:52.760
it is creating a custom tools. Custom tool means a kind of a

01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:55.960
tool which is not available in a crew ecosystem. For

01:50:55.960 --> 01:50:58.700
example, sending a WhatsApp message. Maybe that tool is not

01:50:58.700 --> 01:51:02.380
available here, right? But the beautiful part is that it is

01:51:02.380 --> 01:51:05.280
creating the one, as you can see, excellent. Now I can

01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:08.020
create the custom WhatsApp telegram notification tool for

01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:11.660
you. Let's build it. And this is something which impressed

01:51:11.660 --> 01:51:14.420
me a lot, literally believe me like, uh, this is something

01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:16.800
which has impressed me a lot. That if something is not

01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:20.160
available, it's writing a code for, I know that tool is

01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:23.000
nothing but just a function, right? Uh, I can, I can do it

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.940
even without using a crew AI. That's okay. I can simply

01:51:25.940 --> 01:51:27.840
write a Python function. I have done that a hundred of

01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:33.020
times, but, uh, it looks like a, uh, pretty much encouraging

01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:36.320
that a system is doing it. They have, they have given you

01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:39.660
that option that, uh, if tools are, so they're not

01:51:39.660 --> 01:51:41.940
restricting you by the way, right? They're not restricting

01:51:41.940 --> 01:51:45.660
you that. Okay. Uh. So only you can try to use these main

01:51:45.660 --> 01:51:48.940
number of tools because there is no limit, right? There is

01:51:48.940 --> 01:51:53.140
no limit of the use cases. So obviously, uh, this is, so see

01:51:53.140 --> 01:51:56.400
now it has created the custom tool for me, right? A WhatsApp

01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:59.200
notification tool, just, just in my account, it has created

01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:03.620
it, right? Custom generated. So which, which has impressed

01:52:03.620 --> 01:52:04.120
me a lot.

01:52:11.650 --> 01:52:14.510
Can we check a backend code for the same? Yes, you can.

01:52:14.630 --> 01:52:16.450
That's the reason. So they have given you a download option.

01:52:16.550 --> 01:52:18.930
So once this will finish, right? So this download option

01:52:18.930 --> 01:52:21.650
will be. I have already downloaded, I think once, uh, let me

01:52:21.650 --> 01:52:25.170
show you that part. So you can check all the code line by

01:52:25.170 --> 01:52:27.290
line. They're not restricting anything. They are like, uh,

01:52:27.370 --> 01:52:30.210
you know, making it open source so that you can download

01:52:30.210 --> 01:52:33.450
your own code and then you can do whatever you want with

01:52:33.450 --> 01:52:37.730
respect to that code. Uh, where is my download? Yeah. In

01:52:37.730 --> 01:52:39.830
voice processing. I think this was the code.

01:52:45.480 --> 01:52:50.120
Yeah. So this is like a code that they have created. Krew AI

01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:53.980
has created the previous version, right? File. Then open

01:52:53.980 --> 01:52:55.800
folder, download

01:52:58.330 --> 01:52:59.910
invoice processor.

01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:06.690
Yeah. So this is, this was the code which I have downloaded.

01:53:06.850 --> 01:53:10.710
Right. And I can check everything. Krew.py. Right. So what

01:53:10.710 --> 01:53:13.870
kind of a Krew that they're trying to create means kind of a

01:53:13.870 --> 01:53:16.670
node. You can say Krew members are nothing but just like a

01:53:16.670 --> 01:53:20.190
node. Uh, we have created inside the land graph, right? So

01:53:20.190 --> 01:53:23.650
monitor Google drive, right? One task it has created extract

01:53:23.650 --> 01:53:26.270
is from the extract. So almost similar kind of approach. See

01:53:26.270 --> 01:53:27.730
approach wise. It's not very different. It's not very

01:53:27.730 --> 01:53:30.290
different because it's like a, just a piece of the code,

01:53:30.390 --> 01:53:33.370
right? So what we have done today with respect to a land

01:53:33.370 --> 01:53:36.130
graph, you, you will be able to see like a kind of a

01:53:36.130 --> 01:53:38.590
similarity, right? A lot of similarity. You will be able to

01:53:38.590 --> 01:53:41.970
see a store in voice data into a MongoDB, uh, extract a

01:53:41.970 --> 01:53:45.410
structure data. So it is like a trying to call one by one,

01:53:45.450 --> 01:53:47.170
one by one, a different, different, different different

01:53:47.170 --> 01:53:50.470
task, right? Task basically, or you can say agents, it is

01:53:50.470 --> 01:53:53.790
trying to call configuring all together and then running it.

01:53:53.950 --> 01:53:56.310
Right. Configuring all together and running it over here.

01:53:56.630 --> 01:53:59.950
Uh, so here. So here is like a tool. If there is a custom

01:53:59.950 --> 01:54:05.870
tool, it is like trying to create it. Yeah. So here we have

01:54:05.870 --> 01:54:07.230
like a agents, it's backstory.

01:54:10.280 --> 01:54:16.120
Okay. Still writing it and, uh, looks impressive to me like

01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:20.160
a telegram bot, WhatsApp API integration. Uh, it is, it is

01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:22.760
able to get into the WhatsApp business. I just had to do the

01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:25.720
configuration with respect to a WhatsApp business. I'll show

01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:28.200
you some time. I have that access because we are using like

01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:33.220
a WhatsApp business. Run the automation. So it will go and

01:54:33.220 --> 01:54:36.400
it will start testing it. Enter the WhatsApp API. Okay. Let

01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:37.660
me like enter something random.

01:54:41.670 --> 01:54:43.790
Validation is still as a issue. Yeah. WhatsApp API is not

01:54:43.790 --> 01:54:48.030
correct. So now you can see that, uh, how beautifully it is

01:54:48.030 --> 01:54:51.890
able to create everything. And then there is a three

01:54:51.890 --> 01:54:54.530
notification system. As you can see one for a mail

01:54:54.530 --> 01:54:57.910
notification, one for a WhatsApp and one for a telegram. It

01:54:57.910 --> 01:55:01.270
is able to create by creating some telegram and WhatsApp as

01:55:01.270 --> 01:55:04.710
a custom one. Right. And the configuration wise, you can go

01:55:04.710 --> 01:55:08.070
and check code wise. So this is the telegram one it has

01:55:08.070 --> 01:55:11.030
created. I can go and I can check the code that what it is

01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:13.910
doing with respect to telegram. I can even ask for the

01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:18.570
modification if I want, right. If I want. So this is the

01:55:18.570 --> 01:55:21.590
custom WhatsApp tool it has created. It's a simple piece of

01:55:21.590 --> 01:55:24.830
Python code. Like I said, right. I can like do it in a local

01:55:24.830 --> 01:55:28.410
itself, but yeah, system is writing it. And then here it is

01:55:28.410 --> 01:55:30.530
just asking you phone number ID access token, which is

01:55:30.530 --> 01:55:33.530
pretty much required. For configuring the WhatsApp. So just

01:55:33.530 --> 01:55:36.870
I have to configure and everything will be up and running.

01:55:37.110 --> 01:55:41.450
So isn't it amazing guys, I'm just trying to show you that

01:55:41.450 --> 01:55:44.570
whatever like code that we have written now, even without a

01:55:44.570 --> 01:55:47.090
code that is possible. And same thing I'll show you, even

01:55:47.090 --> 01:55:49.110
with respect to N8N, Krew

01:55:55.670 --> 01:55:59.250
AI backend built on Langchain code. No Langchain is a

01:55:59.250 --> 01:56:01.670
different organization. Krew AI is a different organization.

01:56:02.150 --> 01:56:08.710
They both have used their own frameworks. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:56:08.810 --> 01:56:12.090
So tomorrow topic is going to be Krew AI, but not with this

01:56:12.090 --> 01:56:15.610
UI interface, I'll show you with code. Either way you can do

01:56:15.610 --> 01:56:18.790
it, right. Whatever you can do it with code. Maybe that is

01:56:18.790 --> 01:56:22.030
going to take maybe an hour of time for me. With this one,

01:56:22.130 --> 01:56:25.630
maybe five minutes, only five minutes, same task up and

01:56:25.630 --> 01:56:25.890
running.

01:56:30.770 --> 01:56:34.230
Krew AI beat Langchain and Langraph. Yeah. I mean like there

01:56:34.230 --> 01:56:37.050
is a lot of competition you will see nowadays among this

01:56:37.050 --> 01:56:41.010
four to five organization. Now, like that, like Langchain

01:56:41.010 --> 01:56:43.510
then Langraph. Yeah. Langraph, Langchain is same. It's a

01:56:43.510 --> 01:56:47.350
part of like a same organization Lang, right. So Langchain,

01:56:47.390 --> 01:56:50.910
Langraph, Lama indexes, then Krew AI, Autogen, N8N, right.

01:56:51.130 --> 01:56:56.650
So somewhere I feel like N8N is dominating in a no coding

01:56:56.650 --> 01:57:00.390
environment because many people are able to adopt it. This

01:57:00.390 --> 01:57:06.890
is how N8N is by the way. Coding wise, I trust, I have a

01:57:06.890 --> 01:57:10.010
very less trust and even the world is having a very less

01:57:10.010 --> 01:57:12.290
trust on Langchain. Langchain, Langraph kind of a system.

01:57:12.970 --> 01:57:16.750
It's not very much stable, pretty much secure. I would say

01:57:16.750 --> 01:57:19.990
it's like that even they don't claim that I'm secure, I'm

01:57:19.990 --> 01:57:22.890
stable. They say that, okay, I have created a tool. I have

01:57:22.890 --> 01:57:24.670
basically created a framework. I have created the high level

01:57:24.670 --> 01:57:28.410
API. Use it whenever it is required, right. This is what

01:57:28.410 --> 01:57:32.790
they used to claim. But yeah, I can see that for a non

01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:35.610
coding background people, those who don't want to code, but

01:57:35.610 --> 01:57:38.950
still they would like to like automate, right. Even people

01:57:38.950 --> 01:57:42.490
who codes, right. At the end of the day. We are writing a

01:57:42.490 --> 01:57:44.990
code and we are not writing a code does doesn't matter at

01:57:44.990 --> 01:57:48.250
the end of the day. Task matters, right? It's not like if

01:57:48.250 --> 01:57:51.090
I'm writing a code and solving something, then I'm genius

01:57:51.090 --> 01:57:55.910
and you are solving the same task without even writing code.

01:57:56.030 --> 01:57:58.970
You are not genius. No, things doesn't work in that way. At

01:57:58.970 --> 01:58:02.090
the end of the day, we have to complete the task, right? My

01:58:02.090 --> 01:58:04.790
system should work. My system should automate. My system

01:58:04.790 --> 01:58:07.690
should process and obviously it should save some time and

01:58:07.690 --> 01:58:10.110
money, right? At the end of the day, it's all about time and

01:58:10.110 --> 01:58:14.210
money. So somewhere I feel like in it and it's pretty much

01:58:14.210 --> 01:58:18.930
better, uh, crew AI, uh, studio, especially not a code part

01:58:18.930 --> 01:58:20.750
because crew AI is giving you all these things, right?

01:58:20.830 --> 01:58:23.870
They're giving you even a coding part, uh, this approach

01:58:23.870 --> 01:58:27.270
also, they're like, uh, trying to give you, they do a vibe

01:58:27.270 --> 01:58:31.130
coding and then create something. So crew AI is in a

01:58:31.130 --> 01:58:34.630
competition, maybe in next like a three to six months, we'll

01:58:34.630 --> 01:58:38.030
see some like a very, very positive result. And then this

01:58:38.030 --> 01:58:43.170
code based agent system. Okay. But probably this company

01:58:43.170 --> 01:58:46.630
asked to solve the code base, so obviously you, you should

01:58:46.630 --> 01:58:48.510
understand the code. That's the reason. So we are talking

01:58:48.510 --> 01:58:51.510
both, right? Obviously this class is technically for a

01:58:51.510 --> 01:58:56.890
coding people, right? Uh, the entire like a generative AI

01:58:56.890 --> 01:58:59.830
batch that we are running as of now, we'll try to launch

01:58:59.830 --> 01:59:03.650
some of the batches just for non coders. Yeah. We are not

01:59:03.650 --> 01:59:07.670
even test the code in that place. This system in it in kind

01:59:07.670 --> 01:59:12.690
of a system will come into a picture. Yeah. But, but yeah,

01:59:12.790 --> 01:59:15.690
I'll, I'll show you all the flavors basically. Right. So

01:59:15.690 --> 01:59:17.850
whatever way you would like to go, whatever way you would

01:59:17.850 --> 01:59:21.250
like to automate, you can just like, uh, do it that. Okay.

01:59:21.310 --> 01:59:25.710
And I can claim it that, okay, I have done that. Uh, okay,

01:59:25.770 --> 01:59:30.250
fine. Uh, so this is it from today's class guys, uh, hope

01:59:30.250 --> 01:59:34.450
all of us are good. All of us are able to learn something.

01:59:34.550 --> 01:59:39.010
So just go sit with yourself, uh, try to digest whatever,

01:59:39.130 --> 01:59:41.530
like, uh, things that we have discussed in my today's class.

01:59:41.970 --> 01:59:44.870
And then in case of any questions, so do let me know about

01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:48.090
your, uh, questions. Uh, like I said, so today we are

01:59:48.090 --> 01:59:52.370
launching a batch. So if someone is interested in terms of

01:59:52.370 --> 01:59:56.250
development, you are welcome. DSA with Python, Ram Indra is

01:59:56.250 --> 01:59:58.470
also going to take that batch. So if someone is interested,

01:59:58.610 --> 02:00:03.370
you can join that from 4 PM IST. So I'm going to start like

02:00:03.370 --> 02:00:06.450
this, uh, interview, question, discussion, uh, from this

02:00:06.450 --> 02:00:09.190
interview question batch, maybe you can come and join that

02:00:09.190 --> 02:00:11.610
particular batch as well. That is just a sort of batch. Like

02:00:11.610 --> 02:00:15.270
today, tomorrow, we'll discuss majority of question. If

02:00:15.270 --> 02:00:17.990
something will be left, we'll take it up in a upcoming, like

02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:21.890
a session, we'll schedule upcoming session. Yeah. So all of

02:00:21.890 --> 02:00:24.830
you are enjoying, wow, class. Thank you. Thanks Sanjeev.

02:00:24.970 --> 02:00:30.470
Yeah. Uh, really good session, sir. We will expect the same

02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:32.930
Jackpot session. Yeah. Don't worry. See, sometimes session

02:00:32.930 --> 02:00:35.810
will be boring. Sometime it will be interesting. Uh, depends

02:00:35.810 --> 02:00:40.170
upon the topic, right? Uh, you should be like, uh, ready for

02:00:40.170 --> 02:00:42.690
that, but, uh, it's not like every time class will be

02:00:42.690 --> 02:00:45.490
interesting. Uh, I keep on saying that sometime it will be

02:00:45.490 --> 02:00:53.270
boring. Yeah. Interview course is going to end now. Once I

02:00:53.270 --> 02:00:56.170
will done with my like, uh, questions, interview questions,

02:00:56.250 --> 02:01:01.960
discussion, uh, then it will be like a closed. Yeah. A great

02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:04.760
session. A lot to learn from the session. Thank you. When

02:01:04.760 --> 02:01:10.200
you teach. Okay. Yeah. Uh, please beat it up. Bootcamp. Uh,

02:01:10.340 --> 02:01:14.460
see, I can like a bring all of those batches. So. That is my

02:01:14.460 --> 02:01:20.000
timing. Right. That's, that's the only concern that I have

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:24.320
apart from that, like, uh, I'm okay to teach for the whole

02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:30.760
day. I don't have any kind of, uh, uh, issues with it. Uh,

02:01:30.900 --> 02:01:34.080
if you'll try to understand everything as a story, then TJ

02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:36.880
with the hard heavy name, believe me, things are not at all

02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:41.260
difficult. Right. It's just like, uh, connecting the entire,

02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:44.260
like a small, small stories altogether. That's it. This is

02:01:44.260 --> 02:01:48.980
how things are actually. Okay. So those who are not having

02:01:48.980 --> 02:01:51.160
question, they can drop off, take a rest, join other

02:01:51.160 --> 02:01:54.400
classes, other batches that we have. If you are willing to,

02:01:54.460 --> 02:01:58.640
uh, those who have a question, be here, uh, and, uh, start

02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:03.200
raising your hand. I'll try to unmute you one by one and,

02:02:03.220 --> 02:02:08.340
uh, we'll go with the Q and A. Yeah. So Dhruvil go ahead

02:02:08.340 --> 02:02:13.800
first Mukesh second, uh, third is Syed. You can go ahead.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:17.620
Fourth is Sumit. Fifth is Muhammad. Sixth is Varun. Go

02:02:17.620 --> 02:02:22.360
ahead. One by one. Yeah. Uh, so I have one requirement. Uh,

02:02:22.540 --> 02:02:26.000
we are having, uh, conference spaces, uh, let's say, uh,

02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:30.380
like Wikipedia, uh, anything we search and then we get the

02:02:30.380 --> 02:02:32.900
page and then we have to read those space to get the

02:02:32.900 --> 02:02:36.880
information. So I wanted to build a chat bot kind of thing,

02:02:36.940 --> 02:02:40.640
uh, to utilize that all the conference pages, which is used

02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:44.680
in our internal, uh, portal. Mm-hmm. And, uh, give the

02:02:44.680 --> 02:02:48.760
specific answer. Let's say I wanted to, uh, see any, any,

02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:51.820
any kind of informations and they have only target those

02:02:51.820 --> 02:02:54.460
information and give me that information rather than having,

02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:56.940
I have to read it and I have couldn't go through all the

02:02:56.940 --> 02:03:01.240
pages. Okay. So what, uh, tools, I mean, what LLM, which LLM

02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:03.860
is we use? See, it's just not a LLM. Basically I have

02:03:03.860 --> 02:03:06.260
already, I think we already have a solution inside your like

02:03:06.260 --> 02:03:09.600
a badge itself. So basically it's a RAG use case. Uh, you

02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:14.200
can try to give an access of your confluent to a RAG. RAG

02:03:14.200 --> 02:03:18.320
means basically store everything into maybe a vector DB and

02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:22.180
then maybe try to do a document search and then try to

02:03:22.180 --> 02:03:26.960
showcase the result. That will be a better approach. That is

02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:28.960
part number one. That is approach number one, technically.

02:03:29.480 --> 02:03:33.520
Approach number two, model fine tuning. So let's suppose if

02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:35.840
your data set is not changing frequently inside your

02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:39.500
confluent, right? If it is changing maybe once in a while,

02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:42.400
once in a while means once in one month, once in a six

02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:45.500
month. If your data set is changing in that case, go ahead

02:03:45.500 --> 02:03:49.620
with the some lightweighted model, fine tuning, right? Not a

02:03:49.620 --> 02:03:52.520
heavy one. Just go with a preferred, uh, some of the

02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:55.800
preferred, maybe Laura and Cora, and then that is going to

02:03:55.800 --> 02:03:59.760
work for you. But for this kind of generally, so, uh,

02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:02.960
things, uh, I simply suggest go with the RAG based solution.

02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:08.940
Okay, sir. Yeah. So, and where in it in, uh, is useful, uh,

02:04:09.540 --> 02:04:12.540
here in this case, even in it and yeah, you can, you can try

02:04:12.540 --> 02:04:14.380
this. You can try to use any 10, uh, and you can try to

02:04:14.380 --> 02:04:17.580
like, uh, you know, the given access to your confluent, you

02:04:17.580 --> 02:04:19.380
can connect to your conference, even a crew where you can

02:04:19.380 --> 02:04:21.840
try to use it. Even land graphic and try to use it. See

02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:24.680
these are in it and not land graphic crew is nothing, but

02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:28.800
they will try to create something like they will allow you

02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:32.880
to create something, some function, which can access LMS or

02:04:32.880 --> 02:04:35.000
maybe elements can understand that particular function

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:38.520
automatically, right? So again, you can try to call in it

02:04:38.520 --> 02:04:41.300
and you can try to configure your confluent inside a net

02:04:41.300 --> 02:04:44.720
end. And, and then you can try to initiate a chat with that,

02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:48.560
uh, entire, like a agent that, okay, now, uh, give me detail

02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:52.420
about this data or that data. So before hitting LMS, what it

02:04:52.420 --> 02:04:54.980
will do, it will, uh, like do the similar kind of approach

02:04:54.980 --> 02:04:59.240
that we try to perform with respect to RAG. Okay.

02:04:59.480 --> 02:05:01.700
Technically it's the same thing that it will do. Right.

02:05:01.800 --> 02:05:05.440
Yeah. Whether I'm going to use a, like a vanilla RAG or

02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:08.520
agentic RAG, or maybe a net end, technically it will do the

02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:10.820
same thing. I'll show you such kind of example. Don't worry.

02:05:10.920 --> 02:05:12.840
I'll connect with my confluent. I'll do a Google drive. Uh,

02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:16.420
right. Uh, and then I'll start doing a question and answer

02:05:16.420 --> 02:05:20.260
with respect to an item. Yeah. Another question is, uh, CRII

02:05:20.260 --> 02:05:24.040
AI, uh, since it's a open source tool, and if I wanted to

02:05:24.040 --> 02:05:29.080
use in our enterprise, uh, I mean, uh, let's say so will it

02:05:29.080 --> 02:05:32.780
okay. Or any compliance issues, uh, beta you can't use as a

02:05:32.780 --> 02:05:36.520
cloud because cloud is a cloud is not available for our

02:05:36.520 --> 02:05:39.560
enterprise. Uh, maybe in some time it will be available.

02:05:39.820 --> 02:05:42.220
It's available technically. But yeah. It's in a beta mode.

02:05:42.320 --> 02:05:45.220
So we should wait for that. Yeah. If you are building a

02:05:45.220 --> 02:05:48.260
solution with the help of CRII code, uh, with the help of

02:05:48.260 --> 02:05:51.520
its framework, then hosted anywhere you want anywhere of

02:05:51.520 --> 02:05:56.880
your choice in on any cloud. We can use CRII AI and, uh, get

02:05:56.880 --> 02:06:02.380
the code and then we can just use, uh, our, uh, yeah, tweak

02:06:02.380 --> 02:06:04.740
it and then host it in your own environment anywhere you

02:06:04.740 --> 02:06:06.940
want. That's completely fine. They're not stopping you for

02:06:06.940 --> 02:06:09.820
that. Got it, sir. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks.

02:06:10.260 --> 02:06:12.140
Okay. Next one through bill. Go ahead.

02:06:17.020 --> 02:06:24.640
Uh, first of all, uh, yeah. Hi. Hi. Good to see you. I like,

02:06:24.640 --> 02:06:29.360
uh, you're the one of like one of the Indian, like YouTuber

02:06:29.360 --> 02:06:37.300
who inspires like us to like self educate ourselves and I

02:06:37.300 --> 02:06:40.340
had a fortunate, I have a fortunate to talk with you now. So

02:06:40.340 --> 02:06:43.140
there's one patient I have. Like previously. I, I was

02:06:43.140 --> 02:06:48.420
working on a client and they were using like, um, Langen

02:06:48.420 --> 02:06:51.320
ecosystem for a rag model. Like that means the retrieval

02:06:51.320 --> 02:06:55.320
augmented for a genetic equation and answer based on the

02:06:56.320 --> 02:06:59.160
store patients at the database. Right. And there is a one

02:06:59.160 --> 02:07:01.620
module that came up that like regarding the voice

02:07:01.620 --> 02:07:06.120
assistance. Right. So we can like do same thing by asking a

02:07:06.120 --> 02:07:09.260
question to the LLM chatbot and they are getting an answer.

02:07:09.340 --> 02:07:12.800
Right. So on that is what happens. Uh, we implemented, uh,

02:07:13.260 --> 02:07:16.800
like not me, but my, like the technical architect

02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:20.360
implemented the live kit version for that. Right. So that

02:07:20.360 --> 02:07:23.740
like it wasn't like quite, uh, that don't have any proper

02:07:23.740 --> 02:07:27.140
documentation and high latency. That means there doesn't

02:07:27.140 --> 02:07:30.040
provide any kind of, uh, low latency or something like that.

02:07:30.340 --> 02:07:33.320
Okay. So do you have any idea about the like life kit

02:07:33.320 --> 02:07:38.040
things? Because it is not popular that much. Oh no. I have.

02:07:38.040 --> 02:07:40.480
Unfortunately I've never tried that part. Maybe I can

02:07:40.480 --> 02:07:43.100
search, but yeah, I honestly speaking, I have never like a

02:07:43.100 --> 02:07:46.200
trial. Yeah. Maybe it's not popular because of that. I was

02:07:46.200 --> 02:07:49.100
not able to pick it up. Yeah. Yeah. That's why, because that

02:07:49.100 --> 02:07:51.980
was like, uh, not proper documentation meant that even

02:07:51.980 --> 02:07:54.580
though there are a lot of issue on that. Okay. So like,

02:07:54.700 --> 02:07:58.600
although it was like that contrast going to be over, but

02:07:58.600 --> 02:08:01.420
yeah, that was a patient. Like, uh, we use the life kit for

02:08:01.420 --> 02:08:04.280
a voice assistant things, but it was not like properly

02:08:04.280 --> 02:08:08.860
maintained because it is, it has a high latency. Okay. So

02:08:08.860 --> 02:08:12.180
what, what, what motivated your manager to, you know, go

02:08:12.180 --> 02:08:15.920
ahead with this kind of framework? Uh, the thing is that no,

02:08:15.980 --> 02:08:19.180
that was not decided by me. That was decided by a technical

02:08:19.180 --> 02:08:23.540
architect. So that is my question. That what motivated your

02:08:23.540 --> 02:08:27.000
manager or architect to, you know, uh, choose, choose this

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:32.220
one. Like the thing is that what happens like, uh, they are,

02:08:32.300 --> 02:08:34.880
how can I say that? Because, uh, they have different kinds

02:08:34.880 --> 02:08:38.520
of structure. Can I speak in Hindi? Yeah, you can speak in

02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:41.280
Hindi. I don't have any issue. Yes. Yeah. So .

02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:48.420
.

02:08:54.360 --> 02:08:56.160
. . . . . . .

02:09:00.620 --> 02:09:04.160
. . . . .

02:09:13.200 --> 02:09:14.600
.

02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:27.480
. . . . . . . . . .

02:09:29.580 --> 02:09:37.300
. . That's why everyone was lay-off. These days, there are a

02:09:37.300 --> 02:09:40.000
lot of issues in the industry. There are a lot of

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:45.960
experiments going on. The other thing was that they told me

02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:50.060
that Replit was popular at that time. There was one product

02:09:50.060 --> 02:09:55.500
which was related to fitness. My colleague was working there

02:09:55.500 --> 02:10:00.080
for 6 months. He told me that Replit prepared the product

02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:07.980
within a week. So guys, I want to tell you, I want to give

02:10:07.980 --> 02:10:11.120
you a suggestion that please prepare yourself with these new

02:10:11.120 --> 02:10:13.820
AI things like Replit or Loveable or these other platform.

02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:18.840
Just explore it because in next 1 or 2 years, if you don't

02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:21.620
learn these things then definitely you will have some kind

02:10:21.620 --> 02:10:25.740
of difficulty in the market to survive. For sure. For sure.

02:10:25.740 --> 02:10:29.300
Definitely, it is true. I guess it is true. That's why after

02:10:29.300 --> 02:10:32.420
that I was trying to find some kind of course and try to

02:10:32.420 --> 02:10:36.020
learn myself regarding the MCP things. I covered up some of

02:10:36.020 --> 02:10:38.520
the YouTube videos regarding the MCP things and agent API

02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:41.520
things. So now I am luckily jumping into your course to

02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:47.280
learn more things. So yeah, this was the story. But yeah, I

02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:51.080
think everyone should learn it. Even your coder, no coder,

02:10:51.140 --> 02:10:57.380
even your kids. I believe we should treat AI as a part of a

02:10:57.380 --> 02:11:00.220
regular curriculum and education. But yes, AI is important.

02:11:00.860 --> 02:11:02.980
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

02:11:07.620 --> 02:11:10.860
One more thing. Okay, I will make the announcement tomorrow.

02:11:11.020 --> 02:11:15.340
Not today. I just forgot. I had to make some. So basically I

02:11:15.340 --> 02:11:20.340
am recording a podcast. I think I have already published one

02:11:20.340 --> 02:11:25.300
podcast with Adiv about his story. So anyone and everyone

02:11:25.300 --> 02:11:29.900
who is interested in terms of doing a podcast. I am not

02:11:29.900 --> 02:11:34.940
forcing you to choose topic of my choice. No, not at all.

02:11:35.140 --> 02:11:38.900
You can try to pick and choose a topic of your choice. You

02:11:38.900 --> 02:11:41.680
can choose a language, Hindi or English. It is completely

02:11:41.680 --> 02:11:44.580
fine because I can understand both of these languages. And

02:11:44.580 --> 02:11:47.780
then fill the form. Form has already been circulated inside

02:11:47.780 --> 02:11:49.620
your groups. You can go and check your previous

02:11:49.620 --> 02:11:55.280
conversation. And yeah, so if you are interested, come for

02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:58.580
the podcast because that will give you a visibility

02:11:58.580 --> 02:12:02.440
obviously. And we can have a good chit chat. Maybe some

02:12:02.440 --> 02:12:05.560
productive chit chat we can have on any of the topic.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:09.040
Anything means literally anything. Just try to fill it up

02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:12.920
and we will schedule the podcast with you. That was the

02:12:12.920 --> 02:12:15.580
announcement. Maybe I was supposed to make it in the

02:12:15.580 --> 02:12:19.700
beginning of the class. But yeah, that's okay. Yeah, Sambit,

02:12:19.740 --> 02:12:23.580
go ahead. Sambit, have you raised your hand? Sorry, Sahid,

02:12:23.620 --> 02:12:27.340
go ahead. So I have two questions basically here. First

02:12:27.340 --> 02:12:31.060
question that where are we exactly using the LLM here

02:12:31.060 --> 02:12:35.420
because most of the things basically we are using that

02:12:36.940 --> 02:12:40.960
scaling for the OCR scaling, we are using one library for

02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:44.460
doing that file search, we are using the Python library.

02:12:45.480 --> 02:12:49.640
See, here. So in a clean and in extract, we are trying to

02:12:49.640 --> 02:12:53.820
use our LLMs by the way, because at the end of the day, what

02:12:53.820 --> 02:12:55.160
it is supposed to do.

02:12:59.020 --> 02:13:01.760
Yeah. So these two nodes that we have created, right. So

02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:05.460
basically here for like a cleaning node, the node cleaning

02:13:05.460 --> 02:13:08.060
that we have created the function that we have created. So

02:13:08.060 --> 02:13:12.080
basically we are trying to use LLMs over there and then over

02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:15.860
here. So clean and extract. Okay. One more follow up

02:13:15.860 --> 02:13:18.740
question that basically we are using a land graph framework.

02:13:18.980 --> 02:13:22.200
Is that a general framework or it's like a normal framework

02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:26.380
to create that like a it's okay. So I have just made it made

02:13:26.380 --> 02:13:29.800
these things pretty much clear that see here I have created

02:13:29.800 --> 02:13:32.740
a normal like a simple function, a plain function I would

02:13:32.740 --> 02:13:36.460
say, and then I'm trying to call a node one by one. Now in

02:13:36.460 --> 02:13:39.140
upcoming class, I will try to even I have written this one

02:13:39.140 --> 02:13:42.600
right now in upcoming class. I'm going to show you that that

02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:47.060
by calling just a land graph, right? Just not this kind of

02:13:47.060 --> 02:13:49.580
function because this structure I have already created. Now

02:13:49.580 --> 02:13:52.220
this structure is required inside a land graph basically.

02:13:52.480 --> 02:13:54.520
Right. So land graph understand this particular structure.

02:13:54.640 --> 02:13:57.400
So just by calling this structure directly without even

02:13:57.400 --> 02:14:00.000
calling this one without even calling this entire like a run

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:03.780
pipeline for the file, I will be able to execute the same

02:14:03.780 --> 02:14:07.440
pipeline same funnel just by using a core land graph

02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:11.620
function and a feature. Okay. One more follow up question.

02:14:11.740 --> 02:14:16.140
So normally what is the basically difference between that

02:14:16.860 --> 02:14:19.560
tool and the function tool and function are same only,

02:14:19.700 --> 02:14:23.600
right? Actually tool and functions are same. So we try to

02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:27.740
call it tools in terms of agentic AI or you can say a

02:14:27.740 --> 02:14:30.980
generative AI. So where a tool calling, right? Generally we

02:14:30.980 --> 02:14:33.640
say tool calling. So basically if any LMS is trying to

02:14:33.640 --> 02:14:36.580
invoke any of these functions, we say that okay fine you are

02:14:36.580 --> 02:14:40.000
basically a tool for me. Okay, basically we are calling in

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:43.260
general calling a function itself. Yeah, since the beginning

02:14:43.260 --> 02:14:45.920
I keep on saying that don't get confused with respect to

02:14:45.920 --> 02:14:49.220
tools and functions. Technically it's a function but when

02:14:49.220 --> 02:14:52.160
some generative AI system is going to call or some agents is

02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:55.180
going to call, it's called as people have made it as a

02:14:55.180 --> 02:14:59.840
norms. It's called as tool now. One follow up question may

02:14:59.840 --> 02:15:02.160
be not related to this, but I just wanted to get your

02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:05.440
opinion if you find it. Shall I go ahead sir? Yeah, go

02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:10.140
ahead. Go ahead. Okay. So basically if I say in very normal

02:15:10.140 --> 02:15:13.160
words, I'm just going to talk about that little bit MCP

02:15:13.160 --> 02:15:19.280
suppose. I do have a class called mathematical class which

02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:26.000
do have like a set of methods or set of functions. So if I

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:30.060
map that particular class to MCP, so can I call that all 5,

02:15:30.140 --> 02:15:33.780
6, 7 will be a tool for me? Yes, you can call that as a, see

02:15:33.780 --> 02:15:37.980
MCP is what? MCP is basically a protocol, right? I believe

02:15:37.980 --> 02:15:41.220
we all are aware about REST API. REST API is what? Can I say

02:15:41.220 --> 02:15:45.780
it's a protocol? Yes. HTTP based protocol. Now when we say

02:15:45.780 --> 02:15:49.120
that, okay, this is the API and you can call this API.

02:15:49.540 --> 02:15:52.460
Technically what I'm trying to tell, can I say that

02:15:52.460 --> 02:15:55.720
technically I'm trying to say that at this location, this

02:15:55.720 --> 02:16:00.820
function is available, correct? Correct. In case of MCP, MCP

02:16:00.820 --> 02:16:04.520
is technically a protocol. Protocol for what? Protocol for

02:16:04.520 --> 02:16:10.440
giving an access of your function, your system to any LLMs.

02:16:10.580 --> 02:16:12.780
So for example, let's suppose if I'm chatting with cloud,

02:16:12.860 --> 02:16:17.720
right? Or maybe if I'm chatting with like your cursor,

02:16:17.980 --> 02:16:23.020
right? Or any other system where like they're using, I can

02:16:23.020 --> 02:16:26.580
say they're trying to use LLMs. So what I can do that, okay,

02:16:26.620 --> 02:16:29.780
I have written a function so which can access a file from a

02:16:29.780 --> 02:16:32.760
particular folder or maybe watch a file from a particular

02:16:32.760 --> 02:16:37.440
folder or maybe a function which can access something from

02:16:37.440 --> 02:16:41.000
my S3 bucket, right? A function which can try to take an

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:44.100
access of my calendar, let's suppose, right? Maybe my

02:16:44.100 --> 02:16:47.240
YouTube channel, let's suppose. So basically we are going to

02:16:47.240 --> 02:16:51.020
create the function and now we are going to expose it via

02:16:51.020 --> 02:16:55.360
using a MCP protocol. The way we were exposing some function

02:16:55.360 --> 02:16:59.140
with the help of fast API, right? With the help of APIs. In

02:16:59.140 --> 02:17:01.500
a similar manner, we'll try to expose it. Expose it means

02:17:01.500 --> 02:17:04.620
what? We are attaching or in a layman way, you can say that

02:17:04.620 --> 02:17:07.320
we are giving an access of that tool, a tool which can

02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:11.500
access my calendar, let's suppose, to LLMs so that anyone

02:17:11.500 --> 02:17:14.800
can chat and with the help of chat, I can say that okay,

02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:18.560
fine, book a meeting for me and then update my calendar. So

02:17:18.560 --> 02:17:20.800
to update the calendar, they need an access of a calendar,

02:17:20.900 --> 02:17:24.820
right? And with the help of MCP, I'm giving it to the

02:17:24.820 --> 02:17:25.880
system.

02:17:27.860 --> 02:17:32.580
Okay, follow to the... Give me one moment. Let him complete,

02:17:32.680 --> 02:17:36.180
yeah. So one more follow up question, sir. We do have

02:17:36.180 --> 02:17:40.400
millions of MCP servers. On that MCP server right now, we

02:17:40.400 --> 02:17:43.920
are using that like I can see you are using most of that

02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:49.400
integrated AI tools within the VS Code. It's Amazon Q or

02:17:49.400 --> 02:17:53.060
basically GitHub Copilot or Gemini Code Assistance. You can

02:17:53.060 --> 02:17:56.940
use so many things right now in the market. And they all are

02:17:56.940 --> 02:18:01.680
giving that facility to connect the MCP servers. Even that

02:18:01.680 --> 02:18:06.140
it's not very common for that GitHub Copilot. My question is

02:18:06.140 --> 02:18:12.160
how we can define a security guardrail that that MCP server

02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:16.460
is secured and can be accessed as a proper. So maybe you

02:18:16.460 --> 02:18:20.120
must be using in your organization also. So you are putting

02:18:20.120 --> 02:18:25.020
a guardrail. So I just because I have one basically trying

02:18:25.020 --> 02:18:28.660
to integrate. I just wanted to get your opinion because you

02:18:28.660 --> 02:18:33.240
are in this field of long time so much. So we are trying to

02:18:33.240 --> 02:18:38.000
expose we are using that GitHub Copilot. And now we are in

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:41.880
verge of not verge of like we are just exploring that how we

02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:45.740
can enable the MCP server. But the only concern is that

02:18:45.740 --> 02:18:48.360
security guardrail how we have to define the protocol. So

02:18:48.360 --> 02:18:52.020
first, yeah, the very first guardrail is like the old way I

02:18:52.020 --> 02:18:57.380
would say auth. That is a very first one. So anyone who is

02:18:57.380 --> 02:19:01.280
trying to configure a MCP, they should go through the proper

02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:04.540
authorization funnel. Maybe a two-factor auth. Or maybe a

02:19:04.540 --> 02:19:07.140
device with authentication, whatever it is, whatever that we

02:19:07.140 --> 02:19:10.960
use to follow for our legacy system or any other system that

02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:14.780
we are using. That's the first part. Second part is always

02:19:14.780 --> 02:19:19.480
try to avoid giving any kind of access to your MCP tools

02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:23.020
means basically a functions which can do a data manipulation

02:19:23.480 --> 02:19:28.240
directly. So always try to give a read access. Try to avoid

02:19:28.240 --> 02:19:31.540
giving execute or write access. Even if you are trying to

02:19:31.540 --> 02:19:35.240
give execute or maybe a write access, always try to give it

02:19:35.240 --> 02:19:37.500
to the parallel system. Parallel system means it should not

02:19:37.500 --> 02:19:40.000
hit your actual production. So maybe parallel. And then

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.820
after validation of those parallel system, it should keep an

02:19:42.820 --> 02:19:45.460
update inside the actual system. It should actually make the

02:19:45.460 --> 02:19:49.740
changes. But avoid giving some sort of this one. So I think

02:19:49.740 --> 02:19:53.040
auth will try to fix most of the problem for you, right?

02:19:53.980 --> 02:19:56.860
Because again, so you are going to give a role-based access

02:19:56.860 --> 02:19:59.620
inside the authorization itself. So everyone will not be

02:19:59.620 --> 02:20:02.760
able to call every MCP tools, right? That's a very first

02:20:02.760 --> 02:20:06.940
part. And yeah, and every MCP tool should not be like a open

02:20:06.940 --> 02:20:09.540
that. Okay, fine. You have all the access. No, and

02:20:09.540 --> 02:20:12.060
especially you should not give a write and execute access

02:20:12.060 --> 02:20:15.720
unless and until it's not required. If you are giving it

02:20:15.720 --> 02:20:18.840
then again, it should go through a multiple checks means ask

02:20:18.840 --> 02:20:22.440
for the authorization again and again and again. Why what my

02:20:22.440 --> 02:20:24.780
question was basically that suppose if you go to the GitHub

02:20:24.780 --> 02:20:28.680
copilot now, it's giving you the option to add MCP server

02:20:28.680 --> 02:20:32.060
that all those sort of servers available on VS code like a

02:20:32.060 --> 02:20:36.180
VS code libraries or GitHub libraries, correct? Suppose they

02:20:36.180 --> 02:20:39.460
have given it tons of libraries over there. I am trying to

02:20:39.460 --> 02:20:42.780
if I'm trying to access my GitHub account GitHub account, I

02:20:42.780 --> 02:20:47.120
need to give my authorization a token like yes, yes, right?

02:20:47.240 --> 02:20:51.520
Yes, yes, the keys I can. Yeah, some of that like it. So the

02:20:51.520 --> 02:20:54.920
hanshu has created a one MCP server and built in into that

02:20:54.920 --> 02:20:58.380
GitHub. If I'm trying to access it, how can I authorize

02:20:58.380 --> 02:21:01.160
that? Whether that is basically authentic. It's not going to

02:21:01.160 --> 02:21:03.320
manipulate my data. Not I'll get in my work point, sir.

02:21:03.420 --> 02:21:06.160
Yeah, I got got your point going to see that was that was

02:21:06.160 --> 02:21:09.660
not a new issue, right? So even before forgot about MCP,

02:21:09.700 --> 02:21:11.840
let's suppose MCP doesn't even exist in this world, right?

02:21:12.100 --> 02:21:16.020
We are trying to use hundreds of software, right? We are

02:21:16.020 --> 02:21:18.920
trying to use hundreds of softwares, right? And obviously we

02:21:18.920 --> 02:21:21.160
try to use hundreds of software with the cautions because

02:21:21.160 --> 02:21:24.660
and basically like this should not be a malware. They should

02:21:24.660 --> 02:21:29.140
not inject some sort of viruses in our system. It's just

02:21:29.140 --> 02:21:32.340
just like MCPs. So whenever you are trying to use should not

02:21:32.340 --> 02:21:36.980
just go ahead and start using some random XYG MCP servers or

02:21:36.980 --> 02:21:40.260
tools which has been created by some XYG organization. See

02:21:40.260 --> 02:21:42.960
there are so many malicious application and even apps

02:21:42.960 --> 02:21:46.680
Android and iOS apps are available. Do we go and download

02:21:46.680 --> 02:21:51.080
all of those apps? No, right? We just download a genuine

02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:55.560
one, the required one. Again, same goes with the software,

02:21:55.680 --> 02:21:58.760
not just a software. I would say same even goes with the

02:21:58.760 --> 02:22:01.280
piece of software. So it's not like I will just try to use

02:22:01.280 --> 02:22:04.060
any of the code because I know there can be a malicious

02:22:04.060 --> 02:22:07.340
code. There can be a code which has been bugged, right? So

02:22:07.340 --> 02:22:11.900
same applies with an MCP. Don't go ahead and start using all

02:22:11.900 --> 02:22:16.980
those random stuff just because it's MCP is new and I wanted

02:22:16.980 --> 02:22:21.960
to take a taste of it. Use it which is authentic one and

02:22:21.960 --> 02:22:26.400
after verification that that's a very first guardrail and I

02:22:26.400 --> 02:22:30.360
believe the very last one we all should put up. Okay. Thank

02:22:30.360 --> 02:22:33.000
you so much for the clarification. Thank you so much for the

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:36.960
time. Okay. Next one, please. Yeah, Sambit, go ahead.

02:22:41.380 --> 02:22:46.820
Yeah, Sambit, go ahead. Yeah. Can you hear me? Hello? Yeah,

02:22:46.880 --> 02:22:49.100
I can hear you, Sambit. Yeah. Yeah. Hi. So Damsu, good

02:22:49.100 --> 02:22:51.500
morning. This is Sambit. First of all, I would like to

02:22:51.500 --> 02:22:55.160
congratulate you and also many, many thanks for doing this

02:22:55.160 --> 02:22:58.220
session. There's a boot camp for Genitive AI. And today I

02:22:58.220 --> 02:23:00.920
have joined this session. I really liked this session and

02:23:00.920 --> 02:23:04.980
the purpose like what I was thinking like to have been four

02:23:04.980 --> 02:23:07.420
plus years of industrial experience in data science machine

02:23:07.420 --> 02:23:10.620
learning. The day I started into this, I have been to your

02:23:10.620 --> 02:23:16.360
YouTube channels. So I'm a little bit old subscriber. But

02:23:16.360 --> 02:23:19.960
the moment what I felt to join this session is like to know

02:23:19.960 --> 02:23:23.600
somewhat more into LLM. So looking to this generative AI and

02:23:23.600 --> 02:23:26.700
agentic AI, just I want to know like, what sort of interview

02:23:26.700 --> 02:23:31.260
questions can we can interview ask if we have a non AI

02:23:31.260 --> 02:23:34.820
background and if we have an AI and MLM background. So will

02:23:34.820 --> 02:23:38.300
they focus everything towards AI ML or mostly towards a

02:23:38.300 --> 02:23:43.120
generative AI side? Yeah, so mostly see, interview will be

02:23:43.120 --> 02:23:46.520
driven by not these factors, it will be driven by a work

02:23:46.520 --> 02:23:48.780
that you have done and the work that you have mentioned

02:23:48.780 --> 02:23:52.960
inside your resume. First part, second part is it will be

02:23:52.960 --> 02:23:56.720
driven by an interviewer, right? So it depends upon

02:23:56.720 --> 02:24:00.080
interviewers knowledge as well. So I generally I have seen

02:24:00.080 --> 02:24:02.580
that that not in the product based companies because their

02:24:02.580 --> 02:24:06.440
interview will be more structured, but in MNCs and startup.

02:24:06.780 --> 02:24:10.980
So whatever interviewer knows, he or she is going to ask you

02:24:10.980 --> 02:24:15.460
a question based on that. And it starts with always with

02:24:15.460 --> 02:24:21.440
your resume. Yeah. So if as a non AI coder, if you have

02:24:21.440 --> 02:24:23.520
mentioned something like you have built something with the

02:24:23.520 --> 02:24:26.560
help of no code kind of a tool or solution, obviously people

02:24:26.560 --> 02:24:29.560
will try to ask you like a question based on that, that what

02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:32.220
you have done, what was the use cases, how you were able to

02:24:32.220 --> 02:24:34.500
achieve, what you were able to achieve in terms of

02:24:34.500 --> 02:24:37.840
businesses, revenue, or maybe traction, whatever. And if you

02:24:37.840 --> 02:24:39.660
have mentioned something in terms of technologies, then

02:24:39.660 --> 02:24:43.820
obviously people will just go after that. Whatever

02:24:43.820 --> 02:24:46.220
interviews till now I have been giving it is more focused

02:24:46.220 --> 02:24:48.500
towards the rag application that I've built in the current

02:24:48.500 --> 02:24:51.180
organization. And have you mentioned that inside your

02:24:51.180 --> 02:24:55.940
resume? Yes, yes, I have mentioned that. See, it's all about

02:24:55.940 --> 02:24:58.940
your resume, right? If you have not mentioned a rag, they

02:24:58.940 --> 02:25:01.800
will not ask, right? If you have mentioned something, some

02:25:01.800 --> 02:25:04.660
sort of MCPs over there, maybe a to a protocol over there,

02:25:04.740 --> 02:25:07.960
they will just try to talk about that one. So like I said,

02:25:08.100 --> 02:25:12.280
whatever you are going to mention inside your resume, people

02:25:12.280 --> 02:25:15.700
will drive most of the time, right? Most of the time, 99% of

02:25:15.700 --> 02:25:21.280
time, interviewer will start with that. And then he or she

02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:26.460
will end up with his or her knowledge and experience. Thank

02:25:26.460 --> 02:25:30.940
you so much. Yeah, thanks. Thanks. Okay, next one, Sumit, go

02:25:30.940 --> 02:25:34.780
ahead. Morning, sir. Sir, I need to share my screen

02:25:34.780 --> 02:25:37.980
actually. Okay, Sumit, fine. I'm facing some issue for

02:25:37.980 --> 02:25:41.260
emitting. Promoting as a panelist. Yeah, you can share now.

02:25:41.620 --> 02:25:46.600
Next one is in between. Varun, go ahead. Yeah, hi. So most

02:25:46.600 --> 02:25:51.080
of the questions have been answered by you. That has been

02:25:51.080 --> 02:25:56.600
asked by Shahid. So one, one additional part is that these

02:25:56.600 --> 02:26:01.760
formats that we are having for different libraries, are they

02:26:01.760 --> 02:26:04.880
in the same structure? Because today, the code that you have

02:26:04.880 --> 02:26:07.180
explained, I've understood it. But if you want to start from

02:26:07.180 --> 02:26:12.000
scratch, without the help of AI and other interfaces, then

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:16.520
it will be a little difficult, right? Because No, no, no, I

02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:19.940
got a question. I think, see, the thing is that, just to

02:26:19.940 --> 02:26:23.060
answer your first question, that all these frameworks are in

02:26:23.060 --> 02:26:26.000
the similar format. Answer is no. Reason, I'll tell you.

02:26:27.040 --> 02:26:29.360
These are different, different companies, right? Let's

02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:31.100
suppose you are a company and you have a if you're trying to

02:26:31.100 --> 02:26:33.260
build some frameworks, obviously, you are going to follow

02:26:33.260 --> 02:26:37.100
your own nomenclature. And this is what they have basically

02:26:37.100 --> 02:26:41.000
done, right? Because company-wise, there is no

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:44.000
standardization at all. In between, like, you know, creating

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:45.960
this framework that you should always create this way or

02:26:45.960 --> 02:26:50.640
that way. No, there is not. So again, like coming to the

02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:55.360
second part, implementation part. So implementation-wise, we

02:26:55.360 --> 02:27:00.200
never remember anything, right? Even I don't remember any of

02:27:00.200 --> 02:27:03.120
these things. Like frameworks or libraries. I just

02:27:03.120 --> 02:27:06.280
understand the core concept. I understand that what is the

02:27:06.280 --> 02:27:08.700
meaning of tool. I understand that what is the meaning of

02:27:08.700 --> 02:27:12.400
agent. I understand my business. What I'm solving, right?

02:27:12.480 --> 02:27:15.520
For example, today we were trying to solve something where

02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:19.380
some file will keep on coming inside a folder. System is

02:27:19.380 --> 02:27:22.420
supposed to watch that file. System is supposed to pick that

02:27:22.420 --> 02:27:25.640
file. We know that that file will be available into an image

02:27:25.640 --> 02:27:28.900
format. So system is supposed to implement the OCR. Then

02:27:28.900 --> 02:27:32.560
system is supposed to send that file. OCR extracted to some

02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:36.020
LLM so that it will be able to clean it. Then that clean

02:27:36.020 --> 02:27:40.440
data, we have to send it to another system or another tool.

02:27:40.620 --> 02:27:43.840
Or you can say a function which will be able to create the

02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:46.820
structured data. Because I have to ingest those data into

02:27:46.820 --> 02:27:50.740
the SQL system, right? SQL system. So I understand this

02:27:50.740 --> 02:27:54.180
business, right? I understand this entire design. So this is

02:27:54.180 --> 02:27:57.040
the only thing which I understand. This is the only thing

02:27:57.040 --> 02:28:00.680
which I will be thinking about. Now you will come to me and

02:28:00.680 --> 02:28:04.760
you will say that, okay, use langchain. Okay, fine. I'll use

02:28:04.760 --> 02:28:07.340
langchain. I'll build it. You will come and say that use

02:28:07.340 --> 02:28:11.980
Lama indexes. I'll do it. You will say use crew AI. I'll do

02:28:11.980 --> 02:28:15.940
it. Use NA10. I'll do it. So framework and all of those

02:28:15.940 --> 02:28:19.000
things doesn't even matter to me. I know that all of these

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:22.360
frameworks are giving me a facility to create an agent, to

02:28:22.360 --> 02:28:25.680
create any kind of a tool, to access the LLMs, to add some

02:28:25.680 --> 02:28:28.300
sort of a memory. Again, a different kind of a memory.

02:28:28.300 --> 02:28:31.660
Right. I know that they're providing me all kinds of

02:28:31.660 --> 02:28:35.460
connectivities. That's it. Right. Why would I go and

02:28:35.460 --> 02:28:37.840
remember all of these frameworks and its functionality?

02:28:38.060 --> 02:28:41.160
Because there are like four frameworks, right? Tomorrow,

02:28:41.280 --> 02:28:43.640
again, four frameworks will come into picture. There are

02:28:43.640 --> 02:28:46.180
already another 10 frameworks, by the way, which is

02:28:46.180 --> 02:28:48.500
available in the market. I think someone has already talked

02:28:48.500 --> 02:28:51.420
about this live or something, right? I don't remember the

02:28:51.420 --> 02:28:57.120
framework. I just like LiveKit. Sorry. Yeah, LiveKit. So

02:28:57.120 --> 02:28:59.700
LiveKit was a framework. I never heard about it, by the way,

02:28:59.740 --> 02:29:02.620
right? Never heard about it. But yeah, I understand the core

02:29:02.620 --> 02:29:05.620
concept. So I will assume that, okay, fine, LiveKit will not

02:29:05.620 --> 02:29:08.860
be very different. I can just go explore for five to 10

02:29:08.860 --> 02:29:11.560
minutes and then I'll start building it step by step, step

02:29:11.560 --> 02:29:16.620
by step, step by step. So this is how we all should approach

02:29:16.620 --> 02:29:21.530
to the problem, right? Then they will never feel stuck.

02:29:21.830 --> 02:29:25.130
Yeah. Now your question. Yeah. Yeah. So just to build up on

02:29:25.130 --> 02:29:28.650
that is that it is not possible to remove all the frameworks

02:29:28.650 --> 02:29:32.050
that I have. Yes. Yes. So when we start, you know,

02:29:32.070 --> 02:29:36.530
exploring, is it like we have already mentioned that now is

02:29:36.530 --> 02:29:39.710
it time to use vibe coding and all to just understand the

02:29:39.710 --> 02:29:44.110
syntax, to understand how to go about things, at least in

02:29:44.110 --> 02:29:47.610
the initial part. Because without understanding the syntax,

02:29:47.710 --> 02:29:50.930
like in the earlier classes also we have, I have personally

02:29:50.930 --> 02:29:53.170
faced and others have also faced that if you do not

02:29:53.170 --> 02:29:57.850
understand the flow, then if the code works, then it's fine.

02:29:57.850 --> 02:30:02.450
If it doesn't, then for troubleshooting, it will be very

02:30:02.450 --> 02:30:04.110
difficult. I don't understand. Okay. Okay. Let me really do

02:30:04.110 --> 02:30:06.390
that part. See, I don't understand the syntaxes. I

02:30:06.390 --> 02:30:10.110
understand Python programming language. Right. That is a

02:30:10.110 --> 02:30:12.870
difference, right? See, there are hundreds of framework and

02:30:12.870 --> 02:30:15.270
I keep on suggesting that don't go and learn frameworks.

02:30:15.410 --> 02:30:19.210
Right. But I keep on saying that I understand a Python

02:30:19.210 --> 02:30:22.190
programming because at the end of the day, it's just a

02:30:22.190 --> 02:30:24.850
Python, right? It's just a Python or maybe a Java

02:30:24.850 --> 02:30:26.730
implementation you're trying to do. Maybe a .NET

02:30:26.730 --> 02:30:29.790
implementation you're trying to do. So I just understand a

02:30:29.790 --> 02:30:32.990
Python. Now let's suppose I'm a person who have built

02:30:32.990 --> 02:30:35.810
something with the help of Y coding or something and maybe

02:30:35.810 --> 02:30:39.130
my code is not working. It's a very, very big code base.

02:30:39.230 --> 02:30:41.610
It's not working. I'm not able to even get a solution from

02:30:41.610 --> 02:30:44.950
an AI. Personally, I have to jump into it and I have to

02:30:44.950 --> 02:30:48.270
debug it. Okay. That's cool. Not an issue. Like I said, I

02:30:48.270 --> 02:30:51.590
understand Python, how a function can be created, how class

02:30:51.590 --> 02:30:54.430
can be declared, how package can be managed, how error

02:30:54.430 --> 02:30:57.770
handling can be done, how login and monitoring actually

02:30:57.770 --> 02:31:01.590
works, right? How file reading and writing is going to

02:31:01.590 --> 02:31:04.650
happen. I understand all of these things in a well manner.

02:31:04.710 --> 02:31:06.930
And let's suppose I have written a lot of code from the

02:31:06.930 --> 02:31:09.790
scratch for that one. So basically my base is pretty much

02:31:09.790 --> 02:31:13.590
clear. Now tell me any piece of the code in this entire

02:31:13.590 --> 02:31:16.030
world, which I will not be able to understand even by using

02:31:16.030 --> 02:31:18.750
a framework. Let's suppose framework will do what? They will

02:31:18.750 --> 02:31:21.330
introduce a function, right? They will introduce a function.

02:31:21.450 --> 02:31:24.050
I can go and check their documentation, a framework's

02:31:24.050 --> 02:31:26.990
documentation I can go and check and I can check what input

02:31:26.990 --> 02:31:29.130
this function is taking. And what output this function is

02:31:29.130 --> 02:31:31.490
going to give. And I believe this is the only understanding

02:31:31.490 --> 02:31:35.030
which is required from the framework side. Yeah. Usually the

02:31:35.030 --> 02:31:37.330
frameworks will use their custom classes, right? Yeah.

02:31:37.330 --> 02:31:41.090
Custom classes, custom method. Yes. So for example, let me,

02:31:41.110 --> 02:31:44.650
let me share my screen for example. So let's suppose this is

02:31:44.650 --> 02:31:48.090
this, this piece of the code I have used. Right. And let's

02:31:48.090 --> 02:31:52.110
suppose we have technically used this AI node creation over

02:31:52.110 --> 02:31:55.030
here. So this was the framework, right? And this is the

02:31:55.030 --> 02:31:57.950
complete black box for me. Yeah. This screen is visible,

02:31:58.110 --> 02:32:01.630
right? Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. So this is screen. So this is a

02:32:01.630 --> 02:32:03.970
complete black box for me. Let's suppose I don't understand.

02:32:04.130 --> 02:32:07.830
Right. Then I have used add AI node. Yeah. I have used a,

02:32:07.890 --> 02:32:12.030
like I've just used like a add AI node. Okay. Not an issue.

02:32:12.130 --> 02:32:14.470
Add AI node is basically a custom function which has been

02:32:14.470 --> 02:32:18.550
created by URI AI. Technically us, we have created that. But

02:32:18.550 --> 02:32:22.190
at the end of the day, what information is required? Because

02:32:22.190 --> 02:32:24.370
I don't remember, right? I don't remember this particular

02:32:24.370 --> 02:32:27.270
part. Now what information is required? I just need to know

02:32:27.270 --> 02:32:29.630
that. Okay. What it is taking as an input, what it will give

02:32:29.630 --> 02:32:31.530
me as an output. Can I say only this much is required?

02:32:32.230 --> 02:32:36.310
Exactly. Yeah. Then my work is done and this is how the

02:32:36.310 --> 02:32:39.130
entire world works. This is how the entire framework works

02:32:39.130 --> 02:32:41.370
because there are thousands of framework and every thousand

02:32:41.370 --> 02:32:44.790
framework comes with the millions of, or not millions, then

02:32:44.790 --> 02:32:48.070
at least maybe a hundred K, one lakh, two lakh of different

02:32:48.070 --> 02:32:52.870
functions and classes. Right. So technically what I will,

02:32:52.930 --> 02:32:55.790
and again, when you will start building it, right? Believe

02:32:55.790 --> 02:33:00.990
me. When I say I don't remember, technically I do remember a

02:33:00.990 --> 02:33:07.010
lot. The only reason is like, I have used it so many times

02:33:07.010 --> 02:33:09.910
that even though if I don't want to remember something, I

02:33:09.910 --> 02:33:13.370
will end up remembering. Yeah. That happens when we are

02:33:13.370 --> 02:33:16.170
using the traditional Python method because we have been

02:33:16.170 --> 02:33:18.110
doing it for a long time. No, even with the framework. I

02:33:18.110 --> 02:33:20.730
have used, see in my class itself, I have used Langchain,

02:33:20.790 --> 02:33:24.050
Langraph, Lama index, all those frameworks so many times. So

02:33:24.050 --> 02:33:27.070
many times I have explained things. Now I remember. Even I

02:33:27.070 --> 02:33:30.150
say I don't remember anything, but eventually I remember

02:33:30.150 --> 02:33:34.750
everything. Right. Because of like iterations, because of

02:33:34.750 --> 02:33:37.250
iterations. But yeah, for any newcomer, I don't suggest

02:33:37.250 --> 02:33:39.670
that, okay, go ahead and remember everything. I simply say

02:33:39.670 --> 02:33:43.110
that if you're able to connect logically, right, at the end

02:33:43.110 --> 02:33:45.650
of the day, it's just a piece of code, Python code that you

02:33:45.650 --> 02:33:48.810
are dealing with. Nothing more than that. Where you can do

02:33:48.810 --> 02:33:51.090
maybe some sort of function, file reading, file writing,

02:33:51.230 --> 02:33:54.330
exception handling, logging, monitoring, object classes.

02:33:54.330 --> 02:33:59.250
That's it. And that is a fundamental. So if that part is

02:33:59.250 --> 02:34:03.290
clear to me, believe me, any code, whether it's a 10 line of

02:34:03.290 --> 02:34:06.410
a code or 10,000 line of a code, I can understand it in a

02:34:06.410 --> 02:34:09.650
fraction of second. Okay. Okay. The second part of the

02:34:09.650 --> 02:34:14.330
question is, today's code I've understood, but, and how we

02:34:14.330 --> 02:34:18.090
are using also has been responded as per Shahid's question.

02:34:18.370 --> 02:34:22.990
Now, when you are trying to marry the nodes and the edge,

02:34:23.010 --> 02:34:27.950
like you mentioned today. Today's class, I don't think you

02:34:27.950 --> 02:34:31.370
have taught that, right? You have only... I have just called

02:34:31.370 --> 02:34:36.550
it in one separate independent function. Yeah. But I have

02:34:36.550 --> 02:34:39.190
created the instance. I have created the variable, but I

02:34:39.190 --> 02:34:41.910
have not used that variable. I just had to write another two

02:34:41.910 --> 02:34:45.070
line of a code where with the help of Lang graph, I just had

02:34:45.070 --> 02:34:48.490
to call by nodes and my edges basically, because edges is

02:34:48.490 --> 02:34:51.770
something which is defining the relations. Okay. So using

02:34:51.770 --> 02:34:57.250
that LLM in the next class. Lang graph. Lang graph. Lang

02:34:57.250 --> 02:35:01.230
graph. Lang graph API. This is simple. LLM has been used by

02:35:01.230 --> 02:35:05.130
your nodes. Okay. So basically I'll just try to call the

02:35:05.130 --> 02:35:08.110
node and then it's done. And with the help of Lang graph,

02:35:08.210 --> 02:35:11.910
that's the reason I've created the variables. And I can try

02:35:11.910 --> 02:35:15.410
to call that variable inside the Lang graph, basically edge

02:35:15.410 --> 02:35:19.490
variable and node variable. Yes. So, and the relation is

02:35:19.490 --> 02:35:22.590
called the edge, right? Edge. Edge is basically define the

02:35:22.590 --> 02:35:25.310
relation. That from which, how one node is connected with

02:35:25.310 --> 02:35:28.770
the other node. That is basically edge. So this has no

02:35:28.770 --> 02:35:32.450
relationship or, you know, similarity to the, you know,

02:35:32.490 --> 02:35:38.070
decision tree that we used to learn in ML, right? Decision

02:35:38.070 --> 02:35:42.890
tree inside a ML is different. It's a algorithmic approach.

02:35:43.570 --> 02:35:45.870
Here we are trying to create the independent like a

02:35:45.870 --> 02:35:48.590
functions and we are saying that, okay, you give me output.

02:35:48.830 --> 02:35:51.250
I'll send this output as an input to the another one. Then

02:35:51.250 --> 02:35:53.170
this will give me output. So basically it's a flow chart

02:35:53.170 --> 02:35:56.430
like we have in Power BI. It's kind of a, yeah, it's, it's

02:35:56.430 --> 02:35:58.950
kind of a, just a flow, independent things you are trying to

02:35:58.950 --> 02:36:00.770
create and then you are trying to connect those independent

02:36:00.770 --> 02:36:04.350
things. That's it. So, so in the future when, when these

02:36:04.350 --> 02:36:08.450
nodes are, you know, they're in a proper sequence, so they

02:36:08.450 --> 02:36:12.450
will have dependency on the latency or the lags that the

02:36:12.450 --> 02:36:16.790
earlier modules have. So is there any way to, you know, fine

02:36:16.790 --> 02:36:20.030
tune those individual nodes? Yeah, we do it. We do it a lot.

02:36:20.030 --> 02:36:24.770
Yeah, we do. We do it a lot. So in case of a dependency or

02:36:24.770 --> 02:36:27.970
if you don't want to wait other node, once one node is

02:36:27.970 --> 02:36:30.610
already waiting. So I think I would, we try to call a

02:36:30.610 --> 02:36:33.010
threading. We try to call over there a parallel processing.

02:36:33.110 --> 02:36:35.530
We try to call it over there are forking. We try to do it

02:36:35.530 --> 02:36:38.290
over there. There are multiple ways case by case. We try to

02:36:38.290 --> 02:36:41.870
handle. So these will be explained in future classes or we

02:36:41.870 --> 02:36:44.330
have just started with the agents, right? So we have to go

02:36:44.330 --> 02:36:47.110
like a long, long way to create the agents. So many agents

02:36:47.110 --> 02:36:53.750
we have to create. Thanks. Thanks. Thank you. Okay. I think

02:36:53.750 --> 02:36:57.690
Varun, Sumit is sharing his screen, right? Sumit. Yes, sir.

02:36:57.710 --> 02:37:02.210
Sir, actually I'm getting this embedding error. I think I

02:37:02.210 --> 02:37:04.610
tried it. What is the issue?

02:37:07.850 --> 02:37:12.990
HTTP 404. Show me the embedding function. Yeah.

02:37:17.430 --> 02:37:20.490
Embeddings. Yes, here you have done a mistake. I can see the

02:37:20.490 --> 02:37:23.270
space. Line number 10. Embedding function. After the

02:37:23.270 --> 02:37:25.810
loading, there is a space there. Yes, remove it. Yes, save.

02:37:30.790 --> 02:37:31.310
Now,

02:37:35.660 --> 02:37:39.960
run it once again. Yes, run it.

02:37:58.010 --> 02:38:02.770
Now it has been removed. Trash bag request 401. Client error

02:38:02.770 --> 02:38:07.910
unauthorized for URL. Show me your API key once. Yes, sir.

02:38:09.450 --> 02:38:14.290
Where have you kept API key unauthorized? So it should not

02:38:14.290 --> 02:38:17.350
be. API. I have written it once. Do not have it.

02:39:01.820 --> 02:39:07.160
I tried a couple of times, but it didn't work. I had made

02:39:07.160 --> 02:39:10.080
two projects in this, but there were only two or four coming

02:39:10.080 --> 02:39:15.880
here. You can just take any name XYZ and do it. Click on

02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:16.160
create.

02:39:21.300 --> 02:39:22.100
Copy it.

02:39:28.590 --> 02:39:29.090
Where

02:39:41.090 --> 02:39:43.870
are you reading the API, by the way, in this?

02:39:52.220 --> 02:39:57.740
I followed the same thing in your project. Are you sure you

02:39:57.740 --> 02:40:02.700
are reading from here? There are no current variables. This

02:40:02.700 --> 02:40:06.820
is where I needed it. Okay, so replace it.

02:40:43.350 --> 02:40:46.170
Bad request. What is it showing at the bottom? Come down,

02:40:46.170 --> 02:40:48.870
come down. At

02:40:52.420 --> 02:40:58.600
the bottom. No response. Give me one minute. Let's see what

02:40:58.600 --> 02:41:05.560
the problem is. Give me screen access. Screen

02:41:18.970 --> 02:41:21.670
access? Yes. We can do it.

02:43:20.540 --> 02:43:27.460
You are calling the Autonomous Pipeline in the app. Then the

02:43:27.460 --> 02:43:30.820
Autonomous Pipeline is going to the build graph and invoking

02:43:30.820 --> 02:43:32.900
the Langflow Graph. Basically, this is calling the build

02:43:32.900 --> 02:43:37.220
Langraph. After calling the build Langraph, you are calling

02:43:37.220 --> 02:43:43.040
the instance of the graph. State graph dot this one. Where

02:43:43.040 --> 02:43:48.390
is the API call in this, by the way? I don't understand.

02:43:49.270 --> 02:43:54.230
What are you trying to do here, technically? Because the

02:43:54.230 --> 02:43:57.410
story starts from here, right? From the app, basically. And

02:43:57.410 --> 02:44:01.250
first of all, you are calling this one. Autonomous Pipeline

02:44:01.250 --> 02:44:04.830
from here. This will be called first. In this, we are

02:44:04.830 --> 02:44:10.770
calling the build Langraph. And then inside this, what is

02:44:10.770 --> 02:44:15.330
happening? How are we building this Langraph? And where are

02:44:15.330 --> 02:44:18.910
we using the API? Although, I understand that you are adding

02:44:18.910 --> 02:44:23.290
node or connecting node. That's okay. Right. But what is

02:44:23.290 --> 02:44:27.710
happening before this? I literally don't understand this.

02:44:27.710 --> 02:44:29.230
And then API, how are you passing it here?

02:44:34.070 --> 02:44:38.930
From where did you pick up this code? Sir, this is your, the

02:44:38.930 --> 02:44:44.150
best one, the generative AI one. The blue one. I was making

02:44:44.150 --> 02:44:47.510
projects in that, the Langraph. I was following that class.

02:44:48.210 --> 02:44:51.410
No, no, no. You have done something up and down in this.

02:44:53.110 --> 02:44:54.970
Basically. This is up and down.

02:44:58.480 --> 02:45:00.160
Researcher API tool is fine. The mapper is understanding.

02:45:00.580 --> 02:45:02.660
The researcher is understanding that the mapper will map.

02:45:02.660 --> 02:45:05.400
The researcher will call. The synthesizer will call. Okay.

02:45:05.620 --> 02:45:09.320
The tool is here. The tool API will call. On the head.

02:45:09.700 --> 02:45:13.360
Wikipedia is there. Langraph route.

02:45:16.680 --> 02:45:17.100
A

02:45:23.250 --> 02:45:26.150
lot of things are done up and down. I can see it in this.

02:45:26.490 --> 02:45:27.070
The

02:45:30.750 --> 02:45:34.490
next visual code is open from your project. If you want to

02:45:34.490 --> 02:45:38.170
take reference from it. There are no changes in it. Okay,

02:45:38.230 --> 02:45:43.430
then show me the original one. Which one is original? This

02:45:43.430 --> 02:45:49.710
one, I think. Wikipedia tool. Yes. This one is original,

02:45:49.810 --> 02:45:52.250
right? Original. One minute. Yes.

02:45:55.440 --> 02:45:56.020
I

02:46:19.060 --> 02:46:22.860
have to search synthesizer. Then mapper. Run

02:47:12.050 --> 02:47:19.230
researcher. So here. Run researcher. We will do it. Okay.

02:47:19.530 --> 02:47:23.070
The Google is calling from here. From here. It is calling.

02:47:23.450 --> 02:47:26.110
Run synthesizer. Run mapper. We will call. Then we will add

02:47:26.110 --> 02:47:31.010
the node. Okay. Add edge is done. Graph. Compile. Then it

02:47:31.010 --> 02:47:35.630
will compile and return and send it to me. Okay. Build

02:47:35.630 --> 02:47:43.560
graph. Run researcher. We called the agent here. And. Then.

02:47:47.050 --> 02:47:49.710
Run researchers. When we are doing it. Then the researcher

02:47:49.710 --> 02:47:55.250
will call his API himself. So. Surfer API Wikipedia tool.

02:47:55.790 --> 02:48:00.450
Suppose if we call the Wikipedia tool, then it will call

02:48:00.450 --> 02:48:09.880
here. Okay. Researcher. Utility. Graph. Converter. Config.

02:48:10.160 --> 02:48:16.100
Dot. Pie. Nothing. Graph. Converter. Then it will do it in

02:48:16.100 --> 02:48:19.120
the graph. Wikipedia. Research tool was done. Output graph

02:48:19.120 --> 02:48:22.280
is done. Synthesizer. Run

02:48:32.810 --> 02:48:33.810
synthesizer.

02:48:36.560 --> 02:48:45.340
Generate completion. And here is the URI client. Okay. So we

02:48:45.340 --> 02:48:48.480
are loading the API from the environment here.

02:48:51.560 --> 02:48:52.240
Okay.

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:04.080
Fine. Change this API once. Yes sir. API ki jo hai na,

02:49:04.100 --> 02:49:09.260
change ki ji ek baar aur like, yaha par ye wale mein. Main

02:49:09.260 --> 02:49:12.540
copy already kar kiya toh. Haan, dusre wale aapne kiya tha

02:49:12.540 --> 02:49:18.180
na, copy kahin par. Main aap se utha leta ho. So, let's see.

02:49:25.070 --> 02:49:29.770
Yeah. Aap ka location ismein alag hai actually. Aapne bahar

02:49:29.770 --> 02:49:34.510
kar diya hai, app file ko. It looks like. Thik

02:49:38.920 --> 02:49:43.140
hai, yaha par, kaha par hai, iske parallel mein knowledge

02:49:43.140 --> 02:49:49.180
graph. Thik hai, I will check. Nee sir. Yeh ho gaya, aapne

02:49:49.180 --> 02:49:53.840
change kar diya? Okay. Control S, uske baad phir yaha par

02:49:53.840 --> 02:49:57.560
dekhte hain, DIR. CD, knowledge graph.

02:50:02.330 --> 02:50:07.330
Thik hai, DIR. Yaha par app hai. Streamlit.

02:50:09.910 --> 02:50:16.670
D-R-E-M-N-I-T, Streamlit, run. Run app. App.py.

02:50:31.660 --> 02:50:36.920
Enter the question, topic, okay. Program of, agent API.

02:50:37.620 --> 02:50:38.140
Okay.

02:50:41.820 --> 02:50:45.840
Node map is a dead end. Aacha, toh yaha par yeh aur garbad

02:50:45.840 --> 02:50:49.740
hai. Autonomous pipeline build.

02:50:55.670 --> 02:50:58.210
Yaha toh isko node hi mapping nahi pada chal raha hai pehle

02:50:58.210 --> 02:50:58.470
toh.

02:51:03.540 --> 02:51:07.360
Kaunsa project mein diya wala code tha yeh wala? Kaunsa?

02:51:07.820 --> 02:51:11.320
Main. Kaunsa? Maan. Exit.

02:51:14.450 --> 02:51:18.570
Code agar upload kiye honge toh, wo toh test kar kiye upload

02:51:18.570 --> 02:51:23.970
kiye honge padhane ke baad. Aur agar wo class mein chal raha

02:51:23.970 --> 02:51:26.990
hai toh wo chalna chahiye har jaga. Ne, thoda sa issue hai.

02:51:27.030 --> 02:51:29.710
Wala se issue ko jyada hai nahi. Bad ke 15-20 minute fix

02:51:29.710 --> 02:51:35.390
karne se fix ho jayega. Just a mapping issue. Though, not a

02:51:35.390 --> 02:51:43.990
big one. Chahiye wale ka hai. Nahi, lag application. Okay.

02:51:44.090 --> 02:51:48.070
So, lag and, okay, lang chain ke saath. So, lag application

02:51:48.070 --> 02:51:56.790
hai yeh wala. Theek hai. Hmm. Chahiye wala. Theek hai. Theek

02:51:56.790 --> 02:51:57.510
hai. Samajh gaya hai.

02:52:08.860 --> 02:52:12.480
Nobara open kar lo. Noi, nahi, theek hai. Hum phudi access

02:52:12.480 --> 02:52:16.100
kar lete hain isko. Lag chain. Lag with the lang chain.

02:53:12.500 --> 02:53:14.400
Lag with the lang chain hai? Nahi, iske handa toh nahi dikh

02:53:14.400 --> 02:53:16.540
raha hai meko yeh wala code. Iske handa toh faasi indexes

02:53:16.540 --> 02:53:19.000
dikh raha hai. Uska hai. Phir, lag lang chain meh koi. Iko

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:20.520
IPO any file dikh raha hai yeh wale meh.

02:53:23.300 --> 02:53:24.860
Sure, lag with the lang chain wala hai.

02:53:30.400 --> 02:53:33.120
Nahi, toh uske baaz wala hoga maybe mere khayal se memory

02:53:33.120 --> 02:53:37.660
based chatbot. Yeh toh nahi hai. Confirmed hai. So, yeh

02:53:37.660 --> 02:53:42.100
fourth meh wali meh. LLM application. 20, kaunse wali yeh?

02:53:42.660 --> 02:53:46.300
Fourth meh. Aja, fourth meh. Okay. Understand the LLM

02:53:46.300 --> 02:53:51.100
application. 20 agent graph. Chahiye gaya. Okay. Haan, yeh

02:53:51.100 --> 02:53:53.680
wala hai. 20 agent graph.

02:54:23.620 --> 02:54:26.060
Aapne scene sath mein shop karoon sath? So that I can see

02:54:26.060 --> 02:54:30.860
your screen? Haan, bus download ho gaya hai. Ek minute test

02:54:30.860 --> 02:54:32.540
kar leta hai yeh usme kya issue hai.

02:57:21.690 --> 02:57:25.150
Okay, got it. This was the project, right? Now I remember.

02:57:25.990 --> 02:57:28.910
Baha saar project hota hai toh. Haan, it's running actually

02:57:28.910 --> 02:57:29.490
in my system.

02:57:33.600 --> 02:57:36.620
It's actually running. I have not done anything. I have just

02:57:36.620 --> 02:57:38.420
done some work. I have just changed my URI API key. That's

02:57:38.420 --> 02:57:42.460
it. And technically it's working. Let me show it to you.

02:57:44.280 --> 02:57:45.560
Kaha gaya? Zoom.

02:57:48.930 --> 02:57:51.670
Same project. So like I told you, right? I think aapne kuch

02:57:51.670 --> 02:57:54.370
toh kiya hoga. I don't know. Check karna padega ek baar. Do

02:57:54.370 --> 02:57:58.130
teen minute lagayega debug karne me. But so this is the

02:57:58.130 --> 02:58:00.870
project which I am running in my system. Just I have like

02:58:00.870 --> 02:58:04.910
given my latest URI API key. That's it. And this is the

02:58:04.910 --> 02:58:07.210
knowledge graph generator, right? So which can generate a

02:58:07.210 --> 02:58:11.310
graph. For me, basically. So yeah, it is. It is like able to

02:58:11.310 --> 02:58:17.870
generate this graph for me. The entire system. I think it's

02:58:17.870 --> 02:58:21.350
a URI API change karna hai. Nahi baas URI API hai change

02:58:21.350 --> 02:58:24.370
kiya hai. Aur kuch nahi kiya nahi hai hamne waise. Okay.

02:58:26.030 --> 02:58:28.510
Sirf URI API hamne change kiya. Folder ke andar gaye. Usko

02:58:28.510 --> 02:58:32.810
run kara diya. Then it's like working for me. And hum

02:58:32.810 --> 02:58:35.950
download kar para hai yaar par apna SBG file bhi. Aap dekh

02:58:35.950 --> 02:58:39.330
sakte ho. Ye, ye. Bikul. It is. So, this one.

02:58:42.280 --> 02:58:46.960
It's. I mean it's working. The thing which was made for it.

02:58:47.460 --> 02:58:51.160
That is working. This one. Nothing is required. I just

02:58:51.160 --> 02:58:53.720
changed this part. Us samay hum log ka URI ka format bhi

02:58:53.720 --> 02:58:57.860
alag tha, API ka. So, I think. Jahan log use kar rahe tha.

02:58:57.880 --> 02:59:00.880
Then later stage we have changed the URI API format. But yes

02:59:00.880 --> 02:59:03.840
this is the only thing that you have to change apart from

02:59:03.840 --> 02:59:08.140
that. Jo jaisa hai. Vaisa hi rahega. So, if you want I can,

02:59:08.140 --> 02:59:09.400
I can send you this one.

02:59:37.980 --> 02:59:39.380
maybe you can test it with my api

02:59:42.540 --> 02:59:47.160
we don't care about that but if this is the error code then

02:59:47.160 --> 02:59:48.680
this could be the possible reason

03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:12.920
like for embedding, for chat completion, then how much is

03:00:12.920 --> 03:00:13.840
there in embedding, then how much is there in chat

03:00:13.840 --> 03:00:17.380
completion and then which model of embedding, you can see

03:00:17.380 --> 03:00:20.540
all these stats here and if there was an error then how many

03:00:20.540 --> 03:00:23.640
times did you hit the error, what was the error after that

03:00:24.480 --> 03:00:28.980
then if you go to logs then you will see more on the micro

03:00:28.980 --> 03:00:34.400
level micro means like we just hit it 4 minutes before to

03:00:34.400 --> 03:00:38.960
test it so which model we hit there and then like

03:00:38.960 --> 03:00:44.160
approximate token was used in 358, prompt token was used in

03:00:44.160 --> 03:00:48.900
2744 and then I got this response, so everything is being

03:00:48.900 --> 03:00:51.580
logged here you can see all the information that you need

03:00:51.580 --> 03:00:58.420
here so total token used was this much in completion token

03:00:58.420 --> 03:01:03.880
it was 358 and in prompt token it was 2744 so total is 3102

03:01:03.880 --> 03:01:08.400
so I don't think anything else is needed I think this is

03:01:08.400 --> 03:01:13.860
enough right yes sir, you are right and the stats is more

03:01:13.860 --> 03:01:17.080
than enough to understand I was trying to see where my

03:01:17.080 --> 03:01:20.620
control, ok sometimes this happened ok usage, how many times

03:01:20.620 --> 03:01:23.740
that happened, two more details yes sir, thank you sir so

03:01:23.740 --> 03:01:26.060
here you can track in the users, the overall usage is

03:01:26.060 --> 03:01:30.120
tracked here then model wise too, model wise everything and

03:01:30.120 --> 03:01:32.860
if you want to go more on the micro level then logs logs

03:01:32.860 --> 03:01:36.040
means in full detail, in full depth that what happened

03:01:36.040 --> 03:01:40.140
basically in that hit that too you will get to know sure

03:01:40.140 --> 03:01:41.700
sir, thank you for the details

03:01:44.940 --> 03:01:50.400
I should answer sir please go ahead Rameez can you please

03:01:50.400 --> 03:01:53.240
share your screen, I have one doubt from the today code so I

03:01:53.240 --> 03:01:58.500
should share, ok fine, let me share my screen yes please ok

03:01:58.500 --> 03:02:02.040
so here it is actually you have the same place right

03:02:02.040 --> 03:02:06.720
actually you used some ginger template right yes can you

03:02:06.720 --> 03:02:10.300
please tell me why you are using the double curly braces

03:02:10.300 --> 03:02:14.840
that the blob, which one you showed to the blob which one,

03:02:14.840 --> 03:02:19.460
which one, this the double curly braces and also context you

03:02:19.460 --> 03:02:22.360
are passing clean text, clean underscore text right with

03:02:22.360 --> 03:02:25.060
curly braces so where the values is getting from clean

03:02:25.060 --> 03:02:27.240
underscore, basically value will be getting here this is

03:02:27.240 --> 03:02:29.520
double curly braces means actually it's not taking any

03:02:29.520 --> 03:02:32.840
values over here just like a plain text this is actually a

03:02:32.840 --> 03:02:36.760
value which I am taking clean text yeah where does it come

03:02:36.760 --> 03:02:41.200
from? the variable so whenever you are going to call this

03:02:41.200 --> 03:02:43.980
particular graph right whenever you are going to call this

03:02:43.980 --> 03:02:47.480
particular node at that point of a time you have to provide

03:02:47.480 --> 03:02:50.340
this one basically it's coming from one node to another node

03:02:50.340 --> 03:02:55.080
this clean text can we give any name do we need to give this

03:02:55.080 --> 03:02:57.540
name or any name so we have given this name call as extract

03:02:57.540 --> 03:03:02.460
right yeah yeah so we have given the name of the node is

03:03:02.460 --> 03:03:05.640
basically extract and then task of this node is basically

03:03:05.640 --> 03:03:10.780
this one okay okay task of the node yeah we are only saying

03:03:10.780 --> 03:03:13.200
that okay fine so extract node and whenever we are going to

03:03:13.200 --> 03:03:15.940
call the extract node so the previous one is supposed to

03:03:15.940 --> 03:03:19.200
provide me some text clean text is just for the reference

03:03:19.200 --> 03:03:22.500
but yeah some text it is supposed to provide it to me this

03:03:22.500 --> 03:03:26.720
is what like do we give any name instead of the clean

03:03:26.720 --> 03:03:30.160
underscore text can we give any other name as well you can

03:03:30.160 --> 03:03:34.360
try to give any other name over here like I have given OCR

03:03:34.360 --> 03:03:39.220
text over here and I have given a clean text over here it's

03:03:39.220 --> 03:03:42.500
completely up to me I can give a Sudhanshu over here doesn't

03:03:42.500 --> 03:03:48.620
matter at all okay okay yeah that is fine sir and one more

03:03:48.620 --> 03:03:53.320
question actually I have had some recent meetup from my

03:03:53.320 --> 03:03:57.380
organization so they talked about the quantum mechanics plus

03:03:57.380 --> 03:04:00.540
AI bootcamp use cases okay the clean text that you talked

03:04:00.540 --> 03:04:03.540
about so here what we are doing so we are trying to call

03:04:03.540 --> 03:04:07.680
that graph right just focus now here so we are trying to

03:04:07.680 --> 03:04:12.160
call that graph over here right and then there is graph.run

03:04:12.160 --> 03:04:15.520
technically what it will do so it will try to call this one

03:04:16.180 --> 03:04:20.200
it will try to call this graph right means this one it will

03:04:20.200 --> 03:04:23.360
try to call now here I am trying to provide Sudhanshu let's

03:04:23.360 --> 03:04:26.720
suppose yeah I am trying to provide a Sudhanshu so clean

03:04:26.720 --> 03:04:30.320
text and then column Sudhanshu so key is basically let's

03:04:30.320 --> 03:04:33.880
suppose like a clean text I am trying to give and then value

03:04:33.880 --> 03:04:39.040
wise like Sudhanshu I am trying to provide now so here you

03:04:39.040 --> 03:04:43.300
need a same mapping so that it will be able to understand

03:04:44.080 --> 03:04:47.360
let me node extractor right so this is the graph call right

03:04:47.360 --> 03:04:51.280
this is the graph call oh okay got it got it so here

03:04:51.280 --> 03:04:54.160
whatever name because you can try to give any name see I

03:04:54.160 --> 03:04:56.960
have given clean text any and then I have named it as a

03:04:56.960 --> 03:05:00.980
clean text yeah understood maybe or maybe I can try to give

03:05:00.980 --> 03:05:03.340
Sudhanshu this one right here I can give Sudhanshu and then

03:05:03.340 --> 03:05:06.840
I can map to anything so technically this is how but the

03:05:06.840 --> 03:05:08.980
only thing which I am trying to do is I am trying to call

03:05:08.980 --> 03:05:11.560
this graph here that's it so whatever parameter that you are

03:05:11.560 --> 03:05:13.780
providing and whatever name you should just match with the

03:05:14.280 --> 03:05:16.740
name which is given over there that's it that's the only

03:05:16.740 --> 03:05:20.260
requirement okay understood but whatever name we can give

03:05:20.260 --> 03:05:23.840
over there but we can map the same name here yeah and this

03:05:23.840 --> 03:05:25.900
is how this graph will be called so here we are calling the

03:05:25.900 --> 03:05:30.380
graph means not graph technically a node we are trying to

03:05:30.380 --> 03:05:34.740
call here yeah and one more question sir do we also cover

03:05:34.740 --> 03:05:38.640
some examples for MCP or fine tuning MCP is also already a

03:05:38.640 --> 03:05:41.140
part of a syllabus so MCP we are covering I am going to

03:05:41.140 --> 03:05:44.700
cover MCP by the way and fine tuning as well right fine

03:05:44.700 --> 03:05:47.760
tuning also yes yes whatever is a part of syllabus obviously

03:05:47.760 --> 03:05:52.160
like we will go through it okay okay and what is the

03:05:52.160 --> 03:05:55.460
tomorrow agenda sir actually tomorrow so with the help of

03:05:55.460 --> 03:05:59.520
lang graph by using a lang graph API how I can execute this

03:05:59.520 --> 03:06:03.980
this kind of a things within within how I can execute how I

03:06:03.980 --> 03:06:06.780
can execute this structure by calling direct not by calling

03:06:06.780 --> 03:06:10.460
this one by calling a lang graph API itself again like a

03:06:10.460 --> 03:06:13.440
couple of more line of code that's it and then crew AI so

03:06:13.440 --> 03:06:15.500
how I can try to solve some of the problem with the help of

03:06:15.500 --> 03:06:19.160
crew AI coding part not like a vibe coding coding part okay

03:06:19.160 --> 03:06:23.060
so will you be able to see the tree structure here tomorrow

03:06:23.060 --> 03:06:26.380
I think graph structure right yeah graph structure yeah

03:06:26.380 --> 03:06:28.560
graph structure yes yeah graph I will show you basically

03:06:28.560 --> 03:06:32.400
graph structure is been created by a separate library called

03:06:32.400 --> 03:06:35.720
as graph which or maybe any other graph library I can try to

03:06:35.720 --> 03:06:38.320
use and then I can show you the graph structure but yes I

03:06:38.320 --> 03:06:41.400
will try to show you graph structure yeah yeah okay okay

03:06:41.400 --> 03:06:45.500
yeah and yeah and also for the related on quantum mechanics

03:06:45.500 --> 03:06:49.560
plus AI right and how dominating this kind of quantum

03:06:49.560 --> 03:06:54.360
mechanics because we have not sure about now because it's in

03:06:54.360 --> 03:06:58.300
a research I keep on reading lot of things about the quantum

03:06:58.300 --> 03:07:02.440
mechanics but I think we will have to wait obviously it's a

03:07:02.440 --> 03:07:06.480
very good thing in terms of like using computes obviously it

03:07:06.480 --> 03:07:09.920
is going to increase a lot of capacity but unless and until

03:07:09.920 --> 03:07:15.100
it's not available for us for a public we can't comment yeah

03:07:15.100 --> 03:07:18.560
because so I am asking this question in actually in two days

03:07:18.560 --> 03:07:24.320
back maybe they have provided some use cases to the customer

03:07:24.840 --> 03:07:29.420
here no our company has proposed some use cases but I am not

03:07:29.420 --> 03:07:33.060
sure whether do we have the solution which is already

03:07:33.060 --> 03:07:35.720
available or not but they proposed some use cases with

03:07:35.720 --> 03:07:39.160
quantum plus AI but I was not part of the meeting that's why

03:07:39.160 --> 03:07:43.260
I am asking but yeah quantum if like we don't have a you

03:07:43.260 --> 03:07:46.200
know system available to us the entire setup available to us

03:07:46.740 --> 03:07:50.360
we can't do anything except talking about it and it's not

03:07:50.360 --> 03:07:52.960
available to a public especially to people like us right

03:07:52.960 --> 03:07:57.000
it's not available it's not available okay yeah it's not

03:07:57.000 --> 03:07:59.440
available so we can't even talk about it we can't do

03:07:59.440 --> 03:08:04.160
experimentation right that yeah then my next question

03:08:04.160 --> 03:08:09.180
actually we have been seeing lot of use cases from structure

03:08:09.180 --> 03:08:15.080
unstructured data text processing but are we able to cover

03:08:15.080 --> 03:08:20.340
some image or video related use cases sir I think OCR that

03:08:20.340 --> 03:08:22.360
we have done so basically that was an image related things

03:08:22.980 --> 03:08:26.180
yeah that is we are extracting text only right but not we

03:08:26.180 --> 03:08:29.180
are extracting image image we can use the open means we are

03:08:29.180 --> 03:08:32.100
processing the images technically I was processing SVG right

03:08:32.100 --> 03:08:35.760
this file was our PNG this file is basically an image this

03:08:35.760 --> 03:08:39.780
is a PNG file okay yeah yeah we are dealing with the image

03:08:39.780 --> 03:08:44.780
this is actually an image right so content inside the image

03:08:44.780 --> 03:08:48.240
is obviously like a text only but technically it's an image

03:08:48.240 --> 03:08:52.080
that we are talking about yeah because if there is any logo

03:08:52.080 --> 03:08:56.180
or some other signature or something no is it kind of the

03:08:56.180 --> 03:08:58.320
real image we generally try to use OCR kind of a things

03:08:58.320 --> 03:09:01.480
again there are like powerful OCR and so on or maybe you can

03:09:01.480 --> 03:09:05.340
go ahead with the AWS OCR which is way more powerful which

03:09:05.340 --> 03:09:08.180
can extract and understand even a different different

03:09:08.180 --> 03:09:12.560
elements available inside the images maybe some image inside

03:09:12.560 --> 03:09:15.220
the images maybe some sort of a logos maybe some sort of a

03:09:15.220 --> 03:09:19.340
signature or maybe a text easy OCR which I have used it is

03:09:19.340 --> 03:09:22.780
good with respect to recognizing your handwriting it is good

03:09:22.780 --> 03:09:24.580
with respect to recognizing any kind of a textual

03:09:24.580 --> 03:09:27.620
information apart from textual information if like it's a

03:09:27.620 --> 03:09:32.920
signature kind of information it will not be that great ok

03:09:32.920 --> 03:09:37.480
got it got it ok and look like the use cases we ran

03:09:37.480 --> 03:09:43.800
everything in our local machine right but are we able to

03:09:43.800 --> 03:09:49.300
show some some use cases in parallel parallel manner no

03:09:49.300 --> 03:09:53.240
across the server suppose for example let us implement

03:09:53.240 --> 03:09:59.400
multiple agents use cases can we also so costing some agent

03:09:59.400 --> 03:10:02.400
with different different server and are we able to

03:10:02.400 --> 03:10:04.640
communicate we will do that we will do that we will do that

03:10:04.640 --> 03:10:09.320
right that use case ok ok ok sir thank you so much yeah

03:10:09.320 --> 03:10:14.140
thanks let me go through this thank you ok so next question

03:10:14.140 --> 03:10:19.520
guys Nares and Abhijit you are the only one who is left hi

03:10:19.520 --> 03:10:24.320
Sudhanshu yeah hi go ahead please yeah so my first question

03:10:24.320 --> 03:10:28.360
regarding syllabus so last session we had we have covered

03:10:28.360 --> 03:10:32.780
lang change right it is done or future another you take any

03:10:32.780 --> 03:10:35.740
basically with respect to with respect to deployment we are

03:10:35.740 --> 03:10:38.640
not done means with respect to a lang serve we are not done

03:10:38.640 --> 03:10:43.820
which is I think a part of your later syllabus yesterday I

03:10:43.820 --> 03:10:46.640
was checking your syllabus I was thinking about discussing a

03:10:46.640 --> 03:10:49.840
lang serve today but then I saw your syllabus I said that ok

03:10:50.480 --> 03:10:53.560
let's go and discuss lang graph because lang serve is anyhow

03:10:53.560 --> 03:10:58.660
mentioned in later stage of your syllabus ok ok so my second

03:10:58.660 --> 03:11:03.680
question is like regarding today's class I have an exact use

03:11:03.680 --> 03:11:08.240
case see I am working in an organization we are 5000 plus

03:11:08.240 --> 03:11:12.380
employees are there especially sales people are there so

03:11:12.380 --> 03:11:15.900
whenever they travel out station they need to submit you

03:11:15.900 --> 03:11:21.020
know lot of hotel bills you know food bills right even cab

03:11:21.020 --> 03:11:27.080
bills so we have a team of over I think 20 plus ok who is

03:11:27.080 --> 03:11:29.920
you know validating these invoices and the processes in them

03:11:29.920 --> 03:11:35.020
right so this is exact I think this is the exact use case

03:11:35.020 --> 03:11:38.580
where we can replicate this exactly exactly exactly exact

03:11:38.580 --> 03:11:42.520
use cases plus I believe like see bills are everywhere right

03:11:42.520 --> 03:11:44.420
doesn't matter it's a smaller organization or bigger

03:11:44.420 --> 03:11:47.240
organization and believe me those 20 people are not required

03:11:47.240 --> 03:11:52.260
maybe just one and and yeah here is the my doubt now when it

03:11:52.260 --> 03:11:56.600
comes to replacing human with agent so how authentic is it

03:11:56.600 --> 03:12:00.220
bill authenticity will be verified because people start

03:12:00.220 --> 03:12:03.860
checking how humans are checking it by the way at least we

03:12:03.860 --> 03:12:10.240
are checking you know might be they are checking date name

03:12:11.560 --> 03:12:16.500
and what was the bill amount ok ok ok I will tell you one

03:12:16.500 --> 03:12:19.180
thing how agents can be much better than the humans being

03:12:19.180 --> 03:12:21.820
right in terms of even checking the authenticity of the bill

03:12:21.820 --> 03:12:25.060
right information which is available inside the bill see

03:12:25.060 --> 03:12:27.960
human can be a biased one right let's suppose there is a

03:12:27.960 --> 03:12:32.300
bill from XYG restaurant right or XYG cab services let's

03:12:32.300 --> 03:12:34.140
suppose there will be a GST number which will be mentioned

03:12:34.140 --> 03:12:36.400
maybe GST number is not mentioned if it is a registered

03:12:36.400 --> 03:12:39.580
business obviously GST number should be available on a bills

03:12:39.580 --> 03:12:42.440
right even if it is a hand written bill but still on a bill

03:12:42.440 --> 03:12:44.820
template GST number will should be mentioned or maybe their

03:12:44.820 --> 03:12:48.020
name should be mentioned now let's suppose you are

03:12:48.020 --> 03:12:51.820
processing 5000 bills you have a 20 people team member every

03:12:51.820 --> 03:12:54.740
day you are processing 5000 bills maybe every team member

03:12:54.740 --> 03:12:57.340
may be processing 500 something like a kind of a bills on a

03:12:57.340 --> 03:13:03.140
daily basis yeah now there is a 100% guarantee that every

03:13:03.140 --> 03:13:06.800
will not every will will not go through a proper scrutiny

03:13:06.800 --> 03:13:10.360
scrutiny means that whether it is it was a genuine will

03:13:10.360 --> 03:13:13.620
which was generated also fake bill because we all know that

03:13:13.620 --> 03:13:17.560
in organization right even in IT industry we submit a lot of

03:13:17.560 --> 03:13:21.460
fake bills right we all do it right let's to be honest we

03:13:21.460 --> 03:13:24.120
all do it and we all have done that at some point of a time

03:13:24.120 --> 03:13:28.480
yes correct yeah we all have done that you have an idea I

03:13:28.480 --> 03:13:32.920
know it's no no no us actually even I have done that like

03:13:32.920 --> 03:13:36.880
maybe in my previous organization right so I don't have like

03:13:36.880 --> 03:13:41.560
any shame in terms of accepting it yeah we all did it then

03:13:41.560 --> 03:13:44.700
we stopped doing it because of fear or maybe because of

03:13:44.700 --> 03:13:48.420
maturity or whatever you can say right but yeah now let's

03:13:48.420 --> 03:13:51.120
talk about this agent obviously it is able to extract the

03:13:51.120 --> 03:13:55.060
data now based on that data which is available can I say

03:13:55.060 --> 03:13:58.220
that it can go and automatically initiate a Google search

03:13:58.220 --> 03:14:02.140
about the organization about a GST number it can do yes

03:14:02.140 --> 03:14:05.740
possible not not possible it's practically possible just

03:14:05.740 --> 03:14:08.700
just call the server API pass that same data the data that

03:14:08.700 --> 03:14:10.760
you are extracting with the help of OCR pass that into a

03:14:10.760 --> 03:14:14.520
server server will try to like pull all the information

03:14:14.520 --> 03:14:17.680
about that business its GST its registration everything

03:14:17.680 --> 03:14:21.280
right now human will take to process one single bill human

03:14:21.280 --> 03:14:25.100
will take a lot of time right this will not now once it will

03:14:25.100 --> 03:14:28.520
be able to process it now if you have to scrutinize further

03:14:28.520 --> 03:14:31.880
right it will be able to extract maybe mobile information

03:14:31.880 --> 03:14:34.720
maybe an email id or maybe some contact person information

03:14:34.720 --> 03:14:37.880
also for that particular business if that business is

03:14:37.880 --> 03:14:40.880
genuine authentic so that some contact will be available

03:14:40.880 --> 03:14:43.980
right if business is genuine some contact for example for

03:14:43.980 --> 03:14:46.880
Euron if you are not able to reach out anywhere we have an

03:14:46.880 --> 03:14:49.040
email id official registered email id contact at the rate

03:14:49.040 --> 03:14:51.860
Euron dot one so obviously anyone can reach out to that

03:14:51.860 --> 03:14:56.060
particular email id right and like say that okay fine so is

03:14:56.060 --> 03:14:59.340
this bill generated by you is it a fake or is it this one if

03:14:59.340 --> 03:15:01.840
they have already generated the bill whether you have filed

03:15:01.840 --> 03:15:04.500
a GST or not you can come and pull the data from GST portal

03:15:04.500 --> 03:15:07.420
you can even check that whether GST like is been returned or

03:15:07.420 --> 03:15:12.540
not over there so all of this scrutiny which you as a human

03:15:12.540 --> 03:15:15.740
will be able to do it again you will be able to do it by

03:15:15.740 --> 03:15:19.660
using a existing system right now my code can access the

03:15:19.660 --> 03:15:22.620
same system with a faster speed with a faster speed with a

03:15:22.620 --> 03:15:26.780
faster authenticity with a faster unbiasness right with

03:15:26.780 --> 03:15:31.440
unbiasness basically so can I say that I don't need those 20

03:15:31.440 --> 03:15:36.000
people even to scrutinize a bill now yes we have done that

03:15:36.000 --> 03:15:38.500
actually this bill processing system is nothing new I

03:15:38.500 --> 03:15:41.780
personally I have built so much so many of such kind of a

03:15:41.780 --> 03:15:44.940
system when I was a part of like a Deloitte and I think

03:15:44.940 --> 03:15:48.680
Verizon during that tenure I have built 5-6 years back

03:15:48.680 --> 03:15:52.580
itself we have built so many such kind of a system so that

03:15:52.580 --> 03:15:56.440
is you know we can we can like reduce the corruption inside

03:15:56.440 --> 03:16:00.960
in terms of like a processing of bills plus we can make it

03:16:00.960 --> 03:16:04.200
faster right the bill which takes maybe a week of time or 10

03:16:04.200 --> 03:16:07.620
days of time to process maybe we can process it in 1 hour 2

03:16:07.620 --> 03:16:11.480
hour itself and if we have a doubt B wins if system will be

03:16:11.480 --> 03:16:14.920
having a doubt it will initiate the complete scrutiny

03:16:14.920 --> 03:16:19.640
automatically and it will it will even assign a ticket sorry

03:16:20.400 --> 03:16:23.060
we can still assign human in the loop if system is obviously

03:16:23.060 --> 03:16:25.760
we can we can still so see if we are escalating if system is

03:16:25.760 --> 03:16:28.540
escalating if system is having a doubt that okay maybe based

03:16:28.540 --> 03:16:31.400
on the rule or based on whatever we have written if system

03:16:31.400 --> 03:16:33.840
will be having a doubt it will just escalate to the

03:16:33.840 --> 03:16:36.540
escalation team maybe like I just need 1 or 2 person over

03:16:36.540 --> 03:16:41.060
there ok okay right who can take a help of system as well as

03:16:41.060 --> 03:16:43.660
who can do a manual intervention and then scrutinize at

03:16:43.660 --> 03:16:47.260
least you are not asking human to process your 5000 bills on

03:16:47.260 --> 03:16:49.900
a daily basis that's it you don't need 20 member team it can

03:16:49.900 --> 03:16:53.620
be done in 1 or 2 member itself yeah thank you thank you so

03:16:53.620 --> 03:16:57.180
much that's it yeah thanks ok next question please hi

03:16:57.180 --> 03:17:01.000
sudhanshu abhijit here yeah so sudhanshu this is one of your

03:17:01.000 --> 03:17:03.800
use case whatever you have given the real estate due

03:17:03.800 --> 03:17:07.740
diligence and title summary assistant ok so I am trying to

03:17:07.740 --> 03:17:11.500
make it in little broader way so what is whoever is through

03:17:11.500 --> 03:17:14.200
the due diligence it will be useful for those kind of lawyer

03:17:14.200 --> 03:17:18.740
it's fine but from the end user perspective also whoever is

03:17:18.740 --> 03:17:24.780
trying to buy a land or particular flat right so if they put

03:17:24.780 --> 03:17:31.180
the link of that property so it should take grab all those

03:17:31.180 --> 03:17:36.440
user review and localize information whatever they have

03:17:36.440 --> 03:17:41.680
apart from that if they want to go through loan right so

03:17:41.680 --> 03:17:45.480
give some bank loan website and from there it will retrieve

03:17:45.480 --> 03:17:50.300
this information ok so those things I am thinking now so for

03:17:50.300 --> 03:17:54.700
that we need the API for those website right yeah yeah

03:17:54.700 --> 03:17:59.520
obviously ok but but obviously some society why they will

03:17:59.520 --> 03:18:03.380
give the API key right they will not give so mostly they

03:18:03.380 --> 03:18:08.400
won't be even having it ok most of the cases they won't be

03:18:08.400 --> 03:18:11.120
having it they must be using some like a app like adda app

03:18:11.120 --> 03:18:13.680
or may be my guide kind of app where they are maintaining or

03:18:13.680 --> 03:18:16.080
maybe you can try to pull those information from a

03:18:16.080 --> 03:18:18.160
government portal especially with respect to the land and

03:18:18.160 --> 03:18:23.100
khata and everything ok ok but yeah from like a society you

03:18:23.100 --> 03:18:26.180
can't expect it it's not possible it's not possible it's

03:18:26.180 --> 03:18:28.880
from the app that you are and again like let's suppose you

03:18:28.880 --> 03:18:32.380
are like building something for a tier 2 tier 3 there will

03:18:32.380 --> 03:18:34.620
be very less society right there will be very less organized

03:18:34.620 --> 03:18:38.260
society so it will be like a government website only that

03:18:38.260 --> 03:18:41.140
will be like your source of truth no as I am staying in

03:18:41.140 --> 03:18:43.580
bangalore so I am thinking from bangalore perspective only

03:18:43.580 --> 03:18:48.360
ok and it's full place if we can launch this so that's my

03:18:48.360 --> 03:18:52.520
plan ok so that way I am thinking then then from app because

03:18:52.520 --> 03:18:55.520
in bangalore kind of a society we are using adda or my gate

03:18:55.520 --> 03:18:58.940
kind of app right where most of the information are

03:18:58.940 --> 03:19:01.520
available or maybe you can check your adda and your my gate

03:19:01.520 --> 03:19:04.500
what kind of information is available from others inside

03:19:04.500 --> 03:19:07.160
your society similarly it will be available from others plus

03:19:07.160 --> 03:19:10.240
a government portal government portal and what about the

03:19:10.240 --> 03:19:14.700
banking site means or else some whoever is giving loan right

03:19:14.700 --> 03:19:18.760
in those kind of website bankbazaar.com something like that

03:19:18.780 --> 03:19:24.800
ok show me ok ok so yeah like bankbazaar.com they provide

03:19:24.800 --> 03:19:28.360
like they are basically aggregator so they try to like

03:19:28.360 --> 03:19:31.680
connect you with the multiple correct actual banks HDFC or

03:19:31.680 --> 03:19:35.340
maybe ICICI ES bank or some tata capital or something and

03:19:35.340 --> 03:19:38.540
then like from there they will charge some sort of a small

03:19:38.540 --> 03:19:42.460
commission I don't think that they have a pool of like this

03:19:42.460 --> 03:19:47.940
one loan so for that you can connect with for loan maybe

03:19:47.940 --> 03:19:52.420
tata capital or HDFC and they will be happy to connect it if

03:19:52.420 --> 03:19:57.260
you are bringing a client for them ok ok that's what and so

03:19:57.260 --> 03:20:02.160
for this development so whatever the agent agentic stuff you

03:20:02.160 --> 03:20:06.740
are saying so which will be better remains land land graph

03:20:06.740 --> 03:20:10.680
or crew ai which are which you are going to teach I will

03:20:10.680 --> 03:20:14.900
tell you go ahead with the crew ai crew ai or any 10 that

03:20:14.900 --> 03:20:18.180
will be better ok maybe you can for a poc or mvp so you can

03:20:18.180 --> 03:20:21.980
try this any 10 or crew ai and stick to it I think it's good

03:20:21.980 --> 03:20:26.260
ok ok fine thank you I am not against land chain or land

03:20:26.260 --> 03:20:33.340
graph ok I know I can do the same even with that just from a

03:20:33.340 --> 03:20:38.080
ease of use case I am talking about got it ok yeah thank you

03:20:38.080 --> 03:20:45.470
so much yeah thanks thanks ok anyone Puspa Monika yeah go

03:20:45.470 --> 03:20:48.530
ahead yes yes Sudhanshu it's Monika here yeah please go

03:20:48.530 --> 03:20:52.450
ahead ma'am yes Sudhanshu I would like to share my screen ok

03:20:52.450 --> 03:20:56.030
sure ma'am yeah let me promote you as a panelist you will be

03:20:56.030 --> 03:20:56.810
joining in sometime

03:21:02.680 --> 03:21:07.660
yes ma'am yeah please share the screen I think you have

03:21:07.660 --> 03:21:12.140
joined as a panelist yes please share the screen yes

03:21:12.140 --> 03:21:17.420
Sudhanshu I have actually 3 to 4 queries ok so last class

03:21:17.420 --> 03:21:20.120
was my first class I just tried to cover almost all of them

03:21:20.120 --> 03:21:25.000
ok here if you could see in pine cone what you have shown as

03:21:25.000 --> 03:21:28.100
like you know in order to upset I am just trying to add a

03:21:28.100 --> 03:21:31.240
record here it is not taking your screen and my screen

03:21:31.240 --> 03:21:35.060
actually varies wherein like you know here I don't have an

03:21:35.060 --> 03:21:36.420
option of 1536

03:21:39.820 --> 03:21:44.920
you don't have an option of 1536 I need to take isn't it

03:21:48.860 --> 03:21:52.280
the dimensions I mean the dimensions yes ma'am yeah I got

03:21:52.280 --> 03:21:57.460
that point I got that point so my question is why do we need

03:21:57.460 --> 03:22:01.300
to take that big dimension also like you know 1536 is a very

03:22:01.300 --> 03:22:09.440
big huge we know 2D 3D and 5D 678 will not work out no ma'am

03:22:09.440 --> 03:22:13.060
678 dimension is not going to work out we have to take

03:22:13.060 --> 03:22:18.300
something like 300 500 kind of a dimension because it's like

03:22:18.300 --> 03:22:21.700
a textual information that we are talking about right and

03:22:21.700 --> 03:22:23.820
again relationship between the textual information we are

03:22:23.820 --> 03:22:26.540
talking about just by using 7-8 columns you can't represent

03:22:27.200 --> 03:22:31.560
I am not saying that you can't you can but it will not be

03:22:31.560 --> 03:22:34.460
able to you know understand the relations you need a bigger

03:22:34.460 --> 03:22:37.000
bigger dimension because bigger dimension means more

03:22:37.000 --> 03:22:43.600
relations yes more connectivity less relation basically for

03:22:43.600 --> 03:22:46.900
this what I have done Sudhanshu I actually have written some

03:22:46.900 --> 03:22:49.220
piece of code here in dimension can you please go and create

03:22:49.220 --> 03:22:53.520
one more like pine cone database right now here I tried

03:22:53.520 --> 03:22:58.060
adding it also Sudhanshu if you could see here here here I

03:22:58.060 --> 03:23:01.040
tried adding it also like you know the dimension I just

03:23:01.040 --> 03:23:04.500
searched inside dpt I tried adding it but it is not taking

03:23:04.500 --> 03:23:10.860
so ok ok so give me remote control give me remote control ok

03:23:10.860 --> 03:23:16.060
fine and leave it yeah so database ok

03:23:35.090 --> 03:23:39.210
so basically here is a custom setting option ma'am so you

03:23:39.210 --> 03:23:42.430
have not selected that option I am creating the indexes now

03:23:42.430 --> 03:23:47.850
here it is going to give you 1 5 3 6 now give a name let's

03:23:47.850 --> 03:23:50.690
suppose I am giving a name is equal to test matrix cosine

03:23:50.690 --> 03:23:53.290
similarity vector type whatever it is and then create a

03:23:53.290 --> 03:23:56.710
indexes now if you will try to insert your data inside this

03:23:56.710 --> 03:24:01.110
indexes index test resource already exist ok so test already

03:24:01.110 --> 03:24:04.890
exist I will give test like 3 4 5 6 whatever now it will

03:24:04.890 --> 03:24:10.430
create simple and something management plan ok now it is

03:24:10.430 --> 03:24:15.150
creating it right and see now what is the dimension 1 5 3 6

03:24:15.150 --> 03:24:17.630
yes yeah this is what you were looking for right and this is

03:24:17.630 --> 03:24:19.790
the host yes yes now change the host change your like API

03:24:19.790 --> 03:24:23.230
key connect and yes that I will do that I will do no issue

03:24:23.230 --> 03:24:27.990
ok yes yes that I can do I was just trying to find it and

03:24:28.490 --> 03:24:31.430
this one more also you asked us to do here so in the

03:24:31.430 --> 03:24:35.110
recording I could see this wave end so this wave end also

03:24:35.110 --> 03:24:40.430
will ask us to update a record in it yes yes obviously we

03:24:40.430 --> 03:24:42.670
can add different database basically all together I know I

03:24:42.670 --> 03:24:47.910
know I know no you actually the video was not complete you

03:24:47.910 --> 03:24:50.650
just asked us to do this so I was thinking like you know

03:24:50.650 --> 03:24:53.890
this is as the first one or like you know as like we can add

03:24:53.890 --> 03:24:56.470
a record there yes ma'am yeah you have to add the record

03:24:56.470 --> 03:24:59.190
over there sure sure I can add a record update and then see

03:24:59.190 --> 03:25:03.170
but the worst part here what I could see I could see the

03:25:03.170 --> 03:25:07.850
updated record can you see Sudhanshu here the index 4 it was

03:25:07.850 --> 03:25:10.370
running at the back end but it was not showing me at the

03:25:10.370 --> 03:25:17.810
front end you know where I

03:25:17.810 --> 03:25:20.330
can add the record ok

03:25:25.690 --> 03:25:34.930
ok ok ok I think

03:25:34.930 --> 03:25:38.610
I can add the record I think I can choose the index as well

03:25:39.630 --> 03:25:42.250
ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok is equal to test one index is

03:25:42.250 --> 03:25:45.070
going to test three five three four five three one index is

03:25:45.070 --> 03:25:47.630
basically y y y one index is basically lamas eliminating

03:25:47.630 --> 03:25:51.530
this one yeah so all this record is added and then if a

03:25:51.530 --> 03:25:54.830
record is added if a record is updated you can see inside

03:25:54.830 --> 03:25:57.650
the indexes so index is just like a database or you can say

03:25:57.650 --> 03:26:02.330
table for example right now here if data is available you

03:26:02.330 --> 03:26:04.830
will be able to browse the record see here you will see the

03:26:04.830 --> 03:26:10.910
record this area yeah yes you are going to add it then you

03:26:10.910 --> 03:26:15.050
will be able to see the record here yes so that

03:26:15.050 --> 03:26:17.790
customization like you know where you have done so don't you

03:26:17.790 --> 03:26:20.970
i would like to know okay so basically see click on the

03:26:20.970 --> 03:26:24.550
indexes click on create indexes right this this option you

03:26:24.550 --> 03:26:26.970
are able to see custom settings yes yes i understood click

03:26:26.970 --> 03:26:30.710
click on that so yes yes now you can enter the dimension

03:26:30.710 --> 03:26:35.350
here i actually searched the entire tool you know the entire

03:26:35.350 --> 03:26:39.450
but i think in my in my record in my classes i have already

03:26:39.450 --> 03:26:42.170
shown that part and i have done the same thing right so

03:26:42.170 --> 03:26:46.310
obviously you actually it was actually down showing like the

03:26:46.310 --> 03:26:50.350
options for us it is not showing that option i couldn't find

03:26:50.350 --> 03:26:53.870
okay no ma'am it was it was there it is the same like a

03:26:53.870 --> 03:26:58.170
portal right so okay and so that's you one thing like you

03:26:58.170 --> 03:27:01.070
know this is your piece of code what we have written for the

03:27:01.070 --> 03:27:05.770
launching okay so here i actually tried adding few things to

03:27:05.770 --> 03:27:09.830
it in order to make it customized so i was just trying to

03:27:09.830 --> 03:27:10.550
change its value to quella there was still no sp backward

03:27:10.550 --> 03:27:10.550
devs输 exc Jadi sekarang RUDIK you know again like open��게 is

03:27:10.550 --> 03:27:14.490
only a part of it like instead of 22 plus like you know why

03:27:14.490 --> 03:27:21.110
his common okay i think your chat yeah something whatever so

03:27:21.110 --> 03:27:26.010
it was not taking me there so i added the board movie rule

03:27:26.010 --> 03:27:30.290
in max we use like a calculation path for any type of

03:27:30.290 --> 03:27:34.450
calculator so i just added it there but it was not taking

03:27:34.450 --> 03:27:39.490
that instead of two plus two i added a little bit complex

03:27:39.490 --> 03:27:43.370
thing there it is throwing an error there so basically in

03:27:43.370 --> 03:27:46.530
your in your prompt you have to define so the prompt that

03:27:46.530 --> 03:27:50.050
you have i added i added all those all the required things

03:27:50.050 --> 03:27:52.470
like you know all the required things for about the match i

03:27:52.470 --> 03:27:55.830
added then again i came back here see there's a very simple

03:27:55.830 --> 03:28:00.110
expression you could see here okay what is what is your

03:28:00.110 --> 03:28:02.910
prompt by the way can you please show me your prompt for

03:28:02.910 --> 03:28:08.010
this calculator yes i can because the only issue is with the

03:28:08.010 --> 03:28:12.110
prompt there is no other issues yes yes here

03:28:21.550 --> 03:28:26.030
can you see students yeah i can see it yeah yes i added

03:28:26.030 --> 03:28:29.730
almost all everything in your piece of code only so all the

03:28:29.730 --> 03:28:32.850
calculations what in this uh i just change the query and

03:28:32.850 --> 03:28:38.700
then wrap hmm show me your prompt prompt not not this one

03:28:38.700 --> 03:28:41.840
this is the call right function call show me show me the

03:28:41.840 --> 03:28:42.120
prompt

03:28:46.590 --> 03:28:51.490
so here go go yeah yeah this one this one right react from

03:28:51.490 --> 03:28:56.070
this one okay when you are using this tool follow this

03:28:56.070 --> 03:29:00.030
section exactly the same as forward question third action uh

03:29:00.030 --> 03:29:03.230
using one of the tool access that you have in a tool name

03:29:03.230 --> 03:29:06.090
always finish with the final given numeric answer of the

03:29:06.090 --> 03:29:08.890
question yeah i think it should work maybe we'll have to

03:29:08.890 --> 03:29:11.450
like a check for which cases it is working but ideally it

03:29:11.450 --> 03:29:16.450
should work the same thing right ideally it should work okay

03:29:16.450 --> 03:29:20.530
so i made necessary changes and then i've done and i added a

03:29:20.530 --> 03:29:24.990
few more things also in my bottom i think i created a python

03:29:24.990 --> 03:29:27.590
file and then there also like you know the minor thing where

03:29:27.590 --> 03:29:30.750
it was not taking my changes i've done i've written all i

03:29:30.750 --> 03:29:33.350
added all the prompts like you know in the tools also i

03:29:33.350 --> 03:29:38.850
added all of them okay then still the problem existed then

03:29:38.850 --> 03:29:43.770
it should not ma'am according to me but we'll have to check

03:29:43.770 --> 03:29:46.450
like why problem exists but according to me it should not

03:29:46.450 --> 03:29:49.890
because your problems looks good and you have already given

03:29:49.890 --> 03:29:53.770
an access to all the mathematical function in that yes yes

03:29:53.770 --> 03:29:56.490
so ideally it should not give an issue but yeah we'll have

03:29:56.490 --> 03:29:59.950
to investigate a little bit sure sure okay and this is not

03:29:59.950 --> 03:30:02.570
consistent also so then so one time it gives like you know

03:30:02.570 --> 03:30:05.270
to place two okay correct but second time when we run like

03:30:05.270 --> 03:30:07.930
you know again basically it's something so it's

03:30:07.930 --> 03:30:11.170
hallucinating by the way it's something that needs to be

03:30:11.170 --> 03:30:15.090
standardized i think and lastly you can you can control the

03:30:15.090 --> 03:30:18.490
temperature and something like something like the prompt yes

03:30:18.490 --> 03:30:22.670
yes something standardized you just need to do that and this

03:30:22.670 --> 03:30:27.550
lastly i ran this also that many many chat like you know i

03:30:27.550 --> 03:30:31.130
ran the main file also it was good like you know i was able

03:30:31.130 --> 03:30:36.390
to run this but it landed up with a few errors there okay

03:30:36.390 --> 03:30:37.090
what was that

03:30:43.710 --> 03:30:47.230
i did not learn this i opened it for you yes yes here

03:30:47.230 --> 03:30:51.170
manager so it has given me the copy out of meta tensor node

03:30:51.170 --> 03:30:55.110
model instead of torch model we are moving the meta devices

03:30:55.110 --> 03:30:59.210
okay come down ma'am and show me the whole error desktop

03:30:59.210 --> 03:31:02.510
this this this this this okay and device this one no

03:31:02.510 --> 03:31:06.830
implementation error i think it's a pytorch error okay uh so

03:31:06.830 --> 03:31:11.910
what do you can do uh let me ping you a piece of

03:31:11.910 --> 03:31:20.590
installation that you have to do it yeah just just ping you

03:31:20.590 --> 03:31:23.210
inside the chat you can just copy and run it inside your

03:31:23.210 --> 03:31:29.510
like installation tab okay fine yeah it's a pytorch error

03:31:29.510 --> 03:31:31.530
basically it is not able to resolve your pytorch library

03:31:31.530 --> 03:31:36.630
dependencies okay so that's what i said inside the chat yeah

03:31:36.630 --> 03:31:41.090
just ping you inside the chat ma'am so so yeah this torch

03:31:41.090 --> 03:31:44.990
right yeah that was the error so and for the cpu i have done

03:31:44.990 --> 03:31:47.730
so that even if you don't have a gpu inside your system it

03:31:47.730 --> 03:31:51.110
will work means just with a normal cpu it will work yeah

03:31:51.110 --> 03:31:54.970
i'll take that okay sure thank you thank you thank you ma'am

03:31:54.970 --> 03:31:59.130
thanks okay fine everyone thank you so much take care

03:31:59.130 --> 03:32:02.870
everyone and uh see you again in my next lecture which is

03:32:02.870 --> 03:32:04.910
going to happen tomorrow we'll continue with the agent tki

03:32:04.910 --> 03:32:06.330
itself thank you so much take care everyone
