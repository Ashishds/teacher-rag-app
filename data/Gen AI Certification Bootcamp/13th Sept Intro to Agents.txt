WEBVTT

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.750
Okay, so good morning everyone. I think I'm audible and

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.510
visible to all of you. So please confirm me guys, if I'm

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:58.110
audible and visible.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.620
Yeah, okay. So good morning everyone. Let's start our

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.320
Saturday and Sunday, technically weekends by the way, by

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.660
learning something. Okay, so what we are going to start

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.020
today, by the way, any idea, anyone? I believe we have

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.940
already talked about it. But yeah, so if you have any idea,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.700
so maybe you can ping me in a chat. A world of agent. Yes,

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.680
we are going to start with a world of agents, by the way.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:43.220
So any idea guys, like what is this agent and how it works?

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.280
What an all operation we all will be able to do with respect

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.700
to agent? Any idea, anyone? Yeah.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:01.270
So LLM plus tool is equals to agent. Okay, fine. Agent makes

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:07.690
our process automated. Fine. Okay. Any other thoughts? LLM

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:13.450
plus tool plus memory. Okay, fine. Agent works towards our

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.030
OTS goal autonomously. Okay. Agent have a reasoning

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:22.070
capacity, thought action observation framework to make a

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:26.570
decision. Okay. Okay, fine. In a layman way. So I'm not

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:30.430
looking for some fancy words because, let's suppose a person

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.330
like me who is not aware about agents. So it will be very

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.910
difficult for like me. To understand the actual meaning of

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:41.150
agents, by the way, third party tool. Okay, agent works on

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:47.490
behalf of us fine automation and integration and security

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:52.390
agents are helper. Okay, smart set of a code program, which

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:55.410
is capable to do a repeated task replaced. Yeah, that's

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.870
correct. Actually, that's a layman definition. I would say

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:03.930
mediator mediator. I'm like, okay, fine. It is like a

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:09.190
broker. Okay, like a ticket agent. It will book our ticket

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:14.490
on behalf of us. Agent will do a task using a tool and LLM's

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:17.630
intelligent agent. Okay, that's a category of agent

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:21.330
intelligent, not intelligent, autonomous auto program agent

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.750
will do with all the work whenever we are assigned to

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:28.210
perform the task for a human that was done manually by a

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:34.030
human. Okay. Okay, so, so many definitions, right? So we'll,

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.610
we'll try to see. So we'll try to see the correct definition

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:38.070
and not, uh, we'll, we'll not just try to look for the

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:41.310
definition by the way, but, uh, we will also try to

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:44.690
understand a practical implementation, a lot of practical

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:48.090
implementation. We will try to understand, uh, so that, uh,

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:51.530
we will be able to build an agent, uh, not, but just, uh,

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:54.270
just by using one single platform or one single framework,

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:58.350
but by using a multiple framework, uh, we will be able to

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.510
even products. Nice. Our agents, uh, because it's completely

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:05.810
fine to build those agents in a local system. But, uh, at

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:09.410
the end of the day, so our agent should run, uh, 24 by

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:12.750
seven. That is the whole purpose of creating an agent so

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:16.050
that it will be able to do, uh, some sort of a work, some

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:19.570
sort of a task on behalf of us. So we'll try to even

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:22.830
understand that how we will be able to productionize those,

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:26.670
uh, agent. Yeah. Uh, so we'll, we'll try to do a lot. We'll

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.390
try to understand a lot by building a lot of like examples.

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.110
So fine. Uh, let me start the class and, uh, let me share

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:37.570
and screen. So today I'll try to give you a brief idea about

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:42.830
a agent. Plus we'll try to, you know, build maybe a teeny

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:47.110
tiny agent, a small agent. We will try to build by using one

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.910
of the framework, right? One of the framework called as lang

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:52.550
chain. Uh, there are so many other frameworks. So lang chain

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.090
is there. Lama indexes is there. Lang graph is there. Crew

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:59.450
AI is there. Autogen is there. Init N is there. So some of

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:02.710
these frameworks are going to help me out to create an agent

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:05.530
without even writing a single framework. A single line of a

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:09.190
code. And, uh, with respect to some of the other agents,

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.910
obviously I have to write the code and then I have to bring

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:15.130
those code into a production basically. So you'll have to do

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:18.130
a deployment. So all of these things we'll try to understand

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:23.370
in a step by step manner. Plus memory is one of the part or

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:27.210
you can say one of the integrated part of any agents. And

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.670
there are multiple, uh, different, different kind of

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:33.230
memories you all will be able to find out. So some memories

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:36.650
are going to store the entire. Conversation. Some memories

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:40.030
are going to call a windowing. So where it will try to store

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:43.310
a couple of information, a couple of like a last chat, some,

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:47.630
uh, like, uh, agents will try to store a summary of a

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:51.490
memory, not the exact memory. So again, there are like a

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:53.710
different, different kind of, uh, memories that we try to

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:58.610
attach. But, uh, above all, uh, we have to understand that

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:03.170
what technically this agent is so that you all will be able

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:06.950
to understand that. Uh. What is, uh, agentic AI, how it

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.990
works and it's, it's, uh, philosophically, it's, it's very

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:13.790
simple. Uh, it's very simple, uh, and it's very similar to a

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:18.350
person. I would say a person who can make a decision on its

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:22.330
own, for example, uh, so let's suppose if I have to send a

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.030
message to someone, I'll, I'll give you a very, uh, like a

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:28.290
simple layman kind of example. So let's suppose if I have to

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:31.550
send a message to someone, right? So obviously I'm going to

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:35.550
use maybe a WhatsApp, right? Uh. Maybe a Telegram to send a

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:39.530
message to someone or maybe a SMS. So I already have an idea

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:43.010
that, okay, so these tools are available. So maybe a

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:45.930
WhatsApp is available to me. Maybe Telegram is available to

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:49.890
me or maybe a simple plain SMS services are available to me.

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:54.070
If I have to send a mail to someone, right? So obviously my

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.270
tools are going to be what? Maybe a Gmail, maybe Outlook,

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:01.610
maybe a Yahoo, maybe a other, other like a mail tool or

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:05.110
whatever is available to me. So I'll try to use those tools

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:08.310
or I'll try to use those services and then I'll try to send

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:12.730
a mail to someone if I have to give a call. So again, I know

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:16.670
that that I can, uh, give a cellular call or maybe I can go

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:19.370
ahead with a WhatsApp call or maybe I can try to use some

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:23.770
other platform, right? Uh, if I have to book a ticket, let's

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:27.250
suppose for a movie, right? So especially in India. So we

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:30.470
have basically a book my show kind of option and likewise

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:33.390
there are other options which is available to me. Uh, if I

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:36.650
have to search for a restaurant, so we have maybe a Google

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:40.390
map, we have maybe a gemato or something like that. Uh, if

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:43.250
we have to do a shopping, so maybe I can, I will go ahead

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:46.150
with the flip card or I'll go ahead with the Amazon or maybe

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.070
if I'm looking for apparel shopping in that case, I'll go

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:52.510
ahead with the mantra, something like that, right? So we as

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:56.310
a human being are able to decide each and everything, right?

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:59.770
We are based on the task which is given in my hand, so

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:03.610
obviously I'm able to decide and I'm. I'm able to choose a

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:08.010
specific tool as per the task which is given to me, right?

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:10.950
It's not like if someone is asking me to like send a

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.870
message, I'll start using mantra because with the help of

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:17.050
mind that I was, I can't send a message to someone that, uh,

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:20.270
or using a flip card or maybe a YouTube to send a message,

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:24.870
I'm like, that's not a way of sending it basically. So as a

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:28.130
human being, what we do, so as a human being, so basically,

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:32.690
uh, we are aware about all the tools which is available to

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:37.610
me. All the services which is available to me and based on

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:41.130
the task which someone is going to assign, right? Based on

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:44.070
the task with someone is going to give or whatever we are

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:47.290
going to decide, right? So we try to choose a particular

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:51.870
tool and then every tool needs its own kind of an input,

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:55.390
right? So for example, if I have to like, you know, uh, send

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:58.410
a message, so inside that particular tool, so I have to

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:00.730
search a particular person or maybe I have to add their

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.950
number and then I'm going to send a message. And so that

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:06.870
like a message will reach out to the concerned person, a

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:10.210
particular person. So basically we try to choose a tool. We

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:13.150
try to provide an input inside that particular tool and

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:17.090
eventually I will end up completing a task. So whether I'm

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:19.550
trying to book a tickets or maybe if I'm trying to, you

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:23.090
know, do a shopping or maybe I'm watching a videos, maybe

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:27.110
I'm sending a message, maybe I'm giving a call and we as a

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:31.230
human being are surrounded by tons of such kind of a tool

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:33.430
and just giving you a layman. Day to day kind of example,

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:37.510
right? Now if I'll talk about the industry, if I'll talk

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.870
about the office, if I'll talk about the industry. So let's

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:44.130
suppose if I'm trying to generate a lead, so obviously I

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:46.950
will run the campaign over all the social media platform,

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:49.610
maybe a Facebook, maybe a YouTube, maybe a Twitter, maybe a

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:54.270
LinkedIn then. So once I will run the campaign, then the

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:57.190
people will come to my campaign. They will try to fill the

00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:00.990
form and then that lead should go inside a CRM system, a

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:04.250
customer, a licensee management system and then from there,

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:07.390
so we'll try to do a churning of the data and then my team

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:10.070
is going to give a call back to all those customers who have

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:13.310
filled that particular form and whose data set is available

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:17.470
inside my CRM system and then eventually I'll try to convert

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:21.730
those person into a sales by the way, right? So this is what

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:25.150
in general sales and marketing team is going to do, right?

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:27.250
So marketing team is going to run the campaign and then

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:30.390
sales team is going to do a sales and every business is

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:34.550
doing it, right? Every business is doing it. We keep on

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:38.490
receiving tons of email on a daily basis, right? Keep on

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:42.350
receiving some email we should not reply and some emails are

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:46.070
pretty much urgent, right? Maybe I'm receiving a mail from a

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:49.810
customer, maybe I'm receiving a mail from a client by the

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:53.030
way or maybe in our cases, so maybe we are receiving a mail

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:57.170
from the student. Now so we can try to even configure an

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:00.670
agent over there, so which will keep on watching my entire

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.870
mails. So let's say I have a mail system, right? My entire

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:07.110
mail system on a particular mail ID and whenever we receive

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:10.450
a mail, so it will be able to decide automatically that

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:13.450
whether I should reply or I should leave because maybe some

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:18.070
of the mail system itself can reply and maybe in some of the

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:20.550
cases human intervention will be required. So it will be

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:23.770
able to make a decision and if it is able to make a decision

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:26.370
that okay I can reply to this particular mail, it will

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:29.670
automatically send a mail so that my customer will be happy.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:32.230
And they will say that. Okay, wow. I'm able to receive a

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:35.590
mail reply within a second or maybe within a minute

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:39.150
basically, right? Maybe I can configure a bot which will

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:41.830
keep on watching our entire WhatsApp messages and then

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:45.470
automatically it will send a reply for some of the messages.

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:48.270
Again it will try to decide that okay for this category I

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:50.610
should like a reply and for this category I should not

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:54.370
reply. Same will happen with the telegram. So technically

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:57.890
what what I'm trying to prove over here that that whatever

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.730
repetitive task that we as a human being. All right. So I

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:04.350
would say not so repetitive but still. So whatever task that

00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:08.650
we as a human being was trying to do since very long long

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:13.610
years. I think it's possible right with the help of AI. So I

00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:17.490
think it's possible to automate all of those tasks and

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:21.090
that's the reason. So you must have heard about this agentic

00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:24.990
AI things nowadays a lot especially since like a beginning

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:29.610
of this year 2025. So we are getting like a lot of like a

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:34.230
buzzword call. As agentic AI. So yes agentic AI is a real

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:37.850
thing. People are solving a lot of problem with the help of

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:42.390
agentic AI even inside your own. So we are using a lot of

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:46.490
agents that we have created internally. So that we don't

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:50.110
have to expand a team we don't have to go and do a you know

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:53.090
investment because whenever you hire a particular person so

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:55.930
obviously you have to give them a salary you have to like a

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:59.170
take care of a lot of things around it. Right. But if my

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:02.570
machine is working if my system is working. So in that case

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:07.010
my cost will be very very less and obviously in a very

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:10.170
efficient manner I will be able to deliver a particular

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:14.730
task. So this is where the world of agent comes into a

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:17.550
picture. So whatever task which human being was trying to

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:22.410
do. So maybe I can dedicate not all the task I would say not

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:25.970
100 percent of the task. Right is still human in the loop is

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:31.450
required by the way. In most of the cases right human has to

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:33.970
come into a picture. They have to keep check on each and

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:39.410
everything. But yeah. So a lot of task can be like

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:43.510
automated. Yeah. So our agents agents are different. No. So

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:47.650
agentic AI is basically you can say like an umbrella. Right.

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:51.910
Or it's just a name. So basically inside that we create our

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:55.650
agents like AI agents by the way so agentic AI is you can

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:58.510
say just a name of the business. Right. And inside that

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.850
there are like a chapters called as different different kind

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:04.010
of agents. Yeah. Different. So hope all of you are able to

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:06.610
understand. Right. The context which I have given you to

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:09.310
send a messages to send a call or maybe go for a shopping

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:13.770
maybe go and book a ticket reply to the mail. So I believe

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:16.430
we all are aware about it. Right. And whatever task which I

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:19.810
said practically it's possible to automate all of those

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:24.270
tasks. People have done that. Right. People are doing it by

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:28.670
using some of the no code tool. Or by using a code based

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:31.590
tool in both the manner. So both the options we have now in

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:37.550
the world and I can use it efficiently. Yeah. Now. So deal

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:40.190
is required to learn generative AI. You are already into a

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:42.870
generative AI class. Right. So try to explore. Try to learn.

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:46.290
You don't need like me to answer each and every question.

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:51.490
Yeah. I think we are. We all are that like mature enough.

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:59.430
Okay. Now. So let me share my screen. Okay. And hope

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:02.330
definition is clear. Anyone who is having any doubt with

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.590
respect to a definition of agents by the way. A layman

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:10.890
definition not a technical one. Yeah. Okay. So definition is

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:14.890
clear with respect to the agents. So basically agents is

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:18.170
nothing but a kind of a smart system that we are going to

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:20.570
create. Right. A kind of a smart system which is going to

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:24.790
work on behalf of me day and night day and night and it will

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:29.770
be able to. So basically this agentic AI things is not new.

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:33.890
I think we have been talking about automation since ages.

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:37.590
Right. Since two decades I believe we have been talking

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:40.710
about automation and what we do in case of automation. So

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:43.890
obviously we just try to remove the manual intervention.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:47.310
Right. This is what we have been doing and we have been

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:50.930
doing it by writing maybe some sort of a rule. Right. Some

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:53.670
sort of a rule. Some sort of a query. Some sort of. If else

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:56.810
kind of a statement that if this is going to happen then do

00:20:56.810 --> 00:21:00.910
this or do that. Right. So we as a human being we as a

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:03.330
techie we as a programmer we as a developer we have been

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:06.590
writing a lot of automation since ages. So automation is

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:10.930
nothing new in this world by the way. Right. Agentic AI is

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:14.470
nothing but automation with an AI you can say. So it's

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:17.330
basically another label of or you can say it's a automation

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:22.750
plus plus. It's nothing new. Right. And people have given a

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:27.530
name as an agentic AI. Right. But technically it's an

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:30.710
automation plus plus. If you are looking from my

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:34.790
perspective. So this is how I see this entire agent system.

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:38.290
It's just an automation plus plus. Nothing more than that.

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:42.530
Because now we have an LLM. Right. Before like three years

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:46.010
back. So we were not having LLMs. Why I'm talking about LLMs

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:49.630
by the way. Because LLMs is having a knowledge of entire

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:53.290
world. That's a part number one. Part number two is that

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:57.490
that I can connect. I can interact with those LLMs just by

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:00.890
using a natural language. Maybe in any language. Right.

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:04.170
Maybe Hindi, English, Tamil, Telugu, Punjabi, Spanish,

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:07.470
French. I can use any languages. And obviously it can

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:11.150
understand all of my languages. It can understand my tone.

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:14.130
It's getting better and better day by day. As we have seen

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:17.370
in last three years. Right. Since of very first release of a

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:20.210
chat GPT till today. Now we have a multiple language. We

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:22.890
have multiple options which is available in a market. LLMs

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:26.870
are like a very very good with respect to the context. They

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:29.170
are very good with respect to a memory. They are very good

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:32.530
with respect to basically like understanding even our broken

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:35.230
words or like even if we are going to do some sort of a

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:38.550
grammatical mistake. It's very good with it. And based on

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:41.390
those inputs. It's very good in terms of doing a reasoning

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:44.290
in terms of understanding a mathematical equation in terms

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:48.350
of generating a code or in terms of summarizing any kind of

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:51.670
a data that we are going to give. Right. So LLMs are pretty

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:55.190
much powerful. So previously we were doing automation where

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:59.110
we were writing a rules. Right. Now here. So in a world of

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:01.870
LLMs. So obviously LLMs can understand a natural language.

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:06.990
So maybe I can try to just interact with these LLMs or maybe

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:10.350
I can just automate it. Right. So internally LLMs will try

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:12.890
to understand the data. It will be able to understand the

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:17.610
context and eventually it will be able to understand that.

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:20.810
Right. Which tool I'm supposed to call. Right. Like I have

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:23.610
given you example. Right. So let's suppose if I have to send

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:26.270
a message. So obviously I will be using a WhatsApp. I'll be

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:29.230
using a telegram. I will be using a SMS services but not

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:32.590
Mynthra or Flipkart. Right. Because Mynthra and Flipkart is

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:37.050
not actually meant for sending SMS or sending a message. So

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:40.170
those platforms are technically WhatsApp or telegram or

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:45.290
maybe a SMS like a cellular SMS. Right. So LLMs are pretty

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.730
much good. So let's suppose. Let's suppose I have a hundreds

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:51.590
of tools inside my ecosystem. Now whatever task will come

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:55.130
into a picture, it will be able to decide automatically.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:57.990
Right. It will be able to decide automatically that, okay,

00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:02.610
for this particular task, I should use that particular tool.

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:07.890
And that's like a major or you can say a main backbone of

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:12.150
this entire agentic system that you or I will end up

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:16.610
creating. Yeah. So, sir, how effective agent accuracy is?

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:20.670
How effective something is that depends upon our builders

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:25.190
who is building it. Right. And for what purposes? So, like,

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:27.930
there is no straightforward answer. I can say that, okay,

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:30.850
all the agents that you are going to build will perform with

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:34.310
100% accuracy or maybe with the 90% accuracy. It depends

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:36.950
upon us because everywhere fine tuning is required.

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:39.430
Everywhere a proper configuration will be required.

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:44.150
Everywhere a proper edge case handling is required based on

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:47.470
the businesses. So your response? So the screen is black,

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:51.130
sir. Yes, I think my face is visible. It's not black. So

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:57.890
it's my face, I believe. Yeah. Okay. So basically, LLMs,

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:01.370
right? So we have studied LLMs, we have seen LLMs and we

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:05.290
have used a lot of LLMs in our past in till our previous

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:08.630
classes, like till last Sunday. So we have used a lot of

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:14.530
LLMs over there. So basically, LLMs is a major backbone. So

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:19.390
which will give a capability. To make a decision that, okay,

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:23.630
what kind of a tool I'm supposed to call and in what kind of

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:26.970
a situation, in what kind of a scenario, because now LLMs

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:30.710
are that powerful. And as LLMs will become more and more

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:33.190
powerful in the future, so obviously your agents will be

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:38.130
more and more powerful. But again, the efficiency of an

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:41.030
agent that you are going to create, it depends upon multiple

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:44.730
factors. It depends upon who is creating and how much

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:47.850
experience you are. Otherwise, you will end up creating

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:51.470
agents, which will be having of no use. And this is where

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:54.830
almost like a recent survey. So I was going through a recent

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:58.750
survey, even you can go through a recent survey, which has

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:03.190
been done by major organizations. And they're saying that

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:09.570
the 95% LLMs are, sorry, not LLMs, 95% of the agent that

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:12.510
they have built, it's of no use. They're not able to bring

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:16.410
those agents into a production. Right? 5%. They're not able

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:19.310
to, or 5% of the agent that people have built, yes, they are

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:22.730
able to bring into a production. But that's okay. That's

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:25.490
completely fine. So maybe in a future, maybe like in next

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:27.990
couple of months or maybe in a year of time, we'll be able

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:33.130
to see that maybe that 95% will become maybe 80%, maybe 50%.

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:39.730
And yes, so we will start using 95% EIA startups are going

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:45.190
to fail. See it's just a prospective, I would say, right?

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:46.870
It's just a prospective. It's a prospective that people use

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:50.390
to build and whatever news that you see, by the way, in your

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:57.790
feed, basically, 99.9%, generally, as a common people,

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:00.350
right, as a common man, you will not be able to understand

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:04.930
the world of PR, right? We think that whatever news we see,

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:11.470
that's the actual news. But believe me, right, as an

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:14.370
entrepreneur, I'm telling you, because I have used those

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:18.950
systems and tools a lot. And we still use it on a very

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:23.870
regular basis. I should not say that. But yeah, it's just a

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:26.690
PR. It's not a news that you see in your feed on a daily

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:30.170
basis, right? Even if it's good, even if it's bad, but

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:33.570
actually, it's not a news. Believe me, it's not at all a

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:38.010
news. Yeah. So everything is a paid one, basically, even a

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:44.090
bad one is a paid one, paid by someone. Yes. So it's just a

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:48.610
PR. Yeah. It's not a news that people are like doing it and

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:54.230
yeah, so just to move our world in one particular direction.

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:57.730
So unless and until you don't have a firsthand experience, I

00:27:57.730 --> 00:28:01.790
will simply say, I don't believe on anything that you see on

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:05.630
your mobile screen, right? It is basically meant and

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:09.590
designed to keep you engaged and so that you will not be

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:12.630
able to make any kind of a decision on your own. This is how

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:18.570
the world of entire, like a PR. Uh, uh, media is going on.

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:25.970
Okay. Uh, yeah, from a firsthand experience. So I know how

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:28.930
PR works, how it happens and how easy it is by the way,

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:34.790
today motivation done. Okay. So let me now share my screen.

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:40.190
Yeah. So I believe a definition is a clear and now you will

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:42.650
be able to find out that when we will start doing a

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:45.150
practical, you will be able to relate exactly. Okay.

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:48.310
Exactly. Whatever, like a definition, which I told you, uh,

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:51.570
whatever things, which I'm trying to like, uh, uh, say, or

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:54.390
whatever, like things or topics on which I was trying to

00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:57.170
convince you with respect to the agents, you will be able to

00:28:57.170 --> 00:29:02.170
find out the exact same thing, right? Not like a 1% up or

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:07.810
down now. So here, uh, so when, when we talk about the

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:11.590
agents, right? Uh, so obviously if I have to create our

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:15.690
agents, so what do we need? The very first thing that we

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:19.910
need is, uh, LLMs obviously. Let me open up my scribble ink

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:23.610
so that I can write something. Yeah.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:30.020
I believe my screen is visible, right? My black scribble ink

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:30.300
screen.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:38.980
Yes. Okay. Voice gone. Where is gone? Everything is here.

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:51.470
Agentic AI, just a topic I would say. Yeah. No. No. No. To

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:55.590
build any kind of an agents. So what we need? So obviously

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:59.430
the very first thing is LLMs, large language models, and I

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:02.970
believe we have enough, or we have a tons of large language

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:06.970
model, which is available to us. And uh, as per the previous

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:10.650
classes, even we are aware about a fact that how I will be

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:14.990
able to host my model, right? We all are aware about it. We

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:18.330
can try to use even a URI. So where do you have a 29 model

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:23.050
access? Okay. And we can try to use basically open AI

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:26.330
system. We can try to use maybe a cloud system. We can try

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:29.650
to use maybe a pop-up system. Maybe we can try to use a

00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:34.970
Gemini system. And all of these things are or maximum of

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:38.110
these things are already available inside a URI platform. So

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:40.790
you can try to use URI or you can try to use some other. It

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:43.050
is completely fine at the end of the day. Or maybe you can

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:46.590
try to host it on your own. Because now we all know that how

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:49.250
we can try to host our model on a GPU with the help of

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:52.810
VLLMs. And then how we can try to expose it as an API. And

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:55.190
we can do a inferencing. All these things we have already

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:59.050
done in our previous classes itself. So here the very first

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:03.170
part that you need is a LLM obviously. Right. A large

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:06.310
language model access. And we have enough large language

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:09.170
model access by the way. Which is required to build any kind

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:12.230
of an agent. Because like I said. So previously we were

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:14.910
writing EFILS. That if this is going to happen. Then do this

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:18.150
or do that. But now we have a LLMs. And LLMs can understand

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:20.670
each and everything just as a natural language. It can even

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:23.470
understand the functions. It can even understand the tool.

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:25.910
Everything it can understand by the way. Right. It can even

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:28.250
like go and do some sort of a search. And then summarize

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:32.050
things. With the help of some of the search based API. Like

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:35.990
a server API. So we need a LLMs. Obviously that is available

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:39.710
to us. To build our agents. Now second part is framework.

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:46.270
Right. Framework. Framework means. Nothing but library by

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:49.090
the way. If I am going ahead with the programming. Or maybe

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:52.550
like a no code kind of a framework. So which should allow

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:57.310
me. To you know call LLMs. And then integrate all the other

00:31:57.310 --> 00:32:00.790
ends. With some sort of a tools. Or maybe some sort of a

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:05.150
function calling. Or maybe like a tool calling. So I need a

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:08.710
framework. For example. So if we have to write a code.

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:12.390
Python we are using. Now inside that if we have to process

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:15.390
some sort of a structured data. So which framework we have

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:19.070
been using. Pandas. Inside Python. Right. Let's suppose if I

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:22.050
have to build a neural network. So which framework we were

00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:25.710
using inside a Python. So TensorFlow. Keras. NGNX. Or maybe

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:28.730
a PyTorch. Kind of a framework we have been using. Let's

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:31.250
suppose if I have to like do some sort of a image

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:34.590
processing. So which framework inside a Python we were

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:38.250
using. OpenCV. Right. Let's suppose if I have to create an

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:42.110
API. Obviously I can go ahead with the maybe a fast API. I

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:43.830
can go ahead with the flask. Or maybe I can go ahead with

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:47.850
the. Django there. In terms of a Python. So again inside a

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:50.590
Python we are already aware about a different different

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:52.790
libraries or you can say a different different framework.

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:56.350
Which has been designed for a different different kind of a

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:58.990
task. Right. Which has been designed for a different

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:03.470
different kind of a task. Now in case of this agentic AI.

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:07.630
Right. In case of this agentic AI world. We have a framework

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:11.690
available to us. Basically called as Langchain.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:17.330
Langchain. So Langchain. So Langchain is one of the

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:21.010
framework. Right. Then we have a Lang graph.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.460
Then we have a

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.280
Lama indexes.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:39.040
Then we have a crew AI. Then we have a autogen from

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:45.340
Microsoft. Then we have a n8n kind of a framework. So we

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:47.840
have like a lot of frameworks. People have developed a lot

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:51.920
of libraries. And yeah. So we all are going to use all of

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.800
these libraries almost in terms of creating an agent in

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:58.160
terms of productionizing the agents. Then if we have to

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.680
productionize the agents. So obviously every framework

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:04.200
provides you a deployment. So if I'll talk about a Langchain

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:07.720
Lang graph. So here we can try to use maybe a Langsmith.

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:14.610
Or we can try to use a Langserv.

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:20.250
So generally we. So if I'll talk about n8n. So they are

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:22.930
giving you a direct deployment option. If I'm talking about

00:34:22.930 --> 00:34:25.630
a crew AI they are also giving you a crew AI cloud system.

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:28.310
So where you can go and you can try to deploy. So like why

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:30.270
there are so many different different frameworks which is

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:33.610
available and again these frameworks are nothing new. So we

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:35.790
have been using so many different different frameworks even

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:41.010
in our past. So these are just a library or you can say it's

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:45.010
just a platform right platform. So where you can go you can

00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:48.610
try to use its library or maybe you can try to use a pre

00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:52.830
built node or you can say a pre built like a small small

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:56.150
component drag and drop and then eventually you will be able

00:34:56.150 --> 00:35:00.210
to automate it. Automate your entire task right. Automate

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:02.970
your entire task. So these are the framework which is

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:06.350
available now inside this framework right inside this

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:10.250
framework. So you will be able to find out again a tons of

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:12.990
components which I'm going to give you as an introduction.

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:18.050
So first of all let's start ahead with our very first one

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:22.170
called as Langchain. So let me go to Google and let me

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:25.370
search over here Langchain just a framework introduction.

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:31.170
Yeah. So Langchain is one of the framework you all will be

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:34.970
able to find out. So which you can try to use to create an

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:39.750
agents agents means automation basically automation plus

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:43.790
plus. So whenever someone say that what is your definition

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:48.850
of an agents in a simple two three word I will say that it's

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:52.270
automation plus plus simple like it's automation plus plus

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:54.150
nothing more than that. And we have been doing automation

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:58.190
since an ages. So here if I'll talk about a Langchain so

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:01.690
Langchain is a library which you can try to use and then

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:05.010
with the help of this Langchain libraries you will be able

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:08.270
to create it. Like I said Langchain is one of the framework

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:13.210
and Langraph is another framework. So again in both by using

00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:16.990
both the frameworks you will be able to create agents in a

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:20.730
bit different way and there are just a small differentiation

00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:24.490
you will be able to find out in between not a big

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:28.250
differentiation. You all will be able to find out now. So

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:32.630
inside this Lang right inside this entire Lang so like I

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:34.670
said there is something called as Lang graph there is

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:37.270
something called as Langchain which is going to help you out

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:42.070
in terms of you know building an agents. Then there is

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:45.830
something called as Langsmith inside this ecosystem and what

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:49.670
it does by the way right what this Langsmith ecosystem is

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:52.710
going to do what what it is going to like a help you out

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:55.130
with. So basically. So basically this Langsmith kind of a

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:57.970
system is going to help you out in terms of doing a

00:36:57.970 --> 00:37:02.330
deployment. So yesterday I was like a building one demo for

00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:07.550
your class itself. So here is a Langsmith internal UI you

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:09.770
should not worry about it anyhow I am going to teach you

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:13.610
that how to like a migrate or how to build an agent how to

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:16.350
like you know build an agent and push your entire code

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:20.850
inside this Langsmith kind of a system so where it will run

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:24.650
in a like automated mode. Basically it's a deployment right.

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:27.830
So how you will be able to do a deployment of the agent with

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:30.250
the help of there is something called as Lang graph studio

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:33.430
inside that there is a framework called as Langsmith. So

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:37.430
Langsmith is basically been used to do a deployment. As of

00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:40.830
now don't try to give much stress to your brain. It's

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:44.130
completely fine. I'm just talking about names over here. If

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:46.230
you are able to remember it it's fine. If you are not able

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:49.770
to remember it more than fine I would say because once you

00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:52.810
are going to use it you will be able to understand. That in

00:37:52.810 --> 00:37:56.210
what case what we are supposed to use basically. So

00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:59.790
Langchain is one of the framework like I said and then again

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:02.670
inside that there is a Langsmith Lang graph platform so

00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:05.050
where you can go and you can try to productionize each and

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:08.010
everything. The way I have productionize things over here

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:10.710
right in the exact similar manner you will be able to

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:14.850
productionize big one or small one depends right. Maybe with

00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:17.410
the help of UI maybe with the help of code that again

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:23.150
depends but yeah you all will be able to do it. Now so there

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:26.290
is another one called as Lama

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:30.870
index right. So there is something called as a Lama index

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:34.190
you will be able to find out. So again Lama index is what

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:37.570
another framework right. Lama index is technically another

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:42.610
framework by which you will be able to design agents. It's a

00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:45.310
separate framework. So Langchain is a different framework

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:48.290
right. So here inside this Langchain we have a Langchain and

00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:51.550
Lang graph two frameworks are available. So one. Basically

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:56.410
which is going to give you a graph kind of like a ecosystem.

00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:59.810
So where as a graph node you can define the process that

00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:02.770
okay system will go from here to here to here to here just

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:05.250
like graph nodes right just like a graph nodes and

00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:08.370
Langchain. So basically it's a plain simple like a code

00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:11.770
based framework. So where without nodes we can try to create

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:14.250
the agent and we can try to connect the agent so that agent

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:17.590
can move from one task to another task. So Langchain is one

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:20.790
of the framework. Lama index is a separate framework. You

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:24.910
all will be able to find out so where again you will be able

00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:29.170
to create agents. So redefine a document workflow with the

00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:32.870
AI agent not just a document workflow. They are like they

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:36.230
have written their like a tag lines over here. But yeah so

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:39.450
whatever I will be able to do it with respect to Langchain

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:43.170
and Lang graph I will be able to do the exact same thing

00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:47.310
right. Obviously framework is different so libraries and its

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:49.810
function name is different because both of these two

00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:53.350
companies. These are separate companies right. So both of

00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:56.970
them are giving you a similar feature I would say. But yeah

00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:59.590
so library is going to be there for example TensorFlow

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:03.430
versus PyTorch right. So even in PyTorch I will be able to

00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:05.970
build a neural network and even with the help of TensorFlow

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:09.570
Keras I will be able to build a neural network. But

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:12.910
obviously TensorFlow is being managed maintained by Google

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:15.970
PyTorch is being managed and maintained by Facebook. So

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:19.210
their syntaxes are different right. Their syntaxes are

00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:22.010
different. But technically both are going to do the exact

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:25.190
same thing. They are going to serve the same purposes. In

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:28.290
the similar manner you will be able to find out that in case

00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:31.290
of Langchain so obviously I can create agents right. I can

00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:34.910
create an agent. I can deploy it and even in case of this

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:39.670
Lama indexes I will be able to do the exact same thing. So

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:41.930
nothing different by the way right. I will be able to do the

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:47.250
exact same thing even with the help of Lama indexes which is

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:50.310
which we are going to see. But yeah. So whether we are using

00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:53.650
a Langchain or whether we are using a Lama indexes I need

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:58.750
LLM because agent means LLMs right. Without LLMs it will not

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:02.090
be able to do anything by the way. So this is a second or

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:05.310
you can say this is another framework that we all are going

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:08.770
to see. But yeah. So let's suppose if I am able to

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:11.470
understand that how we can create agents with the help of

00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:14.710
Langchain and Langraph. Believe me once you will move to a

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:18.310
Lama indexes maybe you don't need me even at that point of

00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:21.190
time. But if I am going to ask you that okay now you know

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:24.450
Langchain and Langraph. So now try to create agents in the

00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:27.630
Lama indexes. I believe you all will be able to do it

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:30.350
easily. Believe me you all will be able to do it easily.

00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:33.650
This is how easy it is. So it's not like very much

00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:36.370
difficult. So you have to understand the fundamentals and

00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:39.770
once you understand the fundamentals it's like creating an

00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:43.330
agents from one platform to other platform. So basically you

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:45.390
have to understand the core philosophy right. If you

00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:48.350
understand the core philosophy then any framework which is

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:51.270
available as of now. Or any framework maybe which will come

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:53.790
in a future right. Because people will keep on creating the

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:56.090
startups and they will keep on launching this kind of a

00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:59.110
framework. You will be able to use it. This is just another

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:03.030
framework right. Another framework. The differentiators are

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:06.190
going to be the ease of use I can say. And on an industry

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:09.910
level differentiators are going to be a cost. The major

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:12.790
differentiators are going to be a cost. That which is going

00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:15.790
to cost me like a and which is easy to build and easy to

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:18.990
develop. I will say it's like every every like a platform.

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:21.790
Nowadays like it's it's very very easy to build and develop

00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:24.990
right. Whether I'm using a lang chain framework or whether

00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:27.650
I'm using a llama index based framework. But yeah eventually

00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:31.150
I will be able to build it. So this is the another framework

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:34.210
you will be able to find out to do the exact same thing.

00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:38.050
Nothing nothing different I would say right. Now there is

00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:43.470
another framework called as crew AI. Crew AI right. Another

00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:46.470
company you can say that when I say framework just think in

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:49.670
the way that I'm talking about a separate company. So there

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:53.290
is another framework called as crew AI and again so crew AI

00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:57.070
is going to help you out in terms of building a agent right.

00:42:57.270 --> 00:43:01.290
So crew in case of a crew AI just like a crew right they

00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:04.970
have given this as a name the name of their startup. So crew

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:07.930
means a team right. This is what we understand means crew.

00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:13.030
So we must have seen a crew on a flight and then maybe on a

00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:15.770
boat or ship or something like that. So it's the same same

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:19.010
thing you will be able to see over here. Technically it's

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:22.630
just a name. You will be able to create the agents means you

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:25.010
will be able to create a system. So which will be able to

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:27.470
make a decision automatically which will be able to complete

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:30.970
a task automatically for example sending an email replying

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:34.850
to a messages churning the entire data from the CRM system

00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:38.410
right or maybe like booking some sort of order for you or

00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:44.070
maybe like you know giving a call to someone yeah or maybe

00:43:44.070 --> 00:43:46.470
analyzing some sort of a call automatically at the end of

00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:48.510
the day. So basically a crew AI will be able to do the same

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:53.230
thing. Now crew AI provides you two path by the way. So one

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:56.810
is basically where you will write a code and then you will

00:43:56.810 --> 00:44:01.010
be able to build or configure the agent right. So by writing

00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:04.110
a code you will be able to do it and then you can deploy

00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:08.750
that code in any platform right. That's one of the way. The

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:13.750
another way crew AI is giving you is without writing a code

00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:16.830
means without writing a code, I will be able to. I will be

00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:19.630
able to build a system and I will be able to configure it.

00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:22.970
So that is something called as crew AI cloud basically they

00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:25.950
are going to charge for it right. They are giving you a free

00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:30.250
trial. So you will be able to do an experiment by the way

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:33.550
right you will be able to do the experiment but inside this

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:37.270
crew AI this is how this crew AI cloud looks like right.

00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:39.570
This is how this these are the option which is available to

00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:42.650
you. So there is something called as crew AI studio. You can

00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:45.630
log in after login basically inside which I'm teach which

00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:47.670
I'm going to teach you. So don't worry but I'm giving you

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:51.510
just an introduction over here right. So from a crew AI what

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:54.790
you can do so you can try to come for like a crew AI studio

00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:58.690
and then from here so you can try to you know start doing a

00:44:58.690 --> 00:45:02.770
task you can try to like do any kind of automation and they

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:06.810
have already given you a lot of prebuilt framework or maybe

00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:09.590
you can say a kind of a project which someone else has

00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:12.250
already done that right. A kind of a project which someone

00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:14.210
else has already done that. So basically you have to just

00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:17.970
configure that project. Or you can try to you know build

00:45:17.970 --> 00:45:21.190
things even from the scratch and they are already giving you

00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:23.870
a lot of different different agents. There is an agent tab

00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:27.110
as you can see right and then once you are going to call add

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:31.250
agent and once you are going to come over here. So see CSV

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:35.410
search tool, composition tool, deli tool and then maybe for

00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:39.230
a data bricks query tool they are giving you. So tons of

00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:43.030
tool they have already attached. So it's already a prebuilt

00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:44.890
one. You don't have to write. You can write YouTube channel

00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:48.370
search tool, YouTube video search tool, website search tool,

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:51.870
bivyad vector search tool, vision tool, XML search tool. So

00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:54.410
there are like lot of like tools they have already created

00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:57.210
and you don't have to like use it. You just have to like

00:45:57.210 --> 00:46:00.150
click and then configure and then you can try to use it as

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:04.010
per your own use. Or else what you can do you can try to

00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:06.610
create your own tool and then you can try to register it

00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:09.370
with the crew AI. So with the help of programming you can

00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:12.970
try to like do a program. So tools I will talk about tools.

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:15.490
Generally people get confused with respect to a tools right

00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:19.910
in a very simple way right. What is tool? Any any idea guys?

00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:20.730
What is tool?

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:29.040
Yeah. Any any idea? Heetal is saying function function. Yes.

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:32.980
So technically see those who gets confused with respect to

00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:36.400
this word called as tool right because you will be hearing

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:39.800
about this word again and again and again. So tool is

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:43.320
nothing but a function and we all know that how to write a

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:46.820
function inside Python. Yes. We all know right that how to

00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:49.980
write a function. So function is nothing new for me tool is

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:54.500
exactly the same with the instruction that okay in which

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:58.760
context I should use this. That's it. So technically tools

00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:02.900
are nothing but function by the way. Yeah. So just just a

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:05.780
function. Just think in that way tool is nothing like a

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:08.780
fancy. So tool is just like a function with the instruction

00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:11.400
that okay I will be doing this task so that my LLM can

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:13.960
understand that. Okay fine. So this tool this tool this tool

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:16.300
I have a multiple tools means I have a multiple function

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:20.000
access but definition or maybe doc string we try to write

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.140
right whenever we try to create a function so we try to

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:24.780
write a doc string that's a standard approach. So basically

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:26.820
with the help of something something like that it will be

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:29.480
able to understand that okay what this function is going to

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:34.140
do right and automatically it will decide that okay fine

00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:36.880
call this function or call that function so tool is

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:40.800
technically a function that you have been writing. Since.

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:44.660
This is a very first day of your programming yeah it's

00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:49.220
nothing like a fancy by the way and calling that tool is

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:52.720
called as tool calling by the way. So tool registry so you

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:55.020
can try to create your own function you can try to register

00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:57.220
it with the crew AI and you can try to bring it to the

00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:59.720
production. So again those things are already available

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:03.840
integration via Slack, JPR, HubSpot all this integration is

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:07.340
given to you Gmail, Google Drive, Jira, Google Calendar,

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:11.520
Outlook, OneDrive, Asana. Whatever system you can think

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:14.960
about so they have almost given you an integration for each

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:18.520
and everything and if something is not given not an issue at

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:22.480
all write a function call the API and then expose that as a

00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:26.880
tool work done right. So this is something that you will be

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:30.840
able to find out inside again LLM connection wise so you can

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:34.820
try to like bring your own LLMs basically right so you can

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:38.620
try to like use open AI or maybe Anthropic, Grok, Azure,

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:39.680
Cohera, Gmail.

00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:50.120
You can try to call any of these LLMs you can try to provide

00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:53.560
the like environment variable and you can try to provide the

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:57.640
API key over there and so even in this case you can try to

00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:01.680
use URI by the way yeah you can try to use a URI over here

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:04.920
and then you will be able to call a URI because URI provides

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:09.660
you a LLM connection. So this is how easy it is guys. Thank

00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:11.820
you. Thanks by the way right this is how easy it is so when

00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:14.360
once we will start like exploring all of these things one by

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:17.540
one one by one you will be able to find out that automating

00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:21.200
something is or modern automation or automation plus plus is

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:25.120
not that tough right so anyone can give me a task and I can

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:29.160
try to like automate it in no time right that is something

00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:32.540
that you will be able to find out. So crew AI is another

00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:37.840
framework so one is a lang framework so lang graph and lang

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:41.700
chain another one is a lama index which we talked about

00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:46.040
another one is basically a crew AI that we are talking about

00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:50.300
as of now so in case of a crew AI it's like a kind of a semi

00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:53.660
code right where you can like write a code or maybe without

00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:56.100
even writing a code just with the help of configuration or

00:49:56.100 --> 00:50:00.240
by writing a minimalistic code right I will be able to

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:05.140
create the agents as simple as that. Then as I have

00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:08.200
mentioned over here right. There is a framework from which

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:08.400
you can create an agent. There is a framework from a

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:16.060
Microsoft called as autogen autogen yeah so basically this

00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:18.880
is a framework which has been released by a Microsoft this

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:22.920
is again going to help you out in terms of creating agents

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:27.800
at the end of the day by the way yeah at the end of the day

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.420
it is going to help you out in terms of creating the agents

00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:35.260
so again not very different right not very different so here

00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:38.180
also I can go I can try to create a multiple different kind

00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:42.300
of tools. And then I can try to integrate it with any number

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:47.060
of things out there and then I will be able to build it yeah

00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:52.060
so autogen studio is basically like a place so where you can

00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:54.640
go and you can try to create a tools a different different

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:59.240
kind of a tools and then eventually so this is again I will

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:02.060
be showing you this part by the way yeah so as you can see

00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:05.160
we are calling the agents we are calling the models we are

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:08.620
calling the tools one by one integrating it with Microsoft.

00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:11.840
One by one and then eventually we will be able to test it

00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:15.620
and we will be able to deploy it so same thing we are going

00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:20.160
to do even in our cases right and as you can see it's like

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:23.200
drag and drop drag and drop so again I can write a code or I

00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:26.080
can try to even do a drag and drop where is a link for this

00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:27.880
autogen studio.

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:43.320
I have to log into my Azure account it's from a different

00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:48.160
email ID okay I'll log in into a different session. Okay.

00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:51.580
Because today anyhow I'm not going to start with the autogen

00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:55.220
so basically it's again the same thing right they are giving

00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:58.040
you like each and every options to integrate a tools or to

00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:01.480
integrate maybe a LLMs or anything that you want or any kind

00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:04.680
of a separate system that you want and eventually you will

00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:08.040
be able to build this entire things so autogen is another

00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:13.200
framework now the another framework is basically n8n so if

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:18.440
you will go to Google and try to search n8n. Basically so

00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:21.980
this is again another framework which is going to help you

00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:26.000
out it's a pure no code kind of a framework basically so

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.940
which is going to help you out in terms of you know creating

00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:35.940
this kind of a entire flow. Let me show you something yeah

00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:36.900
so

00:52:42.210 --> 00:52:44.790
this is going to help you out in terms of creating this

00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:46.670
entire flow this

00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:53.320
kind of a flow so here you will be able to see that that

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:57.080
technically there are like a multiple connectors. So we are

00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:59.500
just trying to connect each and everything and then

00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:02.520
eventually we are trying to perform some sort of a task over

00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:05.900
here so one end to end end to end so we are trying to

00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:08.300
connect each and everything and then based on the connection

00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:11.540
so we are trying to automate each and every task and that

00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:15.420
too without writing even a single piece of the code right.

00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:20.600
So this is where this entire n8n comes into a picture. They

00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:23.760
have given you all kind of a component just come over here

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:26.860
click on this plus and then try to search for anything that

00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:31.280
you want and almost everything they have given to you to do

00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:35.500
any kind of automation I to do any kind of automation by the

00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:38.520
way you can try to add a memory you can try to add a

00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:41.060
different different kind of LLMs over here you can try to

00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:45.320
add your gmail your whatsapp your telegram just just name it

00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:48.900
right just name anything and then you all will be able to

00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:52.500
add each and everything and then inside that you will be

00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:56.640
able to do the configuration. Yeah. So every tool or every

00:53:56.640 --> 00:54:00.340
component which is given inside the n8n technically it comes

00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:03.460
with the configuration so you just have to configure it test

00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:08.500
it run it and then live it inside the production and your

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:13.780
task will be automated end to end and yeah for all of these

00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:17.500
there are so many examples which is already given to you so

00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:20.480
many examples right from a community you will be able to

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:24.200
find out that so many examples are already given to us where

00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:26.760
I can go. I can try to like a select so basically it's a

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:29.480
template which is like so many templates which is like a

00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:33.980
given to us over here in case of n8n so people are building

00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:37.020
more and more and they are like a publishing those templates

00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:39.540
to the entire world so that anyone and everyone will be able

00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:44.240
to use it and the thing is that that once you will be able

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:47.960
to understand that how to create one or two workflows

00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:52.800
believe me you all will be able to create any workflows and

00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:56.940
you all will be able to automate. Any given task may be

00:54:56.940 --> 00:55:02.680
starting from a simple file watcher to a processor to

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:06.640
storing those data into some of the databases automatically

00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:10.100
so that it will keep on watching a particular like a place

00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:13.820
and then once file will arrive it will try to pull those

00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:17.380
files process it as per the logic that you are going to

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:19.900
write and then maybe it will try to dump those data into

00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:23.300
some or the other system or maybe executing some sort of a

00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:26.000
code in a background. Okay. Maybe booking some sort of a

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.120
things for you right or maybe replying to your mail maybe

00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:33.020
like a sending some sort of a messages into your telegram or

00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:37.420
like a running a complete marketing campaign maybe a email

00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:43.240
campaign maybe a drip campaign right. So this is where this

00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:47.600
n8n comes into a picture so one by one one by one so what we

00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:50.680
will do so we will try to explore all of these things but

00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:53.540
yeah so like we will try to start with a lang chain. And

00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:57.480
once you are able to understand the lang chain right believe

00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:02.320
me all the other programming based like agent system or

00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:05.380
agent agentic framework you all will be able to understand

00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:08.560
it easily and then once I am going to show you some of this

00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:12.700
configuration in n8n which is one of the popular one many

00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:16.880
people are using it nowadays. I do not know how many people

00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:21.180
are using it in a production right that stats is not

00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:25.320
available by the way. Okay but yeah so if you will go over a

00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:28.700
social media especially on a YouTube many people are using

00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:33.140
it many people are like doing some sort of flex that I have

00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:36.100
done this automation or I have done that automation with the

00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:42.120
help of n8n yeah. So why we use other framework when we have

00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:47.040
n8n. See majorly it is driven by I would say social media

00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:50.620
and a PR I told you in a beginning itself right. Okay. So

00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:54.160
there is nothing that I cannot do it with the help of n8n

00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:56.500
which I can do it with the help of lang chain or llama

00:56:56.500 --> 00:57:01.720
indexes but yeah so if I have a programming based framework

00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:06.580
I will be having more flexibility right. I will be having

00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:09.660
more flexibility and obviously I will feel more comfortable

00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:13.160
as a programmer as a developer and I will be able to build

00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:16.120
anything around it and everything will be under my control.

00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:21.480
I can try to host it on my own platform. Okay. Any cloud

00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:24.480
platform that I want by the way right I can try to create

00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:27.120
any kind of a function technically a tool in a world of

00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:31.220
agentic AI I can try to integrate it or call it or maybe

00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:36.240
debug it if there will be some sort of a problem. So every

00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:39.340
tool or like these kind of a framework that we see in a

00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:43.900
market it is not like one is good or one is bad and it

00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:48.460
depends upon like how much flexibility it is going to

00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:51.980
provide. And because every tool is good I would say I will

00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:54.440
be able to do all kind of automation with the help of any of

00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:57.680
these two only one right and I can I can do it basically.

00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:01.360
But yeah how much flexibility it is going to provide in

00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:04.720
future if I'm going to get some sort of new use cases which

00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:09.640
maybe I'm not aware about as of now then whether I will be

00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:15.520
able to use those things or not or maybe a pricing maybe a

00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:20.060
cost part. Right. Maybe a time of a delivery that how much

00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:23.540
time it is going to take again after building something. So

00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:27.260
what kind of effort we have to put up in terms of doing a

00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:31.180
maintenance all of these things are required and again if

00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:34.100
I'll talk about the enterprise. So on an enterprise based

00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:38.180
label it's a deal right it's a B2B deal. So let's suppose if

00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:42.540
N8n is able to crack a deal before autogen so obviously your

00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:47.560
company will end up using only N8n. Okay. For a very very

00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:51.000
long time right. So unless and until someone is going to

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:54.640
like bring another deal this is how B2B deal happens in

00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:57.940
general. So none of this tool is good or bad and none of

00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:01.660
this tool is easy or hard in terms of understanding every

00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:05.040
tool is as equally easy I would say and equally tough and

00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:08.460
every tool or all of this framework will be able to help you

00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:11.900
out in terms of achieving any kind of automation. So as for

00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:19.460
me no one is good or bad. So hope we are able to like you

00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:22.900
know get

00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:27.160
some sort of idea about this framework. So the framework

00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:31.100
which I have written over here a Langchain, Langraph, Lama

00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:36.400
indexes, Krew AI, Autogen, N8n right and again so every

00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:38.900
frameworks are going to provide you for example Krew AI so

00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:42.540
they are going to provide you a Krew AI cloud system, N8n so

00:59:42.540 --> 00:59:44.480
obviously they are providing your deployment. Autogen

00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:47.140
technically it's a Azure cloud right. Everything is

00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:50.040
available on Azure cloud itself so obviously there is a

00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:53.380
deployment system that they are providing you. If I'll talk

00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:55.680
about a Langchain, Langraph so obviously we have a

00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:59.180
Langsmith, Langserve or Langstudio so which I can try to use

00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:03.140
I can try to productionize it or maybe not right. So it's

01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:05.640
not like I should use their cloud itself maybe I can try to

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.920
write the code I can try to productionize it anywhere that I

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:12.500
want. I'm not like a restricted just with one thing. Yeah.

01:00:18.790 --> 01:00:22.490
So shall we start like looking into this practical things

01:00:22.490 --> 01:00:27.150
guys a little bit today. Maybe more we will try to like you

01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:28.070
know do it tomorrow.

01:00:33.070 --> 01:00:38.570
Yeah okay. So let's like open up your VS code and we will

01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:41.890
start doing some sort of a small implementation today not a

01:00:41.890 --> 01:00:44.750
big one because as we'll progress obviously we'll end up

01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:48.710
doing a big implementation but yeah I will start small a

01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:56.010
very very small. Fine. Okay. So just try to open up your VS

01:00:56.010 --> 01:00:57.570
code and

01:01:00.450 --> 01:01:06.770
here so let's try to create some folder right. Maybe I'm

01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:11.850
going to give a name as a agentic AI as a folder name. You

01:01:11.850 --> 01:01:17.290
can try to give a name of your choice that's okay. Okay so

01:01:17.290 --> 01:01:20.250
agentic AI so this is the folder that I have created. Now

01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:23.250
what we can do so maybe we can try to configure a new

01:01:23.250 --> 01:01:30.130
environment. Yeah. So here agentic AI environment let's try

01:01:30.130 --> 01:01:33.410
to go and create it so that even today tomorrow or even in

01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:35.810
the future we will end up using this environment. So maybe

01:01:35.810 --> 01:01:38.110
you can try to use a python environment or maybe you can use

01:01:38.110 --> 01:01:42.330
a conda. I think we have done this environment creation even

01:01:42.330 --> 01:01:46.710
in the past. So let's go ahead and write conda create create

01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:50.670
hyphen n environment name is agentic AI. Let's suppose I'm

01:01:50.670 --> 01:01:53.870
giving you can give your name. That's okay. So conda create

01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:57.490
hyphen n. Your name is equal to agentic AI and then python

01:01:57.490 --> 01:02:04.890
python is equals to I'll give 3.10 for now. Yeah. Hit enter.

01:02:05.170 --> 01:02:12.000
So python 3.10. Let's let's keep it 3.10 for now. Not a

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:17.940
latest one. Not a 3.13. Yeah. Do it everyone or

01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:25.310
if you have any 3.10 environment available you can even use

01:02:25.310 --> 01:02:28.890
that. I don't have any kind of issue. Okay. So conda

01:02:28.890 --> 01:02:37.050
environment is created. Now conda activate agenti agenti I

01:02:37.050 --> 01:02:40.010
have written. Okay. That's okay. That's not an issue. So

01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:43.070
fine. I have just activated this environment. Yeah. I have

01:02:43.070 --> 01:02:46.350
just activated this particular environment. So now I'm in

01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:50.210
this environment and hope all of you are able to like create

01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:51.150
the environment.

01:02:55.940 --> 01:03:03.460
Fine. Okay. So please share the code. Which code? Which one?

01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:09.790
Have I written any kind of a code by the way? Okay. Come on

01:03:09.790 --> 01:03:14.610
guys. See if you are keeping this these kind of expectation

01:03:14.610 --> 01:03:19.090
right I'm hoping that none of us are kid and I have already

01:03:19.090 --> 01:03:21.850
shown you the same thing multiple times in your previous

01:03:21.850 --> 01:03:25.850
class. So if you are coming in this class and asking about

01:03:25.850 --> 01:03:29.170
how to create an environment which is like a basic and we

01:03:29.170 --> 01:03:34.430
should know I think it's bad. It means you are not able to

01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:38.850
move yourself a bit in last like a couple of weeks I would

01:03:38.850 --> 01:03:43.950
say. Yeah. So you should not keep this kind of expectation.

01:03:44.290 --> 01:03:48.030
It's a wrong expectation by the way in a class. Okay. So we

01:03:48.030 --> 01:03:50.850
are able to create the environment. Now what we'll do. I'll

01:03:50.850 --> 01:03:55.050
try to create a new notebook and here maybe I can name it as

01:03:55.050 --> 01:04:01.330
a lang chain lang c-h-a-i-n chain dot i-p-y-n-b. As of now.

01:04:01.330 --> 01:04:04.270
I'll go with the notebook approach but in my next class when

01:04:04.270 --> 01:04:07.830
I will try to do a deployment at that point of a time no

01:04:07.830 --> 01:04:11.190
notebook approach will write a modular code when we'll try

01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:15.090
to talk about a lang serve or you know lang smith where we

01:04:15.090 --> 01:04:18.650
are going to productionize the things. So obviously we have

01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:22.390
to create that production kind of environment. So I'll just

01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:24.810
leave the notebook. Notebook is just for the experimentation

01:04:24.810 --> 01:04:31.110
for now. So here select kernel and python kernel. And this

01:04:31.110 --> 01:04:33.570
is a new environment which I have created. Right. Python 3

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:37.710
.10 agent TKI. So I have just selected the environment for

01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:43.730
my notebook. Okay. Now that's fine. Now like I said so I

01:04:43.730 --> 01:04:47.910
need basically an access of LLMs. Yeah. I need access of

01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:52.030
LLMs. Without LLMs I will not be able to do anything. And

01:04:52.030 --> 01:04:56.750
this is where this URI AI comes into a picture. Right. This

01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:59.510
URI AI comes into a picture. Otherwise. You can you can use

01:04:59.510 --> 01:05:02.290
any of this model. I don't have any issue even from outside.

01:05:02.650 --> 01:05:08.490
But yeah URI is providing you 1 lakh token per day. 365 lakh

01:05:08.490 --> 01:05:11.690
token for an entire year. I don't think that anyone is

01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:15.890
providing you that much of token. And that too with these

01:05:15.890 --> 01:05:21.490
main number of models basically. Right. In one places and

01:05:21.490 --> 01:05:25.890
that too without charging. Right. Because this comes as a

01:05:25.890 --> 01:05:28.350
complimentary system. So whenever you take a courses. By

01:05:28.350 --> 01:05:32.470
default we all have an access of this URI API ecosystem. So

01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:34.590
basically it's a complimentary one. Right. It's a

01:05:34.590 --> 01:05:38.170
complimentary one that we have given to you. So that there

01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:40.650
should not be any kind of a hurdle or bottleneck you should

01:05:40.650 --> 01:05:45.710
face while learning. And I believe we all know that how to

01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:48.710
create a API. So you can try to create any number of API

01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:52.530
key. Make sure to deactivate it if you have shared your API

01:05:52.530 --> 01:05:55.950
key with anyone. Otherwise they will end up consuming your

01:05:55.950 --> 01:06:00.770
tokens. Right. You will not be able to use it. Plus we also

01:06:00.770 --> 01:06:03.590
know that where we can go and where we can track it. So

01:06:03.590 --> 01:06:06.870
daily availability limit is basically 1 lakh token which is

01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:10.790
more than enough. More than way more than enough I would say

01:06:10.790 --> 01:06:14.630
to do any kind of experimentation on a regular basis. Even

01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:18.050
it's more than enough for any kind of a broad based system.

01:06:18.370 --> 01:06:22.050
Right. And it's one of the most highly available system that

01:06:22.050 --> 01:06:25.370
you will be able to find out. And here. So if I'll talk

01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:28.950
about LLMs. So many LLMs are available. From Alibaba, Quen

01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:31.330
series is available. Flux is available. Deepseek is

01:06:31.330 --> 01:06:34.870
available. Gemini series is available. So almost all the

01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:37.070
version of Gemini you will be able to find out. Gemini

01:06:37.070 --> 01:06:41.230
embedding. Grok is available. Right. LGAI is available.

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:44.990
Metalama is available. Mistral is available. OpenAI. All

01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:50.970
models are available. 4, 5, OSS20B, OSS120B. PlayAI is

01:06:50.970 --> 01:06:55.090
available. TogetherAI is available in one single places. Not

01:06:55.090 --> 01:06:58.190
just that. Right. That was not a main point because we have

01:06:58.190 --> 01:07:02.930
already talked about it in a past basically. AI frameworks.

01:07:03.330 --> 01:07:06.370
Now if you will come to AI frameworks you will be able to

01:07:06.370 --> 01:07:10.510
find out that we have already made this URI AI compatible

01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:14.290
with the LANG chain, with the CRU AI, with the LANG graph,

01:07:14.490 --> 01:07:17.770
with the auto gen, with the small agent and with the LAMA

01:07:17.770 --> 01:07:20.410
indexes. We have already made it compatible. Right.

01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:24.050
Compatible means. So basically whenever you are going to use

01:07:24.050 --> 01:07:26.710
this framework. Right. So obviously all of this framework

01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:30.750
needs a LLM. Without LLM it will not work. As simple as

01:07:30.750 --> 01:07:34.850
that. Now. So let's suppose if I have created some API

01:07:34.850 --> 01:07:39.350
endpoints. So I have to make it compatible as per the nature

01:07:39.350 --> 01:07:42.570
of a particular framework. Generally a PIDENTIC basically.

01:07:42.830 --> 01:07:47.610
So which has been used to you know validate a data set that

01:07:47.610 --> 01:07:50.570
you are going to pass. So we have already made it compatible

01:07:50.570 --> 01:07:55.030
with this one. And yeah. It's not like. You can make it

01:07:55.030 --> 01:07:57.710
compatible but you have to write the additional code just to

01:07:57.710 --> 01:08:00.630
avoid that part. So we have made it compatible and we have

01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:04.710
released the SDK by the way. So SDK means pi pi. So even SDK

01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:08.070
for a Python and for a node. Those who would like to use it

01:08:08.070 --> 01:08:10.770
in a web development they can even use it over there. And

01:08:10.770 --> 01:08:14.190
even with respect to Python. So you can click over here and

01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:19.190
you will be able to find out that we have released a package

01:08:19.190 --> 01:08:26.010
of a URI AI called as URI AI. Simple. Where if you will go

01:08:26.010 --> 01:08:29.570
and check. So we have already given you a auto gen, crew AI,

01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:32.750
lanche, small agent, lan graph all of these compatibility.

01:08:33.150 --> 01:08:37.510
So that without even giving a second thought you can use any

01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:41.170
of our model with respect to these frameworks. You don't

01:08:41.170 --> 01:08:45.110
have to go anywhere outside. If you have to consume models

01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:48.830
from outside that's also OK. If you are willing to pay the

01:08:48.830 --> 01:08:52.650
price because I don't think that any framework out there is

01:08:52.650 --> 01:08:55.130
giving you this much of a limit. Yeah they are giving you

01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:57.910
some free trial. That's OK. But yeah not not this much of a

01:08:57.910 --> 01:09:00.650
limit. You will be able to find out which we are giving you

01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:06.250
as a complimentary. And here this is the SDK. This is just a

01:09:06.250 --> 01:09:09.150
simple like you have to do the installation and then start

01:09:09.150 --> 01:09:12.770
using it. Right. And if you'll come to this framework. So we

01:09:12.770 --> 01:09:15.950
have given you an example as well. So if I click on this

01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:20.170
view example. Right. So here documentation of a lanche you

01:09:20.170 --> 01:09:22.850
will be able to find out. We have attached that link as

01:09:22.850 --> 01:09:25.750
well. Right. So that you can understand model message tools

01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:28.510
agent memory if you would like to. Otherwise just click on

01:09:28.510 --> 01:09:32.970
this view examples. And here we have given example a basic

01:09:32.970 --> 01:09:37.290
one streaming support. Right. Async operation function

01:09:37.290 --> 01:09:40.270
calling a structure output LCLE lanche basically expression

01:09:40.270 --> 01:09:44.050
language advanced feature. So so many examples we have given

01:09:44.050 --> 01:09:48.950
you a small small example so that you will be able to use it

01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:52.410
with ease. Right. You will be able to use it with ease for

01:09:52.410 --> 01:09:56.330
example. So let's suppose if I have to use this a very first

01:09:56.330 --> 01:09:59.090
basic setup example which is providing you just a LMS.

01:09:59.250 --> 01:10:03.370
Right. Which is providing you LMS for a lanche chain. So how

01:10:03.370 --> 01:10:08.790
you will be able to invoke this LMS basically or like chat

01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:15.130
model basically. So copy this code simple from here. Now go

01:10:15.130 --> 01:10:18.850
to your Jupyter notebook. Right. So this is my code from a

01:10:18.850 --> 01:10:22.710
URI. Right. So create chat model and it is looking for your

01:10:22.710 --> 01:10:27.870
API key. And here is a model ID. So by default GPT 4.1 nano

01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:31.650
is given. You can try to give any ID or any model that we

01:10:31.650 --> 01:10:35.730
want. We have like a 29 model which is available. I think

01:10:35.730 --> 01:10:39.230
now it's 31. Last week we have added Grok or something. So

01:10:39.230 --> 01:10:43.030
now it's a 30 plus model access that is there. So you can

01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:46.310
try to give a model ID and then eventually you will be able

01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:51.710
to use it. Now this code. Is going to like create a LMS for

01:10:51.710 --> 01:10:54.490
you. Means it is giving an access to a LMS. And now this

01:10:54.490 --> 01:10:57.850
access you can try to use it for any agents or agentic

01:10:57.850 --> 01:11:01.150
system with respect to a lanche chain. Just with respect to

01:11:01.150 --> 01:11:04.890
a lanche chain. So here URI AI should be available in your

01:11:04.890 --> 01:11:07.650
system in a very first place. Right. URI AI should be

01:11:07.650 --> 01:11:10.910
available if I'm going to execute it. So it is going to give

01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:14.750
me an issue saying that that URI AI is not available or URI

01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:18.050
AI module not found kind of error I will end up getting.

01:11:18.050 --> 01:11:22.770
Just wait for 2 minutes. It will give me an error. Saying

01:11:22.770 --> 01:11:25.270
that that URI AI is not available.

01:11:32.050 --> 01:11:35.690
It is trying to install a Jupyter notebook in my new

01:11:35.690 --> 01:11:36.130
environment.

01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:44.080
I found this URI AI lanche chain very useful. Thanks for

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:47.780
adding it. Yeah. Yeah. So as you can see guys it is giving

01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:50.780
me an error. Right. Saying that that module not found error.

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:54.380
This is what we were expecting by the way. Right. So because

01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:58.720
URI AI is a SDK or you can say library. That we have found.

01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:00.440
That we have released from our side from our own side.

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:05.760
Right. And it's not available in my like environment which I

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:08.920
have created. Right. So I have to install this URI AI. How

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:12.160
to install it. So maybe I can go to my environment or even

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:14.260
from a Jupyter notebook I can do the installation. I think

01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:18.780
we all know the game. So here I can write quip install URI

01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:23.040
AI. Right. Or maybe you can just try to like you know go

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:28.500
there and where is my. Oh

01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:37.630
where is my tab. Yeah. So you can go there and then copy.

01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:40.310
Quip install URI AI. I think we all understand how to

01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:44.790
install a python package. Right. And you can come to your

01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:47.410
Jupyter notebook and then do the installation. As simple as

01:12:47.410 --> 01:12:51.650
that. Right. So quip install URI AI and hit enter. So

01:12:51.650 --> 01:12:54.850
automatically it will start installing the package.

01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:58.390
Everything. Lanche chain. Langraph. Autogen. Everything. It

01:12:58.390 --> 01:13:03.210
will start installing. So yeah. Looks like it is able to

01:13:03.210 --> 01:13:06.010
install. Maybe I can try to do a cross verification. So quip

01:13:06.010 --> 01:13:11.490
show URI AI. So URI AI is installed as you can see in my

01:13:11.490 --> 01:13:15.590
environment. Right. In my environment and author email ID as

01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:18.170
you can see it's been released from our site tech at the red

01:13:18.170 --> 01:13:24.650
Euron dot one. Okay. So python client for URI API with a CLI

01:13:24.650 --> 01:13:29.230
lanche chain. Lama index integration and all. So this is

01:13:29.230 --> 01:13:32.110
just a small definition that you will be able to find out

01:13:32.110 --> 01:13:37.730
now. So now it will not give me this error. If I am going to

01:13:37.730 --> 01:13:41.150
execute it now maybe I can restart my kernel once again.

01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:45.950
Yeah. And now if I am going to execute it. So see now my

01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:50.330
error has changed. Now it's not giving me module not found

01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:53.570
kind of error because it is able to find out the module. Now

01:13:53.570 --> 01:13:58.370
it is giving me basically field takes no argument. So

01:13:58.370 --> 01:14:01.830
technically I have to provide the API key right. I have to

01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:05.090
provide the API key so that it can hit this particular model

01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:08.170
which is hosted on URI. Right. It can hit this particular

01:14:08.170 --> 01:14:11.510
model and then it should be able to give me the answer.

01:14:11.570 --> 01:14:13.970
Answer for this one. What is artificial intelligence. Right.

01:14:14.190 --> 01:14:18.030
And it should give me the content. So I have to pass my API

01:14:18.030 --> 01:14:21.790
key over here. So how I can pass my API key. Again simple. I

01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:24.650
think we all know the. Yeah. Like a place. So API key.

01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:29.110
Click. Yeah. Create API key. Give any kind of a name. Create

01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:31.850
it. So you can create as many API key as possible. Right. So

01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:35.650
copy this API key. And then pass it there. We have already

01:14:35.650 --> 01:14:40.290
used it. In past. Right. While doing RAG. So here is my API

01:14:40.290 --> 01:14:44.790
key. Which which I am passing. And now. What what happens.

01:14:46.610 --> 01:14:53.110
GPT 4.1 nano field takes no argument. API key field takes no

01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:53.110
argument.

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:03.560
Output is truncated.

01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:10.280
Create chat model.

01:15:14.210 --> 01:15:20.430
Let me check. What is the issue. It was. There is no issue

01:15:20.430 --> 01:15:20.990
which I see.

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:35.420
Enhanced lang chain. Hmm.

01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:50.230
AI framework. Lang chain. Streaming support. Fine. So chunk

01:15:50.230 --> 01:15:54.230
async I.O. You can use.

01:15:58.420 --> 01:15:59.940
Function. I.O. Function. Calling.

01:16:37.190 --> 01:16:41.690
There is some issue. I am not even able to copy. Okay. Let

01:16:41.690 --> 01:16:43.890
me close. Open up VS code once again.

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:51.240
It will work. It always works. There is some issue in my

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:51.760
system.

01:17:45.490 --> 01:17:47.410
Field takes no argument.

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:57.640
Yeah. This. I think. This must be working for you guys. In

01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:02.620
my system. So. As you can see. So many tabs are open. For a

01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:06.040
VS code itself. Six tabs are open. So. So. System gets

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:10.320
confused. Sometime. Because. You know. I do a lot of. Like.

01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:14.640
Separate project. Work. And experimentation. So. My system

01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:17.920
is bit confused. But. It. It will work. Just. Like. Same

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:20.160
error is coming. No. So. It is not working. Mine too. Is it.

01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:24.420
I think. Bearer API key. Bearer is not required here. By the

01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:26.800
way. So. We have already handled a bearer in a backend.

01:18:30.570 --> 01:18:31.390
Let me check.

01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:47.120
Working fine for me. Yeah. So. I am also facing the same

01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:50.360
issue. Okay. So. Some people are saying that. You know.

01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:57.420
Working fine. And. Some people are saying that. It is. Not

01:18:57.420 --> 01:19:00.660
working. Let me. Upgrade. My URI. Maybe it is a notebook

01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:04.360
issue. Catchy issue. Basically. Let me do the installation.

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:08.560
Once again. It. It will work. Don't worry. It is a catchy

01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:11.120
issue in your system. Or my system. Because of that. It is

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:13.200
not working. It always works. And it will work.

01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:28.810
Let me install. A pidentic.

01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:40.090
Okay. Pidentic is. Basically. Successfully installed. It is

01:19:40.090 --> 01:19:43.170
a pidentic issue. I will tell you. Like. How to make it

01:19:43.170 --> 01:19:46.110
work. It is basically. A pidentic issue.

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:55.860
Okay. Let me make it. Correct. Or. Let me. Change. My.

01:19:56.040 --> 01:20:01.040
Other. Environment. I have created. Called as. Lang. Study.

01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:01.860
Yeah.

01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:10.700
So. See. It is working. Yeah. It is working. Like I told

01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:13.320
you. It is a pidentic issue. By the way. I will tell you.

01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:16.020
How to fix it. Like I said. It always works. And you can see

01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:16.500
my output.

01:20:28.850 --> 01:20:31.210
So. Let me tell you. What was the actual issue. It is a

01:20:31.210 --> 01:20:37.950
pidentic issue. So. Show. Pidentic.

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:47.820
Yeah. So. Here. I am using. Pidentic version. Okay. So. This

01:20:47.820 --> 01:20:52.100
entire. So. This is the pidentic. That. I am using. In my

01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:56.920
system. So. For anyone. If it is not working. Right. So.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.300
Technically. It is a pidentic issue. And. Here. So. You have

01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:04.540
to install. The same version. So. Which I am using. Over

01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:07.480
here. In this environment. Right. So. Let's suppose. If I am

01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:11.800
going to select. Another environment. Agentic AI. Agentic

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:16.460
AI. And. Inside. This environment. I can try to install.

01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:18.720
This 2.5.1.

01:21:24.690 --> 01:21:26.610
Okay. So. Conda.

01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:29.690
Activate.

01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:38.180
Agentic AI. And. Then. Pip install.

01:21:41.330 --> 01:21:46.290
Pidentic. Is. Equals to. 2.5.0.

01:21:50.010 --> 01:21:52.670
Pidentic. Equal. Equal. To.

01:21:56.590 --> 01:21:59.950
Hmm. So. Basically. I have done. This installation. So. I

01:21:59.950 --> 01:22:02.490
have installed. Pidentic. And. Now. If I am going to use.

01:22:02.530 --> 01:22:07.990
The same. Agentic AI. Environment. Here. Now. It's. Okay.

01:22:08.330 --> 01:22:11.070
So. Again. Failed. In this. Environment.

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:25.080
It's. Working. In this. Environment.

01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:37.180
Pidentic. And. Then.

01:22:40.780 --> 01:22:46.280
Print. Pidentic. Version. Okay. So. It's. A. 2.11. Hmm.

01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:55.200
Okay.

01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:14.980
Yeah. So. Python. 1. 1. This. Should. Work. 2.11.7. It.

01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:17.780
Should. Work. With. The. Python. 3.10. So. This. Is. The.

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:18.860
Only. Like. A. You. Know.

01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:51.840
Okay. Now. I. Have. Yeah. I. Have. This. 2.11. Restart. The.

01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:52.320
Kernel.

01:23:58.680 --> 01:23:59.600
Same. Issue.

01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:10.150
So. Ideally. It. Should. Not. Give. Me. An. Issue. Because.

01:25:10.290 --> 01:25:14.190
It. Is. Not. Giving. Me. Issue. With. The. Another. Version.

01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:20.340
Of. My. Installation. So. How. Many. Of. You. Are. Able. To.

01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:20.780
Run. In. Guys.

01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:42.630
Not. From. My. Side. Okay. Upgrade. Is. Like. Has. Already.

01:25:42.850 --> 01:25:47.480
Installed. A. Latest. Version. Of. Yuri. So. Yeah.

01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:50.740
Requirement. Already. Satisfied. We. Can. Restart. It. Just.

01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:52.840
A. Version. Conflict. It's. I. Have. Shown. You. Right.

01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:55.760
It's. Already. Working. In. One. Of. My. Environment. Which.

01:25:55.860 --> 01:25:57.200
I. Configured. Yesterday. Itself.

01:26:00.050 --> 01:26:03.330
So. Just. A. Catch. Which. It. Is. Not. Able. To. Clean.

01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:14.260
I'm. Able. To. Execute. Your. Version. Some. Version. And.

01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:18.120
Identity. Below. Combination. Identity. Yeah. I. Also.

01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:21.340
Installed. Identity. Two. Point. One. One. Is. Working. In.

01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:22.980
This. New. One. It's. Not. Working. The.

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:39.260
One. Again. In. This. Environment. So. I. Have. Identity.

01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:43.040
Is. Equal. To. Two. Point. One. One. Point. Seven. So. This.

01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:45.920
Is. The. Identity. Which. I'm. Using. So. Technically. It.

01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:49.220
Should. Work. Can. You. Please. Bring. Me. The. URI. API.

01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:52.860
Install. Command. Is. Just. A. People. Install. URI. So.

01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:56.340
This. One. This. Upgradation. But. Yeah. Same. Command. Can.

01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:59.900
Be. Used. For. Installation. As. Well. Just. Remove. The.

01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:08.250
Upgrade. Part. Okay. So. This. Is. Something. Which. Is.

01:27:08.290 --> 01:27:10.630
Working. In. My. System. My. Today's. Environment. Is.

01:27:10.670 --> 01:27:15.790
Working. By. The. Way. Now. I. Can. Go. Here. And. I. Can.

01:27:15.850 --> 01:27:20.790
Try. To. Click. On. Available. A. Framework. Lang. Chain.

01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:23.450
View. Example. And. Streaming. Support. Maybe. I. Can.

01:27:24.050 --> 01:27:27.130
Click. Here. I. Copy. This. Code. Streaming. Code. No. Need.

01:27:27.210 --> 01:27:30.190
To. Understand. As. Of. Now. I'll. Explain. You. And. Then.

01:27:30.250 --> 01:27:33.550
I. Come. Here. Replace. With. The. Uri. API. Key. So.

01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:36.530
Whatever. API. Key. That. I. Been. Using. I. Can. Try. To.

01:27:36.630 --> 01:27:37.810
Like. Use. The. Same.

01:28:31.490 --> 01:28:34.910
And. Even. This. Should. Work. Yeah. So. It's. Working. As.

01:28:35.010 --> 01:28:37.310
You. Can. See. It. Able. To. Do. The. Streaming. Of. The.

01:28:37.370 --> 01:28:41.090
Data. Set. And. Then.

01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:48.250
It. Is. Giving. Me. Some. Runtime. Error. Chunk. Chat. But.

01:28:48.290 --> 01:28:50.330
Yeah. So. Before. That. It. Has. Also. Given. Me. The.

01:28:50.550 --> 01:28:54.510
Answer. Now. The. Whole. Purpose. Behind. Like. Running.

01:28:54.650 --> 01:28:56.990
This. Two. Things. Is. Nothing. But. To. Check. Whether.

01:28:57.150 --> 01:29:00.070
LLM. Is. Available. With. Respect. To. A. Lang. Chain.

01:29:00.490 --> 01:29:02.690
Compatibility. Or. Not. That. There. Was. A. Purpose. There.

01:29:02.810 --> 01:29:06.530
Was. No. Other. Purposes. Which. It. Is. Serving. So. LLM.

01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:10.090
Is. Available. And. I. Can. Use. This. Entire. LLMs. Right.

01:29:10.150 --> 01:29:14.230
I. Try. To. Use. This. Entire. LLMs. For. My. Lang. Chain.

01:29:14.770 --> 01:29:17.970
Basically. Yeah. For. The. Lang. Chain. The. Where. I. Try.

01:29:18.010 --> 01:29:20.290
To. Call. The. URI. And. Then. I. Will. Be. Able. To. Use.

01:29:20.290 --> 01:29:23.050
It. Now. Instead. Of. Using. URI. You. Can. Try. To. Go.

01:29:23.070 --> 01:29:27.730
Ahead. With. The. Open. Ai. Ecosystem. As. Well. Not. A.

01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:30.910
Ecosystem. I. Would. Say. Open. Ai. Tokens. And. Then. You.

01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:33.630
Can. Try. To. Call. Open. Ai. As. Well. Lang. Chain.

01:29:33.810 --> 01:29:35.970
Provides. You. A. Direct. Compatibility. With. The. Open.

01:29:35.970 --> 01:29:39.050
Ai. And. Also. Given. You. A. Rapper. Library. So. Open. Ai.

01:29:39.210 --> 01:29:41.550
Library. Rapper. For. A. Lang. Chain. You. Can. Just. Pass.

01:29:41.650 --> 01:29:44.570
It. And. Then. In. A. Exact. Same. Manner. Nothing.

01:29:44.730 --> 01:29:48.010
Different. Right. Now. Exact. Same. Manner. You. All. Will.

01:29:48.170 --> 01:29:52.330
Be. Able. To. Create. This. One. As. Well. Means. Whatever.

01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:54.590
I. Am. Able. To. Do. It. With. Respect. To. Yuri. Exact.

01:29:54.650 --> 01:29:56.530
Same. Thing. You. Will. Be. Able. To. Do. It. With. Respect.

01:29:56.630 --> 01:30:00.890
To. Open. Ai. Now. Once. This. Part. Is. Verified. That.

01:30:01.030 --> 01:30:07.010
I'm. Able. To. Use. A. Yuri. Ai. And. From. There. I'm.

01:30:07.090 --> 01:30:10.590
Able. To. Use. Some. Of. The. Lm. Models. Right. For.

01:30:10.650 --> 01:30:14.230
Example. Gpt. 4.1. Nano. If. I'm. Able. To. Use. It. I'm.

01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:17.430
Good. With. Like. I'm. I can. Go. Ahead. And. I can. Try.

01:30:17.450 --> 01:30:20.370
To. Start. Creating. Them. Agents. With. By. The. Way. Yeah.

01:30:20.630 --> 01:30:23.770
So. Just. Do. This. Experimentation. Guys. And. Those. Who.

01:30:23.830 --> 01:30:25.910
Are. Facing. An. Issue. So. Majorly. It's. A. Pydantic.

01:30:26.130 --> 01:30:28.830
Issues. Right. Just. A. Pydantic. Issues. Nothing. Much. I.

01:30:28.870 --> 01:30:31.910
Would. Say. Maybe. You. Can. Try. To. Change. The. Python.

01:30:32.190 --> 01:30:34.950
Version. Maybe. Just. Go. Ahead. And. Use. Three. Point.

01:30:34.990 --> 01:30:38.210
One. One. Try. With. Three. Point. One. Two. And. It. It.

01:30:38.270 --> 01:30:41.370
Should. Work. Because. When. We. Have. Released. This.

01:30:41.430 --> 01:30:44.690
Library. So. It. So. We. Have. Already. Mentioned. That. It.

01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:47.330
Should. Work. With. All. More. Than. Three. Point. Six. And.

01:30:47.410 --> 01:30:49.290
We. Have. Checked. The. Compatibility. And. It. Was.

01:30:49.530 --> 01:30:51.750
Working. But. Sometime. What. Happens. Is. That. That. If.

01:30:51.890 --> 01:30:54.010
Someone. Has. Released. Some. Sort. Of. Update. And. They.

01:30:54.050 --> 01:30:56.070
Are. Using. Some. Different. Parenting. Version. It. Will.

01:30:56.110 --> 01:30:58.610
Start. Giving. You. An. Issue. So. The. Only. Thing. Is.

01:30:58.650 --> 01:31:01.030
That. That. Just. Like. Do. Some. Sort. Of. Experimentation.

01:31:01.050 --> 01:31:03.170
With. The. Different. Different. Python. Version. As. The.

01:31:03.250 --> 01:31:04.190
Latest. One. That. We. Have. Released. On.

01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:24.090
August. One. And. Then. Let's. Try. To. Run. Some. Sort. Of.

01:31:24.670 --> 01:31:27.410
Experimentation. With. Respect. To. Agents. And. Let's. Try.

01:31:27.450 --> 01:31:30.150
To. Learn. That. How. We. Can. Create. Agents. Inside. A.

01:31:30.270 --> 01:31:34.370
Lang. Chain. Fine. Guys. What. Is. A. Pydentic. Library. So.

01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:37.590
Nowadays. Almost. Every. Framework. Developer. So. They.

01:31:37.670 --> 01:31:40.870
Are. Trying. To. Use. One. Library. Which. Name. Is.

01:31:40.890 --> 01:31:43.970
Obviously. Pydentic. Or. What. What. It. Does. So.

01:31:44.030 --> 01:31:46.010
Basically. Whenever. You. Are. Going. To. Pass. A. Data.

01:31:46.290 --> 01:31:49.230
Because. Everything. Requires. A. Input. Right. So.

01:31:49.230 --> 01:31:51.730
Whenever. You. Are. Going. To. Pass. A. Data. It. Behaves.

01:31:51.790 --> 01:31:54.450
Like. A. Data. Validator. So. It. Will. Try. To. Validate.

01:31:54.510 --> 01:31:56.190
Your. Data. So. Whether. You. Are. Passing. A. String. Or.

01:31:56.230 --> 01:31:58.350
Maybe. Integer. Or. Maybe. Something. Else. So. Basically.

01:31:59.270 --> 01:32:02.350
And. Every. Library. Is. Trying. To. Keep. Themself. As. A.

01:32:02.490 --> 01:32:03.550
Compatible. With. The. Pydentic.

01:32:07.050 --> 01:32:08.870
It's. Working. In. Google. Lab. It. Will. Work. Everywhere.

01:32:09.010 --> 01:32:13.890
By. The. Way. Yeah. Now. Let's. To. Create.

01:32:18.610 --> 01:32:21.030
Agents. Yeah. Now. Let's. Try. To. Create. The. Agents.

01:32:21.070 --> 01:32:24.510
Over. Here. Now. To. Create. An. Agents. We. Need. To. Like.

01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:28.270
Import. Some. Of. The. Libraries. And. Then. We. Can. Start.

01:32:28.450 --> 01:32:31.410
Creating. The. Agents. By. The. Way. Shall. We. Go. Ahead.

01:32:31.490 --> 01:32:32.270
Guys. Shall. We. Start.

01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:43.980
Yeah. Okay. So. Let's. Do. It. So. Here. To.

01:32:58.680 --> 01:33:04.620
Start. This. Math. Library. Let's. Import. A. OS. Library.

01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:08.000
And. Says. All. All. Of. This. Like. A. Libraries. Let's.

01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:11.840
Try. To. Import. It. Then. Maybe. We. Can. Try. To. Import.

01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:18.220
OS. Dot. Environment. And. Then. We. Try. To. Write. Down.

01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:18.820
Over. Here.

01:33:28.050 --> 01:33:28.870
URI. API.

01:33:32.590 --> 01:33:36.390
Key. And. Then. Here. So. We. Can. Try. To. Pass. The. URI.

01:33:36.510 --> 01:33:37.770
API. Key. By. The. Way.

01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:55.200
So. It. Should. Be. Same. 3A. 5. 4. B. 1. 3E. A.

01:33:58.750 --> 01:34:01.910
Yeah. So. Let's. Try. To. Create. A. Placeholder. For. A.

01:34:01.970 --> 01:34:04.330
URI. API. Key. So. That. We. Try. To. Use. It. In. A. Later.

01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:08.130
Stage. Then. Once. This. Is. Done. Let's. Try. To. Do. Some.

01:34:08.230 --> 01:34:11.590
Sort. Of. Import. So. First. Of. All. URI. Dot. Lang. Chain.

01:34:11.630 --> 01:34:14.010
Import. Create. Chat. Model. That. We. Have. Already.

01:34:14.110 --> 01:34:17.910
Imported. Before. Right. And. Then. We. Can. Try. To.

01:34:17.930 --> 01:34:22.130
Import. Some. Of. The. Lang. Chain. So. I. Import. From.

01:34:22.190 --> 01:34:24.690
Lang. Chain. Lang. Chain.

01:34:27.810 --> 01:34:32.380
Dot. Agents. Import.

01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:40.640
Create. Reactive. Agent. Create.

01:34:45.030 --> 01:34:48.490
React. Agent. And. Then. Agent. Executor.

01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:56.200
Agent.

01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:02.600
Executor. Yeah. So. From. An. Agent. There.

01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:09.520
Executor. So. That. I. Can. Create. It. And. Then. Execute.

01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:12.160
The. Agents. By. The. Way. So. That. Automatically. It.

01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:15.420
Will. Be. Able. To. Make. A. Decision. Now. Once. This.

01:35:15.740 --> 01:35:22.860
Done. Let's. Try. To. Import. From. Lang. Chain. Core. Lang.

01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:29.780
Chain. Core. Just. Try. To. Import. Prompts. And. Import. A.

01:35:30.060 --> 01:35:36.980
Prompt. Template. Then. Chat. Prompt. Template. And. Then.

01:35:36.980 --> 01:35:39.480
Message. Prompt. Template.

01:35:43.310 --> 01:35:47.710
Placeholder. Yeah. Then. From. Lang. Chain.

01:35:50.970 --> 01:35:56.550
Core. Try. To. Import. Output. Parser. And. Then. A.

01:35:56.610 --> 01:35:57.690
Structured. Output. Parser. Yeah.

01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:11.940
And. We. Can. Import. Even. A. String. Output. Parser. Then.

01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:14.200
From. Lang. Chain. Core.

01:36:17.090 --> 01:36:22.910
Import. Runables. And. Then. Import. Runable. Pass. Through.

01:36:23.010 --> 01:36:30.890
Is. Fine. Runable. Lambda. Is. Fine. Runable. R.

01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:37.420
U. Double. N.

01:36:40.110 --> 01:36:43.590
Runable. With. Message. History. Yeah. This. Something.

01:36:43.670 --> 01:36:45.150
That. We. Have. To. Import.

01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:57.620
Chat. History.

01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:04.200
Chat. Message. History.

01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:15.660
In. Memory. Chat. History. As. Chat.

01:37:37.620 --> 01:37:44.960
Then. Call. The. Tools. Lang. Chain. Core. Dot. Tools.

01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:00.240
Memory. So. From. Lang. Chain.

01:38:03.630 --> 01:38:09.770
Dot. Memory. So. We. Have. To. Import. A. Multiple. Memory.

01:38:09.970 --> 01:38:10.210
Unit.

01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:20.040
So. These. Are. The. Import. Guys. Some. Of. The. Import.

01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:23.040
We. Are. Going. To. Use. It. Almost. All. The. Imports. We.

01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:25.080
Are. Going. To. Use. It. Not. Some. I. Would. Say. So. In.

01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:27.160
This. Example. Itself. So. Here. I. Have. Bring. You. The.

01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:29.840
Entire. Imports. So. These. Are. The. Import. Which. Is.

01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:32.220
Required. You. Have. My. U. D. A. P. I. Key. As. Well.

01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:35.760
Inside. Your. System. So. You. Can. Use. Mine. Listen.

01:38:35.860 --> 01:38:38.380
Until. I'm. Not. Deactivating. It. By. The. Way. So. Yeah.

01:38:38.420 --> 01:38:41.280
These. Are. The. Imports. That. We. All. Have. To. Do. Now.

01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:45.160
Once. This. Import. Is. Done. Then. We. Can. Start. Writing.

01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:49.020
A. Code. Now. Before. That. Let. Give. You. A. Brief. Idea.

01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:52.340
About. The. Imports. So. Here. I'm. Just. Importing. A.

01:38:52.340 --> 01:38:55.340
Basic. Libraries. Here. I'm. Importing. A. Yuri. A. By. The.

01:38:55.340 --> 01:38:58.580
Way. Yeah. Now. Here. So. Obviously. I. To. Create. The.

01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:02.240
Agents. Right. So. Agents. Are. Nothing. But. A. Kind. Of.

01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:05.860
Capabilities. Or. You. Say. A. Calling. A. Function. Or.

01:39:05.980 --> 01:39:09.480
Tools. With. Help. With. Some. LLM. Capabilities. So. We.

01:39:09.540 --> 01:39:11.540
Can. Try. To. Create. A. Different. Different. Kind. Of.

01:39:11.780 --> 01:39:14.740
Agents. So. Today. Try. To. Create. A. Reactive. Agent. By.

01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:16.600
The. Way. And. We. Will. See. How. We. Can. Try. To.

01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:19.720
Execute. It. Keeping. That. In. A. Mind. This. Is. Import.

01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:22.800
Is. Been. Done. Now. Prompt. So. Obviously. We. Are. Going.

01:39:22.860 --> 01:39:26.280
To. A. Prompt. To. The. LLM. So. We. Have. To. Create. A.

01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:28.940
Prompt. By. The. Way. So. To. Do. That. We. Are. Using.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:32.000
This. Library. Output. Parser. So. Whatever. Output. System.

01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:33.900
Is. Going. To. Give. Me. Or. This. Lantern. System. Or.

01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:35.940
Agent. Is. Going. To. Give. Me. I. To. Pass. That. Output.

01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:38.120
So. That's. The. Reason. So. I'm. Using. This. Output.

01:39:38.420 --> 01:39:41.560
Parser. Library. Runable. So. I. Have. To. Run. All. The.

01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:44.060
Like. Agents. With. Some. Of. The. Components. I'm.

01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:46.940
Importing. This. Component. Chat. History. So. Obviously. I.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.480
Have. To. Deal. With. The. History. Like. Whatever. Like.

01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:51.340
Which. Is. Available. Inside. The. Memory. So. I'm. Using.

01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:54.460
That. Now. Here. So. I. Have. To. Make. Some. Sort. Of.

01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:56.500
Tools. Tools. Is. Nothing. But. A. Function. Right. I.

01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:57.600
Create. Some. Memory.

01:40:14.780 --> 01:40:17.160
Now. Where. It. Will. Be. Able. To. Memorize. All. The.

01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:19.900
Previous. Conversation. Which. Is. Going. To. Expensive.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.600
Obviously. Then. You. Can. Try. To. Create. A. Memory. So.

01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:25.320
Which. Will. Be. Able. To. Like. Retain. Just. A. Summary.

01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:27.740
Of. The. Everything. So. In. That. Case. It's. Not. Going.

01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:29.760
To. Be. Too. Expensive. Then. You.

01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:47.420
Can. Try. To. Create. Memory. In. Our. Agents. Basically.

01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:50.720
So. That. It. Will. Be. Able. To. Give. A. Response. A.

01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:53.420
Next. Response. By. Keeping. A. Previous. Response. In. A.

01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:56.580
Mind. But. Use. Case. Basis. So. This. Something. That.

01:40:56.820 --> 01:40:58.220
Going. To. Do. So. That's. The. Reason. I. Have. Done. The.

01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:01.000
Import. Of. Multiple. Memories. But. As. I'm. Going. To.

01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:03.060
Use. It. I'll. Talking. About. That. What. Is. The. Meaning.

01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:05.180
Of. This. Bindoing. Memory. What. Is. The. Meaning. Of.

01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:09.060
This. Buffer. Memory. What. Is. Of.

01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:14.300
This.

01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:24.320
Summary. Memory. Using. So. Buffer. Memory. Buffer. Memory.

01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:27.600
Means. Full. Memory. By. The. Way. Yeah. If. I'll. Talk.

01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:31.000
About. Conversation. Buffer. Window. Memory. Window. Memory.

01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:33.820
Means. Couple. Of. Lines. So. I. Can. I. Set. Those. Lines.

01:41:33.860 --> 01:41:35.880
Like. Okay. Fine. Just. Remember. Last. Three. Output.

01:41:36.140 --> 01:41:38.320
Right. So. It. Be. Able. To. Remember. Only. Last. Three.

01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:39.620
Output. Conversational.

01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:56.200
Summary. Memory. As. Well.

01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:03.760
Conversation. Entity. Memory. Yeah. This. Another. Kind. Of.

01:42:03.820 --> 01:42:05.540
A. Memory. You. Will. Be. Able. To. Find. Out. So. Where.

01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:07.740
It. Will. Be. Able. To. Understand. And. Remember. About.

01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:10.640
The. Place. And. The. Person. A. Particular. Entity. Right.

01:42:10.660 --> 01:42:12.880
This. Is. Again. A. Kind. Of. A. Memory. You. Will. Be.

01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:14.340
Able. To. Find. Out. So.

01:42:24.140 --> 01:42:24.320
There.

01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:32.120
Are. Different. Different. Kind. Of. Memories. You. Will.

01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:34.740
Be. Able. To. Find. Out. And. Efficiently. Based. On. The.

01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:36.800
Use. Cases. That. We. Are. Trying. To. Build. Based. On.

01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:39.220
The. Agents. That. We. Try. To. Build. So. We. Try. To.

01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:41.580
Give. A. Different. Different. Kind. Of. A. Memory. Unit.

01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:45.020
To. A. Different. Different. Agent. So. That. It. Will. Be.

01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:47.780
Able. To. Remember. For. Example. If. You. Chatting. With.

01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:51.080
A. Chat. Gpt. Right. You. Can. Go. Into. A. Setting. And.

01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:51.500
You. Can. Try. To.

01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:55.820
Check. That.

01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:10.660
What. Chat. Gpt. System. To. Make. A. Better. Decision. To.

01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:12.760
Give. You. The. Smoothest. Outcome. Because. It.

01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:15.440
Understands. You. It. Remembers. Your. Previous.

01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:18.600
Conversation. So. Memory. Plays. A. Vital. Role. All. The.

01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:21.060
Time. Right. Memory. Plays. A. Vital. Role. And. These.

01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:23.980
Components. Are. Already. Given. To. You. Inside. A. Lang.

01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:27.320
Chain. By. The. Way. So. Let. Me. Execute. And. Let. Me.

01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:30.260
Test. It. Import. Structure. Output. Parser. From. Lang.

01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:32.560
Chain. Output. Parser. Okay. So. Let. Me. Remove. That.

01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:36.220
Part. Structure. Output. Parser. Maybe. If. I'll. Need. It.

01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:39.860
I'll. Resolve. It. Execute. Once. Again. Can. Import. The.

01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:46.320
Response. Schema. Okay. Remove. That. As. Well. Now. Chat.

01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:47.300
Message. History.

01:43:52.620 --> 01:43:54.680
Can. Import. Shared. Memory.

01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:00.960
Let. Me. Remove. For. Now. All. These. Three. Things. I'll.

01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:06.480
Resolve. It. In. A. Later. Stage. Okay. So. My. Import. Is.

01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:09.140
Having. No. Issue. By. The. Way. Yeah. So. My. Import. Is.

01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:11.380
Working. Well. And. Good. Now. I'm. Pinging. You. The.

01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:13.580
Final. Import. So. This. Is. The. Final. Import. Which. I.

01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:17.060
Have. Done. Just. Removed. All. These. Things. Which. Maybe.

01:44:17.220 --> 01:44:19.180
I. Have. Just. Done. The. Import. But. Because. Of. Some.

01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:21.480
Compatibility. It's. Not. Available. But. That's. Okay.

01:44:21.580 --> 01:44:25.640
Yeah. That. That's. Completely. Fine. With. Me. Okay. So.

01:44:25.700 --> 01:44:29.820
Now. Before. That. Right. Before. That. So. This. Something.

01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:31.840
Which. I. Have. Done. As. An. Import. But. Maybe. In. Your.

01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:35.240
System. It. Will. Not. Work. Because. Maybe. Lang. Chain.

01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:39.140
Is. Not. Available. So. Here. Is. Advice. To. All. Of. You.

01:44:39.580 --> 01:44:42.100
That. First. Of. All. Try. To. Do. This. Installation. Pip.

01:44:46.860 --> 01:44:49.760
Lang. Chain. Open. AI. Is. Not. Required. Without. Even.

01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:51.740
Using. This. Lang. Chain. Open. AI. You. All. Will. Be.

01:44:51.820 --> 01:44:54.500
Able. To. Do. It. So. Just. Do. This. Installation. Guys.

Now. Let. Me. Ping. You. Once. Again. So. After. Doing.

01:45:15.530 --> 01:45:17.230
Installation. If. These. Imports. Are. Working. Then. We.

01:45:17.250 --> 01:45:19.850
Are. Good. To. Go. Ahead. With. The. Creation. Of. The.

01:45:19.950 --> 01:45:20.230
Agents.

01:45:29.540 --> 01:45:32.000
Done. Anyone. With. The. Testing.

01:45:36.100 --> 01:45:38.540
Yes. Okay. Do. The. Installation. Guys. I. Have. Already.

01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:40.820
Pinned. The. Installation. Command. So. You. To. Install.

01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:43.060
Like. A. Things. One. Is. Lank. Chain. One. Is. Lank. Chain.

01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:45.800
Core. One. Is. Lank. Chain. Community. One. Is. A. Lank.

01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:46.080
Chain. Open.

01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:23.980
AI. Memory. Three. Or. Four. Components. Of. The. Memory.

01:46:24.060 --> 01:46:26.580
For. This. Example. And. Then. Maybe. In. A. Future. I.

01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:28.680
Will. Using. Other. Memory. Part. As. Well. But. Yeah. So.

01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:30.560
Three. Four. Anyhow. I. Be. Using. It.

01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:36.860
Done. No. Issue. Okay. So. Yeah. Most. Of. You. Are.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:40.580
Getting. Any. Kind. Of. Issues. That's. Cool. So. Once.

01:46:40.580 --> 01:46:44.300
This. Is. Done. Then. What. Is. Next. Guys. So. Then. We.

01:46:44.340 --> 01:46:48.000
Have. To. Basically. Create. A. L. L. M. Because. L. L. M.

01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:49.400
Is. A. Core. Component. Right.

01:47:03.620 --> 01:47:07.760
L. Go. To. The. Framework. And. Then. Copy. It. So. This.

01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:10.540
Is. Basically. The. L. L. M. Right. This. Is. Basically.

01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:11.800
The. L. L. M. Over. Here.

01:47:28.260 --> 01:47:31.320
So. Always. Dot. Get. Environment. UDAPI. Key. So.

01:47:31.460 --> 01:47:34.040
Basically. I'm. Providing. The. UDAPI. Key. In. This.

01:47:34.060 --> 01:47:37.020
Particular. Place. Right. As. An. API. Key. And. Maybe.

01:47:37.340 --> 01:47:40.360
Instead. Of. Chat. Model. I. Can. Rename. It. As. A. L. M.

01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:46.940
Underscore. Default. So. Again. Create. Chat. Model. I.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.660
Have. Done. The. Import. Right. From. The. UDAPI. So.

01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:51.620
Create. Chat. Model. That. Was. A. First. Import. So. This.

01:47:51.780 --> 01:47:54.420
Is. Going. To. Be. My. L. L. M. Provider. Which. L. M. I'm.

01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:57.100
Using. So. I'm. Using. 4.1. Nano. Maybe. I.

01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:17.480
Play. My. L. L. M. Simple. So. L. L. M. Creation. Is. Done.

01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:20.160
Yeah. L. L. M. Creation. Is. Done. Over. Here.

01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:25.540
Fine. Okay. So. Just. Do. This.

01:48:42.260 --> 01:48:47.740
L. Now. What. We. Are. Going. To. Do. What. Should. Be. Our.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.280
Next. Step. Let's. Try. To. Understand. That. Particular.

01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:54.820
Part. Yeah. So. What. Kind. Of. Agents. We. Are. Going. To.

01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:58.300
Create. By. The. Way. For. This. Particular. Example. Let.

01:48:58.380 --> 01:49:00.800
Me. Explain. You. That. One. So. See.

01:49:03.780 --> 01:49:07.320
What. We. Are. Going. To. Do. Over. Here. We. Are. Going.

01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:11.300
To. Create. A. Multiple. Agents. So. Let's. Suppose. I'm.

01:49:11.380 --> 01:49:12.060
Going. To. Create.

01:49:15.010 --> 01:49:19.510
Agent. One. Then. I'm. Going. To. Create. Agent. Number.

01:49:23.910 --> 01:49:27.570
Three. Yes. Now. Let's. Suppose. My. Agent. Number. One.

01:49:28.150 --> 01:49:30.850
Right. My. Agent. Number. One. Can. Do. Some. Sort. Of. A.

01:49:31.270 --> 01:49:31.470
Calculation.

01:49:34.510 --> 01:49:36.930
Yeah. Can. Do. Some. Sort. Of. A. Calculation. My. Agent.

01:49:36.990 --> 01:49:39.850
Number. One. Means. Technically. A. Function. Right. So.

01:49:40.090 --> 01:49:42.010
Technically. A. Function. I'm. Going. To. Write. So. Which.

01:49:42.050 --> 01:49:44.870
Will. Be. Able. To. Do. Any. Kind. Of. A. Calculation. Now.

01:49:45.110 --> 01:49:47.910
Agent. Number. Two. I'm. Going. To. Create. Which. Will. Be.

01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:51.510
Able. To. Do. Maybe. A. Knowledge. Base. Knowledge. Base.

01:49:53.390 --> 01:49:55.730
Search. Operation. Means. Let's. Suppose. I'm. Going. To.

01:49:55.770 --> 01:49:58.990
Provide. Some. Sort. Of. A. Document. To. It. And. This.

01:49:59.570 --> 01:50:01.550
Agent. Means. This. Particular. Function. Technically.

01:50:01.790 --> 01:50:04.450
Agents. Are. Nothing. But. A. Function. Right. So. What.

01:50:04.470 --> 01:50:06.450
This. Function. Will. Do. So. This. Function. Will. Try. To.

01:50:06.590 --> 01:50:09.270
Search. From. The. Knowledge. Base. Maybe. I'm. Going. To.

01:50:09.330 --> 01:50:11.750
Provide. A. Document. One. Two. Ten. Or. Maybe. Hundred.

01:50:12.510 --> 01:50:15.030
Maybe. I. Can. Attach. This. Knowledge. Base. With. Respect.

01:50:15.110 --> 01:50:17.090
To. The. Rag. Or. Maybe. Some. Sort. Of. A. Vector.

01:50:17.430 --> 01:50:20.350
Databases. Yeah. And. This. Is. Going. To. Do. Agent.

01:50:20.510 --> 01:50:22.850
Number. Two. Is. Going. To. Do. Only. One. Specific. Task.

01:50:23.090 --> 01:50:25.750
It. Is. Good. With. Searching. Some. Of. The. Document.

01:50:25.950 --> 01:50:29.670
Okay. That's. Cool. Now. Agent. Number. Three. So.

01:50:29.850 --> 01:50:32.430
Basically. It. Is. Good. With. Interacting. With. The.

01:50:32.770 --> 01:50:35.810
Sequel. System. So. Maybe. I. Can. Write. Something. And.

01:50:36.030 --> 01:50:38.770
Then. You. Know. It. Will. Go. To. A. Sequel. Databases.

01:50:38.870 --> 01:50:41.970
And. If. That. Data. Set. Is. Available. Inside. A. Sequel.

01:50:42.370 --> 01:50:44.770
Databases. It. Will. Try. To. Fetch. Those. Data. And. Then.

01:50:44.910 --> 01:50:47.870
It. Will. Try. To. Show. You. Output. So. Again. This. Is.

01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:50.770
My. Another. Function. So. Technically. I. Will. End. Up.

01:50:50.770 --> 01:50:53.230
Creating. Three. Different. Different. Independent.

01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:56.190
Function. Completely. Independent. There. Is. No. Relation.

01:50:56.370 --> 01:50:59.730
Right. My. Agent. One. Is. Separate. My. Agent. Two. Is.

01:50:59.810 --> 01:51:02.650
Separate. My. Agent. Three. Is. Separate. Yes. It's.

01:51:02.950 --> 01:51:04.990
Completely. Independent. Worker. You. Can. Say. Or.

01:51:05.230 --> 01:51:08.830
Independent. Employee. So. One. Employee. Is. Doing.

01:51:09.270 --> 01:51:11.250
Independently. Like. A. Calculation. Kind. Of. A. Task. One.

01:51:11.550 --> 01:51:13.350
Employee. Is. Doing. Maybe. A. Knowledge. Based. Search.

01:51:13.430 --> 01:51:16.930
Kind. Of. A. Search. And. One. Employee. Is. Like. You.

01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:21.430
Know. Doing. A. Sequel. System. Kind. Of. A. Search. All.

01:51:21.550 --> 01:51:23.050
These. Three. Agents. This. Is. Something. That. We. Are.

01:51:23.110 --> 01:51:26.010
Going. To. Create. Now. What. I. Will. Do. A. Simple.

01:51:26.230 --> 01:51:28.490
Function. Like. I. Said. I. Going. To. Create. It. Now.

01:51:28.610 --> 01:51:31.710
What. I. Will. Do. So. With. The. Help. Of. Lang. Chain.

01:51:32.050 --> 01:51:35.430
Right. With. Help. Of. Lang. Chain. I. Will. Convert. This.

01:51:35.850 --> 01:51:38.350
Function. The. Independent. Function. Which. I. Talking.

01:51:38.410 --> 01:51:42.090
About. Into. Tools. So. Just. With. The. Help. Of.

01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:45.270
Decorator. Let's. Suppose. So. Decorator. I. Think. We. All.

01:51:45.350 --> 01:51:48.030
Understand. A. Concept. Of. Decorator. From. A. Python.

01:51:48.130 --> 01:51:50.270
Because. It's. A. Python. Concept. Right. And. In. Any.

01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:52.030
Programming. Language. You. Will. Be. Able. To. Find. Out.

01:51:52.190 --> 01:51:54.690
So. Decorator. Is. Nothing. But. Adding. Additional.

01:51:55.030 --> 01:51:58.210
Capabilities. Right. Additional. Capabilities. So. Just.

01:51:58.230 --> 01:52:00.750
With. The. Help. Of. This. Decorator. What. Will. Happen.

01:52:00.970 --> 01:52:03.930
The. Normal. Function. Just. A. Normal. Function. That.

01:52:04.110 --> 01:52:06.030
Have. Written. For. Calculation. For. Knowledge. Based.

01:52:06.110 --> 01:52:08.330
Search. On. Me. For. A. Searching. Something. From. The.

01:52:08.350 --> 01:52:11.250
SQL. System. So. Just. With. Help. Of. This. Decoration.

01:52:11.790 --> 01:52:15.610
This. Will. Get. Converted. Into. Tools. So. Technically.

01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:21.370
My. Tool. Is. Equal. Equal. To. Function. Right. How. I.

01:52:21.430 --> 01:52:23.570
Can. Convert. It. So. With. The. Help. Of. Lang. Chain. I.

01:52:23.750 --> 01:52:24.470
Already. Done. The. Import.

01:52:27.670 --> 01:52:27.870
Of.

01:52:31.250 --> 01:52:34.550
Like. Tools. Right. So. Tools. So. Basically. I. Will. Try.

01:52:34.650 --> 01:52:38.210
To. You. Know. Convert. This. Function. Into. A. Tool.

01:52:38.810 --> 01:52:40.570
Right. And. This. Is. The. Meaning. Of. A. Tool. So. Tool.

01:52:40.570 --> 01:52:43.410
Is. Nothing. Like. Something. Fancy. It's. Basically. A.

01:52:43.590 --> 01:52:45.650
Function. And. With. The. Help. Of. These. Libraries. I.

01:52:45.650 --> 01:52:48.630
Will. Try. To. Convert. Those. Into. A. Tool. Over. There.

01:52:49.050 --> 01:52:52.070
That's. A. Part. Number. Two. By. The. Way. So. First.

01:52:52.430 --> 01:52:57.570
Create. The. Independent. Agent. Then. Convert. Those. Like.

01:52:57.730 --> 01:53:00.070
A. Agent. Means. Function. So. Write. The. Independent.

01:53:00.390 --> 01:53:03.010
Function. And. Then. After. Writing. This. Independent.

01:53:03.390 --> 01:53:06.590
Function. So. Convert. Those. Function. Into. A. Tools. By.

01:53:06.610 --> 01:53:09.350
The. Way. One. Function. Will. Be. Doing. One. Thing. Other.

01:53:09.510 --> 01:53:11.350
Function. Will. Be. Doing. Other. Things. By. The. Way.

01:53:11.430 --> 01:53:17.630
Write. And. Then. Do. One. Thing. That. That. Try. To.

01:53:18.110 --> 01:53:23.070
Maybe. Combine. All. Of. This. Agent. Right. Combined. All.

01:53:23.210 --> 01:53:26.910
Of. This. Three. Agent. Via. One. Single. Input. Point.

01:53:27.070 --> 01:53:31.570
Right. One. Single. Input. Point. So. Here. What. Will. Do.

01:53:31.590 --> 01:53:33.950
So. Let's. Suppose. If. I'm. Able. To. Create. All. Of.

01:53:34.010 --> 01:53:37.370
These. Like. Three. Agents. Right. If. I'm. Able. To. Like.

01:53:37.610 --> 01:53:40.110
Create. This. Three. Agent. So. What. Will. Do. I'll. Just.

01:53:40.150 --> 01:53:43.170
Try. To. Create. Some. Sort. Of. Final. Executor. Or. You.

01:53:43.250 --> 01:53:47.130
Can. Say. Orchestrator. I'm. Going. To. Create. Which. Will.

01:53:47.950 --> 01:53:53.630
Right. So. Which. Will. Be. Having. An. Access. Of. All.

01:53:53.710 --> 01:53:59.330
Three. All. Three. Means. Agent. Number. One.

01:54:02.670 --> 01:54:03.590
Agent. Number. Two.

01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:10.180
Agent. Number. Three. This. A. Box. Right. Big. Box. Let's.

01:54:10.200 --> 01:54:12.720
Suppose. And. Inside. This. Big. Box. All. My. Functions.

01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:13.300
Are. Available.

01:54:26.780 --> 01:54:30.040
Calculation. This. Is. Having. What. So. This. Is. Having.

01:54:30.140 --> 01:54:35.180
Basically. A. LLM. Access. As. Of. Now. Yeah. So. This. Is.

01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:38.900
Having. LLM. Access. And. Then. Based. On. This. It. Will.

01:54:39.100 --> 01:54:41.260
Be. Able. To. Give. Me. Some. Output.

01:54:44.270 --> 01:54:47.350
Output. So. What. Will. Happen. Over. Here. So. Whenever.

01:54:47.610 --> 01:54:51.990
User. Will. Come. And. User. Will. Try. To. You.

01:55:01.890 --> 01:55:03.790
Know. Send. Some.

01:55:10.730 --> 01:55:19.850
Info. About. Sudh. From. Db. Right. So. This. Is. You.

01:55:20.310 --> 01:55:22.650
Basically. This. A. Client. Right. You. Are. Trying. To.

01:55:22.690 --> 01:55:26.170
Interact. With. My. System. So. This. Is. A. Box. Inside.

01:55:26.430 --> 01:55:28.770
This. Box. I. Have. A. Multiple. Functions. Or. You. Can.

01:55:28.810 --> 01:55:30.890
Say. Agents. Which. Is. Already. Available. So.

01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:33.970
Automatically. Based. On. The. Input. Which. You. Have.

01:55:34.050 --> 01:55:37.810
Given. Maybe. As. A. NLP. Natural. Language. Right. In. Any.

01:55:37.850 --> 01:55:40.790
Program. Any. Any. Languages. By. The. Way. It. Will. Go.

01:55:40.890 --> 01:55:43.750
Inside. This. Box. Automatically. It. Will. Be. Able. To.

01:55:43.930 --> 01:55:46.970
Decide. That. Okay. I. Use. Agent. Number. One. Two. Or.

01:55:47.090 --> 01:55:49.850
Three. Or. Maybe. I. Should. Like. A. Fallback. For. The.

01:55:50.050 --> 01:55:52.950
Default. Basically. I. Can. Directly. Use. The. LMS. I.

01:55:52.990 --> 01:55:55.830
Should. Not. Use. Any. These. Agents. Maybe. LMS. Will.

01:55:56.050 --> 01:55:58.970
Able. To. Handle. It. Directly. Right. So. It. Will. Be.

01:55:59.050 --> 01:56:01.630
Able. To. Decide. So. In. This. Case. Obviously. Agent.

01:56:01.630 --> 01:56:04.150
Three. Will. Activated. Ideally. Because. I'm. Looking. For.

01:56:04.230 --> 01:56:06.730
Some. Sort. Of. A. Data. From. The. Databases. So. It. Is.

01:56:06.750 --> 01:56:09.330
Going. To. Use. This. Function. Right. It. Is. Going. To.

01:56:09.770 --> 01:56:11.990
Fetch. Those. Data. Maybe. It. Is. Going. To. Pass. It.

01:56:12.030 --> 01:56:14.090
With. The. Help. Of. LMS. And. Then. Finally. You. Will. Be.

01:56:14.210 --> 01:56:16.630
Able. To. See. The. Output. Let's.

01:56:31.690 --> 01:56:37.930
Suppose. If. It. Able. Maybe. Like. LMS. Itself. Will. Try.

01:56:37.970 --> 01:56:40.450
To. Take. Over. Right. Or. Maybe. One.

01:56:44.150 --> 01:56:46.910
Divided. By. Two. It. Will. Try. To. Go. And. Check. That.

01:56:46.910 --> 01:56:49.970
Okay. Which. Agent. Is. Going. To. Help. Me. Out. Right. If.

01:56:50.050 --> 01:56:51.930
This. Is. Going. To. Agent. Number. One. Which. Is. A.

01:56:52.190 --> 01:56:53.650
Calculation. Isn't. Right. If. This. Is. Going. To. Help.

01:56:53.770 --> 01:56:56.730
Me. Out. It's. Well. And. Good. If. LLM. Can. Respond.

01:56:57.010 --> 01:56:59.230
Directly. So. Maybe. I'll. Be. Able. To. Get. The. Response.

01:56:59.710 --> 01:57:02.850
Directly. From. LMS. So. This. Is. How. This. Entire. Agent.

01:57:02.890 --> 01:57:05.590
Tick. System. Is. Going. To. Work. So. Technically. I. Have.

01:57:05.710 --> 01:57:08.250
To. Create. Three. Functions. With. Help. Of. Lang. Chain.

01:57:08.350 --> 01:57:10.710
I. Have. To. Convert. That. Into. Our. Tools. Even. It's.

01:57:10.770 --> 01:57:12.950
Called. As. Tool. By. The. Way. Yeah. Just. A. Name. A.

01:57:12.970 --> 01:57:15.610
Tool. Technically. It's. A. Function. Then. I. To. Connect.

01:57:16.190 --> 01:57:18.190
Means. I. Have. To. Keep. Everything. Into. One. Single.

01:57:18.370 --> 01:57:21.830
Box. Means. I. To. Do. The. Orchestration. Over. Here. I.

01:57:21.870 --> 01:57:24.590
Have. To. Connect. Keep. It. Then. My. L. L. M. Is. Already.

01:57:24.690 --> 01:57:27.950
Available. Right. So. To. Define. My. Output. Like. A. Type.

01:57:28.170 --> 01:57:31.070
By. The. Way. I. To. Define. My. Output. Type. And. My.

01:57:31.110 --> 01:57:33.270
Work. Will. Be. Done. Yes.

01:57:37.940 --> 01:57:40.080
Yeah. Making. Sense. Guys. What. What. Are. Going. To.

01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:43.440
Build. By. The. Way. Yeah. So. Likewise. So. If. I. Am.

01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:45.620
Able. To. Create. This. Three. Different. Kind. Of. An.

01:57:45.620 --> 01:57:48.740
Agent. Right. Now. If. Someone. Is. Asking. Me. That. Okay.

01:57:49.340 --> 01:57:51.920
I. Have. To. Add. Maybe. One. Agent. Which. Can. Send. A.

01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:55.120
WhatsApp. Messages. Okay. I. Can. Do. It. Telegram.

01:57:55.320 --> 01:57:57.840
Messages. Okay. I. Can. Do. It. Let's. Suppose. If. I. Have.

01:57:57.960 --> 01:58:00.380
Send. A. Mail. I. Believe. We. Have. Already. Discussed.

01:58:00.380 --> 01:58:03.980
About. A. Mail. Right. In. My. Medi. Chatbot. Pro. Itself.

01:58:04.420 --> 01:58:06.740
Yeah. So. How. Will. Be. Able. To. Configure. The. Mail.

01:58:08.220 --> 01:58:12.220
Yes. So. In. Medi. Chatbot. Pro. If. You. Remember. We.

01:58:12.260 --> 01:58:14.800
Were. Struggling. We. Were. Struggling. With. With. Respect.

01:58:14.900 --> 01:58:17.180
To. That. Decision. Making. So. We. Have. To. Go. On. A.

01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:20.320
Left. Hand. Side. We. Have. To. Enter. The. Email. Id. And.

01:58:20.380 --> 01:58:23.140
Then. It. Was. Sending. A. Mail. To. That. In. Email. Id.

01:58:23.320 --> 01:58:25.620
Itself. Based. On. The. Nlp. It. Was. Not. Able. To.

01:58:25.820 --> 01:58:27.660
Understand. Because. We. Have. Not. Attached. Any. Kind. Of.

01:58:27.720 --> 01:58:30.560
Agent. And. Was. Difficult. To. Pass. Right. A. Custom.

01:58:30.740 --> 01:58:34.760
Mail. Id. Each. And. Every. Time. But. In. The. Same. Chat.

01:58:34.840 --> 01:58:37.720
Bot. If. You. Can. Attach. An. Agent. Which. Can.

01:58:37.840 --> 01:58:39.700
Understand. Basically. Which. Is. Just. Responsible. For.

01:58:39.740 --> 01:58:42.400
Sending. A. Mail. So. Every. Time. Whenever. You. Are.

01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:45.080
Going. To. Query. It. Will. Try. To. Invoke. That. Agent.

01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:47.280
Automatically. Call. That. Agent. Automatically. A. Mail.

01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:50.280
Sending. Agent. It. Pass. Your. Mail. Id. From. Your. Like.

01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:53.320
A. Natural. Language. Input. That. You. Are. Giving. It.

01:58:53.400 --> 01:58:55.940
Will. Start. Sending. A. Mail. Right. Maybe. It. Will.

01:58:56.400 --> 01:58:58.780
Replying. To. The. WhatsApp. Messages. So. Basically. This.

01:58:59.260 --> 01:59:02.220
Entire. Orchestration. The. Box. Which. I. Am. Talking.

01:59:02.300 --> 01:59:05.620
About. Right. So. This. Is. Going. To. Take. A. Decision.

01:59:06.100 --> 01:59:09.360
Automatically. Out. Of. Hundreds. Of. Agent. Means. Out. Of.

01:59:09.400 --> 01:59:12.420
Hundreds. Of. Tools. Which. Is. Available. To. Me. Which.

01:59:12.520 --> 01:59:16.660
One. I. Am. Supposed. To. Use. Yes.

01:59:19.990 --> 01:59:24.770
Yeah. Everyone. Making. Sense. Theoretically. Yeah.

01:59:28.900 --> 01:59:31.940
So. This. Is. This. Is. Something. That. We. Are. Going. To.

01:59:32.420 --> 01:59:35.000
Create. It. Right. I. Think. It's. A. Time. Now. 11. O

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:38.380
'clock. So. Tomorrow. We. Will. Try. To. Start. From. The.

01:59:38.500 --> 01:59:41.520
Same. Place. So. Till. L. L. M. We. Are. Able. To. Invoke.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.220
Import. Everything. Is. Done. System. Setup. And.

01:59:44.280 --> 01:59:46.780
Everything. Is. Done. So. Back. To. What. We. Will. Do. So.

01:59:46.880 --> 01:59:49.120
We. Will. Try. To. Create. This. Three. Functions. Will.

01:59:49.220 --> 01:59:52.060
Try. To. Convert. This. Into. Tools. Then. We. Will.

01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:55.260
Connect. Each. Other. Again. Just. With. The. Line. Of. A.

01:59:55.320 --> 01:59:58.640
Code. Then. We. Will. Try. To. Provide. A. Memory. So. We.

01:59:58.660 --> 02:00:01.500
Will. Try. To. Provide. A. Calc. To. This. Function.

02:00:01.840 --> 02:00:03.360
Calculation. Will. Try. To. Provide. One. Kind. Of. A.

02:00:03.420 --> 02:00:05.480
Memory. For. KB. Search. Will. Try. To. Provide. Another.

02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:07.400
Kind. Of. A. Memory. And. Then.

02:00:17.340 --> 02:00:21.720
For. A. Sequel. Try. To.

02:00:31.780 --> 02:00:32.100
Provide. Some.

02:00:41.260 --> 02:00:55.900
Memory. For. A. A. Memory. So. We. Will. Try. Some. For. A.

02:00:55.900 --> 02:01:03.360
Function. For. Memory. For. A. Function. Of. A. Of. of a

02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:08.670
memory for a different function and I created how to agent

02:01:08.670 --> 02:01:11.290
will choose which one is best according to which condition.

02:01:11.450 --> 02:01:14.570
So see, uh, basically whenever I'm talking about this agent

02:01:14.570 --> 02:01:18.690
creation, right, our function basically a tool creation. So

02:01:18.690 --> 02:01:22.810
with every tool we try to attach a prompt that, okay, so you

02:01:22.810 --> 02:01:25.950
are this tool, you can do this, you can do that. So the

02:01:25.950 --> 02:01:29.410
detailed prompt, so as I will be able to create this tool

02:01:29.410 --> 02:01:32.210
and as I will be able to provide the detail of prompt to

02:01:32.210 --> 02:01:35.490
this one in this way, it will be able to understand that,

02:01:35.530 --> 02:01:38.510
okay, fine. So which tool is like, uh, you know, uh, can do

02:01:38.510 --> 02:01:41.090
this work or that work. You will, you will be able to

02:01:41.090 --> 02:01:43.370
understand that how it is going to select, but yeah,

02:01:43.450 --> 02:01:47.010
technically it's a prompt. It's like a NLP natural language

02:01:47.010 --> 02:01:49.570
in which we try to say that, okay, you are the system and

02:01:49.570 --> 02:01:52.230
then you, you are responsible for doing this, doing that. So

02:01:52.230 --> 02:01:54.550
whenever you will receive this kind of a query, always try

02:01:54.550 --> 02:01:59.230
to use me something like this. So, uh, LLM will try to

02:01:59.230 --> 02:02:01.350
inference it. And then it will be able to use that

02:02:01.350 --> 02:02:02.270
particular tool.

02:02:05.900 --> 02:02:09.700
Okay. So that's it guys. That's all about my today's class.

02:02:09.900 --> 02:02:12.720
Uh, like I said, so we are going to start from the same

02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:15.980
point, right? And back to back, I think agenda is pretty

02:02:15.980 --> 02:02:18.060
much clear. So I'll try to create this three agents,

02:02:18.220 --> 02:02:23.820
configure it, test it, tested with the memory and then try

02:02:23.820 --> 02:02:27.920
to, if, if time allows tomorrow, right, then try to use a

02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:32.420
lang serve and then try to expose it to the outer world. As

02:02:32.420 --> 02:02:37.200
an API so that anyone can consume it, uh, just by calling my

02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:40.040
APIs, everyone will be having an access of mine, not just

02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:43.560
one agent, multiple agent, and I can keep on adding those

02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:47.580
agents back to back. That is something if time allows, I

02:02:47.580 --> 02:02:50.360
don't, I don't think that like, uh, uh, we'll be having time

02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:54.620
to take a talk about a lang serve. I've already, uh, created

02:02:54.620 --> 02:02:58.460
all of those demos. So in my system, uh, everything is

02:02:58.460 --> 02:03:01.580
working up and running if I have to show you, so I've

02:03:01.580 --> 02:03:03.920
already created the application with respect to the lang

02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:09.600
serve and, uh, yeah. So which is, uh, like, uh, working, uh,

02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:13.760
basically yesterday night I was like trying to test it. Uh,

02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:17.420
but yeah, so all depends upon the time that we'll be having

02:03:17.420 --> 02:03:19.920
tomorrow, if not tomorrow, the next week, obviously we'll,

02:03:19.940 --> 02:03:23.620
we'll be talking about it. Yeah. So we'll try to, in this

02:03:23.620 --> 02:03:25.860
way, we'll try to bring all of this like agents to the

02:03:25.860 --> 02:03:28.740
production system basically with the help of lang serve and

02:03:28.740 --> 02:03:31.060
then when I'll talk about a lang graph, then I will be

02:03:31.060 --> 02:03:34.120
talking about it. I'll be talking about a lang smith, a lang

02:03:34.120 --> 02:03:39.600
studio, which one we can use instead of UDAPI key. You can

02:03:39.600 --> 02:03:41.980
use Gemini, you can use open AI, whatever you want, just go

02:03:41.980 --> 02:03:44.740
ahead and use it. Yeah. At the end of the day, I just need

02:03:44.740 --> 02:03:48.980
the access of LLMs, nothing much, hope all of you are able

02:03:48.980 --> 02:03:53.240
to understand. Yes. Yeah. Everyone.

02:03:59.100 --> 02:04:02.620
Should we always use our own environment, deploy LLMs for

02:04:02.620 --> 02:04:05.960
our agent, security will not be concerned. Yeah. Basically.

02:04:07.560 --> 02:04:11.680
Yeah. You can always use as like a, you know, less open

02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:12.560
system as possible.

02:04:18.230 --> 02:04:20.290
What is the difference between Lanchen syntaxes and UDAPI?

02:04:22.070 --> 02:04:25.050
So basically there is like a different two different system,

02:04:25.170 --> 02:04:27.350
right? So basically with the help of Lanchen, you have to

02:04:27.350 --> 02:04:29.590
integrate open AI. So obviously you have to go to open AI,

02:04:29.630 --> 02:04:32.890
create account, take the API key and then use it. In case of

02:04:32.890 --> 02:04:37.190
UDAPI, all of you have access and that too, the limit is too

02:04:37.190 --> 02:04:38.550
much in case of UDAPI.

02:04:41.480 --> 02:04:44.060
Okay. Fine, everyone. So I'm done for today's class. Those

02:04:44.060 --> 02:04:46.580
who is having a question be here, those who is not having

02:04:46.580 --> 02:04:49.700
any question, they can drop off for today. Yeah. So those

02:04:49.700 --> 02:04:52.640
who is having question, you can raise your hand. So one by

02:04:52.640 --> 02:04:56.920
one. Yeah. So Srinivas Sallu, go ahead with your question.

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.280
Then Rishi, you can go ahead with the question. Yeah.

02:05:03.970 --> 02:05:06.890
Yeah. Srinivas Sallu, you have a question?

02:05:09.770 --> 02:05:11.930
Yeah. Rishi, I think I'm audible, right? To all of you.

02:05:17.560 --> 02:05:22.460
Okay. Jouber, go ahead with the question. Hi, Srinivas

02:05:22.460 --> 02:05:25.860
Sallu. How are you? Yeah. Great. Tell me question. Yeah. My

02:05:25.860 --> 02:05:29.980
question is that too, sometimes I feel the problem like

02:05:29.980 --> 02:05:35.360
installation peep or other thing, whatever, like you show

02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:38.520
up. So that time, how can I figure out the, solve the

02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:42.820
problem and- Yeah. Chat with ChatGPT, Gemini or UDAPI

02:05:42.820 --> 02:05:45.660
basically. That is the way to solve the problem quickly.

02:05:46.960 --> 02:05:50.740
Yeah. That's why taking a lot of time to fixing and like

02:05:50.740 --> 02:05:57.860
make the time. Another thing. Something like create the

02:05:57.860 --> 02:06:01.380
right now is the agent TKI before make the like chat port.

02:06:01.640 --> 02:06:05.540
So do you, how do you know everything you need to with this

02:06:05.540 --> 02:06:10.100
kind of stuff, like input different, different like library

02:06:10.100 --> 02:06:13.800
or how do I know about this? With experience, with

02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:15.700
experience. So once you will build it, you will know it

02:06:15.700 --> 02:06:19.020
simple. Like everything is like coming from the experience.

02:06:19.120 --> 02:06:24.000
Right? So unless you're not going to build it, how you will

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.940
get to know, I'm like. Yeah, no, no, I know. But it has

02:06:26.940 --> 02:06:29.500
anything like something that roadmap, you want to make

02:06:29.500 --> 02:06:31.620
something? No, sir. There is not a roadmap for everything,

02:06:31.760 --> 02:06:34.260
which is available. So things doesn't works in that way. I

02:06:34.260 --> 02:06:37.580
hope you understand. Yeah. I know. It's like my, my curious.

02:06:37.800 --> 02:06:42.020
That's why I asked you. I said, thank you for, I appreciate

02:06:42.020 --> 02:06:44.920
for that. Yeah. Thank you. Okay. So Akash, go ahead with the

02:06:44.920 --> 02:06:45.120
question.

02:06:50.720 --> 02:06:58.760
Okay. Okay. Hello. Go to the question. Hi. Yes. Thanks. I

02:06:58.760 --> 02:07:01.860
have one question here. We are discussing about the agent,

02:07:01.960 --> 02:07:05.140
right? In this agent, is it possible to create the tool to,

02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:10.780
for example, if you have the sales data for one to a month,

02:07:10.940 --> 02:07:14.240
I can calculate and bring the details. Yes. Yes. Obviously

02:07:14.240 --> 02:07:17.820
that that's a, like one of the, I would say one of the

02:07:17.820 --> 02:07:20.240
easiest tasks that you can do. So yes, obviously you can do

02:07:20.240 --> 02:07:23.700
it. See. At the end of the day, if let's suppose I'm using

02:07:23.700 --> 02:07:26.240
chat GPT, right. Or maybe any other system. So I can try to

02:07:26.240 --> 02:07:29.000
provide my document, upload my documents. And then if I'm

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:30.940
going to ask that, okay, if I do this calculation, do that

02:07:30.940 --> 02:07:35.360
calculation, it can do it. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Similarly

02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:38.040
here, I'm just creating a functions. I'm just asking this

02:07:38.040 --> 02:07:40.200
function that, okay, fine. So you are basically the smart

02:07:40.200 --> 02:07:42.900
function. You have this access LLM access, plus you have

02:07:42.900 --> 02:07:45.920
access of the data set from this databases or maybe from

02:07:45.920 --> 02:07:48.560
this file system drive or something. Right. And it will be

02:07:48.560 --> 02:07:51.740
able to pull those data. And then I can eventually deploy it

02:07:51.740 --> 02:07:54.740
and maybe deploy it in a scheduled manner that, okay, every

02:07:54.740 --> 02:07:57.180
day do these things every day at 12 o'clock, do this thing.

02:07:57.480 --> 02:08:00.520
So yes, all those things can be done. And that too, like we

02:08:00.520 --> 02:08:03.280
are going to see that kind of automation a lot. This is, I

02:08:03.280 --> 02:08:06.680
think one of the easiest tasks that we can do. Okay. And

02:08:06.680 --> 02:08:11.580
also see the previous classes, we mostly save the data in

02:08:11.580 --> 02:08:15.680
the vector storage and bring the data result based on the

02:08:15.680 --> 02:08:19.980
similarity search. So is it right? Yeah. So it's the only

02:08:19.980 --> 02:08:23.100
way, or we can connect directly with the database and bring

02:08:23.100 --> 02:08:25.380
the data. No, you can connect directly with the databases

02:08:25.380 --> 02:08:28.260
and bring the data. If you don't have a vector, right? If

02:08:28.260 --> 02:08:30.660
you don't have a vector, maybe I'm storing my data into a

02:08:30.660 --> 02:08:33.260
Mongo, which is a document format. Or maybe I'm storing a

02:08:33.260 --> 02:08:35.960
data with the SQL system, any kind of a SQL system, maybe

02:08:35.960 --> 02:08:39.240
like a snowflake or maybe MySQL, MS SQL, anything, right?

02:08:39.300 --> 02:08:42.740
DB2. I can bring the data. I can directly query the data and

02:08:42.740 --> 02:08:46.360
then bring it. So we don't need to check the similarity

02:08:46.360 --> 02:08:49.880
search there. See, I told you, right? Again and again, I

02:08:49.880 --> 02:08:53.160
think more than like 200, 300 times. It depends upon the use

02:08:53.160 --> 02:08:57.460
cases, what you're solving. Okay. See, database is nothing,

02:08:57.540 --> 02:08:59.920
but you will end up using any databases every time, right?

02:08:59.980 --> 02:09:02.420
Let's suppose I know SQL, right? But I will not end up using

02:09:02.420 --> 02:09:04.800
SQL system all the time. Let's suppose if I'm trying to

02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:07.820
process a time based data, right? Time dependent data. So

02:09:07.820 --> 02:09:10.200
obviously SQL will not be my choice. My choice will be my

02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:12.880
influx DB in that situation. Let's suppose if I'm dealing

02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:15.360
with a document. So obviously again, SQL will not be my

02:09:15.360 --> 02:09:17.680
choice. Maybe my choice is going to be a HBase. Maybe

02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:20.140
Cassandra, maybe a MongoDB. Okay. Let's suppose if I'm

02:09:20.140 --> 02:09:22.160
dealing with a graph based database. So obviously my choice

02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:25.260
is going to be Neo4j in that case. So all this database has

02:09:25.260 --> 02:09:28.160
been designed with a particular purposes and it's not like

02:09:28.160 --> 02:09:30.360
you should just go ahead with the thumb rule that, okay, no,

02:09:30.460 --> 02:09:33.360
in every case I'll end up using a vector DB or in every case

02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:37.140
I will be using a, like a SQL DB. No. Case by case, what

02:09:37.140 --> 02:09:39.180
problem you are trying to solve? I think this is what I have

02:09:39.180 --> 02:09:43.660
discussed more than 300 times in my previous lectures. Yeah.

02:09:43.880 --> 02:09:47.920
It's a case to case by the way. Okay. So we can create the

02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:52.120
graph also. Obviously you can create the graph if you have

02:09:52.120 --> 02:09:54.480
like that kind of a relational, like a two degree

02:09:54.480 --> 02:09:56.260
connection, one degree connection, three degree connection

02:09:56.260 --> 02:09:58.400
or seven degree connection. If you have, obviously you can

02:09:58.400 --> 02:10:00.480
go ahead with the graph DB and then you can try to use it.

02:10:00.680 --> 02:10:03.640
And maybe you can try to store the direct entity over there,

02:10:03.680 --> 02:10:06.080
direct object over there, or maybe you can try to store a

02:10:06.080 --> 02:10:09.520
vector over there. Again, depends. Okay. Thank you. Thank

02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:14.400
you. Yeah. So my question was on like, what is the

02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:17.220
difference? Like mainly when we are trying to use LangChain

02:10:17.220 --> 02:10:21.720
and LangGraph. So how do we do that? Both see both the

02:10:21.720 --> 02:10:24.540
frameworks, which you can use to create the entire, like

02:10:24.540 --> 02:10:28.820
agents one by one. The way you try to combine those agents

02:10:28.820 --> 02:10:32.000
is different in case of a graph. So basically try to follow

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:35.060
a node and edge based approach, as we know already, like

02:10:35.060 --> 02:10:37.960
from a data shell algorithm, right? So maybe you heard about

02:10:37.960 --> 02:10:41.680
a Dijkstra, Kruskal, Prim's algorithm, all these things. So

02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:45.260
the graph algorithm and inside this graph, so basically the

02:10:45.260 --> 02:10:48.060
major component or which can say a basic component is what?

02:10:48.160 --> 02:10:50.480
A node and an edge. And the edges. Node is nothing but, so

02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:52.320
where data will be stored, edges is nothing but connecting

02:10:52.320 --> 02:10:55.140
one node to another node or one journey to another one point

02:10:55.140 --> 02:10:58.940
to another point. If I'll talk about a LangGraph. So

02:10:58.940 --> 02:11:01.340
basically they give you a capability or you can say a

02:11:01.340 --> 02:11:04.300
flexibility. So where you can connect one agent with another

02:11:04.300 --> 02:11:06.760
agent, with another agent, you can try to even create a

02:11:06.760 --> 02:11:09.600
loop. You can try to create even a fork that, okay, if you

02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:12.460
are here, then go in both the direction. So basically this

02:11:12.460 --> 02:11:15.260
kind of a task you can try to configure. In case of a

02:11:15.260 --> 02:11:17.360
LangChain, again, you can try to configure, like this is

02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:19.380
something that you have to choose and then this, then this,

02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:22.080
then this. So both are actually like a framework, but yeah,

02:11:22.120 --> 02:11:25.120
connect the agents in a different way. So when we have like

02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:30.500
more on a kind of tools, so do we use graph in that case or

02:11:30.500 --> 02:11:34.120
if we know already the direction? Both the things are fine.

02:11:34.260 --> 02:11:36.520
You can, you can like technically build it with the help of

02:11:36.520 --> 02:11:39.700
both the approaches. And can you explain the streaming code

02:11:39.700 --> 02:11:42.500
that you have shared from the UD LangChain? Basically

02:11:42.500 --> 02:11:45.040
streaming is nothing but a chunk. So let's suppose if I'm

02:11:45.040 --> 02:11:48.000
trying to generate a very huge chunk. But I will not try to

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.940
retain it. What I will do, I'll generate through, generate

02:11:50.940 --> 02:11:52.560
through, generate through, that is something called a

02:11:52.560 --> 02:11:57.840
streaming. Okay. So one more thing, like I was recently

02:11:57.840 --> 02:12:02.320
exploring Neo4j and extracting like nodes and relationship

02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:07.520
from that. So it has like the source was saying that it is

02:12:07.520 --> 02:12:11.960
using OpenAI, but I was trying to use URI OpenAI, but I

02:12:11.960 --> 02:12:16.220
think it was not working there. So Neo4j, right. See

02:12:16.220 --> 02:12:20.200
everything. So basically every library will be having its

02:12:20.200 --> 02:12:23.540
own dependencies. By default, if they have made compatible

02:12:23.540 --> 02:12:26.060
with the OpenAI, so directly you will be able to work with

02:12:26.060 --> 02:12:27.580
it because they have already provided you with the library.

02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:30.440
Now let's suppose if it is not compatible, then you have to

02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:32.700
make it compatible. Generally it's up-identity things

02:12:32.700 --> 02:12:36.380
because of that it's not compatible or compatible. Right.

02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:40.860
Right. Yeah. But at other places I think I found this, it's

02:12:40.860 --> 02:12:44.560
very useful and it was easily able to like integrate. So

02:12:44.560 --> 02:12:47.020
yeah. Thank you for that. Yeah. Yeah.

02:12:53.160 --> 02:12:57.020
Okay. So next one is Nares. Go ahead.

02:13:01.780 --> 02:13:07.060
Yeah. Hi Siddharth. Yeah. Hi. Go ahead please. Yeah. So in

02:13:07.060 --> 02:13:11.180
the class you were telling like is technically a tool called

02:13:11.180 --> 02:13:16.920
as an agent? Technically not a tool, tool is tool by the

02:13:16.920 --> 02:13:21.140
way, tool is not an agent by the way. So when we are going

02:13:21.140 --> 02:13:24.460
to attach. Because tool is technically a function. It's not

02:13:24.460 --> 02:13:29.320
an agent. Basically it's like when we try to attach a

02:13:29.320 --> 02:13:34.160
capability of a prompt or capability to understand basically

02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:40.900
a natural language, it became agent. So do we need to attach

02:13:40.900 --> 02:13:44.920
separate LLM for the tool so that it becomes the agent or.

02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:48.160
So basically we are going to attach a prompt over there. You

02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:50.200
will see that like we are going to attach a prompt that okay

02:13:50.200 --> 02:13:54.460
fine so you are basically a smart agent. You are basically a

02:13:54.460 --> 02:13:58.240
smart function or tool which can do like a SQL query search

02:13:58.240 --> 02:14:00.880
or which can go into a knowledge base and then try to

02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:04.560
extract the data and then do this. So in this way what will

02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:07.320
happen, so whenever any client is going to send me a

02:14:07.320 --> 02:14:10.000
request, so it will try to understand that okay fine. So

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:11.880
this is something which has been written about this

02:14:11.880 --> 02:14:15.120
function. So let's go and call this function for this

02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:18.240
particular purposes. This is where like LLM will come in

02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:20.560
because LLM understands natural language, right? And you

02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:23.100
have already defined the nature of your tool. Technically

02:14:23.100 --> 02:14:24.580
it's not a tool. It's actually a function, right? So nature

02:14:24.580 --> 02:14:31.160
of your tool in a LLM. And then how it will happen. So going

02:14:31.160 --> 02:14:36.700
forward do we also cover to use multiple LLMs in a same

02:14:36.700 --> 02:14:39.980
thing because you know chargeability is good at content

02:14:39.980 --> 02:14:44.100
writing. Some other LLM will be good at some other task.

02:14:44.480 --> 02:14:47.760
Just change the model ID over here. All the LLMs are

02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:51.980
available to you. No. No. So my question was like I have

02:14:51.980 --> 02:14:56.860
different functions. So one function use to one kind of LLM

02:14:56.860 --> 02:14:59.180
and another function use to another kind of LLM. Obviously.

02:14:59.460 --> 02:15:02.280
So LLM we can try to provide separately to all of these

02:15:02.280 --> 02:15:08.240
things. It's just up to you. You can attach it. And my last

02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:12.560
question was couple of days ago I have attended some Google

02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:18.760
summit. So there I have seen a demo. They have a tool called

02:15:18.760 --> 02:15:23.420
agent space. Yes. they have creating agents based on, you

02:15:23.420 --> 02:15:27.520
know, natural language. Agents are actually based on natural

02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:30.520
language, by the way. They are creating agents using natural

02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:33.940
language. Okay, like technically it's a function, right? So,

02:15:33.940 --> 02:15:36.680
obviously, if I'm going to send some sort of like, you

02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:37.140
know...

02:15:40.140 --> 02:15:43.300
My question was if such kind of tools comes into the

02:15:43.300 --> 02:15:48.420
picture, what is the need of, you know, Naresh or what is

02:15:48.420 --> 02:15:52.800
the need of Sudhanshu? Yeah, so basically, okay, I think

02:15:52.800 --> 02:15:56.820
it's a very like a question that everyone keep on asking

02:15:56.820 --> 02:15:59.500
since the last three years, that if AI is already there,

02:15:59.680 --> 02:16:01.420
then what is the need of Naresh, what is the need of

02:16:01.420 --> 02:16:04.460
Sudhanshu, right? If AI is able to write a code, if AI is

02:16:04.460 --> 02:16:07.600
able to build a project, if AI is able to do a, like, you

02:16:07.600 --> 02:16:10.400
know, build a product, then what is the need of like Naresh

02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:14.760
or Sudhanshu? So, I think we all are getting this kind of a

02:16:14.760 --> 02:16:18.240
question since last three years. Yeah. Are we able to

02:16:18.240 --> 02:16:21.700
replace Naresh or Sudhanshu? Uh, no. They still exist,

02:16:21.900 --> 02:16:25.400
right? Yeah. And when you are talking about agents, what is

02:16:25.400 --> 02:16:29.660
that? It's basically like a piece of code, right? Yeah. We

02:16:29.660 --> 02:16:36.320
are needed in that case. Simple. Thank you. Yeah. If AI can

02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:38.820
do everything, then obviously, I don't have to come and

02:16:38.820 --> 02:16:41.400
teach something to you and then you don't have to learn and

02:16:41.400 --> 02:16:45.880
someone will write. But yeah, it's not happening. So, and

02:16:45.880 --> 02:16:48.440
it's nowhere even close, by the way. Yeah, nowhere even

02:16:48.440 --> 02:16:51.320
close. Okay. So, Yogi, please go ahead. After that, Sid, go

02:16:51.320 --> 02:16:51.520
ahead.

02:16:55.660 --> 02:17:00.880
Hello, sir. Yeah, go ahead. Sir, actually, I started class

02:17:00.880 --> 02:17:08.020
from yesterday, sir. Okay. And install Python and all in a

02:17:08.020 --> 02:17:12.940
condo for first teacher. But how can I proceed then? Just

02:17:12.940 --> 02:17:17.780
needed ideas. Okay. Sorry, what is that? Can you repeat that

02:17:17.780 --> 02:17:22.960
again? I need, sir, ideas. Miss, how can I... How can I

02:17:22.960 --> 02:17:27.180
proceed fastly? Just take a time, take a maybe week of time

02:17:27.180 --> 02:17:29.520
or 10 days of time, right? Max to max, not more than that.

02:17:29.800 --> 02:17:32.960
And maybe you can skip first two lectures because those

02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:35.500
lectures was just induction lectures. And then after that,

02:17:35.540 --> 02:17:37.960
whatever lectures that we have done, do it. Plus, I have

02:17:37.960 --> 02:17:40.660
also attached the assignment almost in every lecture. So,

02:17:40.700 --> 02:17:44.620
try to do assignment as much as you can on your own. And

02:17:44.620 --> 02:17:46.960
then continue with the classes. Don't skip the live classes.

02:17:47.140 --> 02:17:48.840
If you are going to skip the live classes, then again,

02:17:48.920 --> 02:17:52.160
things will keep on piling up and then it will be difficult

02:17:52.160 --> 02:17:56.660
to, you know, handle it in a later stage. Just take week of

02:17:56.660 --> 02:18:00.580
time, max to max. Next week, maybe. Okay, okay. Sir,

02:18:00.660 --> 02:18:04.880
actually, I was iNeuron student, but I skipped because of

02:18:04.880 --> 02:18:11.880
some personal reason. But I couldn't, means, details, I only

02:18:11.880 --> 02:18:18.180
thinking about last year, how can I join or should I

02:18:18.180 --> 02:18:22.840
continue in mechanical career? But somehow, I... How can I

02:18:22.840 --> 02:18:29.380
join your classes, sir? Because I don't know, you have

02:18:29.380 --> 02:18:34.180
classes since... Okay, okay. Thank you, thank you. Okay,

02:18:34.200 --> 02:18:37.560
yeah. Thanks, thanks. Okay, thank you. Yeah. Sid, go ahead,

02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:40.020
please. Yeah. Hi, Sudhak. So, I want to share my screen.

02:18:40.560 --> 02:18:43.820
Okay, go ahead. Share your screen then. Promoting as a

02:18:43.820 --> 02:18:47.400
panelist. Okay, so next one is Abhijit and then Ramesh.

02:18:47.500 --> 02:18:51.220
Please go ahead with the question. Hey, Sudhak. Update it

02:18:51.220 --> 02:18:55.000
here. Yeah. So, So, Sudhak sir, I have a question. Today,

02:18:55.140 --> 02:18:59.500
whatever you teach, right, this Lang-Chen, Lang-Graph. So,

02:18:59.560 --> 02:19:03.260
what about VLNM will create, like, based on your previous

02:19:03.260 --> 02:19:09.260
classes? So, that VLNM, we can download all these things,

02:19:09.420 --> 02:19:16.060
means, because might be my company will not support to send

02:19:16.060 --> 02:19:20.780
the data outside the office network, right? So... Yeah, so

02:19:20.780 --> 02:19:22.660
that's the reason. So, I talked about the VLNM in a very

02:19:22.660 --> 02:19:25.380
first place. See, throughout this entire lectures, right, I

02:19:25.380 --> 02:19:28.620
will be using some LLMs, right? So, maybe from URI, maybe

02:19:28.620 --> 02:19:31.520
from OpenAI, somewhere, right? But I will be using some LLMs

02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:34.740
and that's the reason. So, I talked about the approach. So,

02:19:34.740 --> 02:19:37.840
where, if you have like a concern and majority of the

02:19:37.840 --> 02:19:39.580
company, majority of the client will be having this concern

02:19:39.580 --> 02:19:42.740
that the data should not go anywhere. And so, that's the

02:19:42.740 --> 02:19:44.920
reason. So, I have talked about this VLNM approach. So,

02:19:44.920 --> 02:19:47.280
where you can host it in your own machine, right, wherever

02:19:47.280 --> 02:19:50.000
you want and then, like, use it in any of your application.

02:19:51.240 --> 02:19:54.720
Okay. So, we can use this Langchain, Langgraph also, right?

02:19:55.100 --> 02:19:57.820
Anywhere, anywhere. Yes, yes, yes. Yeah. See, it's just an

02:19:57.820 --> 02:20:00.680
LLM, right? Large language models, right? Correct, correct.

02:20:00.860 --> 02:20:03.360
You can use it anywhere. Anywhere means Langchain,

02:20:03.460 --> 02:20:06.220
Langgraph, KrooAI, NETN, everywhere means, literally

02:20:06.220 --> 02:20:09.620
everywhere you will be able to use it. I never said or I

02:20:09.620 --> 02:20:12.900
never talked about a specific LLM. I simply said LLM. You

02:20:12.900 --> 02:20:17.940
just need LLM access. But your NETN is the, it's a GUI

02:20:17.940 --> 02:20:20.680
based, right? So... Yeah, yeah. It's a GUI based. And they

02:20:20.680 --> 02:20:22.900
provide... It provides you an endpoint and even Langchain

02:20:22.900 --> 02:20:25.400
provides you basically a wrapper with respect to OpenAI.

02:20:25.560 --> 02:20:28.520
Now, let's suppose if you are using your own LLMs, you have

02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:31.660
to make it compatible and that's just one simple class we

02:20:31.660 --> 02:20:34.260
used to write and everything will be compatible. In case of

02:20:34.260 --> 02:20:38.940
this one, NETN, so they have given you a node, so where you

02:20:38.940 --> 02:20:42.040
can try to configure a HTTP request. At the end of the day,

02:20:42.100 --> 02:20:45.300
your model is, like, hosted anywhere, but you are trying to

02:20:45.300 --> 02:20:48.800
make HTTP request itself, right, with an endpoint, yeah,

02:20:48.940 --> 02:20:52.960
HTTP request. So, NETN, that node is already available.

02:20:54.100 --> 02:20:58.720
Okay. Understood. Got it. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

02:20:58.820 --> 02:21:04.100
Yeah. Ramesh, go ahead, please. Hello. Hi, sir. Hello. Yeah.

02:21:04.160 --> 02:21:09.020
From today's class, I have noted some questions to ask. So,

02:21:09.060 --> 02:21:13.620
you have been... Yeah. You have explained many more... Yeah.

02:21:13.700 --> 02:21:16.180
Please tell me. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. You have explained many

02:21:16.180 --> 02:21:20.780
more tools, like Langchain, you know, Lama index. Yeah. And

02:21:20.780 --> 02:21:24.400
Autogen or something, no? We have seen so much tool, do we

02:21:24.400 --> 02:21:27.780
need to overlay and all the tools are... No. One is fine.

02:21:27.840 --> 02:21:31.100
Like I said, so, if you know one tool, right, one framework,

02:21:31.260 --> 02:21:33.040
it's not a tool, it's a framework. So, if you are aware

02:21:33.040 --> 02:21:35.440
about one framework, believe me, if you will, like, you

02:21:35.440 --> 02:21:38.520
know, start, like, exploring other tool, it will be, like,

02:21:38.520 --> 02:21:42.680
same. You won't find much of differences because, see, core

02:21:42.680 --> 02:21:45.120
philosophy is same, right, in terms of building an agent,

02:21:45.160 --> 02:21:47.780
communicating and, like, you know, connecting one agent with

02:21:47.780 --> 02:21:50.380
the other one. So, core philosophy is same, it's not going

02:21:50.380 --> 02:21:54.120
to change at all. So, learn one and then, like, you know,

02:21:54.200 --> 02:21:58.420
explore the other one and say, okay, fine, I know

02:21:58.420 --> 02:22:02.300
everything. Yeah. Yes. You said some tools are the low code,

02:22:02.340 --> 02:22:06.160
no code and some tool customized. So, which one do we need

02:22:06.160 --> 02:22:08.520
to prepare, actually? Customized or... Everything.

02:22:08.700 --> 02:22:11.220
Everything. You never know, like, your next company is using

02:22:11.220 --> 02:22:13.860
which one or your next team is using which one. So, and

02:22:13.860 --> 02:22:15.580
again, it's not that tough too. Like, if you are going to

02:22:15.580 --> 02:22:18.220
spend more, maybe more than 10, 20 hours, right, on one

02:22:18.220 --> 02:22:22.700
tool, you will be able to master. Simple. So, if something

02:22:22.700 --> 02:22:25.040
is going to take this much of time, so I don't think that

02:22:25.040 --> 02:22:31.200
any reason to skip that learning. Just 20 hours per one tool

02:22:31.200 --> 02:22:35.320
or just 20 hours per one tool? Sir, that learning capacity,

02:22:35.480 --> 02:22:38.120
I think, depends upon me and you, right. Maybe I can learn

02:22:38.120 --> 02:22:40.920
faster, but maybe yours will be slower. Depends. Or maybe

02:22:40.920 --> 02:22:43.840
yours will be faster. Right. Okay, sir. And you have

02:22:43.840 --> 02:22:46.580
mentioned the... Yeah, yeah. Got it. Got it, sir. I can't

02:22:46.580 --> 02:22:49.380
tell you the exact number, how many hours you need to learn

02:22:49.380 --> 02:22:53.100
something, right. I can't, like, say that. Yeah, yeah. It

02:22:53.100 --> 02:22:56.240
depends on adaptability, yes. Exactly. So, I think, yeah,

02:22:56.340 --> 02:22:59.220
Lansmith and something, you told that it's under with

02:22:59.220 --> 02:23:04.160
platform services, right. So, let me correct me if I am

02:23:04.160 --> 02:23:07.840
wrong, it is helping for some debugging or deployment or can

02:23:07.840 --> 02:23:11.020
we... No, why do we use those kinds of platforms, something?

02:23:11.580 --> 02:23:15.440
Sorry, why do we use? No, no. Is it kind of the platform?

02:23:15.660 --> 02:23:18.080
What is the difference? You have divided the two groups.

02:23:18.080 --> 02:23:19.940
It's a framework, sir. Framework. Framework. It's a library.

02:23:21.280 --> 02:23:25.080
Okay. No, no. You have segregated the two things, sir. First

02:23:25.080 --> 02:23:27.140
one is the Lang China... One is a low code, one is a low

02:23:27.140 --> 02:23:30.000
code. Yeah. Low code or maybe like a code-based and one is

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:35.100
like a drag-and-drop. Okay. Lansmith and another one, right.

02:23:35.360 --> 02:23:38.640
Lansharu or something you... That is basically a deployment

02:23:38.640 --> 02:23:43.080
platform. Oh, deployment platform. Okay. Yeah. Okay, sir.

02:23:43.420 --> 02:23:45.840
Okay. That's it. And my next question is the agent-related

02:23:45.840 --> 02:23:48.960
question, sir. So you have shown one thing for the one bot,

02:23:49.080 --> 02:23:52.920
right. One bot is nothing but one machine. We graded the

02:23:52.920 --> 02:23:55.160
three agents, right, three tools, something, three

02:23:55.160 --> 02:24:02.220
functions. So my question is that... So each machine, we

02:24:02.220 --> 02:24:04.560
will allocate some memory, right, chat memory or something

02:24:04.560 --> 02:24:08.540
to preserve some data. Hmm. Okay. What is the maximum size

02:24:08.540 --> 02:24:12.180
of the chat memories, you know, which is the best practice,

02:24:12.240 --> 02:24:15.060
for the best practice? So where the data has been stored?

02:24:15.540 --> 02:24:18.720
Cache memory or any... Yeah, you can try to configure Redis

02:24:18.720 --> 02:24:22.820
over there in Redis, you will be able to store it. Okay. We

02:24:22.820 --> 02:24:25.720
can configure Redis, okay. Yes. Yeah. So Redis is a key and

02:24:25.720 --> 02:24:29.100
value pair, right? Just per key and value pair. Yeah. So you

02:24:29.100 --> 02:24:31.100
can try to like... The way you are trying to store it, you

02:24:31.100 --> 02:24:34.000
can just give any kind of a memory over there. You can... If

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.200
you would like to like give something from your local cache,

02:24:36.240 --> 02:24:38.860
then give it. If you would like to configure a Redis,

02:24:38.900 --> 02:24:41.060
configure Redis. If you would like to configure something

02:24:41.060 --> 02:24:44.840
else, configure it. Yes. It's your wish. Okay. Yeah. Instead

02:24:44.840 --> 02:24:47.580
of that, can we store into database instead of the cache

02:24:47.580 --> 02:24:50.080
memory? But again, you have to send a query, right? So

02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:52.200
again, it will defeat the whole purpose of like creating a

02:24:52.200 --> 02:24:58.620
memory itself. Okay. If it is not that fast. Right. So and

02:24:58.620 --> 02:25:01.820
you told me that, right, within bot, we have three agents.

02:25:02.080 --> 02:25:04.840
When we run the program or something, it is automatically

02:25:04.840 --> 02:25:09.000
choose one agent, right? Hmm. So is it possible to call

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:12.880
multiple agents at a time? Yes. Multiple agents. Multiple

02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:17.160
agents at a time, right? Yes. Yeah. So and it is invoking

02:25:17.160 --> 02:25:21.460
one LLM, sir. One LLM model, right? For each agent, it is

02:25:21.460 --> 02:25:26.380
invoking one LLM model. Yeah. By default LLM, it will try to

02:25:26.380 --> 02:25:31.320
invoke. Yes. Yeah. LLM model, right? So my question is that,

02:25:31.420 --> 02:25:35.620
so our LLM model is in the some different places and this

02:25:35.620 --> 02:25:39.260
agent will be in our machine or any... We are costing

02:25:39.260 --> 02:25:42.800
anywhere. So we have the multiple customer, right? yeah. So

02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:42.960
how does the agent, see assistant, agent or something,

02:25:43.220 --> 02:25:47.060
right? They're accessing the agent at a time, multiple

02:25:47.060 --> 02:25:50.380
request within the agent. So by that time, how agent is

02:25:50.380 --> 02:25:56.660
reacting? You have a lot of like a , let's create some sort

02:25:56.660 --> 02:26:00.800
of asian and let's speak okay. Yeah. Then I think your, all

02:26:00.800 --> 02:26:03.100
the questions will be like a cleared by tomorrow itself,

02:26:03.260 --> 02:26:07.020
maybe. Okay. But I think all these things anyhow I'm going

02:26:07.020 --> 02:26:09.760
to discuss. So no need to discuss now. Yup. Yeah. Yeah. okay

02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:13.200
then then it's fine so then react react as you told the

02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:15.900
react engine and we will talk about that what is the meaning

02:26:15.900 --> 02:26:20.500
of our reactivation yep okay okay yeah so then final one

02:26:20.500 --> 02:26:23.420
more question sir what is the tomorrow agenda same thing

02:26:23.420 --> 02:26:28.520
continue the programming or no it's a theory theory or

02:26:28.520 --> 02:26:30.800
exercise or something tomorrow so obviously we have started

02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:33.220
with the programming sir right so we'll do the same thing

02:26:33.220 --> 02:26:39.740
okay okay okay okay next one is arvan go ahead ganesh go

02:26:39.740 --> 02:26:42.880
ahead the hetal go ahead arun go ahead ranji go ahead yeah

02:26:42.880 --> 02:26:47.920
sir i have one small doubt regarding that hugging face they

02:26:47.920 --> 02:26:52.420
have provided different models some model i see the in the

02:26:52.420 --> 02:26:55.560
in the end they are writing thinking some they are writing

02:26:55.560 --> 02:26:59.060
instruct some they are writing nothing so actually what

02:26:59.060 --> 02:27:03.260
exactly why they are uh giving different different models so

02:27:03.260 --> 02:27:06.480
what are the exact purpose for their like their architecture

02:27:06.480 --> 02:27:08.900
is a little bit different so basically thinking model means

02:27:08.900 --> 02:27:12.240
so it will try to like generate a multiple responses and

02:27:12.240 --> 02:27:15.580
then based on the multiple responses select one responses so

02:27:15.580 --> 02:27:19.420
really is and the one is like uh basically input and output

02:27:19.420 --> 02:27:22.440
kind of things like token will go as an input token will

02:27:22.440 --> 02:27:25.460
come as output so based on that they have designed a

02:27:25.460 --> 02:27:28.120
different different kind of models so thinking environments

02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:31.180
it will take obviously a longer time because generating long

02:27:31.320 --> 02:27:36.100
lot of like you know like initial in outputs and then out of

02:27:36.100 --> 02:27:38.740
those initial output again it is trying to select the best

02:27:38.740 --> 02:27:42.900
one based on the ranking. So that's the reason it's been

02:27:42.900 --> 02:27:47.240
like a label as a thinking model or maybe some other thing.

02:27:47.420 --> 02:27:51.200
So instruct have some additional instruction for that model

02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:57.500
or? Instruct is not additional instruction I would say but

02:27:57.500 --> 02:28:02.720
just input output like you are going to give a token as an

02:28:02.720 --> 02:28:05.180
input and then simple like it will be able to give you the

02:28:05.180 --> 02:28:08.300
output that's something called as instruct model yeah not

02:28:08.300 --> 02:28:13.380
not very different okay sir thank you yeah okay next one

02:28:13.380 --> 02:28:20.880
please yeah can I go ahead yeah go ahead yeah I am having a

02:28:20.880 --> 02:28:25.500
problem with this environment setup so I am not able to

02:28:25.500 --> 02:28:29.260
understand okay at least this issue that you are having and

02:28:29.260 --> 02:28:34.220
I tried. To change the python and okay share the screen

02:28:34.220 --> 02:28:39.340
please share the screen okay next question Armaan, Ganesh,

02:28:39.360 --> 02:28:40.940
Arun anyone yeah

02:28:49.770 --> 02:28:52.710
instruct model or fine tuning model using the instruction of

02:28:52.710 --> 02:28:55.570
fine tuning yeah basically it's like a just a simple

02:28:55.570 --> 02:28:58.110
instruction in terms of giving output it's not a different

02:28:58.110 --> 02:29:00.990
model by the way it's just like a taking input and output

02:29:00.990 --> 02:29:03.310
and in terms of thinking so generating a multiple responses

02:29:03.310 --> 02:29:06.910
in between and then selecting the best one this is how it

02:29:06.910 --> 02:29:12.770
happens. Okay Armaan, Ganesh, Arun anyone question I think

02:29:12.770 --> 02:29:17.570
you have raised your hand yeah Gala you have a question yes

02:29:17.570 --> 02:29:22.770
sir I see the answer sir yeah go ahead please sir with these

02:29:22.770 --> 02:29:26.910
agents I think most of the traditional sql dba support guys

02:29:26.910 --> 02:29:29.870
are going to replace right already people have started

02:29:29.870 --> 02:29:33.910
replacing yeah it has already started long back maybe expert

02:29:33.910 --> 02:29:37.110
peoples are going to stay there stay right like 15 years 18

02:29:37.110 --> 02:29:41.210
years plus guys. No sir. No people mid label and senior

02:29:41.210 --> 02:29:44.910
label like people are removing first as we have already seen

02:29:44.910 --> 02:29:48.490
in a 12000 layoff which has been done by Microsoft and again

02:29:48.490 --> 02:29:51.830
from a TCS as well so I think Microsoft not 12000 I think

02:29:51.830 --> 02:29:56.070
6000 and TCS have laid off like a 12000 where majority of

02:29:56.070 --> 02:29:59.650
like a people were mid senior level people or a senior level

02:29:59.650 --> 02:30:02.570
people because companies are thinking that these are the

02:30:02.570 --> 02:30:07.410
people who are not you know ready to enable themselves or

02:30:07.410 --> 02:30:10.690
ready to adopt. A new things with a faster pace the way

02:30:10.690 --> 02:30:15.510
industry changing so they are at risk and if you fall in

02:30:15.510 --> 02:30:19.550
that bracket so you are at risk more if you are not able to

02:30:19.550 --> 02:30:22.210
adopt it if you are able to adopt it then obviously you will

02:30:22.210 --> 02:30:25.410
be having a lot of advantages yes sir because of that I am

02:30:25.410 --> 02:30:30.750
trying to this integrate this genite with the database to

02:30:30.750 --> 02:30:34.530
troubleshoot the errors and to find the optimization queries

02:30:34.530 --> 02:30:40.950
like that I am thinking the solution okay okay maybe support

02:30:40.950 --> 02:30:44.750
guy is going to replace right almost all almost all yeah

02:30:44.750 --> 02:30:46.990
people have already started replacing it because literally

02:30:46.990 --> 02:30:49.630
we do not need support guy because everything can be

02:30:49.630 --> 02:30:52.030
understood and handled by a system now everything means

02:30:52.030 --> 02:30:55.130
literally everything okay okay got it sir thank you very

02:30:55.130 --> 02:30:59.470
much yes thanks yeah any other question or shall we go ahead

02:30:59.470 --> 02:31:06.190
with the screen sharing I am sharing my screen okay so what

02:31:06.190 --> 02:31:09.810
is the issue that you are facing. Generally you had that.

02:31:09.830 --> 02:31:18.270
The issue is this URI issue basically the give me the remote

02:31:18.270 --> 02:31:21.270
control and

02:31:27.160 --> 02:31:30.420
I tried all whatever I could I

02:32:38.580 --> 02:32:41.220
tried these all both yeah

02:34:36.670 --> 02:34:41.630
so it is working what is the difference nothing so just

02:34:41.630 --> 02:34:45.870
install all the packages and now it is fine but these are

02:34:45.870 --> 02:34:50.470
the same things which I was doing. Yeah. So as you can see

02:34:50.470 --> 02:34:53.190
just do this installation all these three that I have done

02:34:53.190 --> 02:34:59.830
and then it will work yeah. Yeah I tried with 2.11.7 tried

02:34:59.830 --> 02:35:03.130
everything other than this. Sir it is working in your system

02:35:03.130 --> 02:35:08.410
as you can see yeah so yeah but the problem is yeah thank

02:35:08.410 --> 02:35:12.610
you sir. What is this magic this nothing sir no magic just

02:35:12.610 --> 02:35:14.730
an installation yeah Sid please go ahead share the screen.

02:35:17.370 --> 02:35:21.250
Yeah. Hi. So actually I was running this last week's model

02:35:21.250 --> 02:35:30.250
so it was running fine so suddenly now it got the one VM got

02:35:30.250 --> 02:35:34.450
off so I am trying to rerun it so actually so this one what

02:35:34.450 --> 02:35:37.790
I was getting the issue that I could get an email so this

02:35:37.790 --> 02:35:41.450
email and this analysis was coming but when I was clicking

02:35:41.450 --> 02:35:45.990
on the session send analysis report it was giving me an

02:35:45.990 --> 02:35:47.990
error and now suddenly this analysis was coming. So I can

02:35:47.990 --> 02:35:51.210
see this while the VM was running it started giving me this

02:35:51.210 --> 02:35:55.410
problem so now I am again trying to run this VM so I am

02:35:55.410 --> 02:35:58.870
doing the installation by creating a duplicate session so.

02:35:58.990 --> 02:36:01.950
Do a debugging Sid just do a debugging you will be able to

02:36:01.950 --> 02:36:05.750
find out the issue yeah. Okay. Just just debug debug like

02:36:05.750 --> 02:36:09.070
where it is getting stuck and then I think you will be able

02:36:09.070 --> 02:36:15.030
to see it yeah. Okay yeah okay thank you okay next question

02:36:15.030 --> 02:36:20.730
guys. Hi Sudhanshu sir. sir yeah go ahead please sir i'm not

02:36:20.730 --> 02:36:23.970
able to understand this pidentic thing are we going to

02:36:23.970 --> 02:36:27.170
basically pidentic is a new library that people have

02:36:27.170 --> 02:36:29.530
released so let's suppose if i'm trying to pass some data

02:36:29.530 --> 02:36:33.710
now so generally we directly pass a data set into any of

02:36:33.710 --> 02:36:37.290
this function what pidentic says is that that okay so let me

02:36:37.290 --> 02:36:40.530
bring in in between uh like a middle man or maybe as a layer

02:36:40.530 --> 02:36:44.630
in between so whenever you are trying to pass a data what i

02:36:44.630 --> 02:36:48.010
will do i'll verify it first and then i'll allow you to pass

02:36:48.010 --> 02:36:51.730
a data into some of the functions this is the use of

02:36:51.730 --> 02:36:57.510
pidentic library uh but uh in our company let's say when we

02:36:57.510 --> 02:37:01.030
are going to use some um other elements like openai right

02:37:01.030 --> 02:37:06.310
not through the uri so in that scenario i mean is it

02:37:06.310 --> 02:37:09.610
required to use the pidentic uh basically it depends upon

02:37:09.610 --> 02:37:11.350
the framework that you are using so let's suppose if

02:37:11.350 --> 02:37:14.310
langchen has already used a pidentic right and they are

02:37:14.310 --> 02:37:17.210
doing any kind of a pidentic validation before calling their

02:37:17.210 --> 02:37:20.510
any any functions you have to use it your function should be

02:37:20.510 --> 02:37:23.010
pidentic compatible otherwise langchen will start giving you

02:37:23.010 --> 02:37:27.710
error okay so ideally i mean we would require to use that

02:37:27.710 --> 02:37:30.310
right exactly like because other frameworks that you are

02:37:30.310 --> 02:37:33.010
using they are already using it and you if you are going to

02:37:33.010 --> 02:37:35.930
use that framework so you have to make your code your

02:37:35.930 --> 02:37:40.310
function compatible with it any and i mean any small project

02:37:40.310 --> 02:37:44.170
that you have used the pidentic one i think so many i would

02:37:44.170 --> 02:37:47.050
say like where i have used a pidentic so even in my last

02:37:47.050 --> 02:37:49.030
class when i was talking about my agentic and all the

02:37:49.030 --> 02:37:52.030
discussion so basically what i have done i have not used a

02:37:52.030 --> 02:37:56.690
uri api uh uri ai as an sdk directly so what i have done i

02:37:56.690 --> 02:38:00.690
have just used the raw url and a key and then i have also

02:38:00.690 --> 02:38:03.690
shown that how to write that pidentic class where i am doing

02:38:03.690 --> 02:38:06.930
a data verification see we have also created a sdk right

02:38:06.930 --> 02:38:10.170
that that your sdk that you are able to install we are

02:38:10.170 --> 02:38:13.690
handling it if you will open up the code after installing

02:38:13.690 --> 02:38:16.010
urei just go and open up the code for uri ai and then you

02:38:16.010 --> 02:38:16.010
will be able to install it and then you will be able to

02:38:16.030 --> 02:38:20.510
write just find out that we have written the pidentic

02:38:20.510 --> 02:38:24.410
classes okay and even in my previous class previous lecture

02:38:24.410 --> 02:38:27.190
so i have already shown that how let's suppose i'm not going

02:38:27.190 --> 02:38:29.850
to use sdk urei i'm not going to install i'm not going to do

02:38:29.850 --> 02:38:33.090
people stall uri at all but still i have to use urei in that

02:38:33.090 --> 02:38:36.450
case how to write the classes i mean the previous class

02:38:36.450 --> 02:38:39.990
you're talking about the last class last last batch actually

02:38:39.990 --> 02:38:46.030
last batch uh i'm talking about agentiki with nlp sorry nlp

02:38:46.030 --> 02:38:50.130
and agentiki the class which i have taken uh like a couple

02:38:50.130 --> 02:38:52.770
of months back and that is available on your own platform

02:38:52.770 --> 02:38:55.190
right that is also available in your own platform yeah with

02:38:55.190 --> 02:39:00.610
the blue uh you know this one uh that is that was the live

02:39:00.610 --> 02:39:03.010
class or hybrid kind of thing that was also live classes

02:39:04.350 --> 02:39:10.030
okay and i mean the other thing like like in the id we are

02:39:10.030 --> 02:39:13.330
getting the auto completion thing right so for that we are

02:39:13.330 --> 02:39:18.230
using any plugin and after that we are attaching the uh uri

02:39:18.230 --> 02:39:23.450
auto uh chat completion thing which one which one like in

02:39:23.450 --> 02:39:27.330
the vs code id right when you are writing some piece of code

02:39:27.330 --> 02:39:30.430
so it is giving the suggestion auto completion thing for

02:39:30.430 --> 02:39:35.350
that you are using any plugin and yeah so basically i have

02:39:35.350 --> 02:39:38.250
installed like a couple of plugins over here so one is

02:39:38.250 --> 02:39:41.470
basically a github copilot i have installed which is running

02:39:41.470 --> 02:39:47.870
in my system the another one is basically uh like a so let

02:39:47.870 --> 02:39:52.070
me show you the because in company generally uh they promote

02:39:52.070 --> 02:39:55.190
using the github copilot one yeah so github copilot is i

02:39:55.190 --> 02:39:57.290
think more than enough you can also install amazon cube

02:39:57.290 --> 02:40:01.890
which is a new uh release by the way you can also install in

02:40:01.890 --> 02:40:05.830
my system i have a gemini code assist as well i have so many

02:40:05.830 --> 02:40:09.370
things basically i keep on like trying multiple things so i

02:40:09.370 --> 02:40:11.710
mean underneath they are connecting to any llm right

02:40:11.710 --> 02:40:14.690
underneath they are connected to llms yes yes so in that

02:40:14.690 --> 02:40:20.070
case can we use uh the yeah the uri token the one lakh token

02:40:20.070 --> 02:40:24.570
per day yeah you can you can use that one that's okay uh but

02:40:24.570 --> 02:40:27.570
uh one like will not be sufficient in terms of code we need

02:40:27.570 --> 02:40:29.950
to go for the subscription in that case right that's right

02:40:29.950 --> 02:40:33.370
multiple one because one lakh will not be like uh sufficient

02:40:33.370 --> 02:40:37.810
okay generally i mean github cook pilot offers ten dollars

02:40:37.810 --> 02:40:46.050
per month i believe okay okay thank you sir yeah thanks any

02:40:46.050 --> 02:41:02.450
other question guys any one sir uh sir sure i i

02:41:02.450 --> 02:41:07.930
tried to sniff through most of the courses but i could not

02:41:07.930 --> 02:41:11.150
find the role based security so sir for agent how can we

02:41:11.150 --> 02:41:12.530
configure role based security

02:41:16.230 --> 02:41:19.230
who is going to access it and then who is not so is

02:41:19.230 --> 02:41:34.010
something

02:41:34.010 --> 02:41:40.490
called a jf token so probably that i i would i would

02:41:40.490 --> 02:41:47.510
research i will let you know uh login login You have to

02:41:47.510 --> 02:41:52.690
define the role. Let's say your login ID is PK. PK is going

02:41:52.690 --> 02:41:55.550
to be admin, PK is going to be user, PK is going to be a

02:41:55.550 --> 02:41:59.690
finance guy, and PK is going to be a HR department. So

02:41:59.690 --> 02:42:02.050
basically what will happen is that your ID is made when you

02:42:02.050 --> 02:42:05.770
log in. Like you log in to Euron. So basically you log in as

02:42:05.770 --> 02:42:08.310
a student. Then we also have an admin portal from where we

02:42:08.310 --> 02:42:10.610
manage content and do everything. Again in the admin portal

02:42:10.610 --> 02:42:12.510
there is something called as finance role, there is

02:42:12.510 --> 02:42:14.550
something called as super admin role, there is something

02:42:14.550 --> 02:42:16.630
called as admin role, there is something called as editor

02:42:16.630 --> 02:42:19.810
role. So again we have defined multiple roles there. That is

02:42:19.810 --> 02:42:24.330
on the login ID. If the role was already defined, then we

02:42:24.330 --> 02:42:26.730
will match it with the login ID. If Danshu is logging in,

02:42:26.730 --> 02:42:29.890
then he will be able to log in as a super admin. If someone

02:42:29.890 --> 02:42:32.010
else from the finance team is going to log in, then they

02:42:32.010 --> 02:42:34.110
will be having just a report access. They won't be able to

02:42:34.110 --> 02:42:36.470
see anything else. They can't come and modify the courses or

02:42:36.470 --> 02:42:38.970
like add and delete the videos or anything. They won't be

02:42:38.970 --> 02:42:43.190
able to do it. So what we do is that whatever feature that

02:42:43.190 --> 02:42:46.490
you are building, we put that feature in a role and assign

02:42:46.490 --> 02:42:51.830
that role to an ID. That is a role based. Okay. I will

02:42:51.830 --> 02:42:54.510
explore that sir. We will let you know. So the next thing is

02:42:54.510 --> 02:42:58.370
how would we achieve multi-agent orchestration. So say there

02:42:58.370 --> 02:43:03.730
are 10 agents in a workflow and there is one agent who is

02:43:03.730 --> 02:43:10.510
managing all those 10 agents. We will see tomorrow how we

02:43:10.510 --> 02:43:13.550
manage multi-agent. And then there is a route through one

02:43:13.550 --> 02:43:17.230
agent. Or all the agent works in a parallel. We will see

02:43:17.230 --> 02:43:22.010
that tomorrow. Okay. Sir, one last question. Whenever we

02:43:22.010 --> 02:43:27.310
create agent, can we create it in such a way that in any

02:43:27.310 --> 02:43:30.370
other new project, I can directly use this agent. Say for

02:43:30.370 --> 02:43:34.630
example, connecting to S3. So I can build one agent and

02:43:34.630 --> 02:43:37.790
which I can reuse multiple times for different projects.

02:43:38.150 --> 02:43:40.330
Obviously, that's why API is useful. Let's suppose you made

02:43:40.330 --> 02:43:43.230
an agent. Technically, agent is what? Function, right? You

02:43:43.230 --> 02:43:46.930
expose it through API. Now it will be independent. You have

02:43:46.930 --> 02:43:49.550
programming language and frameworks, right? Okay. Let's

02:43:49.550 --> 02:43:52.290
suppose that we made an agent in a lang chain. Okay. Now I

02:43:52.290 --> 02:43:54.370
have to use it in a crew. There are two different platforms

02:43:54.370 --> 02:43:57.590
and two different frameworks. Right? So what will you do?

02:43:58.110 --> 02:44:02.610
Expose it as API. Now you can consume it there. Sir, in that

02:44:02.610 --> 02:44:05.470
case, how will we maintain the concurrency if there are like

02:44:05.470 --> 02:44:08.490
10 instances of the same agent being called at the same

02:44:08.490 --> 02:44:15.610
time? 10 instances of the same agent. Call as the same time.

02:44:16.730 --> 02:44:20.410
Concurrency of the agent. So there are 10 threads which are

02:44:20.410 --> 02:44:26.210
accessing that agent. Right? Yes. Okay. And when we create

02:44:26.210 --> 02:44:29.690
it, when we expose that service, we need to also ensure that

02:44:29.690 --> 02:44:32.470
it is concurrent and it is working at the same time. So that

02:44:32.470 --> 02:44:37.330
there is no resource lock at that point of time. So agent is

02:44:37.330 --> 02:44:38.990
as a function only, right? Where is the resource lock

02:44:38.990 --> 02:44:44.830
happening in that? It is not in the thread. Exactly. Agent

02:44:44.830 --> 02:44:46.830
at the end of the day, see, it's just a function that you

02:44:46.830 --> 02:44:49.870
are using. Right? Now internally, that agent will be calling

02:44:49.870 --> 02:44:52.550
a resource. That's okay. But at the end of the day, it's

02:44:52.550 --> 02:44:54.790
just a function that you are trying to call. A tool. Right?

02:44:54.790 --> 02:44:56.550
Just a function. So what difference does it make if he calls

02:44:56.550 --> 02:45:03.210
one or 10 or 50 calls? Okay. So sir, with respect to that

02:45:03.210 --> 02:45:05.810
only, how do we maintain the concurrency? It is from the

02:45:05.810 --> 02:45:08.910
service provider like AWS would help us provide concurrency?

02:45:09.070 --> 02:45:11.630
Yes. Obviously, wherever you are hosting it, it will provide

02:45:11.630 --> 02:45:16.130
it to you. And depending upon the resources, AWS is capable

02:45:16.130 --> 02:45:20.850
of scaling it to a higher level. Any cloud platform is like

02:45:20.850 --> 02:45:23.450
capable enough to scale it to any level basically. Right?

02:45:23.510 --> 02:45:25.990
Let's suppose that if your one agent is getting a thousand

02:45:25.990 --> 02:45:30.050
hits in a second, right? So obviously it has to serve all

02:45:30.050 --> 02:45:33.190
thousand at a time. And how will that depend? That will

02:45:33.190 --> 02:45:36.130
depend on where you have hosted it. Somewhere it must be

02:45:36.130 --> 02:45:38.510
running on some resource. Exactly. It must be running on

02:45:38.510 --> 02:45:43.010
some computer at the end of the day. Right? So basically, it

02:45:43.010 --> 02:45:46.630
depends on just like a website. That my website is hosted on

02:45:46.630 --> 02:45:48.550
a resource. Now we have given the resource of the website

02:45:48.550 --> 02:45:53.150
where we have hosted it. If it hits above 100, then the

02:45:53.150 --> 02:45:55.430
website will be down. It means it will not be able to serve

02:45:55.430 --> 02:45:59.710
101th. Right? Same thing happens even for these functions.

02:46:01.490 --> 02:46:04.770
Okay. So there you will have to manage the resource wherever

02:46:04.770 --> 02:46:08.570
you are hosting it. If you are hosting it. You will have to

02:46:08.570 --> 02:46:10.830
scale it accordingly basically. That okay, if I am getting

02:46:10.830 --> 02:46:13.430
more hits, obviously it should go for auto scale. And

02:46:13.430 --> 02:46:17.390
Amazon, any cloud platform, Amazon Azure, whatever you use,

02:46:17.650 --> 02:46:21.150
like you can just use it. Maybe you can use it like ECR, ECR

02:46:21.150 --> 02:46:24.130
services inside the Amazon or plain EC2 you can try to use

02:46:24.130 --> 02:46:27.790
it. Or like EKS you can try to use it. GKS you can try to

02:46:27.790 --> 02:46:30.710
use it. Or AKS you can try to use it. Use anything. And it

02:46:30.710 --> 02:46:32.810
will be able to manage the scalability. It doesn't matter

02:46:32.810 --> 02:46:36.250
how many hits are coming on it. Okay. Okay sir. We will have

02:46:36.250 --> 02:46:38.330
to read about that setting. But anyways, this is helpful.

02:46:38.470 --> 02:46:41.510
Thank you so much. No, we will teach that in class. When we

02:46:41.510 --> 02:46:44.550
will teach scalable deployment. Generally, I am going to

02:46:44.550 --> 02:46:48.710
talk about ECS and like ECR. Container registry and like

02:46:48.710 --> 02:46:51.110
container hosting. This is something which I am going to

02:46:51.110 --> 02:46:55.490
discuss. Okay. Sir, one last request. Sir, tell us something

02:46:55.490 --> 02:46:58.070
about prompt engineering. Because we don't know anything

02:46:58.070 --> 02:47:01.470
about prompt engineering. And there is no course anywhere.

02:47:01.830 --> 02:47:04.430
No. Okay. Prompt engineering is in syllabus I think. We will

02:47:04.430 --> 02:47:06.810
tell you. Okay. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Go ahead. Hmm,

02:47:06.890 --> 02:47:12.510
hmm. Yeah. Okay. Go ahead. Yeah. Okay. All right.

02:47:17.630 --> 02:47:18.430
So, yeah.

02:47:21.650 --> 02:47:22.450
Uh, no.

02:47:25.650 --> 02:47:28.910
No, no. No. But no. No. I'm going to like, a little.

02:47:29.010 --> 02:47:32.590
Directly. Exactly. I'm going to tell you to find out. Yeah.

02:47:32.910 --> 02:47:34.010
Yeah. Okay. So, you can go ahead. So, you have to do the

02:47:34.010 --> 02:47:35.910
four-character code there. So, you have to go ahead. Yeah.

02:47:36.010 --> 02:47:37.670
Yeah. okay

02:47:40.200 --> 02:47:44.240
so finally everyone i think we are okay yeah go ahead so sir

02:47:44.240 --> 02:47:49.380
i have a question regarding something different so basically

02:47:49.380 --> 02:47:53.420
you have taught a project in our recent classes in jnai and

02:47:53.420 --> 02:47:56.600
after that you have given some use cases regarding that i

02:47:56.600 --> 02:47:59.560
was working upon it so basically i want to understand that

02:47:59.560 --> 02:48:02.140
when you taught the projecting class i was able to

02:48:02.140 --> 02:48:05.420
understand the flow and stuff but when i'm working on use

02:48:05.420 --> 02:48:09.220
case so the at that particular point of time how to start or

02:48:09.220 --> 02:48:12.240
how to approach the problem and getting blank in that

02:48:12.240 --> 02:48:16.160
situation for what would be your advice by doing it by the

02:48:16.160 --> 02:48:19.620
way whatever project which i have given to you right it's

02:48:19.620 --> 02:48:22.660
believe me it's not at all tough it was actually same and

02:48:22.660 --> 02:48:25.640
almost exactly same the project which i have discussed the

02:48:25.640 --> 02:48:28.100
only reason is you are not able to do is like you are not

02:48:28.100 --> 02:48:32.060
sitting enough for that there is no other reason i see right

02:48:32.500 --> 02:48:38.240
how to start the coding in that like logic and stuff we have

02:48:38.240 --> 02:48:40.680
already discussed about the project right even in that one

02:48:40.680 --> 02:48:46.640
there was a coding yeah same way i mean like who can give

02:48:46.640 --> 02:48:49.100
you answer how to start with the coding like the way we have

02:48:49.100 --> 02:48:51.820
done that project in the similar manner like i told you

02:48:51.820 --> 02:48:54.680
actually the no the problem is not like you are not able to

02:48:54.680 --> 02:48:58.200
do it or do it the problem is very basic and very simple you

02:48:58.200 --> 02:49:01.140
are not sitting enough for that that's the only problem

02:49:01.140 --> 02:49:06.220
there is no other problem which i know yeah said enough you

02:49:06.220 --> 02:49:11.500
will be able to do it otherwise you won't okay answer one

02:49:11.500 --> 02:49:14.600
more thing like can i have your detailed perspective on a

02:49:14.600 --> 02:49:19.180
topic which is live coding like how to increase the

02:49:19.180 --> 02:49:22.420
efficiency of folding for example let's say arman see the

02:49:22.420 --> 02:49:25.380
thing is like uh you will keep on asking this question here

02:49:25.380 --> 02:49:29.220
there everywhere but there are certain question which people

02:49:29.220 --> 02:49:32.580
or i will be able to give you an answer but still you will

02:49:32.580 --> 02:49:34.520
not be able to do it you still you will not be able to

02:49:34.520 --> 02:49:37.360
understand it unless and until you are not doing it it why

02:49:37.360 --> 02:49:39.680
coding i have already shown you in a very first i think

02:49:39.680 --> 02:49:42.200
second class right that okay with the help of cursor we have

02:49:42.200 --> 02:49:45.220
coded and we have built one small application as well on the

02:49:45.220 --> 02:49:50.220
same day in a live class itself so beyond that if you have

02:49:50.220 --> 02:49:53.180
to do something you have to do a coding you have to sit with

02:49:53.180 --> 02:49:55.940
the system you have to keep on doing it you have to hustle

02:49:55.940 --> 02:49:58.420
for a couple of hours then only you will be able to

02:49:58.420 --> 02:50:01.200
understand even if i'm going to give you an answer it's not

02:50:01.200 --> 02:50:03.340
going to work for you right this is not how real things

02:50:03.340 --> 02:50:08.620
works no sir my question was about the philosophy i was

02:50:08.620 --> 02:50:11.580
asking because certainly i i'm doing my coding for a while

02:50:11.580 --> 02:50:16.320
time on it is working for me but the situation is that i'm

02:50:16.320 --> 02:50:19.740
getting more dependent on the ai tool rather than coding it

02:50:19.740 --> 02:50:23.700
from scratch so that even even yeah even before you were

02:50:23.700 --> 02:50:26.620
dependent into uh dependent upon when when this ai was not

02:50:26.620 --> 02:50:29.360
there right you were dependent on a stack overflow you were

02:50:29.360 --> 02:50:31.360
dependent on a google search you were dependent on the

02:50:31.360 --> 02:50:36.320
office official documentation right yes yes yeah it's not

02:50:36.320 --> 02:50:40.420
like you are not dependent you were actually dependent the

02:50:40.420 --> 02:50:43.760
mode has the only thing which i changed is the mode it's

02:50:43.760 --> 02:50:46.800
it's became faster more accessible that's it but you were

02:50:46.800 --> 02:50:51.380
dependent even before even like three years back and so what

02:50:51.380 --> 02:50:54.500
about that line that hinders the thinking capacity in that

02:50:54.500 --> 02:50:57.180
case what do you what do you say sorry what was that it

02:50:57.180 --> 02:50:59.640
hinders the thinking capacity of a particular person like

02:50:59.640 --> 02:51:03.640
let's say many i've seen that depends upon the person so see

02:51:03.640 --> 02:51:07.220
for everything uh blindly if i'll just do a you know chat

02:51:07.220 --> 02:51:10.780
with the uh system and then i'll ask the system that okay do

02:51:10.780 --> 02:51:13.940
it i think this is not how things is going to work as a

02:51:13.940 --> 02:51:16.480
human as a developer so i should break down the entire

02:51:16.480 --> 02:51:19.180
problem i should list down the feature then one by one

02:51:19.180 --> 02:51:22.260
generate the piece of the code and then attach it then test

02:51:22.260 --> 02:51:25.200
it then sip it basically so i should follow that particular

02:51:25.200 --> 02:51:28.040
approach if you're following it then it will not hinder your

02:51:28.040 --> 02:51:31.460
thought process and uh yeah so whenever you are building

02:51:31.460 --> 02:51:35.440
something big you have to have like a adopt this particular

02:51:35.440 --> 02:51:37.620
approach because why coding will not be able to help you out

02:51:37.620 --> 02:51:40.980
believe me why coding will not be able to build a massive

02:51:40.980 --> 02:51:43.640
product right so you have to break it down into a small

02:51:43.640 --> 02:51:46.880
small pieces and if you're doing it then there is there is

02:51:46.880 --> 02:51:50.440
no like a thought hindrance over here but i believe you are

02:51:50.440 --> 02:51:52.600
not doing that i believe you are just focusing on the small

02:51:52.600 --> 02:51:55.900
task small application and you're just chatting and then you

02:51:55.900 --> 02:51:58.100
think that okay everything has been generated by system now

02:51:58.100 --> 02:52:01.840
i have not done anything right and then you are this like a

02:52:01.840 --> 02:52:05.000
perception that it's hindering your thoughts somewhere right

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:10.240
somewhere like somewhere instead of building a small build

02:52:10.240 --> 02:52:14.040
big then obviously see your vibe coding maybe cursor will

02:52:14.040 --> 02:52:16.220
not be able to build those big projects then what do you

02:52:16.220 --> 02:52:18.940
have to do you have to break it down right then you will

02:52:18.940 --> 02:52:21.200
start thinking and then you will feel like okay now it's not

02:52:21.200 --> 02:52:23.620
hindering my thoughts but if you are building a small and

02:52:23.620 --> 02:52:28.720
with the chat uh then you will feel in that way okay sorry

02:52:28.720 --> 02:52:32.520
can you repeat that approach because somewhere it was a

02:52:32.520 --> 02:52:35.320
network issue so i was not able to hear the sum of the lines

02:52:35.320 --> 02:52:38.920
in short can you repeat that approach please insert what i'm

02:52:38.920 --> 02:52:41.300
trying to say is that that uh try to build something big

02:52:41.300 --> 02:52:45.680
then your thought will not be hindered okay thank you thank

02:52:45.680 --> 02:52:50.340
you for that yeah okay next uh shiva go ahead

02:52:53.360 --> 02:52:59.900
you have a question yes yes hi actually monica this is sun's

02:52:59.900 --> 02:53:04.340
dp so just continue with it okay okay right so that's your

02:53:04.340 --> 02:53:07.620
one question a quick question see i have done data science

02:53:07.620 --> 02:53:11.420
in there we were writing these llm models using our language

02:53:11.420 --> 02:53:16.160
of python so that still we write for the one i know there

02:53:16.160 --> 02:53:19.700
are few existing but in case i am i just want to customize

02:53:19.700 --> 02:53:23.760
it so still we can write them and use it as per my

02:53:23.760 --> 02:53:26.640
requirement yes ma'am obviously that's that process is

02:53:26.640 --> 02:53:30.400
called as fine tuning okay okay fine so that nowhere like

02:53:30.400 --> 02:53:33.520
you know i haven't heard like you know fine tuning anyone is

02:53:33.520 --> 02:53:37.240
trying to do now no ma'am everyone is trying to do everyone

02:53:37.240 --> 02:53:40.060
okay every across the industry everyone is doing fine tuning

02:53:40.060 --> 02:53:44.920
one of the tasks that i think uh by default we all are doing

02:53:44.920 --> 02:53:49.500
like across the industry okay so this is my first class

02:53:49.500 --> 02:53:54.600
actually after 10 classes i just joined i know a bit late

02:53:54.600 --> 02:53:58.460
but i've just gone through a few videos done some tasks and

02:53:58.460 --> 02:54:00.900
today's class like you know i would like to share the screen

02:54:00.900 --> 02:54:05.140
you're on i installed in spite of installation my code is

02:54:05.140 --> 02:54:08.400
not running okay so you can share your screen ma'am i can

02:54:08.400 --> 02:54:12.260
fix it yes you just need to give permission i believe yeah

02:54:12.260 --> 02:54:15.640
so you can join as a panelist yes

02:54:29.950 --> 02:54:32.950
ma'am yeah now you can share the screen yes see i'm not from

02:54:32.950 --> 02:54:36.690
the tech background so that's you but i am a qa okay okay

02:54:36.690 --> 02:54:40.190
see this already it has been done if you could see so i ran

02:54:40.190 --> 02:54:44.150
this give me remote control give me give me control ma'am

02:54:44.150 --> 02:54:46.230
yeah yes yes why

02:55:14.610 --> 02:55:18.030
not in the command prompt you can run it anywhere ma'am

02:55:18.030 --> 02:55:22.850
doesn't matter i don't need this i'm in the same environment

02:55:22.850 --> 02:55:28.870
isn't it okay so it's okay again it's still still still

02:55:28.870 --> 02:55:31.910
model not far i

02:56:05.420 --> 02:56:14.320
made the last one sudhanshu sorry i'm in the last one people

02:56:14.320 --> 02:56:17.600
yes ma'am yeah okay okay fine no

02:56:31.420 --> 02:56:34.440
no leave your system leave your system and typing okay all

02:56:39.950 --> 02:56:44.190
that i've done sudhanshu but they are success and then also

02:56:44.190 --> 02:56:45.870
it's like you know you know it's not there

02:58:09.750 --> 02:58:13.650
so this is the course for the agent ki isn't it yeah

02:59:48.080 --> 02:59:51.800
so now it will work just pass your api key 401 issue that

02:59:51.800 --> 02:59:55.260
you are getting right so pass your api key it will work sure

02:59:55.260 --> 02:59:59.940
sure i'll do that yeah like in in this we are all uh you're

02:59:59.940 --> 03:00:03.140
teaching about agent ki so we will be creating even in the

03:00:09.440 --> 03:00:12.720
future classes yeah thank you thanks a lot yeah thank you ma

03:00:12.720 --> 03:00:17.660
'am yeah okay so finally everyone this is all about uh

03:00:17.660 --> 03:00:20.820
today's class let's join tomorrow so i believe we all are

03:00:20.820 --> 03:00:23.240
aware about the agenda so tomorrow again it's going to be

03:00:23.240 --> 03:00:25.080
the extension of the same class where we'll see like

03:00:25.080 --> 03:00:28.340
