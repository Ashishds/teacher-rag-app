WEBVTT

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:04.980
Okay, so finally everyone, so as we have discussed, we are

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.400
going to talk about basically MCP in today's class, which is

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.980
nothing but a model context protocol. So it's one kind of a

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.060
protocol as its name suggests. And what is the meaning of

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.620
protocol? So protocol is nothing but a set of a rule, set of

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.820
a rule which is going to allow you to do something. What

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.740
kind of things? We'll be talking about all of these things

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.580
one by one, one by one with the help of practical example.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.360
So let me share my screen. And first of all, let's try to

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.520
understand what this MCP is. And then only we will start

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.380
creating the MCPs in a practical manner. And again, today I

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.480
have created a beautiful, beautiful project for all of you.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.780
So where you will be able to see a MCP not in a dummy

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.960
manner. So I'm going to show you a MCP with respect to a

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.640
real life example that you all are going to use it even in a

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.880
day to day life to solve your own problem. And again. So not

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.220
to just solve your own problem. So you will end up using

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.160
exact solution, which we are going to discuss in my today's

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.520
class in your problems. So here let's suppose we have a

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.280
cloud, right? And we all are aware about a fact that that

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.440
cloud is basically LLM, right? They provide a LLM. So they

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.700
have a Sonnet model and they have one of the best model,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.380
which is going to help you out in terms of coding. This is

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.420
what we all know. OK, that's cool. But let's suppose if I.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.440
I'm going to ask Cloud that can you please try to give me a

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.060
data from this X, Y, G sequel databases? Will it be able to

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.960
give me that data? Any idea? Cloud is the best model, right?

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.400
They provide they are providing you a best model. They're

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.120
giving you a solid like a four day series and which is one

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.140
of the best in the world, especially for coding purposes.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.980
But if I'm going to ask this model that can you please try

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.800
to give me a data from my X, Y, G sequel databases? I think

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.600
no, Cloud will not be able to give you if I'm going to ask a

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.140
question to a cloud that can you please try to help me out

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.280
in terms of, you know, understanding my MongoDB collection?

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.580
Will I be able to get some idea? Or is it going to give me

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.660
or is it going to help me out with respect to my data from

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.880
MongoDB? No. If I'm going to ask a question to a cloud that

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.040
can you please try to, you know, give me all the mail that I

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.940
have received in my. Like in today's. Like, uh, you know, my

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.160
mail ID. So will it be able to help me out with respect to

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.140
my mail in terms of summarizing in terms of giving a reply

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.520
to my mail? No, not at all. In terms of accessing my Google

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.840
seat or Excel seat, not at all in terms of accessing my

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.460
calendar. So will it be able to help me out? Not at all.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.640
Right. So cloud is good. They are good in terms of providing

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.060
you a LLM, right? A large language model that we have been

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.960
using a lot, uh, obviously from cloud. Dave. From GPT, from

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.520
Gemini, from everywhere, but when it comes to, you know, uh,

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.340
providing some sort of information with respect to a world

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.700
where we have a authority or with respect to a tool or maybe

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.060
a kind of a system where we are having only an

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.620
authorization. So obviously these elements are not going to

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.000
help you out. Although these elements are pretty much good

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.600
in terms of understanding a natural language and based on

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.700
natural. These are like, uh, you know, LLMs are pretty much

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.660
good in terms of like, you know, calling some external

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.960
things or, uh, understanding of things. It's, it's, it's a

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.280
good in terms of, you know, providing you a brain in terms

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.560
of providing you a logic, but unless and until you are not

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.460
going to give an access to your world, your system, right.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.640
Cloud or any other model or any other like, uh, this kind of

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.800
LLMs will not be able to perform. Not even a single thing.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.860
And this is where this model context protocol comes into a

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.700
picture. So basically what people have said that, that, uh,

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.020
okay, let's try to do one thing. Uh, we all are surrounded

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.640
by so many systems, not just one single system, right? So

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.580
since morning till evening, so we are using so many systems,

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.060
maybe a WhatsApp, maybe a Telegram, maybe a Slack, maybe,

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.160
uh, you know, uh, some, a mail system, maybe an Outlook,

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.880
maybe a Gmail, maybe a Joho mail. Or maybe something. So

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.900
this is how we have been able to create an open, uh, a

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.220
digital world. We are using our own systems, or for

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.720
databases we are interacting with on a daily basis. So this

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.420
is our digital world by the way, right? So as a techie, if

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.000
I'm going to talk about our story of digital world, so we

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.680
all are surrounded with all of these things and obviously

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.480
it's a proprietary system. So where no one will be able to

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.500
get an access unless and until they are not authorized. So

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.720
it's all basically the authorized system that we are using

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.120
and we all are surrounded by such kind of a system. Now, if

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.260
we have to bring those data. a system closer to LLMs where

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.140
LLMs will be able to understand and LLMs will be able to

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.840
call an action, it will be able to do some sort of a job for

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.820
me just by chatting with these system, right, just by

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.860
chatting with this system, then it will create a wow for me.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.220
For example, so let's suppose I have a database, right,

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.440
inside the database I have so many tables in my SQL system,

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.600
right, in my SQL system and if I am going to ask some

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.700
question with respect to a data, if I am going to ask some

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.600
question with respect to some sort of a collection, if I am

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.720
using a NoSQL system, if it is able to provide, then it will

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.960
be amazing. For example, so if I am going to ask that, tell

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.920
me from my SQL

00:05:51.990 --> 00:06:02.290
system that, that what table access you have, so let's see,

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.730
so maybe it is going to perform some sort of operation, I

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.290
can even try to search table, I can even try to, you know,

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.330
go into maybe a data of the table, I will be able to fetch a

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:17.830
data from the table and just by chatting with my clouded

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.210
desktop which is available in my local system by the way,

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.490
which has been installed in my local system and my database

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.650
is available somewhere over a cloud. I am using some of the

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.870
server or some of the instances, but yeah, so it is able to

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.190
chat and basically by using some technique, I have just

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.410
exposed my database, I am going to show you that how I have

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.470
exposed my email id, I am going to show you that how I have

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.830
exposed my like excel sheet or Google sheet you can say, I

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.970
am going to show you that how I have exposed technically my

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.230
calendar and my MongoDB, so total five exposure I am going

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.750
to show you. So in total in today's class, I am going to

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.950
show you. I will show you a five different kind of MCPs

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:04.170
technically and all of these MCPs are going to be real time,

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:08.670
not a dummy one, not like a calculator example because now

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:11.670
we are in a stage where we can understand a bit of complex

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.650
examples. Since last three months, we all are taking a

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.670
class, so I think we all are that much like mature. Yes,

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:23.470
everyone, yeah, so let's see, it is trying to do something

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.270
for me, so it is trying to, you know, fetch data. Fetch some

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.210
sort of data for me, I don't know whether it will be able to

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.250
fetch it or not, but yeah, it looks like it is trying to

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.970
fetch. If it won't, then obviously I am going to fix the

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:35.450
issue,

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:41.810
maybe I will just have to restart my MCP server, that's it.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:07.190
Let me exit. I was testing the system a lot since yesterday,

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:08.930
so give

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:31.190
me list of list of all the tables from SQL system.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:47.250
Yeah. So it is. It is doing something. So as you can see

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:50.690
that I have simply asked a question that give me some like,

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:55.090
you know, list of tables from my SQL system. So yeah, in my

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.550
SQL system, I have a customer table. I have order item

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:59.730
table. I have order table. I have a playing with neon table.

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:02.570
I have a product table. They are only a total five table.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:07.910
Okay. So do one thing from order tables. Do one thing from

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:14.110
orders table. Show me all the data. So I'm just talking to

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:16.870
my like, you know, database. So basically my entire SQL

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:20.930
system, I'm talking to my tables in my own language. I'm

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.470
going to perform some sort of a query operation as you can

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:26.690
see from my order table and it's the exact data I'm going to

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:29.130
show you. So this is the exact data which I have in my order

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.150
table by the way. Yeah. This is the exact data. Okay. Show

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:43.610
me fetch all the mail that I have received in last three

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:49.580
days. Yeah. So I'm just talking to my mail system basically,

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.420
technically my Gmail. I'm talking to my Gmail. I can talk to

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:56.060
my calendar. I can talk to my Google seat. I can say that,

00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:00.640
try to add this data, that data and I can talk to my MongoDB

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:04.740
as well. So I can talk to any system that I know or any

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:09.480
system like on which I have like a, you know, authorization.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.260
So as you can see in total, I have received a 32 mails as,

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.260
as it is showing me, right? If I'm going to ask. So zoom

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.340
notification, I have received Google account security,

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.220
Google cloud platform. So it is telling me that in total you

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.820
have received like a 32 mail in last three days. And these

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.660
are the detail. If I'm going to ask a summary, if I'm going

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.880
to say that, okay, fine. Reply to this particular mail,

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.060
reply to that particular mail just by chatting with this

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.760
system. This system is going to work and this system is

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:42.300
going to perform this particular operation. And technically

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:47.060
I'm showing you MCP model context protocol. Okay. So what is

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.420
our understanding about a model context protocol? What is

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.860
the definition of a model context protocol? So MCP is

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.980
nothing but obviously it's a set of rule as we all know API,

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.760
right? So basically API walks over a HTTP, HTTPS, right? So

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.160
basically it's nothing but it's a protocol, it's a set of

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.060
rule. So where you expose any function, right? You expose

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:11.980
any function. So over a HTTP and anyone and everyone in any

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.140
environment, so it will be able to call it. It will be able

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:19.180
to consume it without any kind of a barrier, a language

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:22.240
barrier or any kind of a technology barrier. So it's a rule,

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.880
right? So where people are going to hit a particular URL, so

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.400
technically they are hitting a particular function in any

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.340
programming languages. That's a definition of a, you know,

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:37.160
APIs or I can say like a flask API we have already created a

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.200
fast API we have already created. So we have already seen

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.060
those things in a similar manner. So model context protocol.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.720
So model context protocol is a kind of a protocol which

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:49.380
people have designed. So where you will be able to give an

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:55.500
access of your world to a LLM. For example, I'm giving

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.920
access of my SQL databases. I'm giving access of my NoSQL

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.240
databases, MongoDB. I'm giving access of my email. I'm

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.300
giving access of my calendar. I'm giving access of my Google

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.700
spreadsheet. Likewise whatever system which I can think of

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.960
in my mind, right? Whatever system. I can just give an

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.940
access to this. Right? I can just try to give an access. So

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:19.200
the way we try to give an access is called as MCP model

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:24.800
context protocol. Is it making sense guys? Yeah. And like I

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.880
said, so I'm not going to show you like calculator kind of

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.540
example because we are not that new. So we all are now

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.760
mature enough to understand a little bit of, this is not a

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.420
complex example by the way. So if I can add, you know, five

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:40.600
real time tool, I can add 500 as well. Right? And I believe

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:45.200
we all can add it. So now we are in that position inside our

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.920
class. So now let me explain you one by one that how this

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.620
things works and believe me it's very simple. It's not

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.960
difficult at all. It's not difficult means literally it's

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.880
not difficult at all in terms of creating an MCP and

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:03.120
exposing those tools to like a cloud a kind of a system or

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:07.880
maybe MCP inspector or any other LM like out there. So which

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:13.160
supports technically MCP, right? MCP. So MCP is nothing but

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.760
you can say a fancy HTTPS or HTTP request that they have

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:22.180
created just for a LLM. So where my LLM will be able to get

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.860
an access. Yes. My LLM will be able to get an access. Now

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:31.140
you can give me an argument or maybe a counter that, okay,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:36.560
so how this MCP is different from agent then? Any idea how

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.120
it is different from agents? Because we have been talking

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.860
about agents, right? And even agents can, you know, have an

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:46.160
access of a LLMs and then agent can have an access of a

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.460
memory, agents can have an access of a tools, technically a

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.800
function, tool is nothing but a function, right? Where I can

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.260
write, okay, fine. So go and get an access of a Gmail, do

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.840
this, do that and it will do it, right? Agent will do it. So

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.240
any idea guys how it is different from agents?

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:12.150
Yeah. Agents make use of MCP to get the result. Okay. MCP is

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:18.050
a boss of LLMs. Okay. Fine. Real time data, MCP agent can

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:20.770
take a decision on their own. Like they might can also have

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:24.870
an access of these MCP. Yeah. So see agents are nothing but

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:28.570
it's a brain, right? Agents are nothing but it's a brain.

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:33.410
Brain means a kind of a unit which can think, right, which

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:36.450
can take a decision, which can take a decision at the end of

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:40.370
the day that what I'm supposed to do. MCP is just a

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:43.370
protocol. Just like, you know, we try to create an API. So

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:47.190
with the, with the help of HTTP, HTTP request. So in a

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:51.290
similar manner, basically MCP is a protocol. So MCP provides

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:57.670
you or MCP gives you a flexibility to expose any such system

00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:02.410
in a generic way, right? By implementing that, that rule. So

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:06.690
expose any kind of a system in a generic way to the LLMs or

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:10.510
maybe to an agent. So even agent can have an access of a

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:13.810
MCPs. So MCP is just a set of a rule. So where we are

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:18.350
standardizing the exposure, for example, so nowadays you

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:21.950
must have seen even in a latest release of, or I'll show you

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:27.010
even inside my chat GPT, maybe, I don't know whether you

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:29.130
guys have observed that or not, but yeah, today you are

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:32.270
going to observe it. So let's suppose if you will open up

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:36.770
chat GPT and if you will go inside basically here inside

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:41.230
your like a setting and inside that app. App and connectors

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:44.870
option, you will be able to see apps wise booking.com,

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:50.030
Canva, Coursera, Spotify, Figma, Expedia, Gmail, calendar,

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:53.570
contact, Google drive. So technically you can try to just

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:56.970
click one click and then you are going to authorize with

00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:01.230
your SSO, single sign on basically. And then your chat GPT

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:04.890
will be having an access of all of these system, right? Or

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:07.630
what you can do, you can click on advanced setting and you

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:11.110
can try to, you know, make a developer mode on. And then you

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:14.850
can try to even create a custom connector. So where it is

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:20.210
looking for what MCP server URL means I have created my own

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:22.550
MCPs because they are giving you a limited one. They are

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:25.310
giving you a limited tool exposure. So technically these

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:29.090
tools are nothing but someone has created a function for

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:31.990
this tool because all of these tools must be doing something

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:34.690
right. For example, if I'm talking about a booking.com, so

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:37.450
what it does, you can go, you can search, you can book. So

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:39.430
obviously they are giving you a search facility. They are

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:41.410
giving you a filter facility. They are giving you add to

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.030
cart facility. They are giving you a like, you know, a

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:47.150
checkout facilities at the end of this is something that

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.990
this system will give you, right? If I talk about Canva, so

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:52.410
again, you can go, you can try to, you know, brainstorm, you

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:55.230
can try to create a different, different kind of a design or

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:58.370
maybe like a thumbnails and eventually it is going to work

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:01.890
Coursera, same thing as Spotify doing something Figma. So

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:04.290
technically it is helping you out in terms of designing your

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:06.990
app on mobile apps, right? In terms of design. So you go,

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:09.190
you try to select an element. You try to create the element,

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:11.810
you create a project, you create a pages and then you create

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:16.050
a design one by one, right? So every system is like is a

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:18.930
function of something like this is what I'm trying to say.

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:22.910
Every system is a function of something. And if you are

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:27.710
going to expose that function to an LLMs, right? Every

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:30.310
system, for example, I'm just talking about a booking.com or

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:33.670
maybe amazon.com. So what, what amazon.com does, it's a

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.050
function of something. Basically someone has written a

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:39.810
function to search. To filter. Someone has written a

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:42.770
function to do some add to cart operation. Some someone has

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:44.970
written a function where you can go and you can try to check

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:48.830
out. Yeah. So it's a function of something, all the digital

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:52.150
products works in that way, right? So everyone is having a

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:55.830
function. Now if I can expose that function to an LLMs,

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:59.730
right? Expose those functions to an LLMs, any LLMs. So

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:03.590
obviously just by chatting with LLMs, can I say I can, there

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:06.270
is a possibility that I will be able to execute those

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:11.930
functions. Yes, can I say that if I'm going to expose those

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:15.390
functions so obviously I will be able to chat and then I

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:18.150
will be able to do a search, I will be able to do a filter,

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:21.210
I will be able to, you know, uh, do a bookings or maybe

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.970
checkout, whatever I want. Right. Whatever I want. Even I

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.030
can create a design because at the end of the day it's a

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:28.750
function, right? Even this platforms are executing

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:32.690
internally. So every platform has been designed by using a

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:34.730
different, different languages, right? Different your

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:36.470
framework, different different languages. Right. Right. like

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.910
every platform is using because there are like a you know

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:42.010
not just thousands of platforms there are millions of

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:44.850
platform out there so every platform is having its own

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:47.810
language framework programming language way of writing a

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:50.970
code so but at the end of the day every platform is a

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:54.150
function of something so if i can expose those functions to

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:57.250
my llms my llms will be able to understand okay which one to

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.990
call when and then it will keep on calling it and this is

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:03.530
what my llms is doing when i say okay fine fetch a email it

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:06.810
is fetching a email when i say list the all the tables it is

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.610
doing it when i say give me a data from this table it is

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:12.210
going to do that right if i'm going to say that okay fine

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:15.090
from order id give me only the orders which is more than

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:19.250
thousand dollar it will be able to give me yeah so every

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:22.430
system is a function of something and everywhere nowadays

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:26.210
you will be able to see and especially with respect to a gpt

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:30.730
cloud world and even others that everyone is trying to give

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:33.910
you a connectors now technically these characters are

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:37.170
nothing but if i'll talk about a gpt even recently gpt has

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:40.190
released like a you know a drag and drop ui based like

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:44.330
automation so even over there you will be able to find out

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:49.710
that they like focused more and more on mcps right so where

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:53.270
like you can try to create your own mcps or let's suppose

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:56.890
booking.com has created a mcps as a mcp because mcp is a

00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:00.690
standardized protocol just like a api yeah so previously

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:04.830
people used to expose their system by using apis now they

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:07.950
said that okay fine so just do one thing in a mcp way try to

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:10.630
expose it the rule which i have defined in that manner try

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:17.170
to expose it expose your functions and then bingo people can

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:20.710
chat just in a natural language the way they want in their

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:23.010
own language hindi english tamil telugu punjabi bangla

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:26.170
whatever they want right and they will be able to do their

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:31.210
job yeah so this is where the mcp comes into a picture so

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:34.030
previously we were exposing a system just by using our apis

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:37.930
it's now mcps technically what we are doing so for with

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:40.070
respect to a system we're just exposing their

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:45.790
functionalities that's it yes yeah it's only open in chat

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:49.070
gpt uh no it's not just open in chat gpt nowadays many

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:51.470
systems are providing you even cloud cloud was the very

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:55.090
first one so who has invented this and who have made these

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:58.170
things pretty much normal in a market yeah and then everyone

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:07.250
started following it yes so uh fine now uh so here i think

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:11.150
uh we have uh pretty much like a familiar with these things

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:14.430
now what is the definition of a mcp now and everywhere you

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:17.270
will be able to see a mcp in a real time and just now i have

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:20.330
shown you the demo right i'm able to access my database i'm

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:23.090
able to access my email i will be able to access my calendar

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:26.070
i will be even just i'll chat and then i will be able to

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:30.250
reply to my email right because i'm able to access my email

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:33.270
so i have received 32 emails in last three days it is able

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:35.450
to fetch everything it is able to summarize even everything

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:36.450
right yeah and then we have also reported of things like you

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:37.630
know batman star it has never been well this is what lms are

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:44.290
basically yeah so uh uh sir technically we are not using the

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:47.870
apis key yeah we are not using api key over here we are not

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:51.010
using api key because api key generally is required whenever

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:55.070
we are accessing exclusively uh llms for an agent right

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:59.230
because for an agent llm is a major unit but here what we

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:03.110
are doing we have a cloud a right we have just attached so

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:06.810
here if you will go and see so i have attached my calendar

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:10.330
search so basically i have attached my postgres databases

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:13.870
and see what an all access i have given so get a table count

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:16.770
describe a table list table run table these are the function

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:18.930
which i have created yeah these are the functions these are

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:22.090
my own custom function no one has no one else has created

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:24.250
basically i have created that which i am going to show you

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:28.110
that part again for a mongodb so i have created so many

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:32.030
functions see aggregate count delete delete document update

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:35.350
upload insert find list and all those things right i have

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:39.250
already created now for a google services so these many

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:42.090
functions i have created get email details send email search

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:44.710
email list calendar create calendar event update calendar

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:48.190
delete calendar append sheet write sheet read sheet so these

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:51.090
are the functions which i have created basically so these

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:53.510
are just a function i can switch on switch off switch off

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:57.070
all of these functions as per my need right so technically

00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:59.910
these are the function which i have created and in a mcp way

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:02.730
i have given these functions given an access to the lms i

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:07.090
have already attached to this particular cloudy sonet right

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:10.790
sonet lms so that i will just chat and then system is going

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:16.130
to work for me as simple as that okay so now let's see how

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:19.350
we are going to create this mcps and believe me it's a

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:23.310
pretty much easy just writing a function right uh just like

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:28.170
writing a function so we all can create a mcps so let me

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:34.750
show you that part mcp latest v1 okay fine so one by one one

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:36.910
by one i'm going to show you each and everything and it's

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:39.790
believe me very easy literally very easy means literally

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:43.430
very very easy you all will be able to find out for example

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:47.090
so i am going to show you basically first of all my sql db

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:49.770
operation which you all will be able to understand in a

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:54.790
easiest possible manner so i have basically a database i am

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:59.710
using a database called as neon i believe in my previous

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:04.150
class i have used it you can use any database of your choice

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:07.730
uh that that's your wish i don't have any kind of a issue

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:13.250
with it yeah so neon is nothing but a database provider

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:16.890
basically right so database provider so you you will be able

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:20.070
to see or you will be able to get you know free databases uh

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:23.550
hosting over here and you can try to dump our data and then

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:25.890
you will be able to do whatever you want with respect to

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:31.090
those data cells so this is where you are like uh comes into

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:35.470
a picture and uh yeah so in a past so i have created so many

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:38.530
tables over here so many tables in this particular like a

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:42.530
neon database and as you can see so if you will go to my

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:47.130
neon db so i have ordered item order playing with neon

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:53.870
products all of these tables inside my neo db and then i am

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:56.890
trying to hold some sort of custom data so they are my own

00:24:56.890 --> 00:25:01.870
data set i believe this data set But yeah, so these are the

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:05.770
table we have already created, now this is not a point of

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:08.230
attraction basically, right, this is not a point of

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:11.070
attraction for us, point of attraction is that, that okay,

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:13.850
this is one of the database, simple, it is available

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:17.510
somewhere and obviously if it is available on some cloud

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:20.990
platform, so I can go, I can try to connect, I will be able

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:24.330
to perform any kind of operation programmatically, right,

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:26.670
this is what it means, as simple as that, from anywhere,

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:31.370
from any system, right, so having a database is not a big

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:33.650
deal, we all have some sort of databases, right, maybe

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:36.890
vector databases, right, maybe SQL based databases, maybe

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:40.910
graph based databases, maybe like, you know, no SQL based

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:44.230
databases, so we all have such kind of, you know, databases

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:48.650
with us, that's completely fine, the thing is that, I don't

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:51.970
want to come over here again and again and I don't want to,

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:55.170
you know, check these data because I might have like

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:56.870
millions of data. I might have millions of records, right,

00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:59.690
there is a possibility that I will be having millions of

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:02.490
records, so I don't want to come over here and, you know,

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:05.510
drill down into the records and then fetch all of these

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:08.090
records and then do some sort of operation, no, I don't want

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:11.750
that because I am living in a world of AI, right, so

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:15.190
obviously, LLMs are everywhere, so maybe I can try to make

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:19.130
use of LLMs and this is where this MCP comes into a picture

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:24.670
that, okay, let's do one thing, so let's expose this entire

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:29.910
database. Right, as a function to any LLM system which

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:32.850
supports MCP and nowadays everyone has started supporting a

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:36.870
MCP basically, to expose this entire system to the outer

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:40.870
world, now to expose this entire system, so maybe I can just

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:43.870
like a need this connector, nothing else, so I just need

00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:46.830
this URL, so where my user ID and password is already

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:49.810
attached and my cluster detail is already attached, so I can

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:52.830
directly go and I can try to use it, okay, that is again

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:57.690
cool. So let's go back and let's try to understand that what

00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:01.550
implementation we have done and you will be amazed that it

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:03.870
is not a very different implementation that we have done, it

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:07.170
is a very similar one that we are doing since ages, right,

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:10.030
it is a very like a similar one that we have done since

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:13.730
ages. So here what we are doing, so here we have a couple of

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:17.730
functions, so parse db URL, so db URL nothing but a

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:20.550
connection URL, right, so parse db URL is one of the

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:24.770
function I have created. So establish a connection by the

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:29.130
way, execute a query, right, so any query which will come

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:33.090
over here, so cursor.execute, I think this is what we do all

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:37.290
the time, execute a query, execute right, so insert, update,

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:39.850
delete kind of operation inside my databases, so this

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:43.950
function will be called. Now list table, so whenever I am

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:46.430
going to ask that okay, fine, list a table, so it is going

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:49.990
to execute this particular function. Now describe a table,

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:52.230
so whenever someone is going to ask that okay, fine, so

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:54.410
describe this particular table, so this is what it is going

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:58.110
to perform, means this function will be executed and get a

00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:00.530
table count, so when someone is going to ask that what is

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:03.110
the number of total number of table which is available, now

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:06.750
run custom SQL, so if I have to run some sort of a custom

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:10.570
SQL query, now this function will be called. Are you able to

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:14.610
find out any differences over here, a regular function

00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:18.050
versus these functions, are you able to see any kind of a

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:18.450
differences,

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:26.700
yes, and

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:32.830
guys when you are in class, so try to focus inside a class

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:35.450
for your argument and for your discussion, so we have a

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:37.470
personal WhatsApp group, right, so try to keep your

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:39.850
discussions over there, not inside this discussion

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:45.830
and do not try to like initiate any kind of fight, I can see

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:48.250
some sort of aggressive conversation over here, so avoid it,

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:52.010
it will be better. So believe you will not be able to see

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:55.610
any kind of a differences between a regular function and

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:57.730
these functions that you are able to see, it is a regular

00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:00.630
function, right, so I am writing a function to you know give

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:03.270
me a count of a table or maybe fetch some sort of a data

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:06.250
from the table. So you know fire some sort of a custom

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:10.110
queries, normal functions we have written, yeah, normal

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:13.270
function, so in that way I can write hundreds and thousands

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:17.170
of functions, whatever that function like does and whatever

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:19.730
that function is going to do with respect to my databases,

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:22.530
only with respect to my SQL databases I am talking about,

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:26.490
yeah. So this is not a different function, it is a same

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:29.110
function that we have been writing since an ages, we are

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:34.250
writing it, yeah, now so this is like a file, so where I

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:36.370
have written, I will go through these functions once again

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:40.170
one by one and like I said, so I do not think anyone of you

00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:43.310
will find even a single percent of difficulties in terms of

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:48.210
understanding this function. So it is a single function we

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:51.370
have created, yeah, single, so these are the functions we

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:55.510
have created. Now how we are going to expose it, so in case

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:58.630
of fast API if you remember what we have done, we have

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:01.230
written a simple function, yeah, we have written a simple

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:04.490
function and then we have decorated. Decorated with what,

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:08.430
URL, I believe this is what we have done at the time of

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:15.550
creation of APIs, yes, yeah, so this is what we have done,

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:23.030
now so basically and that we try to call it as a path or

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:26.130
maybe a route, something like that, we try to say, right and

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:28.990
we say that okay fine, so if someone is going to call this

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:31.910
particular route, then this function will be executed, that

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:34.550
particular route, then that function will be executed, yeah.

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:37.290
This is what we used to talk about with respect to fast API

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:39.870
and we have seen enough, right, we have seen enough and we

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:43.930
have used those kind of a situation enough. Now here, so we

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:46.730
have created a regular function. Now what we are trying to

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:50.330
do, so I have written a MCP file over here and inside this

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:54.890
MCP file, so we are trying to call now MCP base, just like a

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:57.550
fast API we try to call, so in the similar manner, so we are

00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:02.890
trying to call MCP dot server, MCP type, tool context, MCP

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:05.910
server studios. Studios, studios, server, all of these

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:10.710
things we are trying to call. Now what we will do, now come

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:15.610
down over here, right, so server, at the rate server list

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:19.950
tools, yeah, at the rate server list tools, so basically

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:23.110
this decoration we are trying to perform, yeah, this

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:25.590
decoration we are trying to perform and server is nothing

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:29.710
but what, server is nothing but it is a MCP server, simple,

00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:32.330
so someone has created this library, they said that. They

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:34.530
said that whenever you are going to call the server, the way

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:38.010
we try to call a fast API object, we try to name it as a

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:41.570
app, let's suppose, right and we say app dot route or app

00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:44.670
dot this, app dot that and then we try to perform the routes

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:47.810
on a slashes basically, right, technically a path we try to

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:51.310
give, which we call it as a route. So in the similar manner,

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:54.210
you will be able to see that I am saying server dot list

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:58.990
tools and then inside this server like object, I am trying

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:02.970
to call list tools and then we are trying to say, we are

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:06.590
trying to create one function, right and here, so it is

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:10.310
returning, it is returning what, tool, what kind of a tool,

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:14.150
so tool called as execute query, now what is this execute

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:17.990
query by the way, so this execute query is nothing but,

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:21.810
right, so this execute query is nothing but, so it is coming

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:28.490
from my PostgreSQL DB, so basically here, here I have a

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:31.890
execute query somewhere. So, you can see that. So execute,

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:35.970
write, execute query somewhere. So this is one of the tool

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:38.570
it is trying to call. So someone has defined that protocol.

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:41.370
Someone has already defined that protocol that whenever you

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:44.310
are going to call your MCP or whenever you are trying to

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:47.250
expose your tool, you should do in this way. Similar for

00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:50.650
APIs, right? So someone has defined the standard approach, a

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:53.750
standard rule and anyone and everyone of us who is going to

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:56.870
create an API, we are going to just follow that approach. We

00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:58.790
are not going to do anything else. We are just going to

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:01.430
follow the approach, right? The rule which someone has

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:04.750
defined. Similar manner, right? You will be able to find out

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:09.530
that here I am trying to expose my tool, right? Tool number

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:12.470
one, tool number one. What it does? So basically we have

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:15.070
given a name over here that execute query. It is the same

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:17.730
tool name that we have given, yeah? It is the same tool name

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:21.170
that we have given and description execute a select query

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:24.230
and return a result used for reading a data from the table.

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:28.390
So I have given a NLP description. In English language, I

00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:31.670
have given a description. And then I am trying to provide

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:35.250
what input it will take and then what output it will give,

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:38.830
yeah? Because if I have a function, so obviously every

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:42.190
function, function means what? Function means it will take

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:45.690
some input and then give me some sort of a output. This is

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:48.190
what function does. All the function does, right? That is a

00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:51.130
responsibility and roles of the functions in this entire

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:54.790
world. This is what we know. Similarly, so here we are

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:58.570
trying to define inside a MCP input schema that, okay, this

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:02.010
is the tool name. This is what it will do and this is the

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:05.950
input. So input wise, what it is going to take? Object type

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:08.770
data it is going to take. What will be the property? So

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:11.490
property will be, there will be a key called as query and

00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:13.770
then it is going to, you know, take a string and description

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:18.650
wise select a SQL query to execute, fine? Then parameter, so

00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:21.170
obviously if there is a function, so there is a possibility

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:24.570
that it will accept a parameter input basically, right? It

00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:27.950
is going to accept. So here parameter type is going to be

00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:30.170
array description. Optional query parameter for

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:32.490
parameterized query. So if there will be a parameterized

00:34:32.490 --> 00:34:37.410
query and then here required is equal to query, fine. So

00:34:37.410 --> 00:34:41.150
this is one of the tool access I have given, one of the tool

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:43.830
access. Which tool access? So basically execute query tool

00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:47.190
access I have given. Now I have a multiple tools, right,

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:50.150
multiple functions. So okay, I am attaching tool number two.

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:53.190
What it will do? Execute, right? Execute inside update this,

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:55.830
this, this, this, this. I am providing an input schema. What

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:59.270
is the parameter required query? Okay. Now tool number

00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:02.670
three, run custom SQL. So if I have to run the custom SQL,

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:05.570
so execute any SQL query select insert update automatically

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:10.330
handles query type, simple. And then I am trying to say

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:13.590
input schema, this, this, this, this, this. So whatever is

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:16.750
the input schema format which I would like to give and then

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:19.190
parameter. So what in all parameter it is going to accept

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:23.610
and required SQL. Okay. Then there is a tool called as list

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:27.850
table. So this is going to list a table for me. Simple.

00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:30.790
Name, description, input schema. Then there is a tool called

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:34.450
as describe table. So okay. This is what it will do. Then

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:37.990
there is a tool called as get table count. Now all of these

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:42.940
tools is what can I say it's a function, all of these tools

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:48.700
are what function right? That's a function. Yeah. So you

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:52.520
will be able to see that everywhere. Can I say that I'm

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:55.380
following some set of rules? Because everywhere when I'm

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:58.640
trying to create a tools is a similar thing, right? I'm

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.820
calling a function. I'm giving it the description, giving

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:03.580
its input, giving its output. That's it. It's a kind of a

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:08.500
set of rule. Yeah. Set of a rule and someone has defined

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:12.120
that rule similar to the fast API. So in case of fast API or

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:15.420
any API creation, I had my own function and then I used to

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:17.540
decorate, decorate with the route that okay, go to this

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:20.280
route, execute this function, go to that route, execute that

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:23.400
function. Someone has created that set of a rule. Like you

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.860
have to do a get post, maybe delete, update, insert,

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:28.220
whatever, right? In the similar manner. So here. So here

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:31.780
someone has created this rule for me, though someone is like

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:36.020
a creator of MCPs obviously and I'm not doing much over here

00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:38.660
by the way. I'm just trying to, you know, give a function

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:41.720
name, its description, what will be like input, what will be

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:44.900
the output. That's it means I'm trying to define all of

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:49.000
those things as per the rules that someone has defined right

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.780
inside a library of MCPs and then my work is done, right?

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:58.020
Then my work is done. Okay. So this is how I'm trying to

00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:01.340
list down the tools. Now my MCPs will be able to aware about

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:05.560
what in all tools are available. For example, so here when

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:08.160
you are going to attach, so for example, I'm showing you a

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.580
postgres DB, right? So these are the tool, right? Get table

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:14.380
count, describe table, list table, run custom SQL, execute,

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:17.740
write, execute query. All of these start nothing but a

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:20.720
function or tools. Yeah. Function or tools. So all of these

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:23.200
tools system is able to understand that. Okay, fine. So I

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:26.140
have access of these kind of tools. And these are the tools

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:29.000
which I'm showing you. Which I have written. Yeah. So system

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.180
will be able to understand that. That's looks cool. Now tool

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:35.600
calling. Yeah. Tool calling. So tool execution by the way.

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:39.300
So here what we are going to do. So we are going to

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:43.640
basically execute all of these tools one by one, one by one.

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:50.300
So if tool name is execute query, okay, do this. If tool

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:54.200
name is execute, right, then do this. If tool name is run

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:58.980
custom SQL, do this. If tool name is list table, do this. If

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:02.220
tool name is describe table, do this. If tool name is get

00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:06.400
table count, do this. Else whatever fallback which I have

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:09.660
written. So here at the time of tool calling, what will

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:12.980
happen? So first of all, we are listing on the tool. Then we

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:15.760
are trying to define again with the help of protocol,

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:19.880
server, server is coming from where? MCP, right? So we are

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:23.000
trying to basically say that, okay, so whenever system is

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.640
going to do a tool calling, because I'm not going to do a

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.920
tool calling by the way, right, I'm just going to define it

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:31.800
and given access to it, right? Everything will be done by my

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:35.300
LLMs. So after creation of these tools, I'm not doing

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:37.780
anything. I'm just chatting, right? I'm just chatting with

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:40.780
my system. That's it. So my system is supposed to understand

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:43.580
that which tool to call and then eventually it is supposed

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:47.640
to call that particular tool. So I'm trying to say that when

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:51.940
you are going to call this execute query, what will happen?

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:56.100
So it will try to create a tool. A query, by the way, it is

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:58.520
going to take a query if there is a parameter, it is going

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:02.300
to create a parameter and then simply database dot execute

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:05.860
query it is going to call. And what is my execute query? The

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:08.980
function which I have written in my other files. This

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:12.320
function takes two arguments, right? So like a DBUR by

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:15.160
default, I'm going to give query and parameter, right? Query

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.840
and parameter it takes. So once I'm going to provide that,

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:22.660
it is going to call this one. I'm not calling it. My LLM

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:25.820
will call automatically. But even when LLM is going to call,

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.000
it needs some support. This that support I'm trying to give

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.420
as simple as that. Yeah. So database dot execute query,

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:36.300
database dot execute, right? Database dot execute. So here

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:40.220
technically it is going to do a tool calling in the previous

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:43.120
one listing of the tool. So I'm just trying to say that,

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:47.160
okay, fine. So you have these tool access simple and then in

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.420
a description. So I'm going to define it with the help of

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:52.780
natural language. I can try to give more intense

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:55.100
description. To it. That's completely fine. That will help

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:59.580
LLM more and more to understand. But here I'm going to do a

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:03.420
tool calling. So LLM is going to, you know, uh, create the

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:06.020
parameter. It is going to create the argument. It is going

00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:09.100
to create the sequel query as per the, like a question that

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:11.760
we are going to ask. And then it is going to do a tool

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:15.880
calling. Now once tool calling will be done, so obviously it

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:18.400
is going to execute a function. Technically it is going to

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.840
execute a function. So if it is going to call get table

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:23.100
count, it will go, it will count the number of tables.

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:27.560
Right? Return something. Yup. Return something as a result.

00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:31.440
And then once it is going to return something as a result

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:36.580
into a JSON format, my LLMs is going to do a formatting

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:40.320
because this is what LLMs are again good with, right? They

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.720
are very good with, uh, in terms of summarizing things in

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:45.560
terms of formatting things and in terms of showcasing you

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:49.320
the final result. So my LLMs will be able to understand the

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:52.360
output and then it is going to show me the output in the

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:56.880
way. User will be expecting, yeah, user will be expecting.

00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:02.640
That's it. That's it. Nothing else we are doing over here.

00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:06.900
Nothing else means literally nothing else we are trying to

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:10.920
do. So is it tough guys? What do you think? How does it look

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:13.860
like? Is it like a tough to understand or is it like easy to

00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:20.220
understand even conceptually and practically? In short MCPs

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:23.360
are similar to HTTP, FTP. Technically this is what I'm

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.720
trying to say since the beginning, right? MCPs are nothing

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.960
but it's again, that's the reason it's called as protocol,

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:32.460
HTTP is also protocol, right? APIs are also protocols. So

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:36.940
technically it's a protocol which people have defined for

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:40.700
basically an LLMs that if you would like to give a access of

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:45.400
your world, your world means whatever you are using, maybe a

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:48.380
databases, maybe a slack, maybe out to maybe a Gmail, maybe

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:50.960
a calendar, right? So if you would like to give an access

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.680
to, to your world, to the LLMs where you can just go and

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:57.700
chat and then you will be able to do a task, you can use

00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:01.260
MCPs and this is what everyone is doing now. So every other

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:03.720
companies, they have so many tools, right? And technically

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:06.640
tools means every time you click, it is going to call some

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:09.140
functions, right? They're exposing their functions to the

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:12.600
outer world that, okay, fine. So let's like, you know, uh,

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:15.880
like, uh, use this feature, use that particular feature.

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:23.440
It appears to be similar to what you taught us earlier. It's

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:26.780
not very different by the way. Yeah. I don't think that you

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:29.620
will find like a, that's the reason I'm telling you that you

00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:31.940
will not find difficulties at all in terms of understanding

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:34.820
things and it's very, very easy to understand and very easy

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:37.880
to create, easy to understand and even easier to, you know,

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:40.880
uh, create it. That's the reason I have started my class,

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:44.120
your entire batch with the API because that was important.

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:46.820
So those who understands APIs in a best possible manner,

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:49.460
they will be able to understand many things. And this is

00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:51.080
what has happened throughout the class.

00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:00.680
If you want a result from multiple tables, then how we can

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:03.100
define. So obviously we are going to define joins rules and

00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:06.360
it is going to build a join query. It is going to build all

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.820
of those queries based on the schema based on the

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:11.000
relationship between the schema. This is what we query,

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:18.280
right? Even in a real time. Yeah. Okay. Just a

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:21.060
clarification, but data will be exposed right to the LLMs.

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:24.040
Obviously it will be exposed, right? Obviously it will be

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:26.440
exposed. You are giving an access. So you have all the

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.200
controls. If you don't want to give an access to some

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:31.440
tables, if you don't want to give an access to a, uh, uh,

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:34.980
like, uh, some record. So because the database provides you

00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:37.660
even a rollable security, you have a function control,

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:41.920
right? So basically you are the driver. You will be able to

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:44.300
drive the entire system the way you want. You have all the

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:47.520
controls and this is what we do even in real life, right? So

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:49.280
whenever you are going to create a function, forget about

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:52.520
LLMs, even in real life. So basically you create all the

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:55.100
securities, you create all the authorizations, you create

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:59.140
all the user label accesses and system performs and system

00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:02.280
behaves as per you. Same thing is happening over here.

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:08.210
Nothing different. Yeah. So even in real time, this is what

00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:09.710
we do fundamentally

00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:16.760
how the MCP is different from other approach. So the other

00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:20.180
approach was basically a agent approach. So where to an

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:23.240
agent means to our brain, you were giving a different,

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:25.180
different, different, different kind of a tool accesses and

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:28.180
then agents will go and then it will try to define or it

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:31.040
will try to decide automatically, right? And obviously you

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:34.620
can try to invoke an agent with a chat. You will be able to

00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:39.320
invoke an agent with any other kind of a triggers. Here,

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:43.240
this is been defined this protocol basically over there. So

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:45.520
we were creating our tools and then we were trying to give

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:48.640
an access to an agent. So which was able to take a decision

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:52.180
automatically. You will get confused and you will say that

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:54.940
even this system is trying to make a decision automatically

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:57.780
just with a chat. But here the purpose is different. The

00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:00.800
purpose and the entire tech is different. The purpose is

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:04.020
that, that you have a LLMs and then you are giving an access

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:07.520
of your world to a LLMs. Because LLMs are very good with the

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:10.940
generic data, a generic conversation, but they are not at

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:13.420
all good with respect to your proprietary system. So you are

00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:17.680
giving an access to a system and to do that, right? To do

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:21.540
that, you have defined a protocol. Now that protocol is

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:26.640
called as MCP, just like an API, right? You had a function,

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:30.920
but what you do with the help of APIs. So API is a protocol.

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:33.640
It provides you protocol, set up the rules, right? You try

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:36.700
to just expose it. So just like a protocol. API, you can say

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:43.700
API for LLMs, especially for LLMs now. So these are the

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:48.700
things that we have over here now, uh, basically how it will

00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:52.360
be able to run or how it will, you will be able to basically

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:56.020
test this one. That's a next question that we all have in

00:45:56.020 --> 00:46:01.460
front of us. Yeah. So basically, so whenever anyone tried to

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:05.880
define like a rule, right, uh, what they do. So they tried

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:08.060
to even define that. Okay, fine. So how it will be called,

00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:11.360
for example, like a post get put or something like that,

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:16.200
right? So here they have defined that, that you can try to

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:19.580
create a standard input output, right? And with the help of

00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:22.820
standard input output, you will be able to, uh, like, uh,

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:26.440
you know, attach it simple or else there is something called

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:30.960
SSC, a server sent event SSC. So with the help of SSC, you

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:36.900
will be able to attach it. So here to attach this MCP. This

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:42.500
particular MCP with respect to a cloud day, what you will

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:45.380
have to do. So you have to, you can try to attach it as a

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:48.840
SSC or you can try to attach it as a standard input and

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:52.860
output. So here I'm trying to show you that how I will be

00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:57.140
able to attach it as a standard input and output and many

00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:59.700
tool you will be able to find out out there. So they are

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:03.440
providing you MCP integration, but they're not that mature.

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:06.240
So I have, I've experimented with almost all the tools,

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:07.640
which is, uh, you know, you know, available out there, but

00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:09.580
yeah, eventually you will find out that in a couple of

00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:13.700
months they will be able to get the maturity cloud is one of

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:17.340
the mature system you will be able to see. So where

00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:21.780
integration is pretty much straightforward and easy, other

00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:25.400
system will do the same thing. So they are, they're working

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:28.400
on it and they will eventually do the exactly same thing. So

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.480
here, what we are trying to do, so we are trying to call

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:35.400
basically, uh, studios, a standard input output server again

00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:38.340
from a MCP itself. As a part of protocol, which has been

00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:42.620
defined. And then we are trying to run the server. Yeah, we

00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:46.060
are going to run the server. So technically we are trying to

00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:49.420
expose our entire tool. Our server will be up and running.

00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:52.460
Now once your server will be up and running, which is

00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:55.860
technically a backend, you have to attach, you have to

00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:59.700
attach this server to a client because cloud is what, or

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:03.120
maybe a chat GPT I'm trying to use. So cloud or chat GPT is

00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:05.220
nothing but it's a client right from where we are going to

00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:09.100
chat. And obviously. It should come to the server. So my

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:12.200
backend is ready. This is technically my backend. Now I have

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:16.600
to give an access basically to my cloud. To do that again,

00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:20.740
cloud has defined their own procedure. Similarly, anyone and

00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:23.760
everyone is going to define their own procedure. So let's

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:27.280
suppose my MCP server is up and running. So I'm going to

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:31.140
like a run this postgres MCP dot PI file. If this will be up

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:34.900
and running now, what will happen? So I have to attach this

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:37.800
to my cloud. Yeah. This is the cloud. Only to the cloud.

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:43.140
Right? So here you can come inside a setting and then inside

00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:47.400
a setting inside a developer. So you will be able to see a

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:50.880
edit configuration option in my system. You are able to see

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:53.280
these three option in your system. It will not show you

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:56.620
these three option by the way. Yeah. So you will be able to

00:48:56.620 --> 00:49:00.120
find out a edit configuration option and it will throw you

00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:04.420
inside a cloud installable file and you have to use a

00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:07.260
clouded desktop for now. Clouded desktop for this particular

00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:10.060
like experimentation purposes or even for like, you know,

00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:14.900
using it. So it will throw you inside the cloud. So inside a

00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:17.500
clouded there is something, there is a configuration file.

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:21.260
Yeah. What is there inside this configuration file? So these

00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:26.460
details are there inside the configuration file. So I have

00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:30.900
created three servers. So let's try to focus on the SQL

00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:33.700
server, postgres DB server. So I have given a name to it.

00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:36.720
Command is Python. Everything I have written into Python and

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:41.100
then where this server is. So so wherever this particular

00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:44.780
file is, so I'm just giving a location of that particular

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:48.380
file. So wherever this file is in my system, in your system,

00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:51.320
you can keep this file somewhere else and you have to give

00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:54.960
that particular path. So again, this is a standard which has

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:58.300
been defined that okay. So whenever your server will be up

00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:02.940
and running, if a cursor is supposed to find out all of

00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:06.640
those tools. Which you are trying to expose, it is supposed

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:10.180
to look into this particular file. Then only it will be able

00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:13.700
to capture it. Then only it will be able to call this

00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:17.700
particular path. Yeah. This particular path. So this is how

00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:22.800
I'm exposing, I'm exposing my server to my clouded to my

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:27.440
client. So cloud is my client and then my tools are my

00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:30.120
servers, which I have written in a Python code. I could have

00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:33.640
written that in a different language as well. So now it will

00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:36.880
be able to understand and now this binding is going to

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:40.760
happen in a standard studio way, standard input output way.

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:46.260
Let's suppose if I'm going to deploy it on some cloud

00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:50.320
location, then if I have to establish a communication, so

00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:56.880
that thing is called as SSE, a server sent event. So where

00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:59.860
with the help of some proxies, so I'm going to bind it and

00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:02.660
then with the help of that. I'm going to call it. If I'm

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:05.620
going to deploy it as of now, cloud is in my local and then

00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:08.900
this server is also in my local. So with the help of

00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:12.420
standard input output, I'm able to, I will be able to test

00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:16.720
it. So cloud is one of the tool. There is another tool,

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:19.440
cloud is one of the best, I would say, right. There is

00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:22.060
another tool which has been designed just for the testing

00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:25.760
purpose, which is called as MCP inspector, right? It's just

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:28.100
a UI interface people have created. So where you can go, you

00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:31.900
can try to attach your, like this kind of MCP. And then you

00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:34.780
can try to attach your LLMs and it will be able to, you

00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:37.660
know, uh, call. So basically it has been designed for

00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:39.960
testing purpose, just for the testing purposes, MCP

00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:43.500
inspector. So if you'll go and check my MCP class, MCP

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:46.480
lectures, which I have given, uh, which was a recorded one,

00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:49.600
which was a recorded lecture, self-paced class, right? So I

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:51.880
have shown both the approach I have shown cloud as well as I

00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:54.800
have shown the MCP inspector. It's very easy, right? It's

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:57.880
very easy. Like one single command and one NPX command, and

00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:00.980
it will be able to launch the MCP inspector. And then I will

00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:03.680
be able to call same server even inside the MCP inspector

00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:08.300
for the testing purpose. But for a real time use cases, this

00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:11.340
is the way, this is the approach by which you will be able

00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:18.180
to call it as simple as that. So this is going to close the

00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:22.260
entire flow. Now what I will do, I'll try to share this file

00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:25.300
with all of you and I want you to do the same thing, same

00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:32.080
execution with me. Uh, so here. Okay. So let me share this

00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:33.520
file. Copy path.

00:52:57.140 --> 00:53:00.540
Okay. So I'm going to upload this entire file in your like a

00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:03.020
previous lecture last Sunday's lecture.

00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:11.930
So download it and do it with me and in a couple of places.

00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:14.770
So you have to change your credentials because I have used

00:53:14.770 --> 00:53:17.630
my credentials. You will not be able to use the same.

00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:29.820
So let me share, I mean like you can use my credential, I'm

00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:33.680
leaving that as it is after class. I will disable it. That's

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:40.940
my test email anyhow, not that one, which I use a daily, uh,

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:46.780
so courses wise, your generative AI. So chain. Yeah.

00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:08.180
Okay. So in your 26th October lecture, as a resource, I'm

00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:14.400
adding this code file, download it immediately. Do a setup.

00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:25.710
Okay. It's done. Everyone. So if you can. I will go to your

00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:29.690
like, uh, previous lecture, which I have taken on 26th of

00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:32.990
October, you will be able to find out a file inside a

00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:37.430
resource section, just download it, right? Download it. And

00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:41.770
then you will be able to perform this operation. You will be

00:54:41.770 --> 00:54:44.430
able to call technically my database and you will be able to

00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:48.030
chat. So first of all, what you have to do, so just execute

00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:51.050
a requirement or TXT inside requirement or TXT. There is

00:54:51.050 --> 00:54:54.370
nothing much. Just a MCP installation. I'm trying to use

00:54:54.370 --> 00:54:58.190
these are basically a Google auth. I'll talk about that. So

00:54:58.190 --> 00:55:01.670
Google auth is nothing but I'm authorizing my Gmail calendar

00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:05.590
and Google seat. So to do that, so this installation is

00:55:05.590 --> 00:55:09.290
required not to create MCP, but to create my tools, this is

00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:12.330
required, uh, python.dev. So basically it's been required

00:55:12.330 --> 00:55:15.210
for, you know, uh, giving any kind of a environment variable

00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:18.890
to this one, uh, Pico binary and then PI Mongo. So this is

00:55:18.890 --> 00:55:22.230
basically like, uh, I'm trying to use as a. Uh, like a

00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:24.530
library over here. That's it. Nothing much. I'm trying to,

00:55:24.570 --> 00:55:29.070
uh, use as of now, credentials are mine. DB is mine. So you

00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:31.170
will be able to access each and everything. So I have not

00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:34.110
changed. Even you will be able to access my email if you're

00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:38.350
going to attach it. But uh, what you have to do. So first of

00:55:38.350 --> 00:55:42.010
all, execute a requirement or TXT. Now after executing a

00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:47.050
requirement or TXT, you have to execute basically a python

00:55:47.050 --> 00:55:52.090
inside this SRC folder inside this SRC folder. So I have a

00:55:52.090 --> 00:55:55.370
file called as MCP server dot PI file. So you have to

00:55:55.370 --> 00:55:59.390
execute this command inside my source folder. So I have a

00:55:59.390 --> 00:56:02.690
file called as MCP server. So I have multiple servers. So

00:56:02.690 --> 00:56:05.770
I'm trying to call all of these servers all together. And

00:56:05.770 --> 00:56:07.770
that is the reason. So there is one single file I have

00:56:07.770 --> 00:56:10.570
created because I have created basically server for a Mongo

00:56:10.570 --> 00:56:14.410
DB server for a post clear server for my Google services. So

00:56:14.410 --> 00:56:16.470
I've created multiple servers. That's the reason. So this

00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:19.090
files like, uh, you know, exist, which is going to help you

00:56:19.090 --> 00:56:21.730
out in terms of executing. Okay. Uh, executing this, uh,

00:56:21.850 --> 00:56:25.790
entire server, like, uh, all together. So every server you

00:56:25.790 --> 00:56:29.350
will be able to, uh, call it in a single go itself.

00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:38.590
Yeah. So you have to execute this one. So once you will be

00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:43.250
able to execute this one, then you have to go to Google and

00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:46.950
you have to install a cloud. I believe most of you must be

00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:50.830
having clouded desktop cloud is popular tool. So if you

00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:54.650
don't have a clouding, so just go to a Google and then cloud

00:56:54.650 --> 00:57:00.170
a desktop download. Not a Bev model clouded desktop. So you

00:57:00.170 --> 00:57:03.230
have a clouded desktop for all these machines, windows or

00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:06.830
maybe a Mac or maybe a Linux. I believe they're providing

00:57:06.830 --> 00:57:09.530
you. If not, maybe you can try this with Mac. I'm not sure

00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:12.690
about it, but yeah, for Mac and windows I can see over here.

00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:16.650
So just download it and then install it inside your system,

00:57:16.930 --> 00:57:20.570
this desktop clouded desktop so that it will behave as a

00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:23.490
client for me. Yeah. And you don't have to go out with a

00:57:23.490 --> 00:57:25.930
paid version. It's completely fine. You don't have to know.

00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:29.110
You don't have to pay for this one. So just go do a sign in

00:57:29.110 --> 00:57:32.930
and that's it completely done. Now once you will be able to

00:57:32.930 --> 00:57:36.750
do it, then you have to go to your own profile icon. As you

00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:40.470
can see in my system, click on the setting. After clicking

00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:43.830
on setting, go to a last option called as developer, right?

00:57:43.930 --> 00:57:47.110
And then here you will be able to see edit configuration. In

00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:50.010
my system you are able to see these three server which you

00:57:50.010 --> 00:57:53.130
won't be able to see it in your system. Yeah. You won't be

00:57:53.130 --> 00:57:55.690
able to see and it's, you can see that the server is

00:57:55.690 --> 00:57:58.110
running. This server is running and this server is running.

00:57:58.330 --> 00:58:01.810
So this status is running and here you must be able to see

00:58:01.810 --> 00:58:05.890
my location, but in your system you won't. So just click on

00:58:05.890 --> 00:58:08.150
edit configuration and when you are going to open up this

00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:11.750
file, so this file might be a blank file for you. Yeah.

00:58:11.830 --> 00:58:13.710
There is a very high chance. There is a very high

00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:18.930
possibility that this file will be blank basically for you.

00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:25.870
So wherever your, this MongoDB MCP file is. So just open it.

00:58:25.890 --> 00:58:28.850
Just replace with that path. If this path is incorrect, it

00:58:28.850 --> 00:58:31.310
will not be able to understand your server. Very simple,

00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:35.270
right? So you have to like just update these parts. That's

00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:38.470
it. And run your MCP server.py file and you can start

00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:41.770
testing it today. Just try to test it today. Just try to

00:58:41.770 --> 00:58:44.770
like understand that how things is going to work. Just try

00:58:44.770 --> 00:58:47.670
to digest this thing. This is what I want. That's it. Yeah.

00:58:47.810 --> 00:58:50.690
So that when we are going to discuss it tomorrow, you will

00:58:50.690 --> 00:58:53.810
be able to understand it in a detailed manner. Although

00:58:53.810 --> 00:58:56.010
there is nothing much to understand. In a detailed manner.

00:58:56.130 --> 00:58:58.390
But yeah, you will be able to like, you will be having a

00:58:58.390 --> 00:59:01.330
better understanding by tomorrow. But today I just want you

00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:05.090
to execute it and test it. That whether you are able to call

00:59:05.090 --> 00:59:10.110
your own MCPs or not. Making sense guys? Are you able to

00:59:10.110 --> 00:59:14.890
like, you know, download the file? Yeah. And just let me

00:59:14.890 --> 00:59:17.770
know if any one of you are able to execute it. Any of any

00:59:17.770 --> 00:59:21.950
one of you are able to list our databases, our tables, my

00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:25.090
collections or any one of you are able to access my email.

00:59:26.110 --> 00:59:28.790
Yeah. Any one of you installing

00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:45.890
clouded desktop. Okay. So once you are able to access my

00:59:45.890 --> 00:59:49.390
email or maybe my calendar or maybe my Google seat or maybe

00:59:49.390 --> 00:59:54.930
like my collections or my like SQL databases, just let me

00:59:54.930 --> 00:59:59.410
know. Not yet doing a set of the location one, please

00:59:59.410 --> 01:00:02.590
explain again sir, maybe on more intuition difference

01:00:02.590 --> 01:00:05.110
between MCP and agent. I mean like I have already explained

01:00:05.110 --> 01:00:07.890
MCP is nothing but it's a protocol basically just like APIs.

01:00:07.890 --> 01:00:12.390
So MCP is nothing to do with the brain agents are brain in

01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:16.730
itself, right? So MCPs is basically been called by any

01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:21.070
brains. This is how you can understand means any LLMs.

01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:31.590
So don't get confused between MCP and you know, like agents,

01:00:31.890 --> 01:00:36.010
MCPs, you can like, you know, compare it with the APIs that

01:00:36.010 --> 01:00:38.510
that will be the correct comparison.

01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:46.570
Generally. I have seen that people start comparing MCP with

01:00:46.570 --> 01:00:50.590
the, you know. LLMs. Right guys. Right. Everyone. I believe

01:00:50.590 --> 01:00:53.090
this is something which comes in my, in our minds. So

01:00:53.090 --> 01:00:56.170
whenever we talk about MCP, so we start thinking about that.

01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:59.930
Okay. What is the difference between MCPs and agents? I'm

01:00:59.930 --> 01:01:04.870
like, that's the wrong difference in itself. Yeah. Maybe

01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:08.410
social media effect, maybe a YouTube or LinkedIn effect I

01:01:08.410 --> 01:01:12.250
can say, but whenever we talk about MCPs, the very first

01:01:12.250 --> 01:01:15.390
comparison which comes in our mind that, okay, MCP versus

01:01:15.390 --> 01:01:17.870
agent. I'm like, that's the wrong comparison. You are doing,

01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:18.830
we

01:01:24.210 --> 01:01:26.850
are accessing this locally using clouded extra, how our

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:30.350
agent access, how can our agents access when we are using a

01:01:30.350 --> 01:01:35.350
Langtion or any other framework, same manner you are running

01:01:35.350 --> 01:01:38.450
a server in a local system. So expose that server to any

01:01:38.450 --> 01:01:42.190
other platform, cloud platform, and then call it calling in

01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:45.850
Langtion provides you by the way, direct like a API to call

01:01:45.850 --> 01:01:46.550
MCPs.

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:54.760
Okay. Fine. So first of all, guys, just do our requirement

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:57.860
.org. Txt installation. So once you are going to do a

01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:01.700
requirement.txt installation, then run the server. So to run

01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:04.680
the server, where is your server file inside the source

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:07.240
directory. So there is something called as MCP server.py

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:10.240
file. So just run the command. It's a Python file, right? So

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:13.560
Python, then this source folder inside source folder, I have

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:17.500
a MCP server.py file. So run this one. Now, if you are not

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:19.700
able to see anything in my screen, because I'm not printing

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:23.060
the log by the way, because it will be too much. So it

01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:26.040
simply means that server is up and running. If server is up

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:28.460
and running, it means your backend is up and running. Now

01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:32.880
client means how CloudA will be able to interact basically.

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:36.160
Now to interact with the CloudA, what you have to do. So

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:39.500
basically you can try to, you know, open up a CloudA, go to

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:43.000
developer mode, click on edit configuration, and now you

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.720
will be able to see CloudA desktop configuration file. So

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:48.780
open up this file in any of the editor, maybe in a notebook

01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:54.760
or any other editor. And here is my configuration file.

01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:57.920
Okay. By default in your MCP, if you're doing a setup for

01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:01.020
the very first time, you will be able to see only one word

01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:04.400
called as MCP server. There will be nothing. This file will

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:07.740
be blank. Maybe you can try to use my configuration. This is

01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:11.700
my configuration. I have given you in a chat and you have to

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:14.640
change the location. Your location of this file will be

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:17.240
different. So how you can change the location, nothing,

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:23.200
right click, copy path, right? Our copy related path, paste.

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:26.000
So just change the path.

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:35.560
So this is how you're like, you know, client will be able to

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:40.960
attach to a server. Means this is how your client will be

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:44.280
able to understand that, okay, I have like access of these

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:44.840
MCPs.

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:59.580
So I'm waiting guys, I'm just waiting for all of you, which

01:04:38.550 --> 01:04:40.850
file we have to execute. So you have to execute basically

01:04:40.850 --> 01:04:44.050
MCP server.py file. This is the command, how

01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:53.210
we will deploy this to the cloud, the way you deploy any

01:04:53.210 --> 01:04:57.570
other application. In the similar manner. Just a backend,

01:04:57.670 --> 01:04:59.990
right? So just a server, please

01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:30.700
share desktop configuration. Okay. Let me share this once

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:31.500
again.

01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:39.630
Yeah. So I'll just share it guys. So you will be able to see

01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:42.250
like this configuration one, and

01:05:47.690 --> 01:05:50.630
this is the like, you know, command to execute MCP server.

01:05:50.850 --> 01:05:53.350
It's just a Python file. So just Python go inside this

01:05:53.350 --> 01:05:56.490
folder and then MCP server.py file executed.

01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:13.960
10 projects of MCP project in a. Yeah. This is the, so I

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:18.000
have created that like a, you know, entire playlist when MCP

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.620
was pretty much new, even over there, I have shown you

01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:23.880
integration with the cloud, a integration with, you know,

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:28.220
like a MCP inspector, everything I've shown it to you with

01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:30.760
the multiple projects, not just one single project just for

01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:34.580
MCPs, but technically it's just a function. So if I'm able

01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:38.100
to write a function for one thing, I can write for any of my

01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:41.460
functions and create it as a MCP. This is what, like, you

01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:48.470
know, a. The final conclusion is, which even now we will be

01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:52.110
able to understand so that you can create anything as MCPs

01:06:52.110 --> 01:06:55.250
going forward in no time done

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:11.880
any, everyone, anyone who is able to access any of my

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:12.220
system.

01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:27.380
Not yet. Okay. I'm just waiting. I just want you to, you

01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:32.480
know, execute it so that you all will be able to understand

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:35.180
that in a better way when I'm going to explain you and you

01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:37.520
can, you know, parallel, you can, you will be able to test

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:38.000
it. Okay.

01:07:44.290 --> 01:07:47.730
So, getting by indicator while running a below command, it

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:51.450
should not give you, I think you should use a Python 1.0

01:07:51.450 --> 01:07:54.690
version. That's the first requirement. Second install this

01:07:54.690 --> 01:07:59.010
requirement dot txt, right? So in that particular

01:07:59.010 --> 01:08:03.710
environment and then just run this one, it will not give you

01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:04.210
any issue then.

01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:10.420
I'm getting error of server connection. So it simply means

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:12.620
that you have not installed requirement dot txt. If you are

01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:15.500
getting that error, it means this installation is not there.

01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:19.300
MCP installation is not there. Just try to do a installation

01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:20.720
of requirement dot txt then,

01:09:27.210 --> 01:09:32.510
which Python version 3.10, 3.10 will always like a good.

01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:39.490
Warnings are fine. I think Kushal is getting a future

01:09:39.490 --> 01:09:42.230
warning. Warnings are not an issue at all. Warnings are

01:09:42.230 --> 01:09:47.470
fine. Avoid it. I've installed requirement, run the command,

01:09:47.650 --> 01:09:50.150
look like it is stuck. Nothing is happening from last two,

01:09:50.210 --> 01:09:53.790
three minutes. Yeah. Then you are on a correct path. So see,

01:09:53.850 --> 01:09:56.750
once you are going to execute this one. And if you are able

01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:59.550
to see this blank screen, it simply means that that your

01:09:59.550 --> 01:10:02.150
server is running. I'm not printing a log by the way,

01:10:02.230 --> 01:10:07.010
intentionally I have done that. And because of that, so if

01:10:07.010 --> 01:10:08.930
you are able to run it and if you are able to see nothing,

01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:11.990
then it's fine. If you are able to see an error, then it's

01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:16.010
not fine. So if you are able to see nothing, it simply means

01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:18.490
that that your server is up and running. Now what you have

01:10:18.490 --> 01:10:21.730
to do? So you have to do a configuration means client

01:10:21.730 --> 01:10:26.870
because your cloud is going to use your servers, So how you

01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:31.890
will like attach your clouded and a server. So like I said,

01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:34.390
edit configuration, then you will be able to find out this

01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:37.590
file clouded desktop configuration, open up this file in any

01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:42.210
editor and then just change a path. My path of these files,

01:10:42.330 --> 01:10:44.750
these three files, right? And you already have this file

01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:47.210
inside a source directory. So your path will be different.

01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:49.790
My path will be different. In case of Windows operating

01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:52.930
system, you have to use a double slash in case of like, you

01:10:52.930 --> 01:10:56.430
know, a Mac or Linux. Just double slash. Just a normal like

01:10:56.430 --> 01:10:59.230
a relative path. That's it. It is going to work. But in case

01:10:59.230 --> 01:11:02.790
of Windows, double slash you have to use and then everything

01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:07.570
will be done. Everything is all set. So all set means after

01:11:07.570 --> 01:11:11.250
doing this edit configuration, close your cloud. First of

01:11:11.250 --> 01:11:14.710
all, go to your cloud file and exit. So close it, open it

01:11:14.710 --> 01:11:17.770
once again. So once you are going to open it once again and

01:11:17.770 --> 01:11:21.410
come to the same place, you will be able to see that your

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:23.770
servers are running. The custom server that we have created

01:11:23.770 --> 01:11:27.130
is running. If it is running, means you are able to attach

01:11:27.130 --> 01:11:29.850
it and now you can start chatting. If it is not running, it

01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:32.410
simply means that that your client is not able to attach

01:11:32.410 --> 01:11:35.330
itself to the server, the MCP server that we have.

01:11:41.050 --> 01:11:44.610
From setting not getting an option developer in Cloud AI, I

01:11:44.610 --> 01:11:48.690
mean like Cloud AI is same for all of us. Just install Cloud

01:11:48.690 --> 01:11:52.650
AI desktop, not like a BEV. If you are trying this out into

01:11:52.650 --> 01:11:55.670
a BEV, it will not work like just install at Cloud AI

01:11:55.670 --> 01:11:56.470
desktop. But

01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:06.820
after changing a desktop configuration, now Cloud AI is not

01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:10.660
opening. It will open up. It will open up for sure, I mean

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:13.900
like why it will not open up. If you have made some mistake,

01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:15.780
then it will open up with a pop up and it will give you

01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:17.320
error over there. But it always open up.

01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:30.720
Okay, Arun is saying server is running. Okay, great Arun.

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:34.780
Then try to you know chat with this system if your servers

01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:38.640
are running, right. And then you can talk to my Gmail, you

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:41.540
can talk to my calendar, you can talk to my seat, you can

01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:46.880
talk to my MongoDB, you can talk to my SQL system, simple.

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:51.620
You all will be able to talk to this my system because I

01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:53.480
have not removed my credentials by the way.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.540
Yeah, so anyone who is able to test it, Arun, is it working

01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:49.840
for you?

01:13:59.770 --> 01:14:00.590
Okay, waiting.

01:14:40.450 --> 01:14:43.270
Do we need to create a virtual environment? Your wish, if

01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:45.930
you want you can create it, I mean like how does that matter

01:14:45.930 --> 01:14:47.090
with respect to MCPs.

01:15:04.710 --> 01:15:07.250
Cloud AI will return soon. Cloud AI experiencing a temporary

01:15:07.250 --> 01:15:09.730
shutdown. Service disruption. We are working on it. I mean

01:15:09.730 --> 01:15:13.030
getting this error on Cloud AI desktop, I don't think that

01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:15.130
Cloud AI desktop will give you this issue. I think you are

01:15:15.130 --> 01:15:18.990
using Cloud AI web maybe. Cloud AI desktop never gives you

01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:21.430
this issue. It's a local system, right.

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:28.280
Just a local software by the way. So I don't think it should

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:30.220
give you that.

01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:05.100
Please explain how to add a local server in Cloud AI

01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:10.920
desktop. Simple. Go to your profile. Click on setting. Go to

01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:15.400
developer. Edit configuration and it will like, you know,

01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:18.700
show you a location where this particular file is. Cloud AI

01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:23.280
desktop configuration. Open up this file and then I have

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:26.920
already pinged you this more than five times. Use it. Change

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:30.300
the location. That's it. This is how you will be able to add

01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:31.940
the server. And

01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:47.870
then you can start like chatting with it. Simple. Yeah. So

01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:48.930
you can start chatting with it.

01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:57.140
Okay. So maybe some of you can just raise your hand. I'll

01:16:57.140 --> 01:17:00.760
look into your system. I'll try to do a setup and then, you

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:04.440
know, we can, we can see like what is the issue that you are

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:09.460
facing. Maybe for some of you, the rest of you can do it

01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:13.620
like on your own. It's not a very tough setup guys. So I

01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:17.320
don't think that you should face an issue. Yeah, Rakesh,

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:18.040
share the screen.

01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:24.860
Just I am sharing. Yeah, share it. Yeah.

01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:34.960
Are you able to see my screen? Yes. Not yet.

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:46.760
No. Is it visible? Hmm. Yeah. No, it's visible. Okay. So

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:50.740
give me a control. Let me see what you have done. Yeah. Give

01:17:50.740 --> 01:17:51.020
me control.

01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:57.260
Okay. Fine guys. So I'm just doing it in a Rakesh screen.

01:17:57.420 --> 01:18:00.360
You all can watch and then like you can follow the same

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:03.600
thing. It's it's not tough. Like I said. So, okay. Rakesh

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:07.340
has, I think he has already done the good job. So let me

01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:14.320
close things. Okay. Don't save this one. Fine. So you're on

01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:19.860
JNI MCP source MCP server. So this location is looks like

01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:25.260
it's set. Okay. So this is set. This is set. This is set.

01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:29.560
Control S and then even his like MCP server is running. So I

01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:32.020
guess where is your like a clouding? I can't see your like a

01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:34.940
full screen. I believe you have not shared a full screen. I

01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:38.320
think you have just shared the single screen. Just just no,

01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:42.140
sir. I have a still listen. Just just just hold on. Just

01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:44.680
unshare the screen and share it again.

01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:11.740
Now is it okay? Hmm. You can see some other tabs. Okay. So I

01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:16.720
can see this. Let me close this one. Fine. So here basically

01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:18.340
calling is failed.

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:22.900
This one is just one of the server.

01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:32.260
While exit.

01:19:53.690 --> 01:19:57.310
Okay. Just just try to launch a cloudy. I think I can't see

01:19:57.310 --> 01:20:01.350
your. Okay. Now I can see you below tab bar. Fine. Cloud.

01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:03.690
app it should work

01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:15.870
this connected for troubleshooting guiding please visit this

01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:17.970
this this this this so

01:20:21.330 --> 01:20:33.300
it shows that this is not working it should work log folder

01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:44.740
log for google service what is it started fine system 32

01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:45.900
that's

01:20:50.350 --> 01:20:54.930
the issue it is stating that mcp could not form module not

01:20:54.930 --> 01:20:59.630
found there yeah mc model not found i can see it yeah but

01:20:59.630 --> 01:21:03.550
whereas i installed the mcp and reconfirmed it by pip show

01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:09.450
mcp okay not an issue we'll check yeah so actually

01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:18.060
is my nephew sir uh earlier i told you that uh i connected

01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:22.300
with you with a i neuron actually and i have already joined

01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:26.940
the people to your uh i mean of course as well and he's

01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:34.700
working on the mld i mean machine learning yeah great so

01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:38.160
source mcp python

01:21:39.790 --> 01:21:41.570
version

01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:53.910
oh yours is 3.13 create an environment in 3.10 oh oh Do it

01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:55.150
quickly, so

01:21:57.420 --> 01:22:00.640
guys try to keep your environment 3.10 because generally you

01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:04.920
know beyond 3.10 it gives an issue with a new system

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:07.680
especially like MCP kind of a libraries which is pretty much

01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:12.680
new in a market so just go ahead with a 3.10 that will be

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:16.400
always better. Maybe most of you must be facing an issue

01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:17.880
just because of that.

01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:23.660
So, here Sivananda is saying same happened with me due to

01:22:23.660 --> 01:22:26.700
the Python, so 3.13 will give you an issue if you are

01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:30.200
installing a latest one preferred like to go ahead with the

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:33.560
3.10. These are the new library, generally they are not

01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:37.300
compatible with the new version of Python. Cannot able to

01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:40.300
add the configuration file in the clouded desktop, share a

01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:43.540
screen then we will see what why you are not able to add,

01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:48.940
promoted you as a panelist just share a screen. In between

01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:51.260
Rakesh, so please try to like you know set your environment

01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:55.640
to 3.10 because everything you have done in a correct manner

01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:57.700
so it should work and it will work obviously.

01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:04.500
Just do it and then show it to me once again after Rakesh.

01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:08.240
Just raise your hand guys, raise your hand so that you know

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:09.620
I can promote you as a panelist.

01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:18.780
Okay. Okay, so Elango share a screen. Yes, I share the

01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:22.120
screen. Okay, so you have already shared the screen, what is

01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:27.080
the issue? There is an MZP server, there is a running, fine

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:30.300
that's a warning, not an issue at all. Okay, so you have.

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:35.260
The thing is I try to connect from here, I open this, I

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:39.640
already add the path, but after that nothing happened. It's

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:42.740
not. Go to clouded, close it first. Go to clouded. Go to

01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:48.060
clouded. Go to file. Okay. No, no, no, not this one,

01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:51.980
clouded, clouded, app, application, yeah. And go to this,

01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:54.860
let me, annotate,

01:23:56.810 --> 01:24:02.570
this place, go to the corner place, the corner one, this

01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:06.910
one, this one. Okay. Click file, file, exit.

01:24:09.370 --> 01:24:13.250
Okay. Now after exiting, so I'll, you know, just go to

01:24:13.250 --> 01:24:14.590
clouded, open it once again. Okay.

01:24:18.810 --> 01:24:20.970
So after attaching your server guys, you have to restart

01:24:20.970 --> 01:24:23.290
your cloud at least once, otherwise it will not understand.

01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:26.530
That's a problem with clouded. Now it is showing you the

01:24:26.530 --> 01:24:30.270
error. See. So now it is able to like see your servers. If

01:24:30.270 --> 01:24:33.930
you'll go to your developer. So you will be able to see the

01:24:33.930 --> 01:24:35.490
server now, but

01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:41.580
there is a problem with the server, but yeah, now you can

01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:45.620
see the server. There's a problem. Yeah. So just go to.

01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:51.380
Yeah. So click on logs. Yeah. Open it. Open up any logs.

01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:55.320
MC's have a Google service. No, no, no. That's one. Your

01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:58.620
server is a Mongo postgres on Google, right? Open up. Yeah.

01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:00.120
Open up notepad.

01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:05.520
Let's see what is the error? Come down, come down, down,

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:07.580
down. No, just wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Check the

01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:11.780
server. Started, connected successfully. This is okay. It is

01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:15.280
having line of 14. Okay. No model MCP. I think you are

01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:20.160
running it in a Python 3.1. Three. No, sir. 3.1. Zero. Show

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:21.400
me. Python version.

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:33.160
Just terminate the server. No, stop the server. Stop the

01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:39.570
server. And then show me Python version. I don't see. Hmm.

01:25:39.770 --> 01:25:44.390
Now, like, uh, show me. I think wasn't.

01:25:48.290 --> 01:25:53.430
Hmm. 3.1. Zero. Uh, MCP. Then, uh, do people solve the

01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:54.410
hyphen? Are they going to do it?

01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:11.850
Run the server once again.

01:26:40.450 --> 01:26:44.990
It's inside SRC folder. Right. Source. So Python. Yeah.

01:26:45.070 --> 01:26:46.570
Python. I mean like Python is a command.

01:26:52.820 --> 01:26:59.990
Okay, sir. It's running now. Hmm. It wasn't. It was also

01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.290
boring.

01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:07.720
Hmm. Ready now. Now go to clouding. Oh, close. Walk in. Uh,

01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:08.780
close again. Open again.

01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:17.920
All we do. I exit, exit, exit. Then only it closes, you

01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:20.220
know, in a proper manner. Hmm.

01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:39.400
Same, same issue. It is not able to like. Uh, same issue. I,

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:43.540
I know like, yeah, the same issues, uh, it is not able to

01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:50.100
understand your MCP. Oh, ideally this shouldn't not to give

01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:51.940
you an issue because.

01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:56.060
Okay.

01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:05.780
Just do one thing. Create a one environment with 3.1, two,

01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:08.860
uh, close, close, close all those things. It's the same

01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:11.460
issue. It's not able to understand MCP installation. So

01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:14.920
yeah, just, just to create one environment with 3.1 guys to,

01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:18.620
uh, those who are still facing an issue, uh, try creating an

01:28:18.620 --> 01:28:20.760
environment with 3.1, two, just

01:28:26.550 --> 01:28:29.210
create the environment around the requirement of TXT. And

01:28:29.210 --> 01:28:30.630
then like generally

01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:45.650
the recombinant person is 3.1, zero, but okay.

01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:12.240
3.1, two, right, sir. Uh, yeah. 3.3.1. Two years. Yes. Yes.

01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:27.360
Sahid is saying his path is not correct. Is it? Uh, can you

01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:30.440
please show me your path, uh, once it,

01:29:33.150 --> 01:29:37.410
it looks like it was correct. Yeah. Can you please show me

01:29:37.410 --> 01:29:38.010
your path Elango?

01:29:41.250 --> 01:29:46.690
No configuration file path, the config file, uh, config,

01:29:46.810 --> 01:29:53.910
desktop, Jason, and, uh, yeah. So agent tick project, then

01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:58.270
MCP, then source, uh, right. Click on your MongoDB. MCP.

01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:08.700
Uh, copy the relative path. Okay. Paste it anywhere in

01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:09.760
anywhere, any in location.

01:30:12.820 --> 01:30:17.440
Source MongoDB MCP. Fine. Copy, copy the entire path. Right.

01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:23.100
Copy entire path. Copy path. Just copy the one year. Paste.

01:30:28.180 --> 01:30:33.640
Path is correct. So agent tick project, MCP and SRC. Hmm.

01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:39.190
It's fine. Hmm. Proceed with yes. Uh,

01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:47.500
the space. Uh, yes. Space between his, he has given a space

01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:50.660
in between. Let's check. I generally, that should not give

01:30:50.660 --> 01:30:54.280
an issue, but yeah, it, he has already created a space, uh,

01:30:54.360 --> 01:31:00.920
in a folder. So we have to even overcome that part by using

01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:07.240
some escape character. Elango just do one thing. Uh, so just

01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:12.660
change the folder path. Okay. So don't, don't give a space

01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:16.380
in between the folder. Create a new folder. So you have

01:31:16.380 --> 01:31:19.100
already created a, do one thing, open up tightly the MCV

01:31:19.100 --> 01:31:22.920
folder, open up tightly MCV folder. Okay. I will, I will.

01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:25.820
But again, MCP is available inside the agent tick project,

01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:28.720
right? So it will be like a, there will be a space. Keep

01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:32.180
this one somewhere here. That's good. Fine. Now open up that

01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:33.500
folder because

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:39.820
ideally it should work with 3.10. 3.10 never gives an issue.

01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:48.000
Uh, he was facing MCV model. I haven't even checked your

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.720
error properly. But 3.10. Yeah. Let's see.

01:32:09.070 --> 01:32:11.670
Run with 3.10. Yeah. Yes.

01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:30.800
Yeah. It's always a good practice to create a folder without

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:33.500
a space. Obviously, like, uh, because the space gives you an

01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:36.760
issue, especially in windows, like, uh, Mac and, uh, Linux

01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:40.040
will be able to handle it. But windows is always like, you

01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:45.780
know, uh, painful things to do with the space. So

01:32:58.450 --> 01:33:03.170
show me your logs from your log. Once again, I just wanted

01:33:03.170 --> 01:33:06.290
to see like whether it's a MCP installation issue or

01:33:06.290 --> 01:33:06.910
location issue.

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:13.340
Yeah. Any file.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:21.740
Just wait, wait, wait. Check for the error. Uh, MCP. It

01:33:21.740 --> 01:33:25.320
shows it taking the. Module not found. Yeah. Module not

01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:28.840
found. It's, it's an installation. A space issue. It take

01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:35.660
the fold path. Okay. So from file this, this, this. Hmm.

01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:38.840
Maybe I need to remove this. Uh, I can delete.

01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:48.280
No, it's technically editing the same file. Okay. Click on

01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:49.060
it. Configuration.

01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:00.080
That's it. It's technically the same file. So just paste

01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:01.040
your configuration here.

01:34:04.170 --> 01:34:09.490
Control S. Okay. Close. Exit cloud. Open again.

01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:36.280
Hmm. Same place. So it is, it is taking the correct like a

01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:40.580
location. Argument is C drive MCP. Source MCP server dot PI

01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:44.020
file. And just check whether it's running or not. MCP is

01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:48.600
running or not. Yes. Running. It's running.

01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:55.600
Uh, okay. Okay. Oh great. My server is running. Sir. Amazing

01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:58.240
side. Amazing. So anyone else guys who is able to run it,

01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:00.320
who is able to, you know, test it.

01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:10.400
So in your system, uh, try with 3.1 to them. Okay. Yeah.

01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:14.900
Like deactivate this, try with 3.1 to happy to help you

01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:18.700
count, help you count document. However, I need a bit more

01:35:18.700 --> 01:35:21.820
information to assist you probably agree with the system.

01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:24.880
You are referring to Mongo. Mongo db, postgres, Google seed,

01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:28.660
which is specific. Uh, you can talk to, uh, you can talk to

01:35:28.660 --> 01:35:31.240
my Mongo db. You can talk to my postgres. You can talk to my

01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:34.080
seat. You know, I see it. It's blank by the way in Mongo db.

01:35:34.180 --> 01:35:37.020
I think you can see some default collection in a postgres

01:35:37.020 --> 01:35:40.140
sequel. So we have like a data and databases. So on tables.

01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:45.320
So you can talk to that. Let me know which database you are

01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:47.700
working with. I will come shame

01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:54.860
issue coming, which, which issue. Cool. Same issue as like a

01:35:54.860 --> 01:35:55.120
lingo.

01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:08.200
So anyone else, guys, anyone who is able to run my run MCP

01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:11.820
server and test it. Yeah. I'm just waiting for a

01:36:11.820 --> 01:36:15.720
confirmation. Yes. Same. Okay. Fine. So Kushal then, then

01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:19.280
let me solve his issue. If his issue will be fixed, then

01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:23.200
even I don't see an issue in his system, by the way. I mean

01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:28.700
like, uh, it should work, but let's see what the Boston Mac

01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:31.940
user use Python three instructions. of python in uh okay

01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:35.440
yeah you can use python 3 if you're using mac so

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:45.040
anyone guys i think uh mohammed is able to run it uh he has

01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:47.820
like you know pinged me a message so obviously he's able to

01:36:47.820 --> 01:36:51.420
run it because of that he's getting this reply uh dev kumar

01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:54.700
okay running successfully well done after running server how

01:36:54.700 --> 01:36:58.480
to test it uh okay just chat chat inside your cloud and you

01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:03.500
will be able to test it you can check my email yeah so i

01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:06.000
have given you my credentials my email credentials i have

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.360
attached and i have not removed it not my official one by

01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:13.420
the way so like my class email id is there no no need to

01:37:13.420 --> 01:37:15.440
delete it's fine it's fine leave it leave it leave it leave

01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:17.840
it it's just technically you are deleting it means you are

01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:22.660
removing that json from the json configuration file it's not

01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:27.720
doing anything different yeah file exit and then open up go

01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:43.240
to log you

01:38:02.590 --> 01:38:07.630
this must be the old log like show me the new one i mean

01:38:07.630 --> 01:38:10.310
delete delete the log file delete three log files all three

01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:14.870
no no these three one two three like google mongo no not all

01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:18.450
google mongo postgres yeah this is your log file delete all

01:38:18.450 --> 01:38:23.870
three now run again like close the cloud open again let's

01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:28.600
check what system is able to understand

01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:42.740
now open a developer setting now

01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:54.690
show me the error yeah so line number 14 line number 14 this

01:38:54.690 --> 01:39:02.940
import no module name mcp ok just try to do pip show mcp in

01:39:02.940 --> 01:39:04.540
your terminal open

01:39:15.550 --> 01:39:19.150
up new terminal ok fine pip show mcp 10

01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:26.560
8 v tv 14 m 10 p p version is 1.2 0 show me your

01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:30.800
requirementGHTP i have given like more than for example

01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:39.730
requirement Xuan ext greater than and it has installed 1.20

01:39:39.730 --> 01:39:46.610
which looks good not an issue at all uh but it is not able

01:39:46.610 --> 01:39:48.230
to it's

01:39:59.210 --> 01:40:01.890
just a installation issue it's not any other issues by the

01:40:01.890 --> 01:40:07.970
way so it is not able to understand mcp let me give you some

01:40:07.970 --> 01:40:12.210
solution then we'll force it to install i guess

01:40:38.380 --> 01:40:41.660
this is a virtual environment issue his environment has mcp

01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:44.860
okay no i think he is using the same environment to run the

01:40:44.860 --> 01:40:50.640
mcp server 2 right mcp server 2 is having mcp yeah and he's

01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:54.760
using the same environment like um that's okay now

01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:21.620
do do one thing just uh run this command pip x install mcp

01:41:21.620 --> 01:41:27.700
is equal equal to 1.20 i have pinged the command pip x just

01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:33.360
installation issue if we can fix it means it is not able to

01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:36.780
recognize all the instance mcp is there so take my chat yeah

01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:40.160
it's it's available in chat simple writer command i'll tell

01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:49.840
you pip x pip x install pip x install oh yeah this one is

01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:53.100
not recognized okay fine that

01:42:03.530 --> 01:42:05.630
could be an another issue

01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:11.960
uh do one thing

01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:20.860
let's start a little bit fresh so just close this uh okay

01:42:20.860 --> 01:42:23.260
open up the folder and wherever you have like you know

01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:25.240
downloaded my file yes

01:42:31.130 --> 01:42:35.150
sir yeah copy it keep it somewhere maybe in some directory c

01:42:35.150 --> 01:42:36.770
drive or something paste

paste where it has gone pip

01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:08.560
3 install mcp is equal equal to 1.20 yeah we are checking it

01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:08.560
and we are going to install it and we are going to install

01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:08.680

understand see what you're thinking what will work ideally

01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:15.260
pip should work but like it's not working no no space free

01:43:15.260 --> 01:43:20.120
total size 472 just copy that folder copy that folder and

01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:21.060

loving the one this one yeah okay now uh just do one thing

01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:58.200
go to your vs code and uh open this location

01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:14.720
you had that in a document download for download folder i

01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:17.420
believe yeah this one

01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:26.100
okay now select the environment close

01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:32.480
close just all the things close it close it close everything

01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:38.040
working fine rcc is saying it will work it's it's not tough

01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:42.640
to you know do the installation so okay select the

01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:44.880
environment any environment run

01:44:57.300 --> 01:44:59.320
it now

01:45:14.810 --> 01:45:18.510
you have to change the configuration file no no your

01:45:18.510 --> 01:45:22.490
location has changed right so change the configuration file

01:45:22.490 --> 01:45:23.530
so

01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:33.250
i need to yeah just just change the location yeah click on

01:45:33.250 --> 01:45:38.580
src copy the path src src

01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:44.840
copy the path of this mcp server right

01:45:48.970 --> 01:45:49.830
click copy path

01:45:54.260 --> 01:45:56.580

check once okay

01:46:50.370 --> 01:46:58.370
fine like src inside that you have this okay now attach it

01:46:58.370 --> 01:47:01.970
attach to uh yeah edit configuration it did configuration

01:47:01.970 --> 01:47:07.220
first edit update this file

01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:14.160
control s same

01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:38.320
issue it's

01:47:52.620 --> 01:47:58.020
the same issue of cp solution issue nothing else um

01:48:35.620 --> 01:48:39.880
same thing same thing like uh we'll have to maybe

01:48:41.820 --> 01:48:44.700
what we have done with the class yeah for today we have done

01:48:44.700 --> 01:48:47.500
with the class same thing will continue tomorrow uh but yeah

01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:50.680
today let's just do a setup tomorrow i'll give you the

01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:53.700
complete explanation once again so today the purpose was to

01:48:53.700 --> 01:48:56.300
talk about just a basic of mcps and do a setup

01:49:03.500 --> 01:49:06.080
okay we'll we'll check rakesh are you able to execute it

01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:10.540
maybe you have to restart your system once it will be able

01:49:10.540 --> 01:49:13.840
to understand or maybe like uh that was a i have installed

01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:19.180
the python 1.0 again and then environment set set up but the

01:49:19.180 --> 01:49:24.140
same issue same issue right uh so i'm just uh searching on

01:49:24.140 --> 01:49:29.080
the net no it will not help you much by the way because it's

01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:33.740
just a environment issue right it's related to only mcp

01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:40.460
module right yeah earlier i have configured the fast api mcp

01:49:40.460 --> 01:49:43.020
mcp actually uh to a specific thousand or whatever uh

01:49:43.020 --> 01:49:45.400
variable like last week that is uh gives some time uh issue

01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:49.220
uh do one thing try yeah so one thing is like uh without

01:49:49.220 --> 01:49:51.580
virtual environment so try try this out into a base

01:49:51.580 --> 01:50:00.580
environment into a base itself okay okay the ultimate goal

01:50:00.580 --> 01:50:03.720
will be like ultimate uh uh solution will be uv installation

01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:07.520
so uv generally i would install all the dependencies so if

01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:09.780
this is not going to work then i'll tell you uv installation

01:50:09.780 --> 01:50:15.180
no no I installed it using UV only ok then it should work

01:50:15.180 --> 01:50:19.560
because generally that was the purpose behind UV yeah MCP

01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:22.700
based on UV only it's

01:50:44.330 --> 01:50:48.210
working with 3.13 yeah works with everything generally it

01:50:48.210 --> 01:50:52.490
should work in my system I am running this with 3.12 it will

01:50:52.490 --> 01:50:56.270
work but in some of the system because of some other

01:50:56.270 --> 01:50:58.550
dependency that you have already installed and configuration

01:50:58.550 --> 01:51:03.530
ideally I used to say that that go with 3.10 it works with

01:51:03.530 --> 01:51:05.590
generally every person so

01:51:24.340 --> 01:51:31.800
server is fine yeah close your cloud and then yeah load it

01:51:31.800 --> 01:51:33.320
once again if

01:51:36.460 --> 01:51:41.800
this will not work then we'll try UV installation in

01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:46.300
my system it's just working with pip and I am using Windows

01:51:46.300 --> 01:51:53.560
machine so there is no issue oh! disconnected for

01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:59.000
troubleshooting have you removed other MCPs no sir I will ok

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:03.260
one is running good good one is running then mongodb click

01:52:03.260 --> 01:52:07.680
on mongo this one has failed click on mongo it's running

01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:12.160
yeah it's running so I think there is a click on postgres ok

01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:15.700
there is a path issue d drive c drive see the initial one

01:52:15.700 --> 01:52:19.280
yeah d drive yeah click on configuration change change the

01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:23.180
configuration it will all is yeah guys. So Rakesh I think

01:52:23.180 --> 01:52:27.540
you can try this out in your base environment itself ok yeah

01:52:27.540 --> 01:52:32.360
and anyone else who has pinged me yeah mongodb has suggested

01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:35.560
this one so try without virtual environment it should work

01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:39.000
see environment is environment it's like we are keeping just

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:42.340
our dependencies there but like I said so everyone has done

01:52:42.340 --> 01:52:45.420
a configuration in a different manner so because of that we

01:52:45.420 --> 01:52:49.280
are like you know facing this issue otherwise it should

01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:52.900
ideally work in all the environment every time everywhere

01:52:52.900 --> 01:52:54.060
yeah

01:52:56.050 --> 01:52:59.270
wow it's working working right ok now you can start yeah

01:52:59.270 --> 01:53:02.850
click on click on this like you know beside a plus you will

01:53:02.850 --> 01:53:06.630
be able to see this one beside plus just beside plus not

01:53:06.630 --> 01:53:09.670
there not there not tool ok yeah tool now you are able to

01:53:09.670 --> 01:53:11.950
see your tool right your own custom tool google service your

01:53:11.950 --> 01:53:15.090
custom tool mongodb and postgres is your own custom tool

01:53:15.090 --> 01:53:22.870
right ok so yeah these are your tool so I can search. So

01:53:22.870 --> 01:53:23.030
that's what I am asking you guys if you don't want to do

01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:24.790
this, just start checking if cloud can be run in the same

01:53:24.790 --> 01:53:30.910
environment yeah it should give the table it will work it

01:53:30.910 --> 01:53:35.290
will work anyhow your country to the MCP right yeah I guess

01:53:35.290 --> 01:53:37.310
can you please do the same thing and let me know always

01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:40.990
allow click on always allow the same trend yeah please try

01:53:40.990 --> 01:53:44.770
and let me know. Ok so for illingo it's done next one guys

01:53:44.770 --> 01:53:47.150
anyone who would like to share the screen please raise your

01:53:47.150 --> 01:53:51.590
hand ok sir thank you sir yeah yeah illingo ok guys those

01:53:51.590 --> 01:53:54.710
who would like to you know. share the screen please raise

01:53:54.710 --> 01:53:58.290
your hand Sumit Kumar Sahu fine promote to panelists Santanu

01:53:58.290 --> 01:54:03.690
come as panelists Rutal okay come as a panelist Muhammad

01:54:03.690 --> 01:54:08.690
come as a panelist okay I just added you guys so you will be

01:54:08.690 --> 01:54:11.410
joining as a panelist so anyone anyone share the screen

01:54:12.410 --> 01:54:14.750
first come first let's check

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:23.600
Kaushal okay Kaushal so I just want you to execute this MCP

01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:26.700
in your system guys today itself tomorrow I will be going

01:54:26.700 --> 01:54:31.120
ahead with the you know Google API setup and all those

01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:34.140
things so that you can configure not my mail ID you can

01:54:34.140 --> 01:54:37.920
configure your own mail ID calendar and any services any

01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:44.800
means literally any okay so who is sharing Rutal yeah Rutal

01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:46.980
tell me what is the issue you

01:54:53.160 --> 01:54:59.200
can you can unmute yourself yeah yeah so what is what is the

01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:05.700
issue I tried to install config in base environment okay so

01:55:05.700 --> 01:55:09.640
server is started I just to go and click yeah just change

01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:12.720
the path change the path go back go back to your

01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:16.560
configuration file yeah so here forward slash two forwards

01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:21.380
double forward slash okay yeah it's a it's a window so

01:55:21.380 --> 01:55:23.060
windows is having a issue you know path issues

01:55:39.650 --> 01:55:42.830
yeah remove all the paths this

01:55:45.610 --> 01:55:48.470
is correct one you know relative path double double forwards

01:55:48.470 --> 01:55:52.730
less single backwards are bugs but yeah ideally like you

01:55:52.730 --> 01:55:55.550
know you know windows so it gives an issue so that's the

01:55:55.550 --> 01:55:55.830
reason

01:56:16.260 --> 01:56:17.660
keep it inside double quotes

01:56:21.510 --> 01:56:24.470
now change the path for all three copy to the source yeah

01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:26.330
copy just control

01:56:35.420 --> 01:56:41.540
s yes okay now go to your cloud a exit

01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:49.260
open once again show

01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:01.460
me your log come

01:57:12.980 --> 01:57:15.020
down down down what

01:57:20.370 --> 01:57:27.800
is the error okay so that's the problem so here the Python

01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:41.520
is not this is that's the issue hmm hmm hmm but show me show

01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:45.440
me your config file okay okay

01:57:48.860 --> 01:57:54.480
so you have basically like commands you have args okay

01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:05.460
and you have python so in your system python works yeah

01:58:05.460 --> 01:58:10.440
python is working hmm hmm you

01:58:13.290 --> 01:58:20.450
have args then you have python and your json looks fine to

01:58:20.450 --> 01:58:24.850
me it's working i can access your postgres db lulu method is

01:58:24.850 --> 01:58:28.510
saying okay great lulu amazing it's working in a waste

01:58:28.510 --> 01:58:33.650
environment put will work yeah even that is a post that's

01:58:33.650 --> 01:58:40.610
fine so python ui th1 i can't see an issue in that

01:58:43.570 --> 01:58:44.050
practical

01:58:53.450 --> 01:58:53.930
d

01:58:59.470 --> 01:59:04.370
show me your log once again it it is able to understand

01:59:04.370 --> 01:59:09.650
python by the way so i don't see any other logs logs yeah

01:59:09.650 --> 01:59:11.170
logs logs click on logs

01:59:14.650 --> 01:59:17.630
do one thing delete all three logs yeah

01:59:20.640 --> 01:59:24.580
no no not this one server first log slugs delete the log go

01:59:24.580 --> 01:59:28.120
to log folder yeah delete all three files delete

01:59:30.370 --> 01:59:34.770
all three three files google service mongodb postgres this

01:59:34.770 --> 01:59:37.270
is your log right yeah three logs delete it

01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:46.760
fine now like close this one mcp i mean like close your

01:59:46.760 --> 01:59:51.540
cloud exit open once again now

02:00:05.940 --> 02:00:07.820
show me your log not

02:00:26.930 --> 02:00:27.970
this one other log

02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:39.420
hmm now what is the issue python is not recognized as an

02:00:39.420 --> 02:00:47.620
intellectual command operable batch file okay fine so that

02:00:47.620 --> 02:00:50.060
is the issue okay

02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:05.380
go to open up your cmd type

02:01:08.360 --> 02:01:09.820
python hmm

02:01:15.670 --> 02:01:17.310
it is able to recognize

02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:31.780
environment no no that's fine it is able to recognize python

02:01:31.780 --> 02:01:35.820
and means it must be set in a environment otherwise you can

02:01:35.820 --> 02:01:38.840
you can cross check your path but yeah i mean like if it is

02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:43.700
showing in cmd it should be it is showing me now so maybe

02:01:43.700 --> 02:01:47.900
you can you can or open up your like you know cloud sorry

02:01:47.900 --> 02:01:51.640
sorry just do one thing open up your cloud in android mode

02:01:51.640 --> 02:01:56.570
close cloudy yeah exit fine

02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:03.600
now open up one second no no no not directly not not through

02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:09.400
this uh icon close it close it close it hmm search cloudy

02:02:12.570 --> 02:02:15.390
now yeah run as administrator hmm

02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:28.800
now no issue it simply means it's working go to developer

02:02:38.620 --> 02:02:43.260
failed failed here as well see try user root download this

02:02:43.260 --> 02:02:44.400
this this this yeah

02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:06.860
it must be same issue python it is not able to or error i

02:03:06.860 --> 02:03:12.780
can see like a spawn python e so what is the error so error

02:03:12.780 --> 02:03:14.260
is a

02:03:16.790 --> 02:03:17.170
a

02:03:22.220 --> 02:03:22.800
e

02:03:26.670 --> 02:03:33.310
no ent a check your path once just check your path just

02:03:33.310 --> 02:03:38.890
check your path check your path once where i need to check

02:03:38.890 --> 02:03:43.070
uh environment variable okay

02:04:03.290 --> 02:04:09.970
python path is not set okay so set your python path then so

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:18.020
wherever you have python so you maybe you can just check

02:04:18.020 --> 02:04:18.660
where python

02:04:32.260 --> 02:04:38.180
no no leave it leave it leave it like root anaconda and you

02:04:38.180 --> 02:04:44.460
have a python uh three over there right generally we give

02:04:44.460 --> 02:04:51.340
till bin hmm anaconda three click on okay inside

02:04:56.340 --> 02:05:03.000
scripts only python that exe files yeah so you are trying to

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:06.080
call from anaconda that is not an ideal approach i would say

02:05:06.500 --> 02:05:10.440
so you must have installed a python independent version uh

02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:16.540
that that path you are supposed to set i mean you can you

02:05:16.540 --> 02:05:19.240
can try installing once again so go to like google try to

02:05:19.240 --> 02:05:22.660
search for python install it it will work so it's just a

02:05:22.660 --> 02:05:26.380
python like a issue because cloud is not accessing your of

02:05:26.380 --> 02:05:29.260
your environment so basically it is looking for a python

02:05:29.260 --> 02:05:34.260
from your system itself um that's the issue basically your

02:05:34.260 --> 02:05:38.080
client your server is fine everything is working okay

02:05:40.900 --> 02:05:47.500
yeah just just download anything like three nine 3.9 and set

02:05:47.500 --> 02:05:51.860
that path it will it will ask you for the path setting at

02:05:51.860 --> 02:05:52.940
the time of installation itself

02:06:04.260 --> 02:06:09.080
yeah hello hi sir yeah just a minute just a minute i'll come

02:06:09.080 --> 02:06:10.300
now so

02:06:12.980 --> 02:06:14.240
yeah

02:06:24.610 --> 02:06:27.210
mahesa abhishek basically it will work but his server is

02:06:27.210 --> 02:06:31.470
running fine his client is not able to identify you know

02:06:33.870 --> 02:06:36.810
yeah i guess please tell me um you were saying something

02:06:37.370 --> 02:06:41.310
actually now it's working but it's not related to actually

02:06:41.310 --> 02:06:48.110
base environment you can see if allow me to share this yeah

02:06:48.110 --> 02:06:49.950
you can share the screen multiple people can share screens

02:06:49.950 --> 02:06:54.030
simultaneously i can see everyone everyone can resolve that

02:06:54.030 --> 02:06:58.670
issue yeah okay within the path where we have set now we

02:06:58.670 --> 02:07:05.030
have also mentioned the python python yes yeah yeah okay so

02:07:05.030 --> 02:07:07.430
you are saying that okay fine so set a python path as well

02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:11.010
and then even that is a good approach because it will be

02:07:11.010 --> 02:07:13.730
looking for at the end of the day python file itself so

02:07:13.730 --> 02:07:17.390
maybe like a root l see i think you are able to see rakesh's

02:07:17.390 --> 02:07:21.590
screen right yeah yeah so see what rakesh has done and again

02:07:21.590 --> 02:07:23.710
this is the correct approach i would say so wherever your

02:07:23.710 --> 02:07:26.650
see at the end of the day set system is looking for client

02:07:26.650 --> 02:07:29.610
is looking for basically your exe file python or exe file

02:07:29.610 --> 02:07:34.150
right hard code it i mean like ideally we should not do it

02:07:34.150 --> 02:07:37.870
because uh generally like it will take it from a system

02:07:37.870 --> 02:07:41.330
configuration itself uh but yeah so if it is not working if

02:07:41.330 --> 02:07:44.750
it is not able to find python or some other libraries then

02:07:44.750 --> 02:07:47.770
ultimate approach is to like hard code it but again ideally

02:07:47.770 --> 02:07:50.590
it's not a good approach because if i'm bringing this entire

02:07:50.590 --> 02:07:54.410
solution to a server to a cloud i can't go ahead and set a

02:07:54.410 --> 02:07:57.090
path everywhere it should always pick from the environment

02:07:57.090 --> 02:08:01.050
variable but yeah you can you can do it maybe you can ping

02:08:01.050 --> 02:08:04.130
this rakesh to everyone and they will just like you know

02:08:04.130 --> 02:08:07.450
replace with their own path so guys wherever you have a

02:08:07.450 --> 02:08:10.150
python.exe you must be having multiple environment right not

02:08:10.150 --> 02:08:12.490
just one environment maybe 10 environment in every

02:08:12.490 --> 02:08:15.390
environment you must be having a python.exe file copy paste

02:08:15.390 --> 02:08:19.650
simple from any environment it just looks it will be looking

02:08:19.650 --> 02:08:22.950
for this exe that's it doesn't matter which environment and

02:08:22.950 --> 02:08:30.730
what like exe and uh one question here sir can we set if

02:08:30.730 --> 02:08:35.330
else condition type of things that if the server mcp is not

02:08:35.330 --> 02:08:39.870
found then we can go for the hard coded and obviously we can

02:08:39.870 --> 02:08:42.630
go see at the end of the day we are doing nothing mcp is

02:08:42.630 --> 02:08:45.790
what mcp is trying to call technically your function right

02:08:45.790 --> 02:08:50.110
so if like this function is not giving you the expected

02:08:50.110 --> 02:08:54.110
output on that we can always write a condition and okay fine

02:08:54.110 --> 02:08:57.950
so like uh go for the fallback intent or go for the fallback

02:08:57.950 --> 02:09:02.050
mechanism where where we can put the conditions like this in

02:09:02.050 --> 02:09:06.170
your mcp server itself so mcp server where you are calling

02:09:06.170 --> 02:09:09.410
it right where you are calling your uh entire servers yeah

02:09:10.590 --> 02:09:15.310
so let's talk uh tool calling tool calling so in a return

02:09:15.310 --> 02:09:17.050
itself you can try to modify it

02:09:20.190 --> 02:09:24.690
understood we'll try we'll try this yeah tool calling here

02:09:24.690 --> 02:09:28.390
itself right that if this is if this is going to work so

02:09:28.390 --> 02:09:31.030
always you are you can write a condition on your like a

02:09:31.030 --> 02:09:35.310
result basically so you know but here sir we are not

02:09:35.310 --> 02:09:39.450
actually once we connect with the mcp then only we can come

02:09:39.450 --> 02:09:44.650
here so i just wanted to set the path where we can give the

02:09:44.650 --> 02:09:49.290
hard coded on that on that place we wanted to make it

02:09:49.290 --> 02:09:54.370
dynamic if the dynamic file is not uh from the i mean a

02:09:54.370 --> 02:09:58.210
right path then we can go for the hard coded that type of no

02:09:58.210 --> 02:10:01.550
no no that that you can't do basically so see mcp

02:10:01.550 --> 02:10:04.110
technically means that that you are trying to give a

02:10:04.110 --> 02:10:08.410
functional access of your system to uh basically your like

02:10:08.410 --> 02:10:15.520
you know mcp tools so that is that is not possible after

02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:18.980
calling mcp so yes you can handle with uh you know custom

02:10:18.980 --> 02:10:23.280
queries uh-huh okay so fine for our case it's working even

02:10:23.280 --> 02:10:26.560
for root l i believe i believe it will work uh kaushal what

02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:30.280
is your issue antonu samit what is your issue i'm audible

so our case is done root l so please try to follow uh maybe

02:10:40.740 --> 02:10:44.360
do a new installation or set a path or maybe follow our

02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:48.340
rakesh approach yeah i have

environment no

02:13:54.900 --> 02:14:01.050
so just open up a terminal inside your uh you know vs code

02:14:01.050 --> 02:14:03.430
itself yeah vs code just

02:14:06.340 --> 02:14:07.580
inside the base environment inside vs code just open up

02:14:07.580 --> 02:14:11.090
terminal fine

02:14:15.970 --> 02:14:19.930
no no need to activate uh this environment just come to the

02:14:19.930 --> 02:14:20.370
base environment

02:14:26.810 --> 02:14:29.490
install the common or txt show

02:14:55.440 --> 02:14:57.100
me python version 3

.88 change

02:15:32.440 --> 02:15:36.980
this environment go to some environment where you have 3.10

02:15:36.980 --> 02:15:44.240
or something create an environment of 3.10 hmm fine go to

02:15:44.240 --> 02:15:45.440
that i'm

02:15:47.620 --> 02:15:48.980
creating an environment with

02:15:57.220 --> 02:15:59.720
in between so we can check

02:16:07.570 --> 02:16:10.150

02:17:07.260 --> 02:17:10.680
i i can look into it one by one okay so now i can see

02:17:10.680 --> 02:17:14.060
dhruv's screen so dhruv what is the issue uh so dhruv sir

02:17:14.060 --> 02:17:19.740
just i'm not able to run so basically i have done all these

02:17:19.740 --> 02:17:27.640
things and i have certain text this file and all also so

02:17:27.640 --> 02:17:31.320
this second time i was trying first time this was doing some

02:17:31.320 --> 02:17:34.760
python error then i again did all these things but now i'm

02:17:34.760 --> 02:17:39.020
not able to run it exactly like how to do that like uh user

02:17:39.020 --> 02:17:42.800
apple document okay see there is a problem with your folder

02:17:42.800 --> 02:17:46.960
location as well see there is a ai dash this uh you know so

02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:51.500
spaces between the folder location and that always creates

02:17:51.500 --> 02:17:54.780
an issue so just make sure that whenever you are creating a

02:17:54.780 --> 02:17:59.520
folder there should not be an space between the this one uh

02:17:59.520 --> 02:18:03.680
okay so i i just copy and pasted the path is still this

02:18:03.680 --> 02:18:07.700
might be the same so right uh yeah just just remove remove

02:18:07.700 --> 02:18:10.880
this one yeah this this will be the issue and this is the

02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:13.800
issue because i can see your folder name is like pretty much

02:18:13.880 --> 02:18:16.920
scattered it's not like uh you know connected at all there

02:18:16.920 --> 02:18:22.030
is no underscore nothing there is a space in between okay so

02:18:22.030 --> 02:18:24.590
just type copy paste it from this particular path and just

02:18:24.590 --> 02:18:27.450
type paste got it got it got it so the base folder that you

02:18:27.450 --> 02:18:29.610
are using for a development right so that itself is having

02:18:29.610 --> 02:18:34.670
like a spaces in between try to handle that and i believe it

02:18:34.670 --> 02:18:37.530
will be it will be working there is no issue i can see apart

02:18:37.530 --> 02:18:42.190
from that okay then let me again try yeah try this out find

02:18:42.190 --> 02:18:46.770
group uh so next is basically dhamu yeah dhamu what is the

02:18:46.770 --> 02:18:48.070
issue i can see the screen

02:18:53.110 --> 02:18:58.010
sorry download this one sir by running this i am getting

02:18:58.010 --> 02:19:05.890
that error one now f drive and then d drive okay actually i

02:19:05.890 --> 02:19:10.990
am opening this one in f f drive sir no no copy the path

02:19:10.990 --> 02:19:17.020
just click on mcp server copy the path click on mcp server

02:19:17.020 --> 02:19:21.780
and copy the path so give me the remote control so

02:19:38.580 --> 02:19:41.880
somewhere you are giving d drive somewhere you are giving f

02:19:41.880 --> 02:19:42.300
drive

02:19:49.360 --> 02:19:52.800
freeze that is less yeah let's see that

so this is fine

02:21:00.430 --> 02:21:06.450

you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. I can see your screen as

02:28:03.540 --> 02:28:07.640
well. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm getting this module not found data.

02:28:07.900 --> 02:28:13.920
Which one? Show me. Oh, okay. MCP. Fine. Close this one.

02:28:17.580 --> 02:28:21.660
Open up your terminal. Just run this into a base

02:28:21.660 --> 02:28:23.740
environment. Change the environment. Use the base

02:28:23.740 --> 02:28:23.960
environment.

02:28:42.600 --> 02:28:44.340
Now pip install hyphen R. Yeah.

02:29:40.900 --> 02:29:44.720
Yeah. So it is completed. So I'll just run this MCP server

02:29:44.720 --> 02:29:48.400
to the pipeline. Oh yes. Yeah. So MCP some other pipe ideas.

02:29:53.210 --> 02:29:57.030
So guys, all of you are enjoying these kinds of lectures or

02:29:57.030 --> 02:29:59.270
so they go in more theoretical manner. What would you like?

02:29:59.370 --> 02:30:03.210
Like, so I go in a more practical or theoretical. So what is

02:30:03.210 --> 02:30:06.210
your opinion? I'm unsure. I didn't think a combination of

02:30:06.210 --> 02:30:11.830
both. It's really good. I mean, like, it's very diplomatic

02:30:11.830 --> 02:30:16.250
sentence. I mean, yeah, I think practical thing is, really

02:30:16.250 --> 02:30:19.610
great so only thing that if the theoretical part is also

02:30:19.610 --> 02:30:22.590
will be little in depth so I think that will be also

02:30:22.590 --> 02:30:25.470
helpful. There is not much theory in these things I mean

02:30:25.470 --> 02:30:30.410
like that's like I have simply given you analogy right so if

02:30:30.410 --> 02:30:36.190
there is you know like a you understand basically APIs so

02:30:36.190 --> 02:30:39.910
parallel to that there is MCPs APIs also protocol this is

02:30:39.910 --> 02:30:43.110
also protocol so this is a protocol where by which you can

02:30:43.110 --> 02:30:45.970
give an access to LLMs and more and more you will be able to

02:30:45.970 --> 02:30:49.110
understand tomorrow. I mean like it's not an algorithm right

02:30:49.110 --> 02:30:52.670
it's just a system thing so wherever algorithm comes into a

02:30:52.670 --> 02:30:57.890
picture I think we should talk more about a mathematics we

02:30:57.890 --> 02:31:01.970
should talk more about theory but if it is not an algorithm

02:31:02.650 --> 02:31:08.610
if it is something which we have to build then theory

02:31:08.610 --> 02:31:11.790
believe me if I am going to teach you a theory and then if I

02:31:11.790 --> 02:31:14.170
am going to give you example of calculator right that how

02:31:14.170 --> 02:31:18.130
you can call a calculator function into your MCP you will

02:31:18.130 --> 02:31:21.950
feel pissed off believe me yeah yeah no I was talking about

02:31:21.950 --> 02:31:25.290
like you told about that LoRa part the mathematical how the

02:31:25.290 --> 02:31:29.490
re-ranking. Yeah LoRa and Quora part right yes yeah so in

02:31:29.490 --> 02:31:31.990
those kind of a lecture so obviously we should explore more

02:31:31.990 --> 02:31:36.990
and more theory that I agree yeah that I truly agree so

02:31:36.990 --> 02:31:39.230
which I have already covered in some of my lectures so

02:31:39.230 --> 02:31:43.990
that's the reason you know out of laziness you can say it's

02:31:43.990 --> 02:31:46.850
a live lecture right so some day your mentor feel good some

02:31:46.850 --> 02:31:50.970
day your mentor feel bad so you know we just talk about the

02:31:50.970 --> 02:31:54.830
theory and practical sometimes so this is how things happen

02:31:54.830 --> 02:31:57.450
I think practical is quite better approach likewise code

02:31:57.450 --> 02:32:01.510
walkthrough yeah exactly see if you understand something in

02:32:01.510 --> 02:32:05.510
a practical manner and overall like a theory if we

02:32:05.510 --> 02:32:08.770
understand believe me if someone is going to ask you a in

02:32:08.770 --> 02:32:11.890
depth of theory automatically you will be able to explain

02:32:11.890 --> 02:32:14.570
you will be able to relate because unless and until you are

02:32:14.570 --> 02:32:17.870
not able to see something in practical so for example if I'm

02:32:17.870 --> 02:32:21.950
going to give you a one hour definition for MCPs right but

02:32:21.950 --> 02:32:25.190
if I'm not going to show you a real practical things that

02:32:25.190 --> 02:32:27.830
how you will be able to communicate with any of your system

02:32:27.830 --> 02:32:32.370
it's of no use I mean like just by knowing a definition what

02:32:32.370 --> 02:32:36.050
anyone can do nothing yeah I think it should work Himanshu

02:32:36.050 --> 02:32:39.870
for you yeah yeah so maybe you can check you can just click

02:32:39.870 --> 02:32:42.450
on like a button beside the plus that you have over here

02:32:43.650 --> 02:32:46.790
just beside the no no the next one next one the beside plus

02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:51.170
yeah the next one next next button next yeah see you are

02:32:51.170 --> 02:32:54.590
able to see your server right mongo postgres and this is

02:32:55.030 --> 02:32:58.090
then it's working I believe so it was just an environment

02:32:58.090 --> 02:33:03.110
thing so base environment yes yes yes yeah now you can now

02:33:03.110 --> 02:33:07.170
you can start chatting with my system sure sure I'll do that

02:33:07.170 --> 02:33:12.330
yeah yeah yeah thank you yeah thanks okay so Vansh and

02:33:12.330 --> 02:33:18.790
Rakesh yeah tell me what is what is like the your issue even

02:33:18.790 --> 02:33:23.530
though we have implemented these things but I wanted to ask

02:33:23.530 --> 02:33:29.070
the one question that with the help of fine tuning we also

02:33:30.110 --> 02:33:34.370
we are asking the to the LLM for our specific organization

02:33:34.370 --> 02:33:39.350
if you are fine tuning with our organization right and with

02:33:39.350 --> 02:33:42.210
the help of MCP as well we are doing the same thing like no

02:33:42.210 --> 02:33:45.410
no no no see fine tuning means what fine tuning means you

02:33:45.410 --> 02:33:49.850
are changing a model weight yeah right this is what we have

02:33:49.850 --> 02:33:52.530
done in last classes and then we are deploying a model so

02:33:52.530 --> 02:33:56.110
technically in terms of fine tuning we are building our own

02:33:56.110 --> 02:34:00.810
new model correct yeah LLMs or you can say precisely LLMs we

02:34:00.810 --> 02:34:04.410
are trying to build right with respect to MCPs what you have

02:34:04.410 --> 02:34:06.990
done so now you are able to access what you are able to

02:34:06.990 --> 02:34:10.110
access my database sql database you are able to access my

02:34:10.110 --> 02:34:13.290
mongo db you are able to access my mail id you are able to

02:34:13.290 --> 02:34:15.690
access my calendar and you are able to access my google seat

02:34:15.690 --> 02:34:19.850
right five entities you are able to access today itself just

02:34:19.850 --> 02:34:24.450
with the help of MCPs so MCPs are nothing so basically MCP

02:34:24.450 --> 02:34:28.230
is a protocol over there we are not providing LLMs we are

02:34:28.230 --> 02:34:31.710
creating MCPs means we are creating a function technically

02:34:31.710 --> 02:34:34.410
those functions nothing but a function which is able to

02:34:34.410 --> 02:34:37.750
access some of my system and then we are attaching those

02:34:37.750 --> 02:34:41.810
function to a cloud a means what cloud a cloud is having

02:34:41.810 --> 02:34:47.430
which model sonet right LLM model so we are giving that to

02:34:47.430 --> 02:34:51.390
my model that okay take my system access so whenever I have

02:34:51.390 --> 02:34:55.210
to expose my system where I can chat so now if I have to do

02:34:55.210 --> 02:34:58.130
any kind of research with respect to my database or data or

02:34:58.130 --> 02:35:00.310
maybe if I have to do some sort of insert update operation

02:35:00.310 --> 02:35:03.870
into a databases I don't have to go and run sql query let's

02:35:03.870 --> 02:35:06.250
suppose I am a person who are not aware about sql query

02:35:07.890 --> 02:35:11.770
right now I can just chat with my system and then I will be

02:35:11.770 --> 02:35:14.210
able to do some insert update and delete operation or maybe

02:35:14.210 --> 02:35:19.110
some sort of analytic operation yeah so this is where MCP

02:35:19.110 --> 02:35:24.350
means you are exposing your system to a LLM and fine tuning

02:35:24.350 --> 02:35:29.490
means I am building that LLM understood sir but I just

02:35:29.490 --> 02:35:33.710
wanted to ask that the same thing which we are achieving

02:35:33.710 --> 02:35:37.450
with the help of fine tuning I mean not at all no no no it's

02:35:37.450 --> 02:35:39.750
not comparison it's like apple versus orange kind of a

02:35:39.750 --> 02:35:44.050
comparison it's not at all relatable in any manner see fine

02:35:44.050 --> 02:35:46.050
tuning means what so let's suppose I have fine tuned the

02:35:46.050 --> 02:35:50.210
model will it be able to access my gmail account no actually

02:35:50.210 --> 02:35:54.930
I am not going for the technical thing which we are

02:35:54.930 --> 02:35:58.810
implementing within the fine tuning or within the MCP I just

02:35:58.810 --> 02:36:02.870
wanted to discuss about the end result I mean for the

02:36:02.870 --> 02:36:06.990
specific organizations in the fine tuning also we are

02:36:06.990 --> 02:36:10.150
getting the result right for the specific organization and

02:36:10.810 --> 02:36:15.790
whatever I want to provide the data with the help of MCP as

02:36:15.790 --> 02:36:18.350
well we are achieving that the same thing we are providing

02:36:18.350 --> 02:36:20.670
just a data with MCP we are providing the system access

02:36:20.670 --> 02:36:23.950
there is a difference in terms of fine tuning so yeah you

02:36:23.950 --> 02:36:26.110
have taken a data you have trained the model now model is

02:36:26.110 --> 02:36:29.570
able to give you reply that is a data part right but here

02:36:29.570 --> 02:36:32.930
with the help of MCP my gmail system access is not a data

02:36:32.930 --> 02:36:38.310
it's a system access right right right so fine tuning wise

02:36:38.310 --> 02:36:41.090
you are just providing data and it is trying to train itself

02:36:41.090 --> 02:36:44.330
with respect to a data but in terms of MCPs are we providing

02:36:44.330 --> 02:36:48.530
a data no we are giving a so forget about SQL system or

02:36:48.530 --> 02:36:50.870
MongoDB system access if you are getting confused I am

02:36:50.870 --> 02:36:54.610
providing my calendar access now just with just by chatting

02:36:54.610 --> 02:36:59.050
to your like you know like cloud your LLMs you will be able

02:36:59.050 --> 02:37:01.610
to schedule a meeting will you be able to do it with respect

02:37:01.610 --> 02:37:08.010
to fine tuning no right no yes exactly so with respect to

02:37:08.010 --> 02:37:11.530
MCPs we are providing a system access not just a data access

02:37:11.530 --> 02:37:15.130
obviously data is a part of the system so you can eventually

02:37:15.230 --> 02:37:17.430
provide a data access that's completely fine like a database

02:37:17.430 --> 02:37:20.630
access we are providing but technically MCP means we are

02:37:20.630 --> 02:37:22.990
providing a system access it can access my calendar it can

02:37:22.990 --> 02:37:27.770
access my google seat right but we can say a superset MCP is

02:37:27.770 --> 02:37:31.270
a superset of fine tuning no like I said it's a apple versus

02:37:31.270 --> 02:37:37.150
orange comparison you can't say it not recommended yeah so

02:37:37.150 --> 02:37:43.130
you can't you can't do the comparison even okay so fine next

02:37:43.130 --> 02:37:45.970
one at least you can go ahead with the question yeah yeah so

02:37:47.610 --> 02:37:51.950
like what system access we are let's say any tool we are

02:37:51.950 --> 02:37:55.890
also giving any API access or any system access via tools

02:37:55.890 --> 02:37:59.910
right I mean like technically in world of LLMs in world of

02:37:59.910 --> 02:38:03.710
you know NTKI or generative AI those functions are

02:38:03.710 --> 02:38:07.250
technically named as tool technically it's a function that's

02:38:07.250 --> 02:38:11.990
why separate MCP is required for that because we are already

02:38:11.990 --> 02:38:16.490
achieving that what MCP is bringing into into the table see

02:38:16.490 --> 02:38:21.370
MCP is one of the protocol right like so MCP what MCP is

02:38:21.370 --> 02:38:23.770
bringing in that table so basically it is giving a

02:38:23.770 --> 02:38:27.110
synchronous access to the system that is a part number one a

02:38:27.110 --> 02:38:30.070
part number two so you can connect any system in this entire

02:38:30.070 --> 02:38:33.490
world to any LLMs directly without going ahead with the

02:38:33.490 --> 02:38:36.910
agentic approach I would say that's a part number two part

02:38:36.910 --> 02:38:39.970
number three even agents will be able to consume an MCP

02:38:39.970 --> 02:38:44.070
right so it's just another protocol which has been created

02:38:44.070 --> 02:38:47.010
for example so we have a rest protocol right we have a GPRC

02:38:47.010 --> 02:38:50.450
protocol so we have a web socket now all of these system

02:38:50.450 --> 02:38:52.590
which has been created so technically they help us to

02:38:52.590 --> 02:38:57.310
transfer the data agree yeah but in a different different

02:38:57.310 --> 02:39:01.430
mode so some in a if I'll talk about a web socket so maybe

02:39:01.430 --> 02:39:04.010
into a real time mode I will be able to you know send our

02:39:04.010 --> 02:39:06.890
data if I'll talk about the rest API so basically when

02:39:06.890 --> 02:39:10.370
called then I'll return kind of a like a philosophy it is

02:39:10.370 --> 02:39:12.870
going to follow the similar manner MCP is one of the

02:39:12.870 --> 02:39:15.410
protocol which has been created so you can try to you know

02:39:15.410 --> 02:39:19.110
now if one system will become MCP you can try to use

02:39:19.110 --> 02:39:22.630
anywhere you want with any LLM with ease you can like for

02:39:22.630 --> 02:39:25.150
example we have created the MCP server right 5 MCP server we

02:39:25.150 --> 02:39:28.870
have created yeah and with ease what we have done we have

02:39:28.870 --> 02:39:33.350
just set the path and now my cloud is like up so in short it

02:39:33.350 --> 02:39:36.310
is like a luxury that it is not mandatory that you have to

02:39:36.310 --> 02:39:42.870
access your system not at all not at all right not at all

02:39:42.870 --> 02:39:46.590
mandatory I would say so I can you know create a fast API

02:39:47.150 --> 02:39:49.870
which I know let's suppose I don't know MCP I can create API

02:39:49.870 --> 02:39:52.730
based like you know exposure and then I can try to give to

02:39:52.730 --> 02:39:56.190
the system that's completely fine I think I can feel only

02:39:56.190 --> 02:39:59.310
difference is in case of API you have to mention parameter

02:39:59.310 --> 02:40:03.390
description and all in system prompt or user prompt in this

02:40:03.390 --> 02:40:07.370
case we are if we are going into an agentic way if we are

02:40:07.370 --> 02:40:09.610
going into an agentic way then obviously we have to define

02:40:09.610 --> 02:40:12.850
that so that you know my agents technically again LLMs will

02:40:12.850 --> 02:40:15.210
be able to understand right LLMs will be able to understand.

02:40:15.230 --> 02:40:19.010
and again here so it's a different protocol all together

02:40:19.010 --> 02:40:22.610
which has been created different approach right it's not

02:40:22.610 --> 02:40:25.610
like just you have to go with the MCP approach it's a

02:40:25.610 --> 02:40:27.570
different approach which has been created which is a global

02:40:27.570 --> 02:40:31.250
approach and like with this every system can expose

02:40:31.250 --> 02:40:34.310
themselves Amazon can expose themselves booking.com has

02:40:34.310 --> 02:40:36.570
already exposed themselves Coursera has exposed themselves

02:40:37.070 --> 02:40:40.490
so now anyone and everyone so without having the actual

02:40:40.490 --> 02:40:42.950
access of Coursera they can just click connect and then they

02:40:42.950 --> 02:40:48.750
can talk to that system and the one we did for MongoDB I

02:40:48.750 --> 02:40:54.630
think I have seen MongoDB also given MCP they exposed MCP

02:40:54.630 --> 02:40:58.730
for Atlas even if you will go to like you know chat GPT or

02:40:58.730 --> 02:41:02.010
anywhere so you will be able to find out that there is a MCP

02:41:02.010 --> 02:41:05.070
exposed for a Gmail MCP exposed for a calendar but still I

02:41:05.070 --> 02:41:09.530
have created my own yes yes so you can try to many people

02:41:09.530 --> 02:41:11.650
have done that right you will be now you will be able to

02:41:11.650 --> 02:41:15.670
find out thousands of MCP connectors yeah and you can create

02:41:15.670 --> 02:41:18.490
parallelly your own so I have created my own calendar MCP I

02:41:18.490 --> 02:41:22.070
have created my own Gmail MCP I have created my own Google

02:41:22.070 --> 02:41:25.170
seat MCPs so that I can show you that this is how it's been

02:41:25.170 --> 02:41:28.530
created it's been created yeah I got the intention but my

02:41:28.530 --> 02:41:33.910
question now is the world is using this MCP really or simply

02:41:33.910 --> 02:41:36.930
they are exposing and keeping as an option see the whole

02:41:36.930 --> 02:41:40.290
generative AI itself is in chaos I would say right some

02:41:40.290 --> 02:41:43.350
people are claiming that 95% of the projects which we are

02:41:43.350 --> 02:41:46.270
building is useless some people are claiming that AI is

02:41:46.270 --> 02:41:49.230
really a hype some people are saying that AI AGI will become

02:41:49.230 --> 02:41:53.190
a reality next 5 to 10 year right so again the world is

02:41:53.190 --> 02:41:56.550
divided the only good thing which I can see is investment is

02:41:56.550 --> 02:41:59.370
coming more and more and more people are talking about it

02:41:59.370 --> 02:42:03.250
more and more and more and yes if you will ask me on a

02:42:03.250 --> 02:42:07.410
personal level so personally I have used or I am still using

02:42:07.410 --> 02:42:12.510
AI almost 90% of the time for all kind of a work right

02:42:12.510 --> 02:42:16.070
morning till evening so yes personally it has impacted my

02:42:16.070 --> 02:42:19.110
life so I am assuming that it has impacted everyone's life

02:42:19.110 --> 02:42:23.030
on this entire planet so it's a real thing and if something

02:42:23.030 --> 02:42:29.420
is a real it's actually been used got it and it is having a

02:42:29.420 --> 02:42:33.640
value got it so it's so it's worth learning I would say that

02:42:33.640 --> 02:42:38.920
that's my opinion yeah got it thank you yeah thanks okay so

02:42:38.920 --> 02:42:42.640
suggest go ahead sorry I think I have promoted you as a

02:42:42.640 --> 02:42:49.540
panelist yeah suggest you have a question yeah can I share

02:42:49.540 --> 02:42:51.580
the screen yeah sure you can share the screen

02:42:58.010 --> 02:43:01.990
investment in AI means more exactly yeah I mean like we all

02:43:01.990 --> 02:43:04.930
are moving towards with the trend right so obviously if

02:43:04.930 --> 02:43:09.810
something is real something is creating a value and

02:43:09.810 --> 02:43:12.170
personally just as look into your life so how AI has

02:43:12.170 --> 02:43:15.170
impacted your life so if it has impacted your life means

02:43:15.170 --> 02:43:18.570
it's real and it will impact more just a matter of time

02:43:18.570 --> 02:43:22.190
maybe wait for like next couple of more year it will impact

02:43:22.190 --> 02:43:27.350
more so be ready with the AI yes suggest what is the issue I

02:43:27.350 --> 02:43:32.550
am still learning with my run that in a base environment run

02:43:32.550 --> 02:43:36.910
in a base deactivate this environment okay PK

02:43:49.420 --> 02:43:52.920
is asking how it is different from agent giving a tool

02:43:52.920 --> 02:43:58.120
access then why MCP see in case of agent so again you have

02:43:58.120 --> 02:44:02.500
to use any agentic orchestration framework agree everyone

02:44:02.500 --> 02:44:06.400
yeah you have to use any agentic orchestration framework

02:44:06.400 --> 02:44:10.840
Lanchen Lama indexes Landgraf crew AI autogen any of these

02:44:10.840 --> 02:44:15.780
are maybe any 10 agree in case of agent you have to use any

02:44:15.780 --> 02:44:18.880
agentic orchestration framework right then you will go there

02:44:18.880 --> 02:44:21.580
then you will create a agents and then you will try to

02:44:21.580 --> 02:44:24.460
create a tool inside that and then you will give a tool

02:44:24.460 --> 02:44:26.580
access tool access means you can give any data access

02:44:26.580 --> 02:44:30.620
function or system access to anything that is one of the

02:44:30.620 --> 02:44:33.640
approach by which LLM will be able to get an access of your

02:44:33.640 --> 02:44:35.820
different different tools and they can make a decision okay

02:44:35.820 --> 02:44:38.600
so do this do this do this based on your natural language

02:44:38.600 --> 02:44:42.760
query that's one of the flow the other flow is build your

02:44:42.760 --> 02:44:45.900
function which like which is able to access your tools or

02:44:45.900 --> 02:44:50.820
like any other like database or system that you have and

02:44:50.820 --> 02:44:54.560
then keep it make it generic just like a rule just like a

02:44:54.560 --> 02:44:58.500
protocol and then attach to any system which accepts MCP

02:44:58.500 --> 02:45:01.940
this is how you can differentiate hello

02:45:04.240 --> 02:45:10.140
yeah so I am just run it hmm

02:45:15.220 --> 02:45:21.470
no module in MCP install requirement.txt yes I have

02:45:21.470 --> 02:45:25.210
installed in the particular environment but here here here

02:45:25.210 --> 02:45:27.950
people install iphone requirement.txt so

02:45:32.080 --> 02:45:35.520
you can go in a agentic way you can go even in this way and

02:45:35.520 --> 02:45:38.480
both the way you are technically giving your system access

02:45:38.480 --> 02:45:43.660
to this one so MCP is technically a rule based you are just

02:45:43.660 --> 02:45:46.760
like independently you are creating all the servers for any

02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:50.000
system of that of your choice and then you are giving access

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:53.720
in case of agentic approach you are using some orchestration

02:45:53.720 --> 02:45:59.060
framework or maybe a tool or maybe a library it's working

02:45:59.060 --> 02:46:03.200
okay great if we install iphone what is the issue no

02:46:03.200 --> 02:46:07.340
matching distribution find for MCP okay so what is your like

02:46:07.340 --> 02:46:16.060
python version just 3.1 3 point 3.9 just show me python

02:46:16.060 --> 02:46:17.540
version 3

02:46:19.840 --> 02:46:25.200
.9 then it should ideally work no matching distribution find

02:46:25.200 --> 02:46:26.060
okay

02:47:03.770 --> 02:47:07.690
no no just just wait just wait hmm

02:47:18.760 --> 02:47:21.500
go to your requirement.txt make

02:47:25.570 --> 02:47:29.070
it MCP is equal equal to 1.20 equal

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:34.560
equal to remove

02:47:37.890 --> 02:47:47.600
remove greater than greater than equal equal to 1.20 okay

02:47:47.600 --> 02:48:01.960
control s 1.20 1.20 not 2.0 1.20 1.20 1.20 1.20 control s

02:48:01.960 --> 02:48:07.320
now do it run the requirement again

02:48:13.330 --> 02:48:19.210
remove version remove the version remove version from MCP

02:48:19.210 --> 02:48:28.090
remove the version okay remove control s run again no

02:48:32.860 --> 02:48:39.920
matching distribution find for MCP at all okay so okay so it

02:48:39.920 --> 02:48:43.040
requires python 3.10 at least then only it is going to work

02:48:43.040 --> 02:48:45.640
fine so do you have any environment where you have like you

02:48:45.640 --> 02:48:50.960
know python 3.10 yes yes okay use that environment yes

02:49:06.100 --> 02:49:11.060
okay so use it yes

02:49:31.760 --> 02:49:36.480
can I can I create new environment here yeah yeah you can

02:49:36.480 --> 02:49:38.000
create anywhere of your choice yeah

02:51:23.260 --> 02:51:26.500
no it's not like that I think your friend must be having a

02:51:26.500 --> 02:51:29.860
limited exposure to the system or I don't know what is his

02:51:29.860 --> 02:51:33.640
qualification but it's not like that we try to expose that

02:51:33.640 --> 02:51:37.240
as a ssc so we just like a create any kind of a tool for

02:51:37.240 --> 02:51:40.120
example if I have to expose my Euron system so I'll just

02:51:40.120 --> 02:51:43.500
create one tool and solve it and then anyone and everyone

02:51:43.500 --> 02:51:46.080
who can call it as a ssc so they will be able to check

02:51:46.080 --> 02:51:51.920
everything with respect to the Euron right like with their

02:51:51.920 --> 02:51:56.560
own favorite LLMs right and this really makes our life very

02:51:56.560 --> 02:52:00.500
very easy and that's the whole fundamentals behind using or

02:52:00.500 --> 02:52:03.360
creating a MCP protocol so

02:52:08.730 --> 02:52:11.610
last year I done solve the requirements that they have okay

02:52:11.610 --> 02:52:15.770
then then try running this MCP server okay

02:52:25.340 --> 02:52:29.920
okay it's good to see and race is helping you out like

02:52:38.270 --> 02:52:38.870
now like

02:52:43.460 --> 02:52:46.520
yeah exit it exit first give

02:52:52.060 --> 02:52:53.560
me remote control yeah file

02:53:00.320 --> 02:53:04.020
just leave your system okay okay just

02:53:28.530 --> 02:53:37.070
leave your system so that I can access okay I am not I am

02:53:37.070 --> 02:53:41.610
not able to click on your name or anything one second yeah

02:53:41.610 --> 02:53:43.970
just

02:53:46.690 --> 02:53:50.870
just leave leave your mouse on system everything okay

02:53:57.080 --> 02:54:03.520
still I am not able to click okay click on your name okay go

02:54:03.520 --> 02:54:04.820
to developer go to developer

02:54:13.380 --> 02:54:15.320
edit configuration open

02:54:17.470 --> 02:54:19.070
this file drive

02:54:25.470 --> 02:54:29.950
this this this source and cpm cp server dot file okay so

02:54:29.950 --> 02:54:36.550
there is some issue with this file there was some go up go

02:54:36.550 --> 02:54:40.310
up no no no there is some issue with this file okay so there

02:54:40.310 --> 02:54:50.130
is a mcp server you have mentioned and after that so okay

02:54:50.130 --> 02:54:57.610
got it so this is a json issue now it's fine control s this

02:54:57.610 --> 02:55:01.810
is one of the issue and then you have missed a json even

02:55:01.810 --> 02:55:09.510
over here now this is fixed hmm now go to your cloud okay

02:55:09.510 --> 02:55:10.930
let me close

02:55:24.890 --> 02:55:29.570
hmm developer setting now let's see what

03:04:26.240 --> 03:04:33.360
right install it's 3.9 oh yes

03:05:22.020 --> 03:05:26.680
then do I need to remove 3.9 version from my it's it's fine

03:05:26.680 --> 03:05:31.320
I am just overriding it will override automatically okay the

03:05:31.320 --> 03:05:32.840
same yeah

03:07:16.560 --> 03:07:19.720
just just wait i'm checking okay

03:07:36.760 --> 03:07:38.560
sign 3.90

03:08:00.100 --> 03:08:00.700
what

03:08:17.920 --> 03:08:21.060
is your environment name sorry it's the base environment i

03:08:21.060 --> 03:08:21.840
have to use fine

03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:45.720
now it will work if the requirement files will be installed

03:08:45.720 --> 03:08:50.800
um so we are installing it in a base and we in a base we

03:08:50.800 --> 03:08:52.860
have 3.10 okay

03:10:11.760 --> 03:10:13.700
yeah so

03:11:14.020 --> 03:11:19.580
it's working now it's working yeah see yeah so it was just a

03:11:19.580 --> 03:11:22.160
base environment issue nothing else that was the only thing

03:11:22.160 --> 03:11:27.300
yeah thank you thank you okay yeah thank you fine so fine

03:11:27.300 --> 03:11:30.820
guys everyone will connect again tomorrow same time and what

03:11:30.820 --> 03:11:34.120
we are going to do so we are going to like you know see each

03:11:34.120 --> 03:11:37.700
and everything all this five mcp server that we have created

03:11:37.700 --> 03:11:39.900
or technically three file of mcp server that we have created

03:11:39.900 --> 03:11:43.260
so how we can configure it in our own way and we'll try to

03:11:43.260 --> 03:11:45.740
understand more and more in depth theoretically as well as

03:11:45.740 --> 03:11:47.960
like practically with that thank you so much everyone hope

03:11:47.960 --> 03:11:50.660
all of you have enjoyed and we are doing something real

03:11:50.660 --> 03:11:52.960
right that you can write it down inside your resume directly

03:11:52.960 --> 03:11:57.140
that i have created 500 mcb server or 600 mc server i have

03:11:57.140 --> 03:11:59.480
created mcb server for a sales team for hr team for this

03:11:59.480 --> 03:12:02.720
team that team so in in this way basically you can try to

03:12:02.720 --> 03:12:06.200
mention everything uh like a kind of a work in in your like

03:12:06.200 --> 03:12:09.780
a portfolio in your resume and even you can go and you can

03:12:09.780 --> 03:12:11.980
talk about it right that okay so i have created even an

03:12:11.980 --> 03:12:15.480
agent i have created even a mcp so where mcp where agent all

03:12:15.480 --> 03:12:18.120
these things you can discuss right and that's the reason so

03:12:18.120 --> 03:12:20.920
i'm trying to talk about all of this example not with some

03:12:20.920 --> 03:12:24.200
like a you know dummy functions but with the real system

03:12:24.200 --> 03:12:27.700
right for a database for example mongodb or sql or my gmail

03:12:27.700 --> 03:12:31.680
my calendar so that you all will be able to understand uh

03:12:31.680 --> 03:12:36.000
the reality and again so in an interview you can use it plus

03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:38.540
if you are building something on your own so again you all

03:12:38.540 --> 03:12:41.940
will be able to use the same thing uh with that thank you so

03:12:41.940 --> 03:12:44.480
much everyone take care see you again tomorrow hope all of

03:12:44.480 --> 03:12:47.320
you are liking it and one new batch of this generative i'm

03:12:47.320 --> 03:12:50.120
going to start syllabus why it's same but again it's a live

03:12:50.120 --> 03:12:54.660
class so if it is a live class then i'm not a robot your

03:12:54.660 --> 03:12:57.440
mentor is not a robot it's a human being so obviously i used

03:12:57.440 --> 03:13:00.840
to give a new analogy a new discovery new things so you all

03:13:00.840 --> 03:13:04.160
are welcome in that batch as well plus if someone from your

03:13:04.160 --> 03:13:07.100
side would like to join so they can freely like a join that

03:13:07.100 --> 03:13:09.320
particular batch so thank you so much take care see you

03:13:09.320 --> 03:13:11.760
again tomorrow 9b 9am isd thank you
