anyone

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:34.300
anyone who is having any clue any idea aws with rag yeah

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.920
that we'll discuss obviously okay so let me set an agenda

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.900
for this entire week by the way so what we are going to

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.900
discuss today and tomorrow uh so last week i was talking

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:46.700
about basically uh yuri right so where we were able to you

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:51.320
know uh deploy uh yuri chat system and again we were able to

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.360
do a mapping of this yuri chat system with the open ai apis

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.480
this is what we have seen along with that so we have also

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.960
attached a prometheus and a grafana so that we'll be able to

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.740
get a statistics of basic statistics i would say because

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.780
there are like so many uh other statistics that we can try

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.620
to generate with respect to this prometheus and grafana uh

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:15.400
we can we can configure it as per our own need by the way so

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.840
what kind of a status is that we are going to uh we are

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.660
looking for or your client is going to be looking for going

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:23.620
to look for accordingly we can try to configure it uh so

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.420
today what i will do so i'll try to show you a domain

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:30.100
mapping so because again this is a very very important part

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:33.520
uh last week you must have seen that when we were trying to

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.340
spin our server technically easy to instance when we were

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.780
trying to spin so it has given us a url and on that url we

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.460
were able to access our application so whether it's a

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:49.040
grafana or whether it's a yuri chat api chat system we were

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.020
able to access over there but let's suppose if i have to

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:57.800
host my own application on my own domain any any xyg domain

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.500
which i have purchased and i have to map it i have to

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.860
basically route it so how i will be able to route uh that

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.980
kind of a thing so this is something which i'm going to

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.260
discuss today and then tomorrow we'll be talking about

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:13.480
basically uh aws bedrock there is something called as uh

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.600
bedrock services there is something called as a sage maker

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.920
and around this ai ml and generative ai so there are a lot

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.720
of services which is available inside of aws so i'll be

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.840
focusing on those aws services so that you all will be able

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.980
to understand that how we can access all the proprietary

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:35.960
model or aws related model from aws account itself along

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.520
with that so we will also try to understand how we can do a

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.500
fine tuning right inside our aws cloud so already we have

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:48.720
done a fine tuning inside our classes but specific to aws so

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.620
what kind of a service is we can try to use to do a fine

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.880
tuning what kind of a services i will be able to do with

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.560
respect to rag because in many projects when you are going

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.520
to join so people are going to ask you to like you know use

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.500
just those services not to build any kind of a custom

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.100
application or not to write any kind of an agent but just

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:14.280
use those services and build the entire system maybe a poc

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.880
maybe mvps or maybe a production grid systems that will be

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.580
an agenda for this entire system so that's what i'm going to

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:23.800
talk about in this entire week yeah fine everyone so uh fine

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.900
tuning and then rag uh model access basically uh domain

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:33.340
mapping only with respect to aws specific to aws all of

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.140
these things will be talking about this entire week let's

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.060
see how much we will be able to cover so if we will not be

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.200
able to cover all these things this week then obviously

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.200
we'll try to discuss uh next week as simple as that we have

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.940
enough time and we we all are here for a learning so we'll

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:52.860
try to learn and experiment as much as possible yeah hope

00:11:55.550 --> 00:12:01.170
agenda is clear for this entire week and then i have to even

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:05.090
talk about gcp services i have to talk about even azure

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:08.450
services because there are a lot of services which is

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:12.650
already available inside aws that we are going to discuss

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:15.750
but yeah so similar kind of services you will be able to

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:18.590
find out with respect to azure and even with respect to a

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:22.430
gcp and i believe in a modern world so we all are supposed

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:25.810
to be aware about it and same is also mentioned inside your

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:28.310
syllabus so if you'll go through your syllabus we have

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:32.650
already mentioned uh vortex ai then azure open ai and aws

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:37.850
bedrock okay so let me share my screen first of all and

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:44.540
let's talk about it okay so i believe my screen is visible

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.820
guys to all of you okay

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.600
so uh before starting with the class is it also possible

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.320
that some services available under this but not on azure uh

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.060
yeah so these are two like a major not two i would say like

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:06.200
a aws azure and gcp so they are like a three major cloud

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.840
provider and as per my experience as per my observation and

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:14.240
as per the services that we are already using uh almost

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.880
everything that you can do on aws you can do it even on

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:22.580
azure and you can even do it on gcp maybe by like using some

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:26.000
other services basically by using some other configuration

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.600
or maybe a pipeline but yes it is actually doable uh in all

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.740
of these three major cloud providers because they are

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.680
competitors so if one is going to launch some services

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.640
obviously other will launch those services and they have

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.320
already launched that kind of a services on their respective

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:47.720
platform so technically it's possible yeah okay so just a

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.900
couple of update from your own side uh so like uh three

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.460
weeks back we have launched a consultancy and we have

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.940
launched a white label product so people are enjoying it uh

00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.120
we were able to receive a lot of feedback from our customers

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.900
and we have launched a lot of a lot of you know like

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.380
consultancy projects where people are coming and they're

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:07.140
asking us to solve their problems uh their office problem by

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.340
the way uh the problem that they are facing uh during their

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:14.200
job uh people are coming to us and they are asking us to

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:19.140
solve or build a product basically for the startup so we

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:22.040
have so many such kind of uh people we have onboarded so

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:27.040
many like projects uh in that particular segment uh so many

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.200
people for many people so we are building uh their product

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.080
for their startup and uh for many people so we are helping

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:37.680
them out in terms of uh basically uh providing them our

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.800
services which is helping them out uh in their day-to-day

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:46.800
job and uh yeah so there are like uh people and very soon uh

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.360
we'll make announcements so there are people who have taken

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.620
this entire lms who's uh trying to start their own uh

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:56.740
startup along with that so i believe in a month of january

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:59.480
so we are launching uh something called as your own system

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.700
so which is going to be a sas product and uh over there so

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.640
anyone and everyone can go not a white label white label is

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:10.000
a different one right so a sas product so where people can

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.920
go and they will be able to launch their courses they will

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.820
be able to sell their books uh webinars one-to-one meetings

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:19.440
or maybe a live classes each and everything with this entire

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.600
your own ecosystem so that will be launched as a separate

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.180
system it will not be launched inside this you're on dot one

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:28.360
so that is something that we are going to bring uh as a sas

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:32.480
uh platform uh along with that so internally since last six

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.920
months so we have been building uh something uh which is

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.960
very similar to lovable but approach and architecture wise

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:42.480
it's very different so i think we all know lovable and then

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.760
a bolt and all those platforms so where you can go and you

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:49.040
can try to you know generate a entire website maybe not a

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.780
production grade but yeah so you will be able to generate uh

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.780
or you will be able to build a website you will be able to

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:54.980
build

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:00.900
a live coding but again there are a lot of problems that we

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:04.940
have seen and uh my team is trying to solve those uh

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.320
problems in a different way so our approach is a little bit

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.740
different so in general so they're following zero to one

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.200
kind of a journey but yeah so we are trying to build a

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.300
system in such a way that we can avoid zero to one journey

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:20.700
so we can try to start from one to beyond journey and in

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.240
that way even token consumption will be very very limited

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:29.780
and people will be able to get each and everything uh with a

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:34.600
minimalistic vibe coding or you can say a prompt so that is

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.200
a kind of a tool that we are building and we are going to

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.560
release that tool that tool will be available in a market

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.960
not on your own platform on a separate platform basically so

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:47.620
by march i believe so that's a tentative timeline that we

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:52.420
have given to ourselves uh along with that so yesterday we

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:56.420
have announced something called as work and learn and i

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.380
believe there was a lot of discussions which was going

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:02.980
inside uh your group specifically uh where uh we have

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.980
received a lot of inquiry we have received a lot of query

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:10.000
and even like i've got this inquiry from my team saying that

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.580
that there are so many working professionals for students

00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:15.900
this work and learn is completely fine but yeah those who

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.540
are not aware about this work and learn philosophy uh so let

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.020
me talk about that so why we have launched it so there were

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.320
a lot of like uh after launching this consulting and after

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.780
launching this uh like uh product so basically there was a

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.720
lot of query which was getting from people saying that that

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:34.180
uh learning is fine so we are able to learn a lot and we

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:38.080
will keep on learning but we need even some of the services

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:43.040
so where we can work with our actual team so tech team

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.520
basically right so we can work with the actual team we can

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.960
work on our actual problem we can work with the actual

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.860
client and this is where this work and learn philosophy or

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:54.060
concept comes into a picture and i said that that okay fine

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.220
so let's try to launch one services so where people can come

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:57.680
we are going to be able to work with the actual team we can

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:57.680
work with the actual team we can work with the actual

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.060
clients and we are going to assign them a project because

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:03.900
it's a part of consulting uh we are not assigning a project

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.220
as a part of consulting you don't consulting so basically

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:09.260
you try to bring your problem your product your application

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.920
and we build it basically we deliver it that's the like a

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.620
core idea behind a consulting but behind this work and learn

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:20.340
so what we are going to do so uh basically anyone who is

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:24.400
going to join this initiative so we are going to give you a

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:28.320
task we are going to assign you a board board you can say

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.800
right we are going to discuss about each and every

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.400
requirements that we have with respect to a particular

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.000
product or the problem that we are solving for a particular

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.080
client and with team not alone by the way so with team you

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:46.060
are supposed to solve that problem so that problem may be in

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.400
terms of designing a solution in terms of building an

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.540
architecture in terms of writing a code in terms of doing a

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.440
testing in terms of hosting it in terms of like bringing it

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.040
on a scale right because this is what happens with respect

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.620
to a real product so this is where this work and learn

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:04.380
feature comes into picture we have launched it then we have

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.240
received a lot of inquiry from a working professional saying

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.520
that that how we will be able to work because we are busy we

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:14.380
are busy in our office work for like a five days at minimum

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:18.640
Monday to Friday right so yesterday I have already mentioned

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.440
inside the group that no we need someone who can dedicate

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:26.840
their time but again a lot of inquiry like I said yesterday

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:31.300
itself in till midnight I would say and keeping that in our

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:34.820
mind so I have said decided that that okay so you can join

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:38.800
you can try to you know discuss with a team maybe on

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:43.220
Saturday and Sunday and maybe after evening basically so

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:45.600
when you will be available when you will be free so that

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:49.120
team can assign you a task team can do a meeting on Saturday

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.180
Sunday as well as on a weekdays because this requires a lot

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:56.680
of discussions lot of meeting on a daily basis right if not

00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:00.520
daily so maybe like three to four times in a week so that we

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.060
will be able to track our progress we will be able to hit a

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:06.300
deadline because we have to deliver right and let's suppose

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.860
if you are a part of our SAS product if you are a part of

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:13.360
our your own AI builder so again we have our own deadline we

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.200
can't surpass that particular deadline so keeping that in

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:20.160
our mind now this work and learn is available or you can try

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.220
to talk to a team you can try to join this working

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:28.620
professional and if you are fresher if you have a time 100

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.860
time available with you then in that case no issue at all

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:36.140
just work like 95 job in any of the project that my team is

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:39.780
going to assign it to you so project-wise so majorly all

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:43.780
these projects are available in a like a SAS that we are

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.280
building the problem that we are solving for a client and

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:50.480
into a AI builder so again a lot of like a good project uh

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:53.820
which is already available with us and uh you know we have a

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:56.280
lot of uh yeah so we are like uh working on that maybe you

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.840
will be a part of that and you will be able to get a real

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:03.720
experience in a real time uh can I build like a your own

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.740
platform so for your own platform we have already released

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:10.960
it as a white label so all this platforms is available as a

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:14.040
white label people are liking it and we have already

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:17.340
onboarded so many people for this your own platform uh so

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:21.400
yeah I mean like overnight it is not possible so we have

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:25.720
offered that as a white label and our clients are enjoying

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:30.060
it and along with that so like I said uh we are launching a

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:34.640
SAS basically it's not going to be on Iran.one so and we are

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.860
launching it very soon so January month uh along with that

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:42.900
so again this week I believe by Wednesday you all will be

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:47.160
able to see uh one major improvement inside your learning

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:51.960
portal so uh you in an overview section in this particular

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:56.960
section you will be able to see a summary of a particular

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:01.220
video so for example if you have missed a class or maybe if

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:04.980
you are going through any of our lecture recorded or maybe a

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:09.500
live lecture is lecture simple so we have already built that

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:11.800
solution and we are releasing it by this week itself

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.800
Wednesday Max to Max Wednesday so we are generating all

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.800
those transcripts uh so you will be able to see a summary

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:22.280
not just a summary by the way you will be able to even

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:27.540
download the original script file a transcript file of a

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:31.540
particular class so you will be having a huge huge amount of

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:36.200
a transcript from each and every lecture along with a

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.280
summary so before even jumping into a lecture just by

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:42.660
looking into a summary you will be able to understand that

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:46.240
what is there inside this particular lecture and you can

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.240
download even a raw file so that option also we are going to

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:54.820
give it to you uh plus uh we have been working on a video

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:58.140
engineering since a very very long time uh so we have

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:02.380
decided that that okay uh in our WhatsApp Yuri so in a Yuri

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.760
itself so we are attaching one more services so where you

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.160
can go and you can try to search any topic for example if

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:12.180
you are searching for maybe uh something something called as

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:16.200
AWS bedrock right so in whatever lecture let's suppose in a

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.280
multiple lectures we have already discussed about it and

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:22.880
lectures length is two hour right so you can go to UD

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:26.380
WhatsApp then you can just ask that okay so can you give me

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:32.140
like a Amazon AWS bedrock lectures so from a two hour of

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:36.080
lecture it will be able to tell you that okay so in this

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.140
lecture this particular topic is available at this

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:42.940
particular time stamp so this is a problem that we were

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:47.360
trying to solve since a long time and yeah so very soon that

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.600
will be available to all of us not this week that so this

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.400
week you will be able to see a summary and a transcript so

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:59.020
for almost all the lectures so like all the recorded classes

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:01.700
or selfless classes that we have launched and you can even

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.920
download the transcript basically the original transcript so

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.400
that you will be having enough data and if you would like to

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:10.820
build something on your own you will be able to build it so

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:16.260
hope that will be a great uh you know service for all of you

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:19.460
for work and learn can we work only on AI based project

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:24.120
majorly we have an AI based project derivative based project

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:30.270
so yes quiz will also be there uh yeah quiz and assignments

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:33.370
so we are we are like generating for every lecture but yeah

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:37.210
this is this Wednesday so team we already have like a couple

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:39.890
of round of demo last week itself with respect to this

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:44.070
transcript and the summary uh so yes as of now as we speak

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:46.990
uh so our back-end system is generating because there are

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:50.070
thousands of lecture that we have uploaded in last one year

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:53.610
of time after a launch of your own so now we are processing

00:24:55.630 --> 00:25:00.750
you but almost more than 2500 I believe a number of videos

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:04.690
that we have some video and video length starts from a five

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:08.250
minute till four hour even like a three hours so everything

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:11.390
we are processing now everything is literally everything we

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:16.470
are processing are you using AI for the solution obviously

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:20.770
it's a solution that we have built otherwise uh I mean like

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:24.690
a not processing part processing part is having a different

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:27.690
kind of a solution and then on top of that uh we are trying

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:31.290
to do a summarization and on top of that so for every

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:34.730
lecture so we are even generating a quiz and assignments

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:38.530
right and on top of that so we are trying to build a

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:42.810
timestamp so that you know uh system can go inside a video

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:46.610
they can try to look for a particular topic it can try to

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:49.130
extract a particular timestamp and give it to the user

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:52.290
saying that and if that topic is available in a multiple

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:55.270
videos so again it will give you a link of multiple videos

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:59.970
as of now Yuri is giving you the latest courses and Yuri is

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:04.150
able to search a topic based on video lecture topic but

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:07.550
visual lecture topic is not sufficient in let's suppose if

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:10.450
I'm taking class for two hour right if I'm taking class for

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:15.250
two hour so again uh in two hour so I I can't just write one

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:17.490
single topic name and say that okay fine this is what I have

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:19.370
discussed in two hour because in two hour a lot of

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:22.690
discussion happens so it has to go into a video transcript

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:28.010
it is supposed to search those topic like a 2500 videos it

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:30.450
is supposed to search those topic and then extract a

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:33.430
timestamp and give it to the user along with the video link

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:38.690
so that problem we are able to solve so I think it will be

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:40.990
available as a service very soon but yeah this week

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:46.400
transcript and summary both please let's start the lecture

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.880
okay you are getting bored fine I'll start with the lecture

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.440
a

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:55.700
lately product will be hosted in your info or client info in

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:58.300
client info so this is the meaning of uh white label white

00:26:58.300 --> 00:26:59.340
label means in

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:06.800
and the SAS that we are building so basically uh it will be

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:11.520
on our infra okay fine guys now let's start so this is all

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.660
about work and learn consultancy and all those new updates

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:16.480
uh that the kind of progress that we have made in last

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:23.160
couple of week now so let's go to a aws account and let's

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:28.940
try to log in into aws console everyone I believe we all

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:31.720
have AWS account we have already created those account last

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:32.400
week itself

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:38.570
so let's log in okay

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:18.200
so I believe all of us are able to log in guys yeah inside

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:18.880
AWS account

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:25.770
yes so if you can confirm me guys in a chat that will be

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:27.050
better can

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:33.930
we download our live recorded videos for a future reference

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:36.730
you can download it inside the application only inside the

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:39.170
app inside the web you can't download it because that will

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:43.690
increase our piracy so our DRM will not allow you in

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:49.670
-app download is available just like any other OTT platform

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:54.050
gives you right so Netflix and uh like uh you know uh Imogen

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:56.310
prime and everyone is giving you enough download so we are

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:59.830
also giving you in-app download in Android and IOS so that

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:04.590
you can watch it in a offline mode okay fine so I believe we

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:07.250
all are able to log in so please log in guys I'm giving you

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:10.450
two three minutes of time so that you can log in okay

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:53.870
so logged in guys everyone yeah I'm looking for more yes I

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:58.910
can see one two three four so far sir

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.480
have you tried Google anti-gravity foundation sorry let me

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.580
just give you something for a vibe coding, I think I have

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:11.160
also created a video where I was like, my system anti

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:15.460
-gravity is installed actually and yeah. So if you are

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:19.580
asking me a comparison with respect to a cursor, I will say

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:23.380
still cursor is pretty much powerful as compared to anti

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:26.000
-gravity, maybe in six months of time anti-gravity will be

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.320
more powerful. I don't know about it, right? Depends upon

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:32.320
their product release. But yeah, as of now cursor is way

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.480
more powerful than anti-gravity. I

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.720
mean, UI wise, you will not be able to find out any kind of

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:46.280
differences because both are using VS code, right? So both

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:49.380
have built this entire thing on top of VS code itself, VS

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:53.420
code, which is an open source, even you can modify it and

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:56.220
even you can build it, that's pretty much possible. And if

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.460
you remember in my previous company, Iron On, so we have

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:02.180
launched a lab, we did the exact same thing three or four

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:04.800
years back. So we have launched everything inside a web

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:08.000
based VS code. So yeah, VS code, you can do anything with

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.860
that. So the power of VS code. The power of anti-gravity or

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.820
power of cursor is coming from our agents basically. So

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:19.440
cursor's agent is a very, very good for now only. I don't

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.720
know after six months what will happen, right? Who is going

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:22.680
to lead a market?

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:36.780
Okay, so fine guys, if you are able to log in, then we have

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:40.820
to do one thing. So let me talk about a flow, right? So what

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:44.380
is a flow that we are going to follow over here? So first of

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:48.660
all, we are going to launch our EC2 service, right? So we

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:51.500
are going to launch our EC2. Technically, we are going to

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:55.760
launch a machine, right? A machine. We will be hosting some

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:59.140
of the code over here. So for example, today we are going to

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:02.460
host a hello world. Last week we have already hosted our

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:08.520
like a URI AI, you can say, right? Complete open web UI we

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.480
have hosted. But yeah, so this week, so inside our EC2

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:17.500
instances, we are going to maybe host a hello world code.

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:20.360
Okay. So what we are going to do, right? Maybe my name is

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:22.580
Anshu Kumar, kind of a code over there with the help of

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:27.580
maybe fast API. And we all know that that in a local system,

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:31.300
so fast API is going to launch itself with some URLs. So

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:34.640
this is what this EC2 instance is going to do. By default,

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.440
EC2 instance is going to give you a public IP address. So

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:40.760
public IP address will keep on changing. So on a start or on

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:43.520
a refresh. So what we are going to do, so we are going to

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:47.000
obtain basically something called as elastic IP address.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:53.680
Elastic IP address. Address we are going to obtain once

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:56.740
we'll be able to obtain an elastic IP addresses, then what

00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:03.760
we are going to do. So with the help of route 53 inside AWS,

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:06.220
which is one of the services which I'm going to teach you.

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:10.940
So with the help of this route 53, so we are going to map

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:17.140
our own domains. Let's suppose I have a domain xyg.com. So I

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:18.460
have a lot of domains. I have a domain which I have

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:23.060
purchased, purchased in my GoDaddy account. So I will be

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:25.920
using one of those domain and I will be mapping with a

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.980
service which will be running inside this EC2 instances,

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.760
right? So this is something that we are going to do it. So

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:35.160
if I'm able to map this domain in that situation, so

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.400
anything and everything which will be running on an EC2

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.220
instances, I will be able to map it in an exact similar

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:44.180
manner. And I can simply claim that, that, okay, so my

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:48.400
service is running on my website, a website, that I have

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:51.640
purchased from some of the domain name provider. Simple.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:55.000
Yeah. So that is the approach which we are going to follow.

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:59.120
And this is a one time job, I would say, because if you are

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.400
able to do it once in a life, you will be able to do it

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.480
again a hundred times or maybe a thousand times in your

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:09.020
life, right? So this is our flow that we are going to

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:14.260
discuss in my today's class. Now let's move. So here what

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.600
you have to do. So first of all, I need some of the

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.200
services. Okay. So this must be up and running inside my

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:23.300
EC2, right inside my machine. So first of all, I will have

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:27.100
to launch a EC2 machine. So I'll click on EC2, right? And

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:30.560
I'll click on this launch instance step by step. And now

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:33.620
here, so maybe you can try to give a name of your machine.

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:38.260
So I can try to give maybe SUDH underscore Euron underscore

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:42.220
test machine. Yeah. So this is a name which I have given.

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:45.060
You can try to give any name of your choice. That's like

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:48.840
completely okay. And this is what we have done even in my

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:52.440
last class. Then we can try to select a operating system. So

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.860
we can try to select maybe a Ubuntu and here, so it is going

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:59.220
to give you a detail about the images as you can see, right?

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:03.560
Ubuntu and then maybe I can try to select instance side. So

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:06.980
any kind of instance is going to work as we are not going to

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.400
do much. We are not going to run a heavy application last

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:12.900
time. So when we were trying to run this open web UI, we

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:17.500
were trying to, you know, spin that open web UI. So at that

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.900
point of time, we had a requirement, right, we had a

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:23.260
requirement that machine must have a 20 GB of a hard disk

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:26.380
and 8 GB of a RAM. That was a minimum one which was required

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:29.440
because if you are going to select any kind of a machine

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:34.360
below that, it is not going to run it. But for today's task,

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.920
I don't need a heavy machine, I need a very, very

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:40.120
lightweighted machine. So maybe T2 micro, T3 micro is going

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:44.260
to do a job for me. So here I can try to select maybe a T3

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:47.540
micro. Okay. Or maybe I can try to select even a T2 Nano.

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:50.980
This is also fine. So T2 Nano is going to give you one

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:56.700
virtual core CPU and 0.5 GB of RAM basically, right? So

00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:00.300
which is like more than enough at least for my today's like

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:05.540
a class. So fine, everyone. Now, so I can try to generate

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:09.380
maybe a key pair or maybe I can try to attach key pair. So

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:13.100
even last class, I have also I have already created a key

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:16.280
pair. Here, I can try to use that itself. This is something

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:19.080
that we have already like I use so many times when we were

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:22.140
trying to launch even a GPU and even in my previous classes.

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:26.840
If I have to do a SSH from my local system, if I don't have

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:29.580
to do SSH from my local system, then I can try to leave it.

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:32.720
I don't want like I don't have to attach any kind of a key

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:35.360
value pair just like a user ID password, right? So that you

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:39.180
can launch it from your local machine. Then you can come to

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:45.180
basically a network setting, right? So SSH by default, it's

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:48.040
ticked. So it simply means that that you will be able to hit

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:52.360
this particular machine, this EC2 instance from your local.

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:56.600
Maybe I can try to select allow all the HTTPS traffic from

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:59.540
internet, allow HTTPS traffic from internet. So maybe I can

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:04.380
HTTP and HTTPS both secure, non-secure both and then storage

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:07.660
configuration. So I believe this is fine even lesser than

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:11.480
this is fine for today's task actually, right? So one into

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:15.360
eight. That gigabyte, that's completely fine for me for

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:21.680
today, right? And then advanced detail wise. So nothing is

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:25.280
required by the way. Auto recovery, transmission protection,

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:28.200
stop is not required. Credit placement group is not

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:32.740
required. Okay. So rest of these things looks fine to me.

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:36.880
Maybe I can try to click on launch instances. So are we able

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:40.860
to select each and everything guys? Yeah. Are we able to

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:41.460
select each?

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:56.060
Everything? Yes. Same thing, same operation that we have

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:58.680
done last time. So launching EC2 instance, launching any

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:03.240
machine inside AWS is not at all a big deal, right? So if

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:06.760
everything is ready and here, so you will be able to see the

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:10.040
specification, right? And again, so firewall and security

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:12.580
settings, all these things we can try to change even in a

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:16.220
later stage. So even after launch, we will be able to change

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:18.600
inbound traffic and outbound traffic. All those things are

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:22.860
possible. So here I can try to click and click on launch.

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:25.620
Launch instances. It will take maybe a couple of like, you

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:27.240
know, second of time to launch.

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:17.100
Free version allows me T3. Yeah, you can go with T2, T3,

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:20.740
anything is fine. And T2, T3, like both are available in a

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:23.860
free version. So you don't have to worry much about it.

00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:08.870
Yeah. Okay. So now I think everything is like up and

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:12.610
running. So now if I have to connect with my instance, I can

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:16.170
simply click on over here and I will be able to launch my

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:21.490
instances. Simple, right? So here I can try to click on

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:25.150
connect and then I will be able to like click on connect

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:29.610
once again and it is going to give me a console access. So

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:32.430
from this particular console, I will be able to access my

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:36.850
machine. So here, yes, I'm able to access my machine CLEAR.

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:40.550
Let me write clear. Yeah. So this machine is available to me

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:43.450
now and I can do whatever I want with respect to this

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:46.710
particular machine. Okay. So first of all, what we are going

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:50.770
to do, so we are going to create some of the services which

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:54.150
must be up and running inside this particular machine. And

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:56.830
once those services will be up and running inside this

00:40:56.830 --> 00:41:01.450
machine, then we will try to see how we can try to route it,

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:05.090
right? How we can try to basically route it to our outer

00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:10.690
world or you can say how we will be able to route it with my

00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:15.470
own respective domain. Yeah. So here, what we can do, so we

00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:20.410
can try to run some of the services, for example, a flask

00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:24.290
application or maybe a fast API application we can try to

00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:29.550
run inside this one. So to run this fast API application,

00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:32.690
the way we try to run it inside our local system. So in the

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:36.270
similar manner, we can try to run it even over here. Before

00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:38.690
that, so whenever you are going to launch a new machine, so

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:41.170
you have to run couple of commands, which is going to update

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:46.090
your entire machine. So here we can try to write sudo apt,

00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:51.890
apt is nothing but basically like a place or we can say a

00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:53.850
library from where it is going to download each and

00:41:53.850 --> 00:42:00.670
everything in a sudo mode. Update and I'm going to do sudo

00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:09.410
apt upgrade run

00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:13.230
in background. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So let me do this command.

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:17.890
Let me ping you this command to all of you. Just a machine

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:19.650
upgradation I'm trying to do over here.

00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:35.510
So update your machine everyone quickly.

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:33.860
sudo apt command not found. So I believe you have not

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:36.960
selected a correct image. So maybe you have selected some

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.280
different image. So try to select a Ubuntu when you are

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.360
launching your EC2 instances.

00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:46.270
And here, if it is showing you Ubuntu, then sudo apt will

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:52.820
work. Yeah. Okay, fine. So this upgradation is done inside

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:56.100
my system. So like we are able to upgrade our images over

00:43:56.100 --> 00:44:00.140
here. Now we can try to install a virtual environment here.

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:03.160
So we can try to install a Python as well as we can try to

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:05.340
install a virtual environment. So this is a command everyone

00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:09.180
so just try to run it and it is going to install a Python

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:12.700
and then it is going to install a virtual environment so

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:15.500
that I will be able to create a virtual environment the way

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:18.520
we used to create it inside our local system. So here again

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:21.920
sudo apt install what? So install basically Python and then

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:24.340
like a Python virtual environment. This is what we are doing

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:28.420
in this command. So command is already available. Do it

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:28.620
guys.

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:09.360
Done everyone. Yeah. So are we able to install Python and

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:13.240
are we able to install a Python virtual environment? Simple

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:15.520
sudo apt install Python and then Python virtual environment.

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:19.940
This is what we are doing. Okay, now once this is done, then

00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:22.700
let us do one thing. So let us try to create one directory.

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:25.940
So a project directory maybe we can try to create and then

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:29.540
inside that, so we can try to create a virtual environment

00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:32.300
and then we can try to activate it. So maybe I can try to

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:38.220
write over here. So mkdir fast API. You can try to give any

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:41.520
name of your choice. I don't have any kind of issue. So

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:44.660
mkdir make directory fast API hyphen app. So this is a

00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:47.880
directory which I have made. Now if I am going to do LSL, I

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:50.760
will be able to see the directory as you can see. Now I will

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:54.560
get into this fast API directory CD. Now I am inside this

00:45:54.560 --> 00:46:01.110
fast API directory. So create one directory. Everyone. So

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:03.790
after creating a directory, after getting into that

00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:06.150
directory, as you can see, even if you are going to fire

00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:09.050
PWD, present working directory, you will be able to see a

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:12.590
newly created directory name along with this home slash

00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:17.990
ubuntu. So I am inside this directory, fast API hyphen app

00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:21.410
directory. Now inside that, I will try to, you know, create

00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:24.830
a virtual environment. So to create a virtual environment,

00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:28.730
command is Python. Let's suppose Python 3 I have been using.

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:35.610
So Python 3. Hyphen m, venv, virtual environment. And then

00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:38.470
we can try to give virtual environment name as a venv

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:39.570
itself. So that's fine.

00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:48.630
Okay. So looks like it is able to create a virtual

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:52.110
environment. We can try to do LSL once again, just to check

00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:55.250
what it has done. So yeah, it is able to create this

00:46:55.250 --> 00:46:58.750
directory, which is eventually a virtual environment for me.

00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:02.670
Now what I can do, I can try to activate this virtual

00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:06.270
environment. Yeah. So the way we try to activate this

00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:09.010
virtual environment inside our local system in a similar

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:16.730
manner, we can try to activate it. So S O U R C source, and

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:22.730
again, venv inside that. So there will be bin inside that

00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:27.190
there will be activate. So yeah, as you can see, virtual

00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:30.950
environment is activated. So this is activated for me.

00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:36.010
Command. Command to mkdir. Okay. That's a serious issue.

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:40.610
Mkdir and then directory name. So whatever directory that

00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:42.790
you would like to create, mkdir means make directory.

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:50.060
Done everyone. So are we able to create a directory? Are we

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:51.840
able to create a virtual environment? Are we able to

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:55.640
activate that? Everyone just like working with the windows

00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:58.120
machine or any other machine. So it's not different at all.

00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:00.360
Not even a 1%.

00:48:12.370 --> 00:48:12.810
Yeah.

00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:19.800
History. Let me copy and paste all the command, which I have

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:23.580
executed. Yeah. In my system. So these are the command guys

00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:25.100
I have executed so far.

00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:51.830
Okay. So once this is done, let me clear my screen. Okay. So

00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:54.390
once this is done, once we are able to activate our virtual

00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:57.650
environment, so maybe we can try to upgrade our pip so that

00:48:57.650 --> 00:48:59.970
it should not give me any kind of an issue. And then we can

00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:03.670
try to install fast API and uecon because if we have to

00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:06.070
launch some Python is already available. Python I'm able to

00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:08.830
install. Right. Even I'm able to create a virtual

00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:10.730
environment with respect to python, which is eventually

00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:14.650
required for any kind of a project. So that is done. Uh, now

00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:17.550
what we can do, so we can try to maybe upgrade just a pip

00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:20.290
without even a gradation is going to work, but generally

00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:22.770
it's a norm so that it should not give me any kind of a

00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:27.630
issue. So pip install, hyphen hyphen upgrade and then

00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:31.490
upgrade what's upgrade pip for me. So it is going to like,

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:34.490
uh, build a latest one. Okay. So operation is done. Now

00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:38.270
let's do one thing. So install. So pip install what fast API

00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:40.550
or any other thing that you would like to install. You can

00:49:40.550 --> 00:49:41.890
try it. You can try to install it. You can even try to

00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:45.410
create a requirements dot txt file and you can try to run it

00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:49.210
in a single sort that is going to work. Uh, so just like it

00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:54.310
works, right? So pip install fast API and then, uh, uecon

00:49:54.310 --> 00:49:59.810
uecon so that I can run my server, uecon uecon. So it is

00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:02.650
going to install these two library, fast API and a uecon.

00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:09.600
Done everyone.

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:26.500
Yeah. So are we able to install library and a fast API and

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:34.420
uecon? Python is already available. Okay. So I am able to

00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:39.000
install all of these, uh, libraries, right? Okay. So once

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.620
this is done, then what we can do, so we can try to create

00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:46.480
one file. So where we are going to keep our code, right? And

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:48.820
then we can try to run that particular file, a very, very

00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:52.440
simple one. So any idea how we can create a file over here?

00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:57.710
Yes. Any idea how we can create? I believe we have created a

00:50:57.710 --> 00:51:00.210
file. We have edited a file. Last week itself.

00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:09.090
Yeah. Nano or maybe we can try to use a vim. Yeah. So why

00:51:09.090 --> 00:51:13.070
touch? Yes. All of these things are available to all of us.

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:18.130
So I can try to write maybe, uh, over here, nano, uh, let me

00:51:18.130 --> 00:51:23.570
clear my screen. Okay. Nano. And then maybe main.py file. So

00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:27.290
a Python file we are going to create a, okay. So what

00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:32.410
happens? Nano not found. Okay. It's not. No, no. It's nano.

00:51:32.530 --> 00:51:39.830
N-A-N-O. Nano. Main.py file. Fine. So this is a file that we

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:42.830
are able to create now inside that what we can do. So we can

00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:48.770
try to keep a piece of a code. So this is a piece of a code.

00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:51.850
You can try to use any file editor. I don't have any kind of

00:51:51.850 --> 00:51:55.690
issue. So I'm using like a nano and I'm just trying to keep

00:51:55.690 --> 00:51:59.330
this fast API, import fast API, creating a object of fast

00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:02.490
API. Okay. And then I'm trying to create one simple

00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:05.430
function. I'm trying to write a message. Hello world from

00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:10.370
fast API on EC2 and uh, it will be available on a route

00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:13.890
itself means on a URL itself, it will be available. So

00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:16.630
whenever I'm going to hit, it should give me, you know, uh,

00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:19.430
this particular message that is something that we are going

00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:24.890
to do it. So here just save it. So control S and then

00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:30.090
control X simple. Yeah. Control S and control X. I can even

00:52:30.090 --> 00:52:33.790
do a cat just to do a cross check. So yes, inside this file,

00:52:33.930 --> 00:52:38.390
uh, this is a piece of a code which is already available. So

00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:42.690
just create a file, control S, control X, control S for

00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:47.650
save, control X for exit. If you are using nano, if you are

00:52:47.650 --> 00:52:52.190
using vim, then in that case, escape colon WQ for save and

00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:53.570
quit cat

00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:05.880
for looking into any like a file content basically. Okay.

00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:08.680
Without getting into a file, I

00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:15.460
mean like it will go into a file, but it will not open up

00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:18.980
the file. So in a read mode, it is going to show you all the

00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:24.500
content of the file in your console itself. Done guys,

00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:27.140
everyone. I have already pinged you a code that I'm keeping

00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:29.660
inside and this code is not a big one. It's like a very,

00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:32.500
very small one. I think we all can understand with no time.

00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:41.000
Yeah. Then everyone. Okay. So now I have a file. Okay. Let

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:44.800
me do like a LSL over here. So I have a file called as main

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:49.060
.py file as you can see. And inside that, so I have a very,

00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:52.760
very small flask, sorry, fast API application, right? So if

00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:54.860
I'm going to run this particular file, so obviously it is

00:53:54.860 --> 00:54:01.320
going to invoke that fast API. So how we can run guys, how

00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:07.740
we can run this main.py file. Yeah. How we can run this main

00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:08.280
.py file?

00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:23.400
By using uvcon. Yeah. Same as local system. So even in local

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:27.080
system, we used to run this like a py file, right? So uvcon

00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:31.100
to activate my server. So uvcon and my file name is what? My

00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:33.840
file name is main, right? If my file name is different, then

00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:36.420
obviously I should write different thing over here and

00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:40.140
inside a file. So I have application and that object name is

00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:45.060
basically app. So uvcon main app, and then I can mention a

00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:50.040
host. So host is going to be a local 0.0.0.0, right? And

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:53.380
then we can try to mention a port numbers on which port it

00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:57.460
is supposed to execute it inside my current EC2 machine. So

00:54:57.460 --> 00:55:01.100
uvcon main app host, I have given a local host and then port

00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:04.940
I have given over here as 8,000. So this is something that

00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:09.880
you have to run and if everything goes well, you will be

00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:13.220
able to see your application up and running at this

00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:17.820
particular URL. Yeah. At this particular URL, this is up and

00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:19.920
running. It means if I'm going to run this application. I am

00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:23.500
going to hit this URL. So obviously I'm supposed to get this

00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:26.920
particular message, right? That my server is up and running

00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:30.260
for any application simple. So even last time when we were

00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:33.640
trying to run a open web UI, obviously it was running on

00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:37.760
some particular address and a particular port number. So how

00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:42.460
I will be able to access this guys, any idea? Yes. How I

00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:46.060
will be able to access it, how I will be able to access this

00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:49.940
message, message hello world from a fast API on EC2,

00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:08.610
curl

00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:21.300
localhost, is it URL plus root directory, URL plus root

00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:30.700
directory, postman, see. So this is my 0.0.0.0 8,000. Now

00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:34.540
this is running inside, right? This is running inside this

00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:38.680
EC2 machine and let's suppose if I'm trying to hit it from

00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:42.360
here, from this particular browser. Right? So this is a

00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:47.560
external system for this EC2 machine. This is inside my AWS,

00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:51.620
right? And if I'm going to hit something from this one, it's

00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:53.900
not going to be same. So I'm trying to hit from my local

00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:56.880
machine. If I'm trying to open it up inside this browser or

00:56:56.880 --> 00:57:00.200
maybe from a postman, if I'm trying to hit it. So again, I'm

00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:03.460
trying to hit it from my local machine to our AWS. This

00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:09.560
address is basically a local to a EC2 machine itself. EC2

00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:13.620
instance itself. I think we all know it, right? So those who

00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:16.480
are saying postman or like a local host or something. So I

00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:19.860
think your fundamentals are not good at all. You should

00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:24.660
again revisit your API classes, which I have already taken

00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:29.480
in the beginning of the lecture itself. If you are still

00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:35.500
facing an issue. So here what we can do, so this is my EC2

00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:38.920
instances where one of my application is up and running. Now

00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:44.840
if you will go here, you will be able to find out this

00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:48.940
public DNS. You will be able to find out this public DNS. So

00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:55.280
maybe you can try to copy this public DNS from here and then

00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:59.340
you can try to maybe hit it in this particular place and

00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:02.340
let's see. So whether it is able to give you something or

00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:04.980
not. So hopefully it is not going to give you anything for

00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:09.040
now. And there is a reason behind it. Okay. Any idea? So why

00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:12.860
it is not going to give me or maybe I can say a colon 8000

00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:16.160
because at 8000 port number inside this machine, something

00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:19.060
is running, right? I'm running something. So it is not

00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:25.030
giving me anything guys. Any idea why? So Pradeep is saying

00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:30.310
not expose a port. Exactly. That's the reason. Yes. Need to

00:58:30.310 --> 00:58:33.710
update the inbound rule. I think all of you remember. Good.

00:58:33.930 --> 00:58:38.770
Well done. So see, I'm trying to hit this machine, our EC2

00:58:38.770 --> 00:58:41.090
machine that we have. And there is something which is

00:58:41.090 --> 00:58:43.870
running on 8000 port number. My application, by the way, my

00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:48.370
fast API application, my API is running over there. I'm

00:58:48.370 --> 00:58:51.310
trying to hit it. But yeah, so it is not giving me anything.

00:58:51.390 --> 00:58:55.310
The reason could be my firewall, right? Reason could be my

00:58:55.310 --> 00:58:59.710
security. So maybe it's not allowed to hit from some

00:58:59.710 --> 00:59:04.490
external system to my EC2 machine, which is hosted on AWS

00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:08.830
system or cluster, you can say. So here, what would I should

00:59:08.830 --> 00:59:11.490
do guys? Next. Excuse me. I think we have already done that

00:59:11.490 --> 00:59:18.500
last time. Yeah. So there is a tab called a security tab. So

00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:22.780
we can go to security tab, right? And inside the security

00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:27.640
tab, you will be able to find out inbound rule. Inbound rule

00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:31.340
by, so it is allowing you by default 22 number port inbound

00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:36.060
22 means you can do SSH by the way, right? You can come to a

00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:40.780
443 and you can come to 80, but 8000 is not opened up.

00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:45.540
Right. 8000 is not opened up. So how we can try to like

00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:49.600
change this one. I believe we have done that even last time.

00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:52.420
So I can try to click on the security group, which has been

00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:56.340
attached to this particular instance. And after clicking on

00:59:56.340 --> 00:59:59.340
the security group, so I can try to click on edit inbound

00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:03.540
rule. So I'm going to allow a traffic, right? So inbound. So

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:07.440
here I can try to click and add a rule. So add rule wise. So

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:13.080
fine. We can try to like, you know, add. All the traffic

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:18.360
possible, or maybe I can try to add custom TCP, HTTP, HTTPS,

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:22.900
whatever I want, I can try to do it. So maybe I can write a

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:26.960
custom TCP as of now and then port range. So port wise I can

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:32.080
give 8000 precisely. Yeah. And then here. So anywhere I can

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:35.940
save anywhere from IP address. So from anywhere, anyone will

01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:39.620
be able to hit it and then click on save rule. So once this

01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:42.920
rule will be saved, you can come over here once again. And

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:47.800
now I'm able to see a message quickly. Yeah. Message hello

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:52.160
world from fast API on EC2. This was my actual message and

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:56.600
this was a server, right? So this, this is, this is

01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:59.500
something which I'm able to access it now. This is a fast

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:04.400
API. So I can even do slash DOCS and I will be able to

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:10.600
access my swagger UI. Yeah. Yeah. Swagger UI as well. So

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:15.260
okay. This URL is working. This is basically a public URL.

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:18.320
Now if I'm going to give you this URL, even you will be able

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:22.840
to access something which is running inside my machine. So

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:23.860
let me ping you this URL.

01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:29.640
How did you edit an inbound rule? Okay. I'm showing you once

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:32.980
again guys. So see for any machine which is running inside

01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:36.440
your system, right? So let's suppose there is a EC2 machine

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:41.180
which is running over here. So click on your EC2. Okay. This

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:43.820
is the machine interface. Now come to security. This one

01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:47.280
security tab for this machine by the way. So come to

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:50.800
security. Now for every machine there will be a security

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.720
group which will be attached at the time of creation itself.

01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:57.700
Now so click over here and then inside that edit inbound

01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:01.720
rule. Simple. Same thing we have done last time even if you

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:08.040
remember. Done everyone. So I believe all of you are able to

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:11.080
access your application and all of you are able to access

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:14.620
even my application. Okay. Which is already running inside a

01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:16.320
EC2 instances.

01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:38.460
Yes, everyone done.

01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:16.220
Yeah. So anyone guys who is able to do it?

01:04:12.770 --> 01:04:18.450
Yeah. Okay. Now, so till this point application is running

01:04:18.450 --> 01:04:23.690
and yeah, so any, yeah, many people were trying to hit my

01:04:23.690 --> 01:04:28.150
server and I can see a logs over here. Right. So people are

01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:31.070
trying to hit it, hit my URL and I believe you are able to

01:04:31.070 --> 01:04:36.250
get something out of it. Okay. Now, so once this is up and

01:04:36.250 --> 01:04:40.710
running inside my machine and I can't, I can't, you know,

01:04:41.350 --> 01:04:44.850
keep this entire application up and running in this

01:04:44.850 --> 01:04:47.770
particular mode, this is our development mode. I can say,

01:04:47.830 --> 01:04:50.610
right, this is our development mode. So where, you know,

01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:53.570
things are running, you are going to hit the URL, you are

01:04:53.570 --> 01:04:56.790
going to do some sort of a debugging, but in general, so

01:04:56.790 --> 01:05:00.050
when we talk about basically a production grade system,

01:05:00.250 --> 01:05:03.270
right? So everything. Everything is supposed to run in a

01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:06.770
background. Yeah. Everything is supposed to run inside a, in

01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:09.850
a background. So first of all, what we have to do, so we

01:05:09.850 --> 01:05:13.010
have to change this particular approach. So we have to run

01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:17.150
each and everything into a background and then what we can

01:05:17.150 --> 01:05:20.150
do, we can do a port mapping and then what we can do, we can

01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:24.570
do a DNS, DNS mapping. So elastic IP, which I have already

01:05:24.570 --> 01:05:29.810
mentioned over here and route 53, all of these things we are

01:05:29.810 --> 01:05:33.650
going to implement. So, so far this hello world application

01:05:33.650 --> 01:05:36.850
is running, but I have to send this hello world application

01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:40.270
in a background as a background process, it should be up and

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:44.030
running automatically. Uh, so that, you know, uh, I don't

01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:46.950
know what, because if I'm going to close this screen or if

01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:49.730
I'm going to do control X, control X, the entire application

01:05:49.730 --> 01:05:52.350
will go down, which I don't want and I can't keep my system

01:05:52.350 --> 01:05:55.970
up and running in this manner. So here, first of all, let's

01:05:55.970 --> 01:05:59.410
try to terminate this entire application and one by one,

01:05:59.490 --> 01:06:03.250
let's try to understand that how we can try to make it up

01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:09.430
and running in a background, right? So control X, control X

01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:14.530
here. So I have already closed this application. Now what is

01:06:14.530 --> 01:06:17.290
the next step for me? Now this application is not up and

01:06:17.290 --> 01:06:21.350
running. This application is gone. So here I have to create

01:06:21.350 --> 01:06:26.590
a service which will allow me to, you know, run things in a

01:06:26.590 --> 01:06:31.830
background. Let's do it then. Yeah. So there is something

01:06:31.830 --> 01:06:37.350
called as a system S Y S T E M D basically. So which is

01:06:37.350 --> 01:06:41.130
going to help me out to run my fast API into a background.

01:06:41.590 --> 01:06:45.250
Now to do that, uh, I can try to write over here, pseudo

01:06:45.250 --> 01:06:50.170
nano. So I can try to like, uh, create one file ETC, which

01:06:50.170 --> 01:06:54.370
is our directory already available. So ETC S Y S T E M D

01:06:54.370 --> 01:06:59.410
background, uh, like a system process. System. And then we

01:06:59.410 --> 01:07:03.970
can try to create a file called as fast API dot S E R V I C

01:07:03.970 --> 01:07:07.570
service. So here it is going to create this particular file

01:07:07.570 --> 01:07:10.390
inside this particular folder. And inside this file, I'm

01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:13.770
going to write, uh, uh, basically each and everything which

01:07:13.770 --> 01:07:17.070
is required to run something into a background. So here

01:07:17.070 --> 01:07:21.890
just, uh, hit this and it is going to open up a nano editor.

01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:26.290
Okay. So this one guys, so basically I'm, I have created a

01:07:26.290 --> 01:07:29.010
file, right? So a file which is going to help me out in

01:07:29.010 --> 01:07:32.150
terms of running things in a background now.

01:07:39.370 --> 01:07:47.780
So inside this file, just try to keep these things. So there

01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:51.540
is a script which you have to keep inside this file, a

01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:52.820
background file that you have created.

01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:18.660
Yeah. So just try to keep all of these things inside this

01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:20.800
file. I'll tell you what this file is actually doing and

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:25.640
what we have mentioned inside this file one by one. But

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:29.120
yeah. So first of all, create it, save it, control S and

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:31.580
then take exit fine.

01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:44.540
Now just try to do this, uh, cat so that you will be able to

01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:49.600
see a content of this file. Okay. So this is the content of

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:52.860
this file as you can see now what this file is technically

01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:56.540
trying to do. So this file is going to help me out to run

01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:58.760
something in a background because I have created this file

01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:02.380
inside a system D. So system D means basically anything that

01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:05.160
we have to run in the background. So we can try to create a

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:08.340
file inside that and then we can try to activate it. So we

01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:10.520
have already mentioned that what is our working directory.

01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:14.120
So home slash Ubuntu slash fast API hyphen app. This is my

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:18.420
working directory by the way, right? So fast API hyphen app.

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.580
So whatever working directory that I have, I can try to

01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:23.800
mention that particular part. Now where is my environment

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:26.340
available? So I have already created an environment inside

01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:28.820
this one. So I have mentioned that particular location

01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:33.120
itself. And then what is the exact command? That? That we

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:36.760
have fired at the time of starting our application. So you

01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:40.220
will call main app, host this port, this one as simple as

01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:43.860
that, right? So same thing we have mentioned over here,

01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:46.400
restart always so that it will be able to, you know, restart

01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:49.000
always whenever we are going to make some sort of changes.

01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:52.900
So these are the things that we have like the mentioned,

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:55.600
right? So if application is going to crash, it is going to

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:59.420
automatically restart it so that it will make sure that it

01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:06.140
is on a high availability. Yeah. So here, uh, basically, uh,

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:08.460
this is something that we have kept inside this particular

01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:12.020
file and it is going to help me out to run services in my

01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:16.560
background. Now how I will be able to reload this particular

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:19.700
service, how I will be able to activate this particular

01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:24.080
service. So now to activate this particular service, I have

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:29.940
to write sudo systemctl daemon de daemon.

01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:35.940
Daemon reload, then

01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:45.520
enable fast API. So sudo systemctl enable fast

01:10:47.850 --> 01:10:51.790
API. So it is going to activate that created basically a

01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:54.790
system link, find fast API dot service it is able to create

01:10:54.790 --> 01:11:02.370
and then start, start what? So start fast API service that

01:11:02.370 --> 01:11:06.370
we have already created. And, uh, so it has already started

01:11:06.370 --> 01:11:10.350
and then I can try to even check the status. So systemctl

01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:17.790
status fast API. So yeah, it is telling me that it's up and

01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:20.710
running. Yeah. It is telling me. So whenever I have to come

01:11:20.710 --> 01:11:24.470
and check, uh, that, uh, whether this fast API is up and

01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:27.810
running or not. So I can try to check that part. So here is

01:11:27.810 --> 01:11:30.690
a command guys, I'm pinging you. So starting from like a

01:11:30.690 --> 01:11:34.290
reload to enabling the fast API. Yeah. Checking the fast API

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:38.390
and checking the status. So here my status is active. It's

01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:40.950
up and running. Right. Again, if I have to come and check

01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:43.790
any time, so I can try to come and check at any point of a

01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:48.010
time. So it's activated, it's up and running. So just, just

01:11:48.010 --> 01:11:51.690
do this and, uh, it's, it's running in my background by the

01:11:51.690 --> 01:11:53.830
way. Yeah. It's running in my background.

01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:12.960
So just do this process everyone and let me know. Then we'll

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:14.380
come move to the next one.

01:12:33.050 --> 01:12:35.670
One quick question. Service file is under root or virtual

01:12:35.670 --> 01:12:38.250
environment. No. Inside a root by the way. I have created

01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:40.710
this inside the ATC, right? It's inside the root.

01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:49.470
We are giving a virtual environment access to that one.

01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:04.340
Yeah. Okay. Now, so once this is done, so maybe we can do a

01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:13.660
smaller testing over here so we can try to check our EC2

01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:18.400
instance. We can try to copy this IP address and then we can

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:24.740
try to like a call 8000 slash DOC. And let's see, so whether

01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:27.360
it's working or not, hopefully it will not work.

01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:36.940
Yeah.

01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:49.600
Okay. So till this point, uh, everything is up and running

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:52.280
and everything is up and running in a background, right? So

01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:54.640
everything is up and running. I can even come and configure

01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:57.480
and check once again. So yeah, fast API service, fast API,

01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:01.940
you can app and, uh, technically it's, uh, up and running at

01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:06.800
127.0.0.1 port number 8,000. Now let's do one thing, right?

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:09.640
Let's do one thing. So let's try to use a port forwarding.

01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:12.880
So basically whatever is running at a 8,000 port number. So

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:16.240
let's try to forward it to a 80 port number to do that. So

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:19.240
we can try to use maybe a NGINX. I believe even in the local

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:22.520
system we have already used it. So let's try to install

01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:27.320
first of all NGINX and then let's try to like, uh, change a

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:30.980
port number. Yeah. So here after creating a NGINX

01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:33.200
configuration so that I can do a port forwarding. So

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:35.880
whatever is running or whatever traffic will come on a

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:40.000
particular port will redirect to the 8,000 port number. So

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.980
here, let me clear my screen, CLEAR, clear, just like doing

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:47.460
it in a local, so nothing different. So sudo apt, first of

01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:54.560
all, install in NGINX. So sudo apt install hyphen Y N G I N

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:57.120
X. So everyone

01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:01.780
just install it.

01:15:12.710 --> 01:15:14.770
Done everyone till this point.

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:24.360
Yeah. Any, anyone who is, who is able to do it?

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:32.440
Okay. Yogesh has asked me a question that what should be

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:35.200
the, uh, command to install. Stop a background services,

01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:38.560
nothing simple sudo sudo systemctl stop. And then the

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:43.640
service name fast API dot service, it will stop the start

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:48.480
and stop. So command is same sudo systemctl stop or start

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:50.040
and the service name.

01:15:56.300 --> 01:15:56.860
Yeah.

01:16:08.450 --> 01:16:13.830
Okay. So once I'm able to install this NGINX, now let's try

01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:18.050
to create a configuration for NGINX. So clear the screen and

01:16:18.050 --> 01:16:22.850
then try to create one file sudo nano. And uh. Here inside,

01:16:22.970 --> 01:16:30.070
uh, ETC folder, ETC slash NGINX, uh, slash site available

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:37.400
slash fast API. So this is a file. It is going to basically

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:44.720
create S I T site, A V A I L A B L E available fast API. Now

01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:49.200
inside that, right, so now inside that, so you can try to

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:54.680
paste this piece of a code, which I'm going to ping you. So

01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:59.620
just paste this piece of the code inside this file. So I'm

01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:02.940
giving you a sudo nano as well. And plus this one. So here

01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:05.200
we are not doing anything much. So we are trying to like,

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:08.480
uh, just pass the proxy. So whatever is running on one 27.0

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:11.820
.0.1 eventually, which is my current application, which is

01:17:11.820 --> 01:17:14.900
running on this particular port number. So I'm just trying

01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:17.460
to like, uh, you know, forward it. Right. So I'm saying

01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:20.440
that, that, okay. So listen to eight 80 port number. So

01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:23.560
whenever traffic comes. Yeah. It goes to 80 port number. And

01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:27.940
then from there it goes to 8,000, which is actually like a,

01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:31.940
my machine and my application. So where actual fast API is

01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:34.720
running. So this is what we have done. So this is basically

01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:37.500
a NGINX file configuration for this fast API application

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:43.180
that we have created. So control S control X. What

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:21.640
happened to why this is not to working save

01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:25.620
modified buffer.

01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:54.460
Oh, I'll have to activate my. Uh, environment once again,

01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:57.160
but let me check, let

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:02.000
me know

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:32.520
why this command is not working. Save modified buffer. Yes.

01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:33.300
Simple.

01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:24.110
It's giving me some issue guys with respect to my nano

01:21:24.110 --> 01:21:26.550
editor. Let me check. It's a temporary issue.

01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:34.960
Sudo nano this, this, this, okay. And uh, okay. ETC NGINX

01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:40.380
site available does not exist. Okay. Fine. That is it. That

01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:42.200
is a major issue.

01:22:12.290 --> 01:22:16.210
Okay. Now it's working. So you have to go into this

01:22:16.210 --> 01:22:17.670
directory and

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:28.000
then you have to go here and then you have to basically keep

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.980
this as a port forwarding inside your system. And uh, let's

01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:36.820
check. So whether my fast API is still running or not. So

01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:39.520
yeah, even I have like a reference, this entire things, but

01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:44.440
it's still, my API is up and running at 127.0.0.1, uh, 8

01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:47.560
,000. So because it's running in as a background process, so

01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:52.280
it will keep up and running all the time basically now. So

01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:54.900
as we are able to create a port forwarding configuration,

01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:59.460
right? So we are able to do that. So here what we can do,

01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:00.460
okay.

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:15.740
So here what we can do, so we can try to basically enable

01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:20.000
the configuration. So to enable this configuration, there is

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.400
a couple of commands. So here, go to this one. And then etc

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:26.700
site enable. So it is going to enable it. So I'm pinging you

01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:29.040
this command guys, and don't worry, I'm going to provide

01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:33.120
even a documentation for this one and uh, remove the default

01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:35.780
site enabled one. So whatever is available inside the site

01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:40.500
enable default one, just remove it. Just keeping my system

01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:47.440
clean and then sudo ng-annex p, so configuration file system

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:51.580
is okay. Test is successful. Okay, fine. So ng-annex

01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:54.180
configuration is successful. This is just a test command.

01:23:54.820 --> 01:24:01.420
And then I'm going to restart my ng-annex server. So here

01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:04.620
just restart your ng-annex server. So this is the command.

01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:09.740
Now once you are going to hit this command, then just go to

01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:11.700
your like a IP

01:24:13.850 --> 01:24:16.590
address, which is visible inside your EC2 instances and

01:24:16.590 --> 01:24:19.490
without even any port number, you will be able to see it. So

01:24:19.490 --> 01:24:21.890
by default, what is happening? So by default, it is trying

01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:24.730
to send a traffic. So by default, what is happening? So I'm

01:24:24.730 --> 01:24:27.350
going to set a port number 80 and as per our ng-annex, so

01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:31.710
port number 80 is mapped to port number 8000 and at 8000 in

01:24:31.710 --> 01:24:35.930
my local system 127.0.0.1 which is local to my EC2, my

01:24:35.930 --> 01:24:39.170
application is running and from this is a place that is able

01:24:39.170 --> 01:24:44.090
to access it. So now this is a URL without any port number

01:24:44.090 --> 01:24:46.770
as you can see it's everything is running. So I've just

01:24:46.770 --> 01:24:52.130
mapped 80 to 8000 is the default one. Okay. Now, once this

01:24:52.130 --> 01:24:55.870
is done. Once this particular part is done. Maybe I can I

01:24:55.870 --> 01:24:59.990
can even check like a swagger UI DOCS right DOCS and this is

01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:02.690
how we do a production grade deployment if I am using EC2

01:25:02.690 --> 01:25:05.810
instances and if my backend services running my frontend

01:25:05.810 --> 01:25:08.710
services running or any other services is running. So this

01:25:08.710 --> 01:25:11.570
is how we try to even do it every time every time with

01:25:11.570 --> 01:25:14.950
respect to EC2. Again there are multiple way of doing a

01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:18.070
deployment. So basically we can try to even deploy it as a

01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:20.850
container. So there is something called as ECS service

01:25:20.850 --> 01:25:24.330
inside AWS there is something called as EKS as a service. So

01:25:24.330 --> 01:25:27.630
there are so many like you know like a way by which I will

01:25:27.630 --> 01:25:29.810
be able to productionize an application. This is one of the

01:25:29.810 --> 01:25:33.410
way which I am showing you. So now my application is running

01:25:33.410 --> 01:25:37.230
on this particular URL like this particular URL. So whatever

01:25:37.230 --> 01:25:40.110
application I want I can run it. If I would like to run my

01:25:40.110 --> 01:25:43.570
website it is going to run it as simple as that right in the

01:25:43.570 --> 01:25:45.910
exact similar manner. So here I am using a fast API

01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:48.430
application. Maybe I can try to use something different and

01:25:48.430 --> 01:25:52.630
that's completely fine. So now once this is done right. Once

01:25:52.630 --> 01:25:55.990
this port forwarding. Port mapping is done. So my system is

01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:59.390
running a background processes means my API is running it as

01:25:59.390 --> 01:26:03.450
a background processes. I have just exposed it. Now I have

01:26:03.450 --> 01:26:07.470
to do a mapping right. I have to do a mapping. So I don't

01:26:07.470 --> 01:26:11.430
want this URL by the way. This URL is basically a EC2 URL. I

01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:16.790
don't want that one. I want my own like a domain which I

01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:20.010
have purchased right from maybe Hostinger from maybe GoDaddy

01:26:20.010 --> 01:26:22.990
or from some other provider. I have already purchased it. So

01:26:22.990 --> 01:26:28.450
I would like to map this one with respect to my own domain

01:26:28.450 --> 01:26:31.190
right. Domain mapping. This is something that we are trying

01:26:31.190 --> 01:26:35.150
to learn today in today's class. So how I will be able to do

01:26:35.150 --> 01:26:38.650
it. So here as of now the IP address that you are able to

01:26:38.650 --> 01:26:41.730
see the IP address that is visible over here. So basically

01:26:41.730 --> 01:26:46.230
it's a public DNS right. It's basically a public DNS. It's

01:26:46.230 --> 01:26:49.750
not your private one. It's a public DNS right. Public DNS

01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:52.550
means. Once you are going to restart the system or you are

01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:54.850
going to refresh the system this IP address is going to

01:26:54.850 --> 01:26:58.750
basically change and if this is going to change then again

01:26:58.750 --> 01:27:03.270
you have to like change a mapping. So before that before

01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:05.850
sending any application to a production. So what we have to

01:27:05.850 --> 01:27:10.310
do. So we have to take a private IP or a kind of IP address

01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:13.350
a static IP address which should not change. So how I will

01:27:13.350 --> 01:27:16.550
be able to take that one and this is something called as

01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:19.590
elastic IP address. As of now. You will be able to see that

01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:22.890
there is no elastic IP address which has been assigned to my

01:27:22.890 --> 01:27:25.990
system right. It's blank by the way. So elastic IP is

01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:29.710
technically blank for me. So what I can do is that that I

01:27:29.710 --> 01:27:33.930
can try to take one elastic IP address and then I can try to

01:27:33.930 --> 01:27:36.350
you know configure it with respect to this particular

01:27:36.350 --> 01:27:41.070
machine. Because it will keep on changing. So it will keep

01:27:41.070 --> 01:27:44.210
on bouncing and again my application is not going to be live

01:27:44.210 --> 01:27:49.850
on the same DNS for the for forever. So here to take a new

01:27:49.850 --> 01:27:54.090
elastic IP address on the left hand side you can come to

01:27:54.090 --> 01:27:57.170
network and security and inside network security you will be

01:27:57.170 --> 01:27:59.910
able to see something called as elastic IP address. So click

01:27:59.910 --> 01:28:03.870
on this elastic IP address and then you can try to like see

01:28:03.870 --> 01:28:07.250
an option called as allocate elastic IP address with public

01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:09.530
IP address you can't send something to the production as

01:28:09.530 --> 01:28:12.630
simple as that. You have to take the elastic IP address. So

01:28:12.630 --> 01:28:16.810
allocate IP address. Yeah. Yeah. And imagine pool of IV for

01:28:16.810 --> 01:28:20.330
like IP address I can try to select a network border group

01:28:20.330 --> 01:28:25.130
maybe south. That's completely fine. Tag optional global

01:28:25.130 --> 01:28:28.190
static IP address it is going to allocate. So click on this

01:28:28.190 --> 01:28:34.390
allocate. Yeah. Click on this allocate and here. So this is

01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:40.070
basically the IP address it is able to create. Yeah. This is

01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:42.470
the IP address it is able to basically create. This is the

01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:43.990
IP address. This is the IP address it is able to give it to

01:28:43.990 --> 01:28:51.210
me now. So once I'm able to obtain this IP address is it

01:28:51.210 --> 01:28:55.550
fine guys are we able to do it. Yeah. Are we able to take

01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:56.990
one elastic IP address.

01:29:08.750 --> 01:29:14.510
Yeah. Okay. So here things are running means I'm able to

01:29:14.510 --> 01:29:17.450
take basically elastic IP address. Now what I can do I can

01:29:17.450 --> 01:29:21.570
try to click on associate elastic IP address simple so as of

01:29:21.570 --> 01:29:24.930
now you have just taken the IP address. By the way. Now if

01:29:24.930 --> 01:29:27.850
you'll go to your EC2 instance and if you will go and check

01:29:27.850 --> 01:29:31.690
again you will be able to see it blank. Yeah. Still you will

01:29:31.690 --> 01:29:34.370
be able to see it as a blank. So you have just taken a

01:29:34.370 --> 01:29:38.030
elastic IP address. You have not associated it. So this is

01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:41.190
my elastic IP address. So here you will be able to find out

01:29:41.190 --> 01:29:45.710
associate IP address and then with what you would like to

01:29:45.710 --> 01:29:48.330
associate. So I would like to associate with respect to my

01:29:48.330 --> 01:29:51.370
machine. Technically it's an instance. Right. Technically

01:29:51.370 --> 01:29:56.430
it's a instance. So here I can try to like a click and it is

01:29:56.430 --> 01:30:00.150
going to showcase all the instances which I have. So let's

01:30:00.150 --> 01:30:02.030
suppose I have created so many different different instances

01:30:02.030 --> 01:30:05.470
but there will be only one instance which is going to be the

01:30:05.470 --> 01:30:08.190
entry point. Let's suppose I'm working on a cluster. I have

01:30:08.190 --> 01:30:11.090
associated all those clusters but yeah entry point is going

01:30:11.090 --> 01:30:13.570
to be only one instance or whatever instance is your entry

01:30:13.570 --> 01:30:16.190
point. I can try to select it in this situation. So I just

01:30:16.190 --> 01:30:19.550
have one. So yeah it is like showing me one. So I can try to

01:30:19.550 --> 01:30:25.090
select that instance. And then associate simple. So now this

01:30:25.090 --> 01:30:27.630
IP address the elastic IP address which I was talking about

01:30:27.630 --> 01:30:31.570
now it's been associated. I can maybe try to like go to a

01:30:31.570 --> 01:30:34.570
dashboard instance running and then I can try to you know

01:30:34.570 --> 01:30:40.270
check over here. And yes now I'm able to see elastic IP

01:30:40.270 --> 01:30:41.010
address.

01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:49.730
Fine everyone. So now this is not going to change. This is

01:30:49.730 --> 01:30:51.850
what I'm trying to say. Right. This is not going to change.

01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:56.390
And you can try to even like. You know copy this URL and

01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:59.570
then hit it over here. You will be able to see your

01:30:59.570 --> 01:31:02.910
application up and running. So see my application is up and

01:31:02.910 --> 01:31:06.250
running. So whether it's a public or private public means it

01:31:06.250 --> 01:31:09.390
will keep on changing. Keep on bouncing. Right. And this is

01:31:09.390 --> 01:31:12.350
my private. So basically it is not going to change now for

01:31:12.350 --> 01:31:15.050
this particular instances. So if service is up and running I

01:31:15.050 --> 01:31:17.770
will like it will it will be up and running for the infinite

01:31:17.770 --> 01:31:20.950
time. And this is basic unless and until I'm not going to

01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:26.670
disassociate it. Yeah. Now my application is running on this

01:31:26.670 --> 01:31:30.890
particular IP address. Now this IP address which I'm able to

01:31:30.890 --> 01:31:34.070
get it a static IP address or elastic IP address in terms of

01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:38.390
AWS. This is the IP address. Right. Now I can try to map it

01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:42.790
with my DNS domain name server. So whatever like a name

01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:46.310
which I'm going to take. So with that name I'm going to

01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:51.690
associate it. So if we are able to do it till this

01:31:51.690 --> 01:31:55.530
particular point then half of the work is done. Yeah. Half

01:31:55.530 --> 01:31:56.470
of the work is done.

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:11.220
What is the purpose of NGINX server root forwarding or port

01:32:11.220 --> 01:32:12.020
forwarding you can say.

01:32:18.110 --> 01:32:21.390
Elastic IP address for the specific API or for our. So here

01:32:21.390 --> 01:32:23.890
we have done a port forwarding but elastic IP address is

01:32:23.890 --> 01:32:26.790
basically an address of or entry point of your machine

01:32:26.790 --> 01:32:30.110
basically whatever is running in your machine. You can try

01:32:30.110 --> 01:32:35.780
to access it. Forwarding not forwarding depends like depends

01:32:35.780 --> 01:32:40.060
upon the purpose. Okay. So till this point I think if it is

01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:43.640
clear. Now let's go to the next step. Right. So this is the

01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:46.260
IP address and this is the static one. So obviously it is

01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:51.100
not going to change for me. Now coming to our next step by

01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:54.940
the way. So I'll try to log in into my GoDaddy account. So

01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:56.480
let me log in into my GoDaddy account.

01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:08.000
So anyone guys who is having some like a you know domain you

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.400
have purchased maybe in a past any anyone who is having

01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:10.640
that.

01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:14.080
Yeah.

01:33:45.850 --> 01:33:49.890
Okay. So here is my GoDaddy account and I have so many

01:33:49.890 --> 01:33:54.470
domain not just one or two domain. URI AI, the AI company,

01:33:54.750 --> 01:33:57.570
Yneurons AI, St. Mary's, India, St. Mary's, Jhanshyatpur,

01:33:57.690 --> 01:34:03.910
Euron.one, the one for your Euron like Euron where you are

01:34:03.910 --> 01:34:08.890
able to access it. Right. The AI company dot club. So I have

01:34:08.890 --> 01:34:11.950
like so many domain I can I can try to use any of these and

01:34:11.950 --> 01:34:16.070
I can just try to you know map it basically. And yeah

01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:18.550
generally I keep on purchasing. So I have a couple of more

01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:22.110
accounts as well. So where I keep on you know. Purchasing

01:34:22.110 --> 01:34:27.770
domain. So you need one domain by the way. So you have to go

01:34:27.770 --> 01:34:30.890
and buy one domain. So maybe in one dollar or maybe even in

01:34:30.890 --> 01:34:34.970
one rupees you will be able to get a lot of domains on so

01:34:34.970 --> 01:34:38.330
many platforms. Right. So any one single domain is required.

01:34:39.410 --> 01:34:42.370
Yeah. So if you are purchasing something which is associated

01:34:42.370 --> 01:34:44.850
with your business then obviously it's fine. Right. You have

01:34:44.850 --> 01:34:46.850
to check a price with GoDaddy or Hostinger or anyone.

01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:51.310
Otherwise any any domain is going to be fine. Any domain.

01:34:51.530 --> 01:34:55.150
Right. So just you have to have like a one single domain.

01:34:55.610 --> 01:35:01.150
OK. So I can try to map any of my domain with this IP

01:35:01.150 --> 01:35:05.250
address which is like a which is associated with my EC2

01:35:05.250 --> 01:35:07.690
machine. Yeah that's my whole idea. That's the whole

01:35:07.690 --> 01:35:12.850
objective. Now how I will be able to do it. Yeah. So there

01:35:12.850 --> 01:35:17.050
is a service called as Route 53 so which has been used to

01:35:17.050 --> 01:35:20.950
manage a domain name services. Or you can say a domain name

01:35:20.950 --> 01:35:25.830
server Route 53. So here I can come and I can try to search

01:35:25.830 --> 01:35:29.590
for a service called as Route 53. Right. So here is scalable

01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:33.470
DNS and domain name registration. I can try to click Route

01:35:33.470 --> 01:35:38.730
53 and then you have to follow like a step by step a step by

01:35:38.730 --> 01:35:41.910
step process. I will wait to route user to our internet

01:35:41.910 --> 01:35:45.210
application. This is what the service does. So click on

01:35:45.210 --> 01:35:48.770
this. Get started. Yeah. Click on this. Get started. And

01:35:48.770 --> 01:35:53.170
here so I can try to like I have multiple options. So

01:35:53.170 --> 01:35:55.670
register a domain. So register the name such as example dot

01:35:55.670 --> 01:35:59.490
com that your user used to access your applications. You can

01:35:59.490 --> 01:36:02.310
try to take a new domain even from here that suppose I don't

01:36:02.310 --> 01:36:05.430
have a GoDaddy account or something. Right. Transfer a

01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:08.070
domain. So if I already have a domain I can try to transfer

01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:11.770
it. Create a hosted zone. So a hosted zone tells Route 53

01:36:11.770 --> 01:36:15.270
how to respond to a DNS query for a domain such as example

01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:18.350
.com. OK. So configure health check configure traffic flow

01:36:18.350 --> 01:36:23.450
configure resolver. So if I don't have maybe a domain I can

01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:26.570
I can take it from here itself. Yeah. And if I have a domain

01:36:26.570 --> 01:36:30.590
on GoDaddy or Hostinger I can even try to do a mapping. So I

01:36:30.590 --> 01:36:33.990
just have to update DNS records or NS record name server

01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:37.770
records then everything will be like fine. So whatever is

01:36:37.770 --> 01:36:40.810
running on this IP address it will show a particular domain

01:36:40.810 --> 01:36:43.850
name and it will be running at that particular domain name.

01:36:44.310 --> 01:36:48.830
So I can try to like. Click on this hosted zone if I already

01:36:48.830 --> 01:36:51.530
have a domain. But let's suppose if I don't have a domain I

01:36:51.530 --> 01:36:54.430
don't want to you know go to GoDaddy or Hostinger and I

01:36:54.430 --> 01:36:57.330
don't want to purchase it. In that situation register a

01:36:57.330 --> 01:37:01.010
domain simple. So get started. Register a domain if you

01:37:01.010 --> 01:37:05.050
don't have a domain if you have a domain then hosted. Enter

01:37:05.050 --> 01:37:07.770
a domain name. So first of all you have to search whether

01:37:07.770 --> 01:37:11.110
this domain name is available or not. And again it is going

01:37:11.110 --> 01:37:14.090
to show you a price. So price is also a concern by the way

01:37:14.090 --> 01:37:17.950
for all of us. Right. So here I can try to maybe check

01:37:17.950 --> 01:37:20.810
domain name su dh nshu sudhanshu.

01:37:24.710 --> 01:37:29.170
And yeah this is costing sudhanshu.io is costing me 71 USD.

01:37:29.370 --> 01:37:33.970
So it's very very expensive by the way. Right. So sudhanshu

01:37:33.970 --> 01:37:41.330
.kumar I can search it from here. It's expensive. It's a bit

01:37:41.330 --> 01:37:44.550
expensive and I already have a lot of domain which I have

01:37:44.550 --> 01:37:47.330
already purchased. So I don't want. You know. I don't want

01:37:47.330 --> 01:37:49.910
to purchase any of the domain. But yes if you are looking

01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:52.550
for a purchase then you can come here and you can try to

01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:56.150
purchase even from here. That's OK. So what I will do I'll

01:37:56.150 --> 01:37:59.630
go back. Yeah I'll go back. So here they're going to show

01:37:59.630 --> 01:38:02.230
you a price. Don't worry. Yeah. So for every domain that you

01:38:02.230 --> 01:38:04.350
are going to purchase and then that price comes with the

01:38:04.350 --> 01:38:08.130
yearly subscription as well. So every year you have to like

01:38:08.130 --> 01:38:11.890
you know give that price or maybe you can try to take that

01:38:11.890 --> 01:38:14.770
particular domain for maybe many many years maybe for next

01:38:14.770 --> 01:38:19.290
10 years 20 years as long as you want. So here I'll come

01:38:19.290 --> 01:38:24.110
back to route 53 and here. So what I will do I'll try to

01:38:24.110 --> 01:38:30.170
create click on like a hosted zone right. And then I can try

01:38:30.170 --> 01:38:33.350
to click on create hosted zone. So click on create hosted

01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:40.350
zone. Now here I can try to provide a domain name. So let me

01:38:40.350 --> 01:38:43.010
use some of my domain by the way.

01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:57.940
I have two domain. The AI company club and the AI company

01:38:57.940 --> 01:38:58.460
dot AI.

01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:14.520
OK description fine testing or something I can try to

01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:18.980
mention. Yeah now publicly hosted domain yes create a hosted

01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:27.320
zone. So fine the public company dot AI. This is like a

01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:33.180
domain that we have like taken over here right. Now done

01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:34.500
guys any anyone is doing it.

01:39:37.540 --> 01:39:38.020
Yeah.

01:39:58.150 --> 01:40:01.510
So any domain anywhere you have it's completely fine. Now

01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:04.830
once I'm going to like a put up this it is showing me this

01:40:04.830 --> 01:40:09.330
for records right. So value route traffic too. So this is

01:40:09.330 --> 01:40:12.370
basically a name server record. This is basically called as

01:40:12.370 --> 01:40:15.930
NS record which is required. So this is the only thing which

01:40:15.930 --> 01:40:19.150
is required by the way that this is the only thing which is

01:40:19.150 --> 01:40:22.890
required by the way. So what I can do I can try to copy this

01:40:22.890 --> 01:40:26.750
I can try to take this and then I can try to go to my

01:40:26.750 --> 01:40:30.030
GoDaddy account because inside from GoDaddy I have purchased

01:40:30.030 --> 01:40:35.230
basically my domain and application is running inside my AWS

01:40:35.230 --> 01:40:40.550
and I'm trying to route it with the help of route 53 right

01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:43.690
with the help of route 53. So I'm trying to basically route

01:40:43.690 --> 01:40:50.690
it. So here basically like you know I have to like a map

01:40:50.690 --> 01:40:57.850
this route 53 with my GoDaddy. Yeah. With my GoDaddy. So

01:40:57.850 --> 01:41:00.570
basically I have to like a route it or I have to basically

01:41:00.570 --> 01:41:04.310
update it. So I have to basically update this records. I

01:41:04.310 --> 01:41:06.750
have to update this particular record inside my GoDaddy so

01:41:06.750 --> 01:41:09.290
that my GoDaddy will be able to understand that how it's

01:41:09.290 --> 01:41:14.390
been like a mapped internally. So here what you have to do

01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:17.750
so you need these four records and then you can go to your

01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:22.170
GoDaddy right your GoDaddy and then over there so you can

01:41:22.170 --> 01:41:26.830
try to you know one by one one by one one by one. Basically

01:41:26.830 --> 01:41:34.050
like update this entire like records that we have. So here

01:41:34.050 --> 01:41:40.520
I'll come here right and then I can try to click on this

01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:41.200
manage DNS.

01:41:48.730 --> 01:41:52.310
So everywhere it's like going to be same and then inside

01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:56.850
that there is something called a name server. And then here

01:41:56.850 --> 01:41:59.930
so I can try to click on change name server.

01:42:02.830 --> 01:42:04.010
Okay. Leave it.

01:42:19.940 --> 01:42:24.760
Where is my domain. Okay. Let me go back once again.

01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:30.160
Sometime they change the UI interface. So yeah

01:43:18.670 --> 01:43:20.230
domain setting DNS

01:43:29.860 --> 01:43:30.900
it

01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:45.370
should show me my DNS records DNS record add

01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:51.640
new record it is not giving me any option manage DNS

01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:53.520
template why

01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:38.440
yes on DNS template I can add let me just add it. Okay.

01:44:41.460 --> 01:44:44.020
After a very very long time I'm logging into my GoDaddy

01:44:44.020 --> 01:44:46.420
account. So yeah the

01:44:55.890 --> 01:44:58.530
AI company domains

01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:04.760
manage

01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:07.860
DNS manage

01:45:24.750 --> 01:45:30.730
DNS template and then add template name test save.

01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:41.900
Yeah. So basically here so we can try to basically like add

01:45:41.900 --> 01:45:45.780
my records DNS records by the way so I can try to click and

01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:49.520
then I can try to add a record. Now basically what happens.

01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:55.260
So. So here when you have activated your route 53 so it is

01:45:55.260 --> 01:45:58.380
giving you name server records. So basically this is

01:45:58.380 --> 01:46:00.860
something that it is going to give you and these are the

01:46:00.860 --> 01:46:05.280
things you have to map with your domain provider. If you are

01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:08.160
taking domain from AWS itself then it's completely fine even

01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:11.620
they are selling your your domain. If I have taken a domain

01:46:11.620 --> 01:46:15.280
from maybe GoDaddy or Hostinger or there are other service

01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:17.840
provider so where we can go and you can try to you know

01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:21.080
check the availability of a domain and you can try to buy

01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:25.040
it. So after buying it my machine is running my application

01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:28.540
is running inside AWS. So I have to do a mapping but to do a

01:46:28.540 --> 01:46:31.360
mapping first of all these things comes into picture. So I

01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:36.940
can do a mapping of this route 53 with my GoDaddy or with

01:46:36.940 --> 01:46:41.940
anyone who is my domain name provider and then with route 53

01:46:41.940 --> 01:46:45.120
application that we have created we can try to bind our

01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:50.300
machine right. So that. So that anyone and everyone who is

01:46:50.300 --> 01:46:55.240
going to come via this domain to a route 53 it is going to

01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:59.160
route it to this particular IP address. So people will try

01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:03.220
to see just a domain name just a name. But yeah so it is

01:47:03.220 --> 01:47:06.620
routing towards this particular one it is routing it is

01:47:06.620 --> 01:47:09.080
going to route basically a traffic towards this particular

01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:11.800
one. So that's the whole idea that's the whole idea behind

01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:17.640
this one by the way. So here this record is important. Yeah.

01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:22.940
Now so here what we can do so we can try to you know create

01:47:22.940 --> 01:47:27.140
we can we can. So we are we are having a route 53 and we

01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:30.500
have this machine so where something is running. Now both

01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:33.780
are not attached anywhere. So we have to attach these two

01:47:33.780 --> 01:47:38.620
means my route 53 and a machine and then route 53 and my

01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:41.720
domain name which is available on GoDaddy or Hostinger or

01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:46.060
anywhere. So to attach first of all my route 53 and this one

01:47:46.060 --> 01:47:48.580
the machine that I have so I can try to click on it. So I

01:47:48.580 --> 01:47:52.460
can click on create record and here so I can try to like you

01:47:52.460 --> 01:47:58.400
know update it basically update it with respect to my like a

01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:02.520
machine. So if I would like to create a sub domain for

01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:08.320
example if you will go to maybe a Euron right so if you will

01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:15.900
go to maybe Euron over here sorry where I am. Okay. Yeah. So

01:48:15.900 --> 01:48:19.000
if you will go to Euron over here. Yeah. So Euron dot one is

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:22.940
a route or basically it's a domain name a main domain name.

01:48:23.060 --> 01:48:27.080
If you will go and click on this work and learn so inside

01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:30.300
this Euron so we have created a directory and inside that

01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:33.420
there is the service called as work and learn. Now if you

01:48:33.420 --> 01:48:37.120
will create click on this URI so here you will be able to

01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:40.840
see chat dot Euron dot one and both are different actually

01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:44.620
right. So this is basically a sub domain that we have

01:48:44.620 --> 01:48:49.120
created chat dot Euron dot one. Right. And we have mapped it

01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:52.440
and we have mapped this URI application and in this

01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:54.660
situation the situation which I have shown you for example

01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:57.820
click on work and learn and here slash. So basically there

01:48:57.820 --> 01:49:00.560
is a folder so there is a different there is a sub domain

01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:04.900
mapping and there is a folder mapping we do it and both the

01:49:04.900 --> 01:49:08.480
approaches like we try to like define. So somewhere you will

01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:10.600
be able to find out if you will go through a Euron website

01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:12.680
you will be able to find out that we are hosting something

01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:16.040
on a particular folder and somewhere we are hosting

01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:19.380
something on a particular URL. So all those major services

01:49:19.380 --> 01:49:21.880
that we have so we try to host it on a sub domain in

01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:26.520
general. So here right. So here if you will come so it is

01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:31.040
asking you for like you know a sub domain name. So if I want

01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:35.120
my user to access this entire things at sub sub domain I can

01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:40.240
try to mention SUDH then this so SUDH dot the AI company dot

01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:42.960
AI people will be able to access it. If I'm not going to

01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:45.800
keep some sub domain it's completely fine. Yeah. It's

01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:51.600
completely fine. So this is this is what it this is what it

01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:56.080
means by the way. Yeah. So record type I can say a and then

01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:58.240
there are so many different different kind of a record type

01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:01.140
you will be able to find out. So record type let's suppose

01:50:01.140 --> 01:50:05.420
we are trying to keep it as a a over here and then value

01:50:05.420 --> 01:50:08.100
wise. Yeah. So value wise. So value wise what you have to

01:50:08.100 --> 01:50:10.500
provide. So you have to provide this elastic IP address so

01:50:10.500 --> 01:50:13.020
that it will be able to reach out. Right. So we are trying

01:50:13.020 --> 01:50:19.260
to do route 53 mapping and my machine mapping fine. And then

01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:21.820
we'll do a GoDaddy mapping or any domain name provider

01:50:21.820 --> 01:50:26.360
mapping without 53. So this is my elastic IP address. Yeah.

01:50:26.780 --> 01:50:30.580
So I'm trying to like keep it here TTL time to live

01:50:30.580 --> 01:50:33.400
basically. So I can try to keep it as a 300 like a

01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:36.400
millisecond. That's completely fine. I can try to increase

01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:40.440
or decrease depends upon the failover and routing policy

01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:43.640
wise. So simple routing. I don't want anything else latency

01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:47.620
failover IP based or geo proximity. I don't want that. So

01:50:47.620 --> 01:50:51.720
simple routing. Keep it as it is and then create a record

01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:55.580
fine create a record. So it is going to create a record and

01:50:55.580 --> 01:51:00.480
now right now it will be able to understand that what this

01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:03.460
the AI company if someone is going to hit the AI company

01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:08.720
right from outer world. Now it knows that it is associated

01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:12.680
with this IP address. Right. And at this IP address there is

01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:14.940
some application which is running right at this IP address

01:51:14.940 --> 01:51:17.640
there is some application which is running so and we have we

01:51:17.640 --> 01:51:21.620
have just associated it. So this route 53 and this

01:51:21.620 --> 01:51:26.940
association is done. Yeah 53 and this association is done.

01:51:28.020 --> 01:51:31.960
Now if I'm going to hit the AI company still it will be

01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:36.020
blank. Our reason is very simple. Right. So our reason is

01:51:36.020 --> 01:51:38.000
very simple. So it is not showing me anything by the way.

01:51:38.060 --> 01:51:40.180
Right. It is not showing me my message. It is not showing my

01:51:40.180 --> 01:51:48.260
application. So we are able to map basically my EC2 my

01:51:48.260 --> 01:51:56.400
machine to basically 53 route 53 and inside that so yes

01:51:56.400 --> 01:52:00.220
there is the AI company this particular domain I have

01:52:00.220 --> 01:52:03.880
associated but this particular domain I have purchased from

01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:08.040
whom so from GoDaddy or any domain name provider. So I have

01:52:08.040 --> 01:52:11.720
to go there and I have to update a record. So once I'm going

01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:15.620
to update a record a name server record then it will be able

01:52:15.620 --> 01:52:19.140
to route properly and it will be able to reach out to my

01:52:19.140 --> 01:52:21.180
application. So that is something which I'm going to show

01:52:21.180 --> 01:52:25.260
you now a last step by the way. So till this point it's

01:52:25.260 --> 01:52:29.380
fine. So anyone who is coming to this particular domain so

01:52:29.380 --> 01:52:31.920
they will be able to understand but to come to this

01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:35.000
particular domain to make internet understands that. Okay.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:38.440
So like this domain is representing this particular machine

01:52:38.440 --> 01:52:41.420
this particular IP address. So what I have to do I have to

01:52:41.420 --> 01:52:45.400
take this NS record a name server record and I have to go to

01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:50.160
GoDaddy and I have to update it over there as simple as

01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:54.400
that. Yeah. So basically I'm going to go to GoDaddy I'm

01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:58.120
going to say that that okay so I have a route 53 service and

01:52:58.120 --> 01:53:01.040
at this service so there is a machine which is up and

01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:05.260
running now just try to map it. Perfect. So let's go to a

01:53:05.260 --> 01:53:10.360
GoDaddy guys let's go to my GoDaddy account yeah and here so

01:53:10.360 --> 01:53:15.640
I can try to you know update a record. So here to update a

01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:20.820
record let me show you the process from the beginning yeah.

01:53:26.070 --> 01:53:29.250
So I have a domain the AI company let's suppose so I'll go

01:53:29.250 --> 01:53:30.870
to my AI company domain.

01:53:33.530 --> 01:53:38.270
So domain the AI company right and here so I can try to

01:53:38.270 --> 01:53:41.530
click on manage DNS as simple as that. So manage domain name

01:53:41.530 --> 01:53:45.890
server and then over here so what I can do so I can try to

01:53:45.890 --> 01:53:51.030
go to a name server right and I can try to say that like a

01:53:51.030 --> 01:53:54.750
change a name server so I can try to come over here and I

01:53:54.750 --> 01:53:58.310
can try to click and say I'll try to change my name server

01:53:58.310 --> 01:54:01.750
and here so edit name server choose name server for the AI

01:54:01.750 --> 01:54:06.310
company a name server provider is whom route 53. I'll use my

01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:14.390
own name server. Fine. And here so I can click on add a name

01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:15.850
server add

01:54:18.190 --> 01:54:22.870
a name server right and if you will come and if you will

01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:26.490
check over here so I have this four name server which is

01:54:26.490 --> 01:54:30.990
given to me. So let me copy it somewhere okay.

01:54:34.700 --> 01:54:37.400
This four name server which is given to me which I have

01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:42.260
basically like a copied over here right. Now name server

01:54:42.260 --> 01:54:43.020
number one.

01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:54.520
Yeah. Name server number two here add name server name

01:54:54.520 --> 01:55:02.740
server number this here name server number this one add here

01:55:02.740 --> 01:55:05.800
okay and there was like a by default Cloudflare and leave

01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:08.520
NSCloudflare.com which was available so I can keep it or I

01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:13.540
can delete it. So edit name server. Let's see what has

01:55:13.540 --> 01:55:16.920
happened. So

01:55:25.370 --> 01:55:27.710
host name has entered. Invalid please provide a name server

01:55:27.710 --> 01:55:31.090
in a correct format there

01:55:39.220 --> 01:55:45.980
is a dot which was mentioned okay now click on save. Now it

01:55:45.980 --> 01:55:49.420
has basically saved my name server click on continue and

01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:53.880
verify. So it is asking me for my like a authorization let

01:55:53.880 --> 01:56:01.160
me open up and edit my code so six one zero okay.

01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:04.420
So verify code. Okay

01:56:12.100 --> 01:56:15.940
so it name server updated so whatever name server that I

01:56:15.940 --> 01:56:19.520
have inside my AWS account so that name server is basically

01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:22.020
updated over here all this four name server which is

01:56:22.020 --> 01:56:27.880
provided by my route 53 okay that looks cool. So here now if

01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:31.320
I will go and let's try to check it

01:56:34.900 --> 01:56:35.860
will take some time.

01:56:48.260 --> 01:56:52.240
So technically what we have done let me give you a brief

01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:55.040
summary. So we have a GoDaddy account.

01:56:58.090 --> 01:57:04.130
GoDaddy. So now what is happening so GoDaddy is pointing to

01:57:04.130 --> 01:57:09.970
route 53 which is inside my AWS as a service right. So

01:57:09.970 --> 01:57:13.130
GoDaddy is pointing to this one. Now this route 53 is

01:57:13.130 --> 01:57:17.790
technically pointing to my elastic IP address right. I have

01:57:17.790 --> 01:57:20.670
already mapped it so route 53 is mapping to this one and

01:57:20.670 --> 01:57:24.790
basically so elastic IP address is technically pointing to

01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:28.470
my what to my EC2 instance our actual machine. Our actual

01:57:28.470 --> 01:57:31.530
machine where like things are actually happening things are

01:57:31.530 --> 01:57:35.990
actually like running. Now this EC2 machine is basically

01:57:35.990 --> 01:57:40.930
pointing to NGINX which is nothing but a server and then

01:57:40.930 --> 01:57:44.050
this is actually pointing to my final application called as

01:57:44.050 --> 01:57:48.910
fast API. So this is the complete flow guys GoDaddy pointing

01:57:48.910 --> 01:57:51.690
to route 53, route 53 pointing to my elastic IP address,

01:57:51.790 --> 01:57:54.630
elastic IP address pointing to my EC2 instance, EC2 instance

01:57:54.630 --> 01:57:57.950
pointing to my NGINX and NGINX pointing to my GoDaddy. Fast

01:57:57.950 --> 01:58:02.770
API so this is how this entire application we will be able

01:58:02.770 --> 01:58:07.190
to access. Now so I have already updated a domain which is

01:58:07.190 --> 01:58:09.410
eventually going to take maybe like a five minute or

01:58:09.410 --> 01:58:12.310
sometime even couple of hours it is going to take. So

01:58:12.310 --> 01:58:17.330
updation is done now once it will take some time it will

01:58:17.330 --> 01:58:22.310
take some time for sure and maybe sometime so it is going to

01:58:22.310 --> 01:58:26.430
like a reflect the changes in five minutes sometime it

01:58:26.430 --> 01:58:32.530
takes. It takes even an hour of time. So once it

01:58:36.270 --> 01:58:40.150
is going to reflect it won't be quick for any one of us by

01:58:40.150 --> 01:58:44.190
the way yeah it won't be quick. So on this the AI company

01:58:44.190 --> 01:58:48.110
dot AI I will be able to see my application. This

01:58:48.110 --> 01:58:51.210
application is still running so if I have an IP address

01:58:51.210 --> 01:58:54.710
directly I will be able to access it anytime right anytime I

01:58:54.710 --> 01:58:58.630
will be able to access it but yeah so if I have mapped with

01:58:58.630 --> 01:59:01.750
the domain name. So with the help of this domain. Also. I

01:59:01.750 --> 01:59:05.750
will be able to access it that's a whole story we have

01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:10.270
discussed today is it making sense to all of us yeah. So

01:59:10.270 --> 01:59:13.690
this is how any application and every application which you

01:59:13.690 --> 01:59:18.270
are going to build you can make it live to the entire world

01:59:18.270 --> 01:59:19.310
any

01:59:21.900 --> 01:59:23.540
application did

01:59:28.570 --> 01:59:31.670
route 53 create a NS by itself why it has four records so

01:59:31.670 --> 01:59:37.090
yeah it creates basically like this NS by default but

01:59:42.620 --> 01:59:45.160
we have to keep paying for our domains. So basically

01:59:45.160 --> 01:59:48.620
obviously you if you have bought some domain so on a yearly

01:59:48.620 --> 01:59:52.500
basis you have to pay for your domain not just that so I

01:59:52.500 --> 01:59:55.140
have taken an elastic IP address even elastic IP address

01:59:55.140 --> 02:00:00.400
inside AWS is coming with the cost it's not free by the way

02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:03.640
public IP address will be associated with the EC2 instances

02:00:03.640 --> 02:00:07.600
but elastic IP address is not at all free so you have to pay

02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:10.360
for that which I am going to deactivate very soon right

02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:12.720
after this class I am going to deactivate it otherwise it

02:00:12.720 --> 02:00:17.140
will keep on like you know. Charging me basically if

02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:23.220
we having a database to access backend then how it will

02:00:23.220 --> 02:00:27.540
route so basically internally we try to create a API the way

02:00:27.540 --> 02:00:30.080
we used to create a API in our local system we are going to

02:00:30.080 --> 02:00:32.600
host our database somewhere or maybe we can try to take a

02:00:32.600 --> 02:00:35.960
managed services and again through API everything through an

02:00:35.960 --> 02:00:38.720
API yeah what

02:00:42.020 --> 02:00:44.520
is the purpose of TTL time to leave is nothing but so it

02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:48.100
will keep on hitting that particular like a domain before

02:00:48.100 --> 02:00:51.540
giving you an error. So TTL okay

02:00:55.280 --> 02:00:58.300
so that's the whole story guys hope all of you are going to

02:00:58.300 --> 02:01:02.660
test it out all of you are going to like you know do it at

02:01:02.660 --> 02:01:05.900
least once in your life because yeah I strongly recommend

02:01:05.900 --> 02:01:09.560
all of you to do it at least once in a life so that you will

02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:13.040
be aware about how the entire application works now this is

02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:18.960
one way only one way I can do exact same thing in 10 other

02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:22.100
ways as well maybe more than that right. So. So this is just

02:01:22.100 --> 02:01:25.080
one of the way by which you know we are hosting an

02:01:25.080 --> 02:01:27.760
application and we are trying to make it like a live to the

02:01:27.760 --> 02:01:32.140
entire world same thing can be done in a multiple ways as

02:01:32.140 --> 02:01:35.120
well. But if you are trying to build some end-to-end

02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:38.960
application if you are trying to you know work as a lead if

02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:41.940
you are working as an architect or something I believe you

02:01:41.940 --> 02:01:45.760
all are supposed to be aware about the entire process to

02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:49.860
make our application live because if some developer under

02:01:49.860 --> 02:01:53.880
you. you will be stuck obviously your responsibility to

02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:57.080
rescue them or your responsibility will be to guide them and

02:01:57.080 --> 02:01:58.800
you know deliver the project,

02:02:02.290 --> 02:02:03.070
okay.

02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:10.260
So now how to stop a running services, a simplest way is to

02:02:10.260 --> 02:02:13.380
terminate your ec2 instances and leave your IP address,

02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:16.860
elastic IP address that you have associated and located and

02:02:16.860 --> 02:02:21.340
it will be done. Otherwise sudo systemctl stop and then a

02:02:21.340 --> 02:02:24.500
service name and it will be stopped if it is a background

02:02:24.500 --> 02:02:27.540
service. If it is not a background service then control x

02:02:27.540 --> 02:02:29.860
control x control x and it will try to stop.

02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:43.540
Okay so fine I think it is still it will take some time so

02:02:43.540 --> 02:02:46.920
it will not be quick by the way but yes it will for sure

02:02:46.920 --> 02:02:52.700
come. So let me terminate my services one by one one by one

02:02:52.700 --> 02:02:56.460
so first of all I will terminate this one then I will just

02:02:56.460 --> 02:03:02.800
go to my elastic IP address and then I will go here I will

02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:08.040
try to. First of all disable disassociate first of all

02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:12.660
elastic IP address because elastic IP address will give me a

02:03:12.660 --> 02:03:15.700
cost and then action first

02:03:23.320 --> 02:03:26.760
disable the transfer the

02:03:30.410 --> 02:03:32.690
following access will not be disabled for transfer since

02:03:32.690 --> 02:03:37.210
they are not why I am doing this release

02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:47.840
elastic IP address and then release it fine so elastic IP

02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:50.780
address I have deleted which is like a link which is going

02:03:50.780 --> 02:03:54.500
to give me a cost auto scaling group leave it instance let

02:03:54.500 --> 02:03:59.260
us do one thing so action and then then then then terminate

02:03:59.260 --> 02:04:05.040
this first of all this instance skip OS shutdown means

02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:08.540
terminate immediately. So every one of you guys please do it

02:04:08.540 --> 02:04:12.880
otherwise it will keep on giving you a cost and then do not

02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:17.480
come and tell me that I have not taught you how to stop it.

02:04:21.070 --> 02:04:26.430
Not terminate. Okay. Yeah. So yes it has initiated a

02:04:26.430 --> 02:04:30.530
termination of my instances now in this way obviously it is

02:04:30.530 --> 02:04:34.410
not going to give me a cost it was just a T2 nano so T2 nano

02:04:34.410 --> 02:04:38.950
is anyhow like available as a free tier. So fine everyone

02:04:38.950 --> 02:04:42.070
now if you have any kind of a question so please go ahead

02:04:42.070 --> 02:04:45.030
with your question and let me know so I will try to clarify

02:04:45.030 --> 02:04:46.510
your doubts.

02:04:49.930 --> 02:04:53.630
So you can raise your hand by the way. Yeah Sid go ahead

02:04:53.630 --> 02:04:54.930
after that Rakesh. Yeah.

02:05:01.270 --> 02:05:04.890
Good morning. Yeah. Good morning. Please go ahead. Yeah. So

02:05:04.890 --> 02:05:11.230
can you go to that graph that you showed us not drop this

02:05:11.230 --> 02:05:14.670
boxes right where they're connecting. Which one which one

02:05:14.670 --> 02:05:19.050
which one. Just now you show how different services are

02:05:19.050 --> 02:05:24.010
connecting. Oh okay okay. So basically that one so that I

02:05:24.010 --> 02:05:29.090
have deleted but maybe I can try to redraw for you if you

02:05:29.090 --> 02:05:32.910
want. Yeah. So basically let me tell you how things are

02:05:32.910 --> 02:05:37.270
connecting to each other. Where is my pen. Yeah. Yeah. So

02:05:37.270 --> 02:05:41.950
when we do applications right so AI applications basically

02:05:41.950 --> 02:05:46.690
there is a UI right and from that UI we may call to

02:05:46.690 --> 02:05:50.970
different models or different services. Right. So how

02:05:50.970 --> 02:05:55.390
actually what the best way to design that we have a one

02:05:55.390 --> 02:06:00.330
domain. Yeah. So then internally those domain could be

02:06:00.330 --> 02:06:04.450
routed to model calling API or something. No no no no see

02:06:04.450 --> 02:06:07.630
what happens so we try to design the backend services and we

02:06:07.630 --> 02:06:11.550
never try to allocate an IP address to those services in

02:06:11.550 --> 02:06:15.090
general. So technically think in this way I have created a

02:06:15.090 --> 02:06:18.690
like a some API API means some route I have already created

02:06:18.690 --> 02:06:23.970
and then I have hosted those things in some of the machine

02:06:23.970 --> 02:06:28.130
why I will go and I will try to allocate a domain to that

02:06:28.130 --> 02:06:31.270
one because it's not a public interfacing API right. My API

02:06:31.270 --> 02:06:35.030
can run even on a like a some URL yeah means some IP

02:06:35.030 --> 02:06:37.690
addresses basically. So I will not try to do a domain

02:06:37.690 --> 02:06:40.510
mapping unless and until I'm not exposing it to the outer

02:06:40.510 --> 02:06:43.510
world. Let's suppose if I'm using a URI API and if I have to

02:06:43.510 --> 02:06:45.310
expose it then obviously it should be available at a

02:06:45.310 --> 02:06:48.230
particular domain for example so whenever you try to access

02:06:48.230 --> 02:06:52.490
any open AI API or even a URI API so it's actually available

02:06:52.490 --> 02:06:56.050
on some domain name. Yeah. Domain name you are hitting our

02:06:56.050 --> 02:06:59.150
particular domain as a user but technically it is trying to

02:06:59.150 --> 02:07:03.010
hit a IP address in a backend a machine in a backend but

02:07:03.010 --> 02:07:06.950
let's suppose if I'm trying to design a application so where

02:07:06.950 --> 02:07:10.770
in my front end so I'm trying to call some of the buttons or

02:07:10.770 --> 02:07:14.350
maybe on a click of button it is supposed to invoke some of

02:07:14.350 --> 02:07:18.030
my models models or any backend services right it is

02:07:18.030 --> 02:07:22.830
supposed to invoke now this model will be up and running in

02:07:22.830 --> 02:07:26.990
my machine with a IP address and with the help of IP address

02:07:26.990 --> 02:07:30.210
itself I can try to expose it because it's an internal

02:07:30.210 --> 02:07:34.990
communication or internal communication within the AWS

02:07:34.990 --> 02:07:40.270
within the AWS or maybe one is available in AWS and one who

02:07:40.270 --> 02:07:43.310
is available on Azure right. So maybe on a different cloud

02:07:43.310 --> 02:07:45.970
platform itself so what I will do so I'll try to even try to

02:07:45.970 --> 02:07:49.730
like expose it as an API but yeah on some like a IP address

02:07:49.730 --> 02:07:52.690
I can try to keep it but yes same service if I have to

02:07:52.690 --> 02:07:55.390
expose it. To the outer world then obviously I'll have to go

02:07:55.390 --> 02:07:57.790
through the domain name mapping otherwise it's not required.

02:07:59.450 --> 02:08:04.290
And one more question is let's say I build a model and I

02:08:04.290 --> 02:08:09.010
want to expose that model to the outer world so in that case

02:08:09.010 --> 02:08:15.550
I create APIs and that API. Same thing. Any domain is my

02:08:15.550 --> 02:08:17.770
understanding correct. Yeah so same thing that we have done

02:08:17.770 --> 02:08:20.590
today so even fast API fast API what we were able to do we

02:08:20.590 --> 02:08:23.430
were able to execute a function right. So whenever someone

02:08:23.430 --> 02:08:26.150
is going to call your model eventually it will be calling a

02:08:26.150 --> 02:08:28.370
function right and function will be executing your or

02:08:28.370 --> 02:08:31.950
processing your models right. This is something which is

02:08:31.950 --> 02:08:34.810
going to happen this is what we have done so whenever you

02:08:34.810 --> 02:08:38.110
have to expose your models any models basically or with

02:08:38.110 --> 02:08:41.030
respect to the particular URL or maybe a subdomain you can

02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:44.310
do it. So the process that we have followed so today's

02:08:44.310 --> 02:08:48.350
process was I have like a GoDaddy account so basically

02:08:48.350 --> 02:08:53.690
GoDaddy. GoDaddy and it was routing to what it was pointing

02:08:53.690 --> 02:08:58.150
to my route 53. Route 53 was pointing to what so basically

02:08:58.150 --> 02:09:02.010
it was pointing to my elastic IP address elastic IP address

02:09:02.010 --> 02:09:05.290
and then this elastic IP address was pointing to what so

02:09:05.290 --> 02:09:08.410
basically it was pointing to my EC2 a machine the actual

02:09:08.410 --> 02:09:11.310
machine right the actual machine was pointing to what my

02:09:11.310 --> 02:09:14.730
server like you know or you can say like a route handle

02:09:14.730 --> 02:09:20.070
NGINX and this was pointing to what. This is a fast API

02:09:20.070 --> 02:09:23.310
right and fast APIs was trying to execute some of the

02:09:23.310 --> 02:09:25.510
function now here the function is going to be function which

02:09:25.510 --> 02:09:28.710
is going to execute your models means it is going to pass a

02:09:28.710 --> 02:09:30.950
data into a model whatever model is going to give you an

02:09:30.950 --> 02:09:33.690
output it is going to return back. This is what my API is

02:09:33.690 --> 02:09:37.370
doing over here right okay yeah at this domain which is

02:09:37.370 --> 02:09:40.030
which I have inside a GoDaddy. So this is the flow that we

02:09:40.030 --> 02:09:42.430
have done today and this is the same flow you will be like

02:09:42.430 --> 02:09:45.750
even doing even in future. So let's suppose I have a model

02:09:45.750 --> 02:09:48.850
and this is something that we have done even with respect to

02:09:48.850 --> 02:09:57.050
your URI API. Yes okay yeah okay fine yeah so so this got

02:09:57.050 --> 02:10:02.830
the idea so maybe a few more questions I'll ask later yeah

02:10:02.830 --> 02:10:10.850
yeah okay next one hello hi Rakesh Rakesh Rakesh after that

02:10:10.850 --> 02:10:15.830
Ramesh yeah yeah okay yeah sir good morning yeah good

02:10:15.830 --> 02:10:19.810
morning please go ahead my question is on the EC2. So

02:10:19.810 --> 02:10:24.330
actually I have cleared about the domain name DNS mapping

02:10:24.330 --> 02:10:30.930
with a 53 and API API something but on the EC2 actually all

02:10:30.930 --> 02:10:35.370
the all the all the hit point is comes on the 80 port right

02:10:36.030 --> 02:10:39.070
yes yeah so that is why that is the entry point which I have

02:10:39.070 --> 02:10:41.230
created so if I would like to create some other port number

02:10:41.230 --> 02:10:47.870
I can do that as well okay so if suppose I have we are

02:10:47.870 --> 02:10:50.190
running the four different systems. So basically I want to

02:10:50.190 --> 02:10:52.490
hit the specific services in the background okay that's okay

02:10:52.490 --> 02:11:00.930
and I want to hit the specific services APIs with the help

02:11:00.930 --> 02:11:09.830
of this domain map how we can hit I mean specific services

02:11:09.830 --> 02:11:14.250
because here we are only associated the 80 port with the

02:11:14.250 --> 02:11:19.630
8000 something like that right. So see basically. Okay.

02:11:19.650 --> 02:11:22.790
There are like a multiple ways of doing that so we basically

02:11:22.790 --> 02:11:26.190
what we can do so I have basically my IP address and slash I

02:11:26.190 --> 02:11:29.830
can try to give a route right and with the help of routes

02:11:29.830 --> 02:11:34.010
obviously things can be segregated over here right now there

02:11:34.010 --> 02:11:38.170
is a possibility that I have a IP address and then I am

02:11:38.170 --> 02:11:41.950
trying to maintain 80 towards 8000 right so maybe I can try

02:11:41.950 --> 02:11:45.430
to expose more port number so I can try to take 81 81

02:11:45.430 --> 02:11:49.030
towards maybe 6000 82 towards maybe some different port

02:11:49.030 --> 02:11:52.850
number. So even in that way so I have a like a huge number

02:11:52.850 --> 02:11:55.670
of ports which is available in my machine so I can expose

02:11:55.670 --> 02:11:59.010
any port to any port it's not like 80 to 8000 you have to

02:11:59.010 --> 02:12:02.430
bind no it's not like that 81 or maybe 80 to 6000 I can try

02:12:02.430 --> 02:12:06.170
to bind 82 maybe 3000 3000 to 3003 I can try to bind up

02:12:06.170 --> 02:12:09.230
maybe 5000 or something I can try to bind. So anything to

02:12:09.230 --> 02:12:15.050
anything I will be able to route it basically okay so I mean

02:12:15.050 --> 02:12:21.890
you want to say that. Suppose. You have associated what our

02:12:21.890 --> 02:12:26.950
AI company dot com something like that okay AI company dot

02:12:26.950 --> 02:12:32.270
com slash again after that we can put the APIs endpoint

02:12:32.270 --> 02:12:35.170
different exactly a folder folder structure we can try to

02:12:35.170 --> 02:12:37.470
maintain yes technically a route we can try to maintain.

02:12:38.770 --> 02:12:44.070
Okay and but if if I want to suppose we are putting the

02:12:44.070 --> 02:12:49.730
endpoint like a admin I mean I'm in a. My AI company dot com

02:12:49.730 --> 02:12:59.250
slash admin and I don't want to I mean put the our AI

02:12:59.250 --> 02:13:06.310
company dot com slash admin or slash account or slash HR I

02:13:06.310 --> 02:13:11.650
just wanted to hit directly admin dot com or accounts dot

02:13:11.650 --> 02:13:16.530
com or like that because we have we have maintained in our

02:13:16.530 --> 02:13:21.770
locations. Okay. We have maintained like this. Yeah that

02:13:21.770 --> 02:13:24.390
that's basically you are talking about a subdomain so

02:13:24.390 --> 02:13:27.050
basically you are talking about this this kind of approach

02:13:27.050 --> 02:13:31.590
which I have already like discussed I believe so here. Just

02:13:31.590 --> 02:13:35.590
like a URI and like a Euron dot com. Yeah exactly so

02:13:35.590 --> 02:13:37.610
basically you are saying that that whenever someone is going

02:13:37.610 --> 02:13:40.110
to come to URI so they should come to this subdomain chat

02:13:40.110 --> 02:13:43.890
dot Euron dot com Euron dot one. So Euron dot one is my main

02:13:43.890 --> 02:13:48.230
domain and this chat like is my subdomain right. So that is

02:13:48.230 --> 02:13:53.190
a mapping that we do inside a route 53 so as per this

02:13:53.190 --> 02:13:57.310
diagram right so GoDaddy is fine so from GoDaddy let's

02:13:57.310 --> 02:14:00.610
suppose like I have a GoDaddy domain provider by the way a

02:14:00.610 --> 02:14:03.050
main domain provider now subdomain I can try to create

02:14:03.050 --> 02:14:06.850
thousands of subdomain after this domain so nothing is going

02:14:06.850 --> 02:14:09.550
to change over here no DNS record nothing is going to change

02:14:09.550 --> 02:14:13.910
now here so when we are trying to create a routing here

02:14:13.910 --> 02:14:16.690
itself I have shown you an option. So where you can try to

02:14:16.690 --> 02:14:21.170
put your subdomain name right so that that happens over here

02:14:21.170 --> 02:14:25.730
now this is technically mapped to a elastic IP address

02:14:25.730 --> 02:14:28.410
elastic IP address means are basically a static IP address

02:14:28.410 --> 02:14:33.170
now here so at this elastic IP address maybe I can try to

02:14:33.170 --> 02:14:36.590
forward something at some different ports as of now 80 80

02:14:36.590 --> 02:14:40.830
means by default means a route you at a route IP address

02:14:40.830 --> 02:14:43.650
what people will be able to access but let's suppose I don't

02:14:43.650 --> 02:14:46.470
want to do that. So I just wanted to like you know. Use a

02:14:46.470 --> 02:14:49.730
multiple services one HR one finance one sale another one so

02:14:49.730 --> 02:14:53.890
here itself I can try to make a changes saying that that

02:14:53.890 --> 02:14:58.730
okay so maybe 81 versus 6000 so anyone who is going to hit

02:14:58.730 --> 02:15:04.010
my IP address 81 right they will internally come to that

02:15:04.010 --> 02:15:07.110
particular one but yeah your subdomain creation will happen

02:15:07.110 --> 02:15:10.330
over here and from here to here your mapping is going to

02:15:10.330 --> 02:15:15.450
happen elastic IP address mapping. But in that case. Yes.

02:15:15.470 --> 02:15:18.090
Elastic IP address it's a different different IP address

02:15:18.090 --> 02:15:21.790
which is a single IP address so for a particular machine it

02:15:21.790 --> 02:15:23.810
will be a single IP address I'm just trying to differentiate

02:15:23.810 --> 02:15:27.490
it with respect to a port number and the services I see I

02:15:27.490 --> 02:15:29.870
paid is not going to change right it's a static one for one

02:15:29.870 --> 02:15:32.730
particular machine there will be only one IP address okay

02:15:32.730 --> 02:15:36.110
you want to say that they're on the 6000 we can associate

02:15:36.110 --> 02:15:40.030
the admin and yeah any any any port I can try to open it up

02:15:40.030 --> 02:15:42.970
any port I can try to open up right I have a like a huge

02:15:42.970 --> 02:15:45.010
number of port series which is available inside my machine.

02:15:46.590 --> 02:15:50.530
Okay okay why I am putting these questions because on the on

02:15:50.530 --> 02:15:54.690
the on the same same machine I mean the EC2 we can we can

02:15:54.690 --> 02:15:58.210
run the multiple yes this is what I'm talking about so

02:15:58.210 --> 02:16:00.830
multiple services are running on the same machine means

02:16:00.830 --> 02:16:04.410
machine IP address is not changing the port is changing it's

02:16:04.410 --> 02:16:07.430
running on a different port but the same machine so IP

02:16:07.430 --> 02:16:09.350
address is not going to change your elastic IP address is

02:16:09.350 --> 02:16:11.830
not going to change I'm just trying to read out my port to a

02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:16.510
different port that's it. Okay. Elastic IP. I mean. Machine

02:16:16.510 --> 02:16:19.110
is not changing right same machine same machine multiple

02:16:19.110 --> 02:16:22.290
services are running so I'm not going to change this elastic

02:16:22.290 --> 02:16:24.350
IP address the actual one is not going to change at all.

02:16:24.770 --> 02:16:27.790
Yeah understood. Yeah I mean this is the this is the

02:16:27.790 --> 02:16:31.690
possible possibility this is this is actually what we do so

02:16:31.690 --> 02:16:34.830
let's say if I've taken a big machine so I can't take like

02:16:34.830 --> 02:16:37.750
you know multiple machines I have just taken let's suppose

02:16:37.750 --> 02:16:41.250
one single single big machines so I can run like n number of

02:16:41.250 --> 02:16:45.230
services inside that yes understood thank you thank you so

02:16:45.230 --> 02:16:52.610
much. Yeah go ahead. Same question actually you have port

02:16:52.610 --> 02:16:57.370
port forwarding is 80 right instead of 80 can some other

02:16:57.370 --> 02:17:01.230
number when we enter the IP address it can route

02:17:01.230 --> 02:17:07.270
automatically or or only applicable with 80. Sorry what was

02:17:07.270 --> 02:17:10.470
your question? My question is that right now you are port

02:17:10.470 --> 02:17:16.070
forwarding from 8 right 8000 to 80. Yeah. so instead of i am

02:17:16.070 --> 02:17:21.310
i applied with 81 or some other number can i just enter the

02:17:21.310 --> 02:17:24.850
ip address can it automatically forward it or do i need to

02:17:24.850 --> 02:17:29.050
also enter the port number in my address bar no so you have

02:17:29.050 --> 02:17:32.390
to enter your port number as well i mean like uh by default

02:17:32.390 --> 02:17:36.610
if you are trying to like uh uh do it with one single port

02:17:36.610 --> 02:17:41.190
right so again it is just going to like uh you know so let

02:17:41.190 --> 02:17:44.030
me let me let me clarify this like a scenario over here so

02:17:44.030 --> 02:17:48.030
let's suppose we have a multiple apis right fast api itself

02:17:48.030 --> 02:17:52.070
now some api is running on 9000 series 9000 port number some

02:17:52.070 --> 02:17:54.670
api is running on 8000 port number some api is actually

02:17:54.670 --> 02:17:59.430
running uh basically like uh on a 80 80 port number let's

02:17:59.430 --> 02:18:04.750
say right and uh publicly nginx right so nginx is still

02:18:04.750 --> 02:18:08.570
running on maybe port number 80 so that that we have

02:18:08.570 --> 02:18:13.070
forwarded by the way as we have already uh seen over here so

02:18:13.070 --> 02:18:18.790
one approach is that i can try to map a different different

02:18:18.790 --> 02:18:24.630
uh you know port with a different different open public port

02:18:24.630 --> 02:18:31.290
which is available inside my nginx 81 9000 80 8000 80 80

02:18:31.290 --> 02:18:35.310
some different port number and then with ip address i can

02:18:35.310 --> 02:18:38.570
try to update it that okay ip address column this and at

02:18:38.570 --> 02:18:41.170
this one the service is up and running this is how you can

02:18:41.330 --> 02:18:45.390
you know do it yeah right so in this case it is a multiple

02:18:45.390 --> 02:18:49.930
part forward port forwarding right so do i just enter the

02:18:49.930 --> 02:18:52.950
course name is it enough or is it always to enter the port

02:18:52.950 --> 02:18:57.150
number when we run the when we are giving our coast uh no

02:18:57.150 --> 02:19:00.630
course name in the address bar is it mandatory to pass the

02:19:00.630 --> 02:19:05.810
port number after the port yes yeah right now you have power

02:19:05.810 --> 02:19:09.290
you have set up with 80 but you you didn't give any port

02:19:09.290 --> 02:19:11.410
number right this is always when we do port number the

02:19:11.410 --> 02:19:15.190
course name it is automatically uh when the hollow world

02:19:15.190 --> 02:19:19.510
application came right in the yes yeah yeah so only it is

02:19:19.510 --> 02:19:22.670
applicable for 80 port number 80 other than port number we

02:19:22.670 --> 02:19:26.470
should enter the port number right exactly so even my 443 if

02:19:26.470 --> 02:19:29.950
you remember my 443 was inbound was open right so i can even

02:19:29.950 --> 02:19:32.890
try to like uh so i have used 80 let's suppose there is

02:19:32.890 --> 02:19:35.950
another application which is running on some 9000 port so my

02:19:35.950 --> 02:19:40.490
443 was open inbound was open right so 443 to 9000 i can try

02:19:40.490 --> 02:19:46.250
to map okay 443 also it can automatically yeah exactly so

02:19:46.250 --> 02:19:48.330
basically that is something which i have made is made it as

02:19:48.330 --> 02:19:53.950
open right okay then uh i think nginx is only helping for

02:19:53.950 --> 02:19:56.930
port forwarding or is there any other benefit uh the

02:19:56.930 --> 02:20:00.910
engineers generally generally what happens so whenever we

02:20:00.910 --> 02:20:04.090
are trying to create some test application so we try to give

02:20:04.090 --> 02:20:06.910
a port number means a domain name or ip address call and

02:20:06.910 --> 02:20:10.450
port number that's a ideal approach but whenever we are

02:20:10.490 --> 02:20:13.630
trying to send some application into a production it's a

02:20:13.630 --> 02:20:17.990
best practice right a best practice is hide your port number

02:20:17.990 --> 02:20:22.030
means people are going to just hit an ip address and don't

02:20:22.030 --> 02:20:25.950
show your port number to anyone so that you know no one will

02:20:25.950 --> 02:20:28.330
be able to debug and they will be able to understand that at

02:20:28.330 --> 02:20:31.930
which port in your machine something is running so today

02:20:31.930 --> 02:20:34.310
what we have done so we have followed a best practice

02:20:34.310 --> 02:20:37.410
approach right before that what we have done we were able to

02:20:37.410 --> 02:20:37.630
access

02:20:40.490 --> 02:20:44.170
so i think this is where the people is like having confusion

02:20:44.170 --> 02:20:49.230
right so it's not like i can't run something on ip address

02:20:49.230 --> 02:20:53.150
column port number i can do it right it's just a system

02:20:53.150 --> 02:20:57.210
where we have to reach out the only thing is it's not a bit

02:20:57.210 --> 02:21:02.590
best practice yeah you know is it only helping for for the

02:21:02.590 --> 02:21:05.470
port forwarding for using nginx or is there any other yeah

02:21:05.470 --> 02:21:08.030
basically yeah so it is it is helping me out in terms of

02:21:08.030 --> 02:21:10.470
hiding my port number now it is okay so it is helping me out

02:21:10.470 --> 02:21:11.450
in terms of hiding my port number okay is it also it is

02:21:11.450 --> 02:21:15.290
software right it is software nginx yeah it's basically

02:21:15.290 --> 02:21:19.470
library yeah work as a library okay then my next question is

02:21:19.470 --> 02:21:23.450
the ptl right time to leave option is available in our code

02:21:23.450 --> 02:21:28.750
.u website uh i think is it just for uh some uh what is the

02:21:28.750 --> 02:21:32.650
use of this exactly so basically yeah so whenever someone is

02:21:32.650 --> 02:21:35.890
hit your services so if it is not able to get a response in

02:21:35.890 --> 02:21:39.510
that particular time so it will show you maybe 404 kind of

02:21:39.510 --> 02:21:42.270
error and all the site not found or crash something like

02:21:42.270 --> 02:21:46.870
that okay so what is the best time to pass it is two hours

02:21:46.870 --> 02:21:50.210
one hours nothing nothing i mean like two hour one hour so

02:21:50.210 --> 02:21:53.270
servers should not keep on trying two hour one hour uh it

02:21:53.270 --> 02:21:55.950
should not be more than like a five ten milliseconds so that

02:21:55.950 --> 02:21:59.970
that's more than enough yeah yeah then final one more

02:21:59.970 --> 02:22:03.450
question uh today when we uh paste paste your host name

02:22:03.450 --> 02:22:08.010
right uh it is a default is https can we also support with

02:22:08.010 --> 02:22:12.630
the http as well in our address box yes yeah yeah same right

02:22:12.630 --> 02:22:15.850
both are same there is no any difference in between http and

02:22:15.850 --> 02:22:20.710
https yeah that is security protocol this is uh without

02:22:20.710 --> 02:22:23.910
security basically https so basically we try to attach a ssl

02:22:23.910 --> 02:22:26.230
certificate a security certificate so that it will be more

02:22:26.230 --> 02:22:32.010
secure okay but by default it's https right in aws by

02:22:32.010 --> 02:22:34.610
default so nowadays everyone is giving you previously we

02:22:34.610 --> 02:22:36.810
used to attach a certificate we used to buy the certificate

02:22:36.810 --> 02:22:40.670
then we used to attach the certificate nowadays by providing

02:22:40.670 --> 02:22:46.350
that certificate oh okay thanks thank you yeah thanks okay

02:22:46.350 --> 02:22:49.570
so next one is dhaneshwar go ahead with the question uh

02:22:53.480 --> 02:22:57.000
nares you can go ahead uh sit i think you have raised your

02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:02.120
hand once again then sumit ranjit anuj yeah go ahead with

02:23:02.120 --> 02:23:07.160
the questions uh yeah go ahead please uh most of the

02:23:07.160 --> 02:23:10.200
questions people are already asked i just wanted to know uh

02:23:10.200 --> 02:23:13.420
so let's say you have a uh domain already in godaddy right i

02:23:13.420 --> 02:23:14.380
can simply replay the domain already in godaddy right i can

02:23:14.380 --> 02:23:17.580
simply replay my elastic ip uh inside godaddy instead of

02:23:17.580 --> 02:23:20.400
again using one more service history is there any specific

02:23:20.400 --> 02:23:24.640
benefits to use this three elastic ip you can replace inside

02:23:24.640 --> 02:23:30.120
godaddy no that ip ip pointing will be there inside godaddy

02:23:30.120 --> 02:23:35.340
sorry i think you are on mute yeah no no no so no you can't

02:23:35.340 --> 02:23:37.920
update our elastic ip address directly you have to update

02:23:37.920 --> 02:23:43.020
our ns record name server records okay okay okay Yeah, this

02:23:43.020 --> 02:23:45.600
is how it will be able to understand. Otherwise, IP address

02:23:45.600 --> 02:23:49.320
you can't point it. IP address you can point it to a out 53

02:23:49.320 --> 02:23:52.980
services and then that will be like generating an NS record

02:23:52.980 --> 02:23:56.020
and that you will update inside a GoDaddy as per this

02:23:56.020 --> 02:23:59.300
diagram. This is what you have to follow but not IP address

02:23:59.300 --> 02:24:04.460
directly. No, got it. Got it. Thanks. Yeah. Okay. Sumit, go

02:24:04.460 --> 02:24:09.830
ahead please with the question. Sir, good morning. Yeah,

02:24:09.830 --> 02:24:12.730
good morning. First of all, I think I just want to share a

02:24:12.730 --> 02:24:17.030
good news. As you suggested to post on LinkedIn on a weekly

02:24:17.030 --> 02:24:21.270
twice. So, I got one opportunity from one of the company who

02:24:21.270 --> 02:24:26.590
want me to train them on a JNI course. Okay, amazing. Yeah,

02:24:26.610 --> 02:24:29.470
I told you, right? So, if you and many people, I have seen

02:24:29.470 --> 02:24:32.230
even from your badge. So, when I ask people that okay, do a

02:24:32.230 --> 02:24:35.590
project, they don't do it. Like people is having hundreds of

02:24:35.590 --> 02:24:39.210
excuses. When I asked them in a beginning itself that keep

02:24:39.210 --> 02:24:42.090
on posting something on and something valuable. So, I have

02:24:42.090 --> 02:24:45.470
seen some of the post where people don't even remove the

02:24:45.470 --> 02:24:49.370
static static marks from a chat GPT they used to get and

02:24:49.370 --> 02:24:54.290
they just post it on a internet. Again, like even and when I

02:24:54.290 --> 02:24:58.150
say keep on posting over a social media, again people don't

02:24:58.150 --> 02:25:01.430
do it. But yeah, those who do it, they get a benefit and I

02:25:01.430 --> 02:25:07.030
think you are able to get it. Yes. Now, tell me. I want to

02:25:07.030 --> 02:25:10.490
understand. Actually, I am writing a blog also. I write on

02:25:10.490 --> 02:25:14.930
like fine tuning on that. Now, I am doing for like for the

02:25:14.930 --> 02:25:18.410
QLR. The main thing I want to understand from you like when

02:25:18.410 --> 02:25:21.330
I am trying to understand as you have explained in the last

02:25:21.330 --> 02:25:23.910
like fine tuning badge, the mathematical thing. But still, a

02:25:23.910 --> 02:25:26.010
lot of things are there which I have to understand how it's

02:25:26.010 --> 02:25:28.850
going internally because in blog I have to go deep in dive.

02:25:28.950 --> 02:25:34.250
I have like read the research paper twice. I have gone to

02:25:34.250 --> 02:25:38.850
many videos as well. Understood 70%. That's okay. I just

02:25:38.850 --> 02:25:41.150
want to understand from your point of view, whenever any new

02:25:41.150 --> 02:25:43.310
thing comes up, in the market, that's like A2A is new, now

02:25:43.310 --> 02:25:45.850
Antigraphy is new. So, are you, what is your approach to

02:25:45.850 --> 02:25:47.950
learn anything in a new, first of all, how you will

02:25:47.950 --> 02:25:51.590
understand that something came and then when you gave us

02:25:51.590 --> 02:25:56.550
demo for the new thing, will you also like read like read

02:25:56.550 --> 02:25:59.790
those research paper or blogs, then you implement it like

02:25:59.790 --> 02:26:02.850
how you will. Because for us, after this course, like many

02:26:02.850 --> 02:26:05.150
things will be come up in the market. So, we have to learn

02:26:05.150 --> 02:26:10.270
by own. Because my question coming when I am like writing a

02:26:10.270 --> 02:26:13.170
blog in the QLR, you have mentioned few step, like first

02:26:13.170 --> 02:26:17.690
model loading, then data like load, then tokenizer. So, how

02:26:17.690 --> 02:26:20.630
to get all this structure in my mindset. Exactly. Yeah.

02:26:21.050 --> 02:26:25.350
Sumit, I think my screen is visible, right? Yes, sir. It's

02:26:25.350 --> 02:26:28.030
your screen is visible. Yeah. See, a message from our

02:26:28.030 --> 02:26:30.430
founder, Dhanasi Kumar, which is me, when I started my

02:26:30.430 --> 02:26:33.130
journey, just to answer your question in a precise manner,

02:26:33.270 --> 02:26:37.270
in a written way, I didn't have a mentor, industry

02:26:37.270 --> 02:26:40.290
connection or right exposure. I have started like a journey

02:26:40.290 --> 02:26:46.070
from, so very small college and then like a company. So, I

02:26:46.070 --> 02:26:48.890
learned by struggling, experimenting, failing, rebuilding

02:26:48.890 --> 02:26:51.630
everything from the scratch. This is what I'm doing since

02:26:51.630 --> 02:26:55.070
last 11 year, day and night. Maybe you can say like a 14-15

02:26:55.070 --> 02:26:58.450
hour a day, all seven days, right? And even till today,

02:26:58.590 --> 02:27:03.230
right? That's the only approach which has helped me out. I

02:27:03.230 --> 02:27:07.650
have, I think in my whole life, I have never watched any

02:27:07.650 --> 02:27:13.390
tutorial. Yeah. Never means literally never. And I have read

02:27:13.390 --> 02:27:17.030
a lot of like a research paper. I read books, but nowadays,

02:27:17.090 --> 02:27:19.630
since last three or four years, so I just used to read

02:27:19.630 --> 02:27:24.250
philosophy books and I just used to read a poetry books,

02:27:24.510 --> 02:27:27.290
which I love a lot, but not a technical book at all, because

02:27:27.290 --> 02:27:31.050
again, you can just go and pick any technical book out

02:27:31.050 --> 02:27:35.210
there, right? So with 600 pages, 700 pages, it is going to

02:27:35.210 --> 02:27:37.950
take maybe a month, two months or six months of time to

02:27:37.950 --> 02:27:40.990
digest all of those knowledge. But by building something by

02:27:40.990 --> 02:27:43.990
like, you know, picking up some of the problems, by solving

02:27:43.990 --> 02:27:47.070
those problems, you will be able to learn it maybe in two or

02:27:47.070 --> 02:27:50.150
three days of time that any book will not be able to explain

02:27:50.150 --> 02:27:53.350
you. So my approach even till today, even with a new thing

02:27:53.350 --> 02:27:57.390
is build, test it, try to build some application which

02:27:57.390 --> 02:27:59.770
should work in a production, which should work for my

02:27:59.770 --> 02:28:02.910
client, which should work or solve some of the problems for

02:28:02.910 --> 02:28:07.030
my associate or for my client. And this is what I have like

02:28:07.030 --> 02:28:09.570
done. And this is what I used to say even inside a class

02:28:09.570 --> 02:28:13.050
from a beginning. And I clearly say, and if you go and check

02:28:13.050 --> 02:28:16.290
my initial class in any batches, any of my batches in last

02:28:16.290 --> 02:28:19.330
like a seven to eight year, I simply say that that see, you

02:28:19.330 --> 02:28:21.830
are not here to give an exam, right? You don't have to like,

02:28:21.870 --> 02:28:24.810
you know, take a degree. Basically, you have to get an

02:28:24.810 --> 02:28:28.010
experience. Even yesterday when I created a video, I said

02:28:28.010 --> 02:28:32.350
the same thing that when we used to, you know, we happen to

02:28:32.350 --> 02:28:35.230
be in a college, we happen to be in a school. So over there,

02:28:35.250 --> 02:28:38.030
our objective is to pass the exam, get a degree or get maybe

02:28:38.030 --> 02:28:41.950
a certificate. But when we come into a reality, a real life

02:28:41.950 --> 02:28:45.630
industry, basically, so at that point of time, so we try to

02:28:45.630 --> 02:28:48.250
say that as experience, whenever you are going to leave a

02:28:48.250 --> 02:28:49.890
company, they're going to give you not a degree, not a

02:28:49.890 --> 02:28:52.550
certificate, but experience later, and that is going to

02:28:52.550 --> 02:28:55.710
yield a next opportunity for you, right? And that experience

02:28:55.710 --> 02:28:59.350
is going to come not just by studying something that

02:28:59.350 --> 02:29:02.330
experience is going to come to solve your client problem or

02:29:02.330 --> 02:29:05.450
to build some product of work in some product. So I strictly

02:29:05.450 --> 02:29:09.310
advise everyone that if you have to be relevant inside our

02:29:09.310 --> 02:29:12.350
industry, stop doing all of those nonsense. That people used

02:29:12.350 --> 02:29:15.090
to do it like going through a lot of articles, going through

02:29:15.090 --> 02:29:17.310
a lot of blogs, going through a lot of like videos,

02:29:17.430 --> 02:29:19.790
tutorials and all those things. It's completely fine if

02:29:19.790 --> 02:29:22.370
you're able to get initial understanding, for example, what

02:29:22.370 --> 02:29:25.430
is agent if I'm able to understand immediately, let's go and

02:29:25.430 --> 02:29:27.890
build it. If I'm understand if I understand a Python

02:29:27.890 --> 02:29:30.610
programming, right immediately, let's go and start doing

02:29:30.610 --> 02:29:33.310
something. I mean, like people keep on waiting to learn, you

02:29:33.310 --> 02:29:36.190
know, Python, the thing that okay, fine, so I'll try to

02:29:36.190 --> 02:29:39.310
like, you know, take a mastery into a Python and then I will

02:29:39.310 --> 02:29:41.390
start building some application and that day is not going to

02:29:41.390 --> 02:29:43.910
come. Right. And people are not going to appreciate you

02:29:43.910 --> 02:29:47.230
inside the industry for your learning and especially in 2025

02:29:47.230 --> 02:29:52.090
and beyond. No one is going to appreciate you and not even a

02:29:52.090 --> 02:29:54.810
one single percent for your learning, even if you're going

02:29:54.810 --> 02:29:57.590
to say that I'm a very good learner. So I'll say, okay, then

02:29:57.590 --> 02:29:59.830
what I will do with that learning? Keep your learning with

02:29:59.830 --> 02:30:02.610
you because I need an experienced person. I need someone who

02:30:02.610 --> 02:30:05.270
can do a job. I need someone who can do a 10 days of job in

02:30:05.270 --> 02:30:10.430
one day. Right. So this my simple advice is already written

02:30:10.430 --> 02:30:14.510
over here, right? It's just a experience. Just experience

02:30:14.510 --> 02:30:18.310
means just experience work more. You will work and again,

02:30:18.370 --> 02:30:21.430
you will enjoy actually. So learn this, this, no, this

02:30:21.430 --> 02:30:25.930
experience, this work is even more enjoyable than a learning

02:30:25.930 --> 02:30:29.150
because when we learn, we are not able to most of us, most

02:30:29.150 --> 02:30:32.090
of us are not able to find out the end that, okay, where my

02:30:32.090 --> 02:30:34.130
learning is going to end when I will be able to get an

02:30:34.130 --> 02:30:36.970
opportunity. But when you build things are different, it is

02:30:36.970 --> 02:30:39.390
going to give you a different kind of a dopamine hit. So

02:30:39.390 --> 02:30:42.890
again, reiterating, which I have already reiterated more

02:30:42.890 --> 02:30:47.010
than a hundred times in my past, just build, focus on

02:30:47.010 --> 02:30:49.830
building something. Learning is fine. I mean, like that,

02:30:49.950 --> 02:30:52.850
that's actual learning. I would say, right. If you're not

02:30:52.850 --> 02:30:56.330
doing it, then you are doing it, you're doing it wrong. So

02:30:56.330 --> 02:30:59.610
sure, I totally agree. But you just in addition to this one,

02:30:59.670 --> 02:31:03.270
as you were saying building, I just know one topic, may I am

02:31:03.270 --> 02:31:06.130
kill or I don't know anything about it. I just like Google

02:31:06.130 --> 02:31:11.530
it. What is the concept from that? Just ah, that question is

02:31:11.530 --> 02:31:13.770
not going to get answered. mind how to build it so what we

02:31:13.770 --> 02:31:17.990
need to do on a google like do i need to google see no no no

02:31:17.990 --> 02:31:20.970
so see building never happens in that way so you need a real

02:31:20.970 --> 02:31:23.970
problem in your hand you need a real people in your hand

02:31:23.970 --> 02:31:27.350
basically so that is the reason uh if you remember all of

02:31:27.350 --> 02:31:31.350
you so couple of days back so i have posted a message in all

02:31:31.350 --> 02:31:34.450
the groups saying that that you guys can try to create a

02:31:34.450 --> 02:31:37.830
small small groups right uh try to pick any kind of open

02:31:37.830 --> 02:31:41.130
source project even try to replicate the existing open

02:31:41.130 --> 02:31:43.270
source project because if you're trying to learn generative

02:31:43.270 --> 02:31:45.970
ai there are a lot of open source liability there are a lot

02:31:45.970 --> 02:31:48.230
of open source project which people are building which

02:31:48.230 --> 02:31:50.390
people are working on there are a lot of open source product

02:31:50.390 --> 02:31:52.990
that people are building which people are working on right

02:31:52.990 --> 02:31:56.710
so maybe try to create a small group and try to design each

02:31:56.710 --> 02:31:59.310
and every kind of a solution which is already available or

02:31:59.310 --> 02:32:01.350
maybe someone else has built it some other group has built

02:32:01.350 --> 02:32:05.230
it right that is one of the approach but yeah i have seen

02:32:05.230 --> 02:32:08.430
some like you know communication inside the group but after

02:32:08.430 --> 02:32:12.410
that no one has sent me even a single project right no one

02:32:12.410 --> 02:32:14.730
has and even i have already mentioned over there that i'm

02:32:14.730 --> 02:32:17.170
going to assist you i'm going to help you out if you will be

02:32:17.170 --> 02:32:20.610
stuck somewhere because randomly if you go to google what

02:32:20.610 --> 02:32:24.210
google will say how google will be able to help you out now

02:32:24.210 --> 02:32:28.990
that is one of the approach second approach is welcome to

02:32:28.990 --> 02:32:31.690
work and learn i'll give you the project you will be working

02:32:31.690 --> 02:32:34.770
in my project you will be working with me with my team with

02:32:34.770 --> 02:32:39.570
on my client project in real but yes it comes with the

02:32:39.570 --> 02:32:42.570
payments as simple as that as that so these are the two

02:32:42.570 --> 02:32:46.430
approach uh i believe so with any approach if you are okay

02:32:46.430 --> 02:32:49.370
please go ahead yes sir i think i had discussed with one of

02:32:49.370 --> 02:32:54.450
your like uh teammate uh yeah they told you i believe that

02:32:54.450 --> 02:32:57.110
for a working professional so and i think i have already

02:32:57.110 --> 02:32:59.770
clarified that in the morning like itself i just want to

02:32:59.770 --> 02:33:02.370
understand like uh this is the project which you are getting

02:33:02.370 --> 02:33:06.130
on a like service space but if our goal is to only on a

02:33:06.130 --> 02:33:08.390
product base whether no no so we are not getting something

02:33:08.390 --> 02:33:10.990
this project no no not at all not at all we have already

02:33:10.990 --> 02:33:14.250
received almost more than i would say in last three week

02:33:14.250 --> 02:33:17.910
itself so we have received more than i think count is 56 or

02:33:17.910 --> 02:33:21.690
57 somewhere right a product based people are coming to us

02:33:21.690 --> 02:33:24.690
saying that i'm launching this startup and you have to build

02:33:24.690 --> 02:33:28.650
something from a various scratch right that is the kind of a

02:33:28.650 --> 02:33:31.370
product that we have taken there are some people who are

02:33:31.370 --> 02:33:34.170
just asking us to solve their like a day-to-day problem uh

02:33:34.170 --> 02:33:36.830
that the problem that they're facing inside their uh you

02:33:36.830 --> 02:33:39.550
know the existing company maybe they're not able to solve

02:33:39.550 --> 02:33:43.170
that so that that comes into a support and service part so

02:33:43.170 --> 02:33:46.510
our support team is like helping them out and you know they

02:33:46.510 --> 02:33:48.250
are trying to solve their day-to-day problem that's a

02:33:48.250 --> 02:33:50.910
different one i'm talking about a product basically along

02:33:50.910 --> 02:33:53.670
with that so we are building our own ai builders as i have

02:33:53.670 --> 02:33:57.250
already mentioned unlovable uh better than that basically so

02:33:57.250 --> 02:33:59.970
which will be released in a month of march along with that

02:33:59.970 --> 02:34:02.210
so we are building our neurons as itself there are a lot of

02:34:02.210 --> 02:34:04.030
ai that we are doing over there a lot of application

02:34:04.030 --> 02:34:06.310
building we are doing it over that's a big system right it's

02:34:06.310 --> 02:34:09.810
a sas system that we are like uh releasing it uh with the

02:34:09.810 --> 02:34:13.170
name your own systems uh so yeah this this kind of a project

02:34:13.170 --> 02:34:17.270
i was talking about okay right that will help us for a fan

02:34:17.270 --> 02:34:20.330
kind of company as well so to get exposure like we can up

02:34:20.330 --> 02:34:24.790
with 15 plus zero experience they expect us to be a

02:34:24.790 --> 02:34:29.050
technical lead or principal architect you can say yeah right

02:34:29.050 --> 02:34:32.550
with current company i don't have experience only this is

02:34:32.550 --> 02:34:35.330
the platform which you are including is very well much

02:34:35.330 --> 02:34:39.350
helpful for us so see this is this is the submit i'll tell

02:34:39.350 --> 02:34:42.530
you one thing right so in my team and since last 11 year i'm

02:34:42.530 --> 02:34:44.930
building a team and as a part of startup since last seven

02:34:44.930 --> 02:34:48.450
year i'm building my team right uh even i don't so it was

02:34:48.450 --> 02:34:50.910
like a very very big team almost like a 450 people or 500

02:34:50.910 --> 02:34:53.630
people uh even here so we are like following the same

02:34:53.630 --> 02:34:59.470
traction so i have seen right from my teaching experience as

02:34:59.470 --> 02:35:02.150
well as from my own team building because personally i used

02:35:02.150 --> 02:35:04.410
to build a team i used to like handpick each and every one

02:35:04.410 --> 02:35:06.970
so whenever i used to build even a current one and the

02:35:06.970 --> 02:35:11.890
previous one so i have felt that that uh if you are very

02:35:11.890 --> 02:35:15.310
very active and if i'm going to allocate you a beautiful

02:35:15.310 --> 02:35:17.750
project with a beautiful architecture with a beautiful

02:35:17.750 --> 02:35:22.050
funnel if you are going to work in any project and doesn't

02:35:22.050 --> 02:35:24.090
matter whether you know something or not doesn't matter from

02:35:24.090 --> 02:35:26.070
which background you are coming doesn't matter how many

02:35:26.070 --> 02:35:28.970
years of experience you have but what i believe is that that

02:35:28.970 --> 02:35:33.770
if someone is going to work in a real project even for five

02:35:33.770 --> 02:35:37.090
to six months which is a huge time i would say six month is

02:35:37.090 --> 02:35:40.450
not a small time right it's a huge huge time so if someone

02:35:40.450 --> 02:35:45.410
is going to work believe me that person will be much much

02:35:45.410 --> 02:35:48.950
better than any person who have studied something for maybe

02:35:48.950 --> 02:35:52.730
a two year or even a five year right and practically i have

02:35:52.730 --> 02:35:55.290
seen that and i have seen that not just one time with one

02:35:55.290 --> 02:35:58.530
person with almost everyone this is what i suggest from a

02:35:58.530 --> 02:36:01.090
beginning itself that i'm not here to teach something i'm

02:36:01.090 --> 02:36:03.810
here to do something to experiment something to build

02:36:03.810 --> 02:36:06.970
something with you and yeah you should do the same thing i

02:36:06.970 --> 02:36:09.450
never said that that i'm a good teacher i'm going to teach

02:36:09.450 --> 02:36:10.830
you you know all these things i'm not going to teach you all

02:36:10.830 --> 02:36:13.450
these things no i'm a good builder i'll sit with you i'll

02:36:13.450 --> 02:36:15.690
guide you i'll teach you how to build things and if you are

02:36:15.690 --> 02:36:19.290
willing to do it do it and that will be my advice even going

02:36:19.290 --> 02:36:23.150
forward right sure thank you uh one last question on that

02:36:23.150 --> 02:36:28.790
technical side i have like while while implementing cola and

02:36:28.790 --> 02:36:33.670
these things i have resolved all this query but some like we

02:36:33.670 --> 02:36:36.790
do some like problem my session got restarted and now again

02:36:36.790 --> 02:36:39.550
i went to the same phase of zero where i didn't have to

02:36:39.550 --> 02:36:44.110
depend like solar dependency so any is in any way where i

02:36:44.110 --> 02:36:48.590
can freeze my running environment so that if i will run that

02:36:48.590 --> 02:36:52.110
environment after six months also it will not ask me for the

02:36:52.110 --> 02:36:55.290
it's it's like it's okay the version and all these things

02:36:55.290 --> 02:36:57.510
will be changed but that the old version should be intact

02:36:57.510 --> 02:37:01.410
and my code should be run is there anything yeah that is

02:37:01.410 --> 02:37:03.730
that is possible see so there is a meaning of creating a

02:37:03.730 --> 02:37:06.950
virtual environment or environment right and every like an

02:37:06.950 --> 02:37:09.430
environment or every library come with a worsening so let's

02:37:09.430 --> 02:37:13.090
suppose in my environment or txt or toml file that i'm going

02:37:13.090 --> 02:37:15.770
to create right so if i'm going to mention a specific

02:37:15.770 --> 02:37:18.870
version if i'm going to rerun it it will run as it is with

02:37:18.870 --> 02:37:21.450
the same version which i have executed maybe four years back

02:37:21.450 --> 02:37:25.450
forget about six months four years back so yes so like

02:37:25.450 --> 02:37:28.210
generally what happened just now i have one requirement of

02:37:28.210 --> 02:37:31.010
tsc i have a few specific questions but while running that

02:37:31.010 --> 02:37:36.090
file it's again asking me for new dependency i just went to

02:37:36.090 --> 02:37:40.250
google and i like install and clear all this thing now no no

02:37:40.250 --> 02:37:42.910
no no no then then then maybe you have changed your python

02:37:42.910 --> 02:37:46.130
version see to run the requirement or txt file you need a

02:37:46.130 --> 02:37:48.950
python now maybe previous project you have executed in

02:37:48.950 --> 02:37:53.030
python uh 3.8 right and now you are trying to execute it in

02:37:53.030 --> 02:37:57.870
a 3.11 then there will be a problem your base also supposed

02:37:57.870 --> 02:38:01.690
to be same right okay yeah so that could be a problem

02:38:01.690 --> 02:38:04.430
otherwise i don't think it will give you a problem in any

02:38:04.430 --> 02:38:09.610
circumstances so if you're based so so so what that phrase

02:38:09.610 --> 02:38:13.710
means so that we are freezing this is something see pip

02:38:13.710 --> 02:38:17.610
freeze means basically inside a python environment whatever

02:38:17.610 --> 02:38:20.870
library or whatever installation you have done on top of

02:38:20.870 --> 02:38:24.050
python see to execute those library the base is base

02:38:24.050 --> 02:38:28.030
requirement is python language right so inside that whatever

02:38:28.030 --> 02:38:31.370
you have installed it is going to freeze that part now

02:38:31.370 --> 02:38:33.870
whenever you run requirement.txt can i say without

02:38:33.870 --> 02:38:38.510
installing python first you can't run requirement.txt right

02:38:38.510 --> 02:38:41.250
so let's suppose if you have changed your python itself then

02:38:41.250 --> 02:38:43.730
there will be a conflict if your python version has not

02:38:43.730 --> 02:38:47.970
changed it will never give you a conflict base should be

02:38:47.970 --> 02:38:51.030
same okay yeah so your base in base is supposed to be same

02:38:51.030 --> 02:38:53.570
you must have changed your base and that is the only problem

02:38:53.570 --> 02:38:57.730
thank you for your guidance yeah yeah thanks thanks so much

02:38:57.730 --> 02:39:00.810
okay next one is arun please go ahead with your question

02:39:00.810 --> 02:39:06.550
yeah yeah i just mess up with this uh port forwarding in

02:39:06.550 --> 02:39:11.310
that so okay i wanted to share my screen okay sure sure you

02:39:11.310 --> 02:39:15.250
can share your screen uh in between uh yeah rakesh you have

02:39:15.250 --> 02:39:19.730
a question yeah yeah sir actually uh i have some questions

02:39:19.730 --> 02:39:25.250
related to aws elastic beanstalk services i mean uh right

02:39:25.250 --> 02:39:30.950
now we have deployed our services on the ec2 right so uh are

02:39:30.950 --> 02:39:34.430
we going to cover this even even in the bin stock we can do

02:39:34.430 --> 02:39:36.950
it and even with uh over there we can try to map it so in

02:39:36.950 --> 02:39:39.050
the elastic business tag you just have to zip the things and

02:39:39.050 --> 02:39:43.390
then upload the zip and then like application will be up and

02:39:43.390 --> 02:39:46.150
running that's uh even as a docker you can try to put it

02:39:46.150 --> 02:39:49.870
over there so we'll not cover like i said so see there are

02:39:49.870 --> 02:39:52.910
like a hundreds of ways by which we can do a deployment and

02:39:52.910 --> 02:39:55.570
all those like even aws itself is providing you more than

02:39:55.570 --> 02:40:00.210
270 services right there it will become more like a aws

02:40:00.210 --> 02:40:05.170
class not a jni class no no actually because uh there are

02:40:05.170 --> 02:40:09.710
two uh two major different uh differences between our the

02:40:09.710 --> 02:40:13.990
one of the ec2 and one of the elastic beans talk so that's

02:40:13.990 --> 02:40:16.890
why i am asking these questions because that is a that's a

02:40:16.890 --> 02:40:19.450
service deployment for the beanstalk i i think i have

02:40:19.450 --> 02:40:21.530
already covered i have already shown elastic bin stack in a

02:40:21.530 --> 02:40:24.710
lot of recording as well uh elastic unit because elastic bin

02:40:24.710 --> 02:40:27.910
stack looks like uh pretty much easier as compared to ec2

02:40:27.910 --> 02:40:31.270
right but uh yeah so if you are working into a real project

02:40:31.270 --> 02:40:34.310
from the various stats generally we try to like or we tend

02:40:34.310 --> 02:40:36.670
to you know configure each and everything as a raw

02:40:36.670 --> 02:40:40.150
environment which is technically an ec2 instance okay but

02:40:40.850 --> 02:40:44.270
elastic bin stack is very easy okay okay and just like that

02:40:44.270 --> 02:40:49.650
uh also we can deploy this one as uh domain domain yeah yeah

02:40:49.650 --> 02:40:53.010
and domain mapping is like a same so domain mapping part

02:40:53.010 --> 02:40:55.690
that i've shown you right good idea to this to this it's

02:40:55.690 --> 02:40:58.130
it's actually same so it's like a similar procedure that it

02:40:58.130 --> 02:41:01.910
follows okay okay thank you thank you so much and the one i

02:41:01.910 --> 02:41:05.310
just wanted to give you her uh input uh related to the

02:41:05.310 --> 02:41:11.670
summit i think uh has asked the version versions that yeah

02:41:11.670 --> 02:41:16.010
yes so we we can't depend on the older version because the

02:41:16.010 --> 02:41:20.510
vapt points all always claims in our organizations and then

02:41:20.510 --> 02:41:24.750
we we should we should uh upgrade our applications according

02:41:24.750 --> 02:41:29.290
to the versions as well so we we can't depends on the older

02:41:29.290 --> 02:41:34.750
or uh very older versions so it's it's just if project is

02:41:34.750 --> 02:41:37.370
running on a older version you can't do it right and if

02:41:37.370 --> 02:41:42.130
something is running you can't and this happens with many

02:41:42.130 --> 02:41:45.690
old projects so the patchings are it's uh always uh patching

02:41:45.690 --> 02:41:48.850
comes in our picture in our organizations and we we can't

02:41:48.850 --> 02:41:52.650
ignore that not not not every organization believe me okay

02:41:52.650 --> 02:41:57.210
okay right because it comes with because i'm i'm facing lots

02:41:57.210 --> 02:42:00.370
of things yeah because because it comes with the investment

02:42:00.370 --> 02:42:02.930
right so if someone is have hired you to do a patch

02:42:02.930 --> 02:42:06.290
obviously they are paying a salary it is it is like a giving

02:42:06.290 --> 02:42:08.170
them a cost so not everyone does

02:42:10.850 --> 02:42:14.870
on the os level as well as on the on the some different

02:42:14.870 --> 02:42:19.970
different uh i mean networking labels as well the security

02:42:19.970 --> 02:42:24.170
levels yeah we do a patching what let's suppose there is a

02:42:24.170 --> 02:42:27.130
project which have not been passed since last like a couple

02:42:27.130 --> 02:42:31.070
of months so it should run right so simple thing is use the

02:42:31.070 --> 02:42:33.070
same piece environment you use the same requirement or txt

02:42:33.070 --> 02:42:37.070
run it yeah okay yeah i don't please go ahead with the

02:42:37.070 --> 02:42:41.830
question uh just need to share like uh i i think it should

02:42:41.830 --> 02:42:46.530
be a panelist uh yes yeah i don't know i think you will be

02:42:46.530 --> 02:42:49.070
able to join i think i have already promoted as a panelist

02:42:49.070 --> 02:42:52.110
okay so in between anuj s please go to the question

02:42:57.340 --> 02:43:04.240
yeah you can share your screen i think you have a permission

02:43:04.240 --> 02:43:10.540
now okay pause disabled participant screen sharing no no

02:43:10.540 --> 02:43:15.960
click and i will get a pop-up i can approve you okay i click

02:43:15.960 --> 02:43:23.640
now okay got it click and select your screen it will allow

02:43:23.640 --> 02:43:24.160
you to share

02:43:27.240 --> 02:43:31.160
yes i think you haven't done that so far yeah i'm trying to

02:43:31.160 --> 02:43:37.000
i have posted it okay oh yeah i can see your screen now okay

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:44.920
uh i opened these two tabs for uh uv and uh the nginx so i

02:43:44.920 --> 02:43:52.040
messed up somewhere here i think port was really okay fine

02:43:52.040 --> 02:43:55.920
so your inbound show me your inbound i think i you are

02:43:55.920 --> 02:44:00.820
showing me outbound yeah inbound and then it is inbound fine

02:44:00.820 --> 02:44:07.860
so no no just show me inbound fine https http custom tcp

02:44:07.860 --> 02:44:12.800
8000 port number custom fine this looks good click on save

02:44:12.800 --> 02:44:18.020
yeah this is fine okay so share this is this is fine

02:44:27.520 --> 02:44:35.960
so one thing like here i am so have you done a port

02:44:35.960 --> 02:44:40.900
forwarding like and have you that is what i'm i think

02:44:40.900 --> 02:44:47.360
missing okay restart nginx sudo systemctl restart nginx

02:44:47.360 --> 02:44:57.580
nginx. Okay, fine. And apart from the problem with this,

02:44:57.580 --> 02:45:06.120
with which one you'll be UV. Have you used UV over here? I

02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:10.900
don't think so. Okay. Unicorn. So you are not able to run

02:45:10.900 --> 02:45:17.620
the application even inside. Yeah. Okay. Show me, show me

02:45:17.620 --> 02:45:20.240
the, you can run the, you can come on and show me what is

02:45:20.240 --> 02:45:20.540
the issue.

02:45:23.790 --> 02:45:28.670
This is where I run this. This is running. This is running.

02:45:30.730 --> 02:45:36.710
Sure. Hmm. Yeah, this is running. It seems so. So do app

02:45:36.710 --> 02:45:42.070
install you go accessing this in the. No, no, no. So you

02:45:42.070 --> 02:45:44.550
can't access this one, right? This is your. Your IP address

02:45:44.550 --> 02:45:49.730
to our EC2 instance inside AWS server or investor. So

02:45:49.730 --> 02:45:52.350
basically go back to your EC2, how you will be able to

02:45:52.350 --> 02:45:56.730
access 0.0.0. So you go to your container, basically go to

02:45:56.730 --> 02:46:00.710
your EC2, not

02:46:00.710 --> 02:46:05.150
console. Yeah. Not console one, not console. This is a

02:46:05.150 --> 02:46:09.650
console, right? So server that you are able to see like that

02:46:09.650 --> 02:46:14.570
place, go back to your AWS. Okay. Okay.

02:46:19.020 --> 02:46:21.560
Now over here, go to your, like a EC2.

02:46:25.330 --> 02:46:30.160
Now go to dashboard. First option instance.

02:46:32.970 --> 02:46:38.650
Hmm. Now click on instance. Hmm. Now copy public DNS. This

02:46:38.650 --> 02:46:43.430
one easy to 52, 37, one 50. Public DNS. Second row. Last

02:46:43.430 --> 02:46:43.730
option.

02:46:46.770 --> 02:46:49.870
No, no, no. There is a there, there, there, there, this one

02:46:49.870 --> 02:46:53.970
go up, go up, go up just a minute. I'm marking it. This

02:46:53.970 --> 02:47:06.910
part, this one. Copy it. Hmm. Okay. I was missing this. Hmm.

02:47:09.790 --> 02:47:13.770
Hmm. What was your port by the way? 8,000, right? So call it

02:47:13.770 --> 02:47:14.250
8,000.

02:47:20.600 --> 02:47:23.900
It's inside the, it's in, not in the local, it's in the AWS,

02:47:24.240 --> 02:47:28.700
right? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So if it is running, it

02:47:28.700 --> 02:47:30.940
will show you, if it is not running, it will not show you.

02:47:31.940 --> 02:47:33.760
Simple. Okay. Because it will, it's running, I mean it is

02:47:33.760 --> 02:47:37.560
running. It is running. Shut

02:47:44.410 --> 02:47:50.410
down. Error while bind to the address 0, 0, address already

02:47:50.410 --> 02:47:54.370
in use, application shutdown completed waiting for, yeah. So

02:47:54.370 --> 02:47:57.290
basically the, I think you have already configured NGINX,

02:47:57.390 --> 02:48:03.990
right? Just now I'm running. Yeah. I, should I, Show me

02:48:03.990 --> 02:48:08.730
whether it's running or not? status you want to yeah status

02:48:08.730 --> 02:48:10.270
basically simple

02:48:28.350 --> 02:48:31.530
sudo system ctl status and then your like application name

02:48:31.530 --> 02:48:35.930
fast ap or something that you have given this one fail

02:48:46.780 --> 02:48:49.460
to start fast api service fast api you're gonna no it's not

02:48:49.460 --> 02:48:53.940
running actually okay yeah so i'll just do one thing alone

02:48:53.940 --> 02:48:56.740
so i'll just upload like uh you know when i will upload okay

02:48:56.740 --> 02:49:00.120
recording i'll upload even a document because i know many

02:49:00.120 --> 02:49:02.760
people will face an issue and many of us are not able to do

02:49:02.760 --> 02:49:05.720
it right okay it's a little bit of like a you know lengthy

02:49:05.720 --> 02:49:08.320
process but yeah it's a one-time process once you are able

02:49:08.320 --> 02:49:10.460
if you are able to do it once you will be able to do it

02:49:10.460 --> 02:49:13.540
again and again for our entire life right so i'll upload the

02:49:13.540 --> 02:49:15.920
beautiful documentation with the explanation same thing

02:49:15.920 --> 02:49:18.680
which i have done in the class and uh yeah i think that will

02:49:18.680 --> 02:49:23.120
help help you out my godaddy's account okay godaddy is

02:49:23.120 --> 02:49:26.140
activated so maybe yeah so once uh you will be having a

02:49:26.140 --> 02:49:29.920
route 53 right and the dom ns basically ns record name

02:49:29.920 --> 02:49:32.260
server records then you can come to this one and then you

02:49:32.260 --> 02:49:36.100
can like update it now for now uh it's like doesn't make

02:49:36.100 --> 02:49:39.880
sense to update it actually route 53 also i had configured

02:49:39.880 --> 02:49:43.520
everything is done only this part then then route 53 must be

02:49:43.520 --> 02:49:48.620
have given you ns record yeah that is copied here okay that

02:49:48.620 --> 02:49:51.760
you have already copied and then this uh like uh have you

02:49:51.760 --> 02:50:00.360
mapped a route 53 with a machine that is uh yeah no no uh so

02:50:00.360 --> 02:50:03.480
route 53 is a godaddy on one side then you have to attach go

02:50:03.480 --> 02:50:09.600
to go to your aws aws itself yeah endless window okay okay

02:50:13.820 --> 02:50:17.200
yeah so open up your route 53

02:50:26.750 --> 02:50:30.440
and have you obtained elastic ip address yes yes okay then

02:50:30.440 --> 02:50:35.900
good uh in this one so basically hosted zone uh left hand

02:50:35.900 --> 02:50:38.020
side second option yeah

02:50:40.290 --> 02:50:41.330
create a hosted zone

02:50:46.560 --> 02:50:49.430
this is done and this is yeah create create record fine this

02:50:49.430 --> 02:50:56.890
is fine uh like uh create record fine okay this is now here

02:50:56.890 --> 02:51:00.090
so you have to give basically this uh ip address value wise

02:51:00.090 --> 02:51:05.290
value value value the ip value yeah this is this one this

02:51:05.290 --> 02:51:10.330
one value not not uh domain this one this value part here

02:51:10.330 --> 02:51:14.110
here here this one yeah okay yeah yeah yeah so this is how

02:51:14.110 --> 02:51:18.230
it will be able to like come from godaddy to route 53 to

02:51:18.230 --> 02:51:22.350
your machine this value is of uh elastic id or something

02:51:22.350 --> 02:51:27.070
yeah address actually okay this is how it will be able to

02:51:27.070 --> 02:51:30.370
understand right so which machine i have to go and hit okay

02:51:30.370 --> 02:51:37.010
uh okay uh so from ec2 yeah you can go to ec2 and then on

02:51:37.010 --> 02:51:39.690
the left hand side networking security and you will be able

02:51:39.690 --> 02:51:42.570
to see your elastic ip this

02:51:47.850 --> 02:51:56.480
is your ip 52 37 150 110 zero this i can put it in 53 yeah

02:51:56.480 --> 02:52:03.640
so now mapping is complete here only 253 to machine okay now

02:52:03.640 --> 02:52:06.140
if something is running in your machine it will like uh it

02:52:06.140 --> 02:52:11.000
will show you at a particular url that you have you have

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:14.220
taken right so yeah if something is running on a machine on

02:52:14.220 --> 02:52:16.060
that particular port number it will show you at this

02:52:16.060 --> 02:52:19.020
particular url something means anything your website your

02:52:19.020 --> 02:52:23.780
application will be like you know more or anything okay so

02:52:23.780 --> 02:52:26.020
you have already completed that i think you are a little bit

02:52:26.020 --> 02:52:29.200
confused between those uh you know port mapping right that

02:52:29.200 --> 02:52:32.140
is only giving you issue rest of the rest of the thing is

02:52:32.140 --> 02:52:36.920
fine rest of this like uh uh mapping is fine yeah yeah so

02:52:36.920 --> 02:52:40.440
maybe after my like a document upload just copy and paste

02:52:40.440 --> 02:52:46.520
until this uh you know creating a route and then yeah i

02:52:46.520 --> 02:52:51.760
think fine thank you yeah okay yeah thanks ask you a

02:52:51.760 --> 02:52:56.080
question uh yeah just a minute uh anuj you can share the

02:52:56.080 --> 02:52:58.440
screen please yeah in between so yeah please go ahead with

02:52:58.440 --> 02:53:02.480
the question yes sir mine issue is same as arun so my is

02:53:02.480 --> 02:53:07.580
fits now i am no your screen is not visible on which sir my

02:53:07.580 --> 02:53:11.320
issue is fits now i have okay okay it's very okay then yeah

02:53:11.320 --> 02:53:15.760
it's same as arun okay okay cool yeah please go with the

02:53:15.760 --> 02:53:20.720
question yeah i mean uh this question is not regarding this

02:53:20.720 --> 02:53:24.780
particular question class okay this question is uh way back

02:53:24.780 --> 02:53:30.320
we did some kind of quantization q laura remember that laura

02:53:30.320 --> 02:53:36.180
q laura you taught us yeah yeah i know now now for example i

02:53:36.180 --> 02:53:42.600
have a for to create an inference engine i need to quantize

02:53:42.600 --> 02:53:50.240
with the fp8 and 8 or aw key q those are basically some

02:53:50.240 --> 02:53:55.560
weight or weight plus activate activation uh parameters okay

02:53:55.560 --> 02:53:58.940
sorry i was not no no no i was not able to understand the

02:53:58.940 --> 02:54:04.400
last part what was that okay okay we have got uh some

02:54:04.400 --> 02:54:09.640
quantity quantization which we can do with the fp8 or int8

02:54:09.640 --> 02:54:20.360
or awq so awq is uh is for weight only while the fp8 and

02:54:20.360 --> 02:54:26.840
int8 will be weight plus some active activation okay now

02:54:26.840 --> 02:54:36.200
suppose if i have some big model llm model and i want to uh

02:54:36.200 --> 02:54:43.540
to optimize it for some particular use case so what kind of

02:54:43.540 --> 02:54:48.420
algorithms uh could be because i have no idea i don't know

02:54:48.420 --> 02:54:52.060
theory but could you give me some kind of uh first of all

02:54:52.060 --> 02:54:55.220
first of all first of all first of all first of all try to

02:54:55.220 --> 02:54:58.200
build some model a small one second approach try to do some

02:54:58.200 --> 02:55:02.040
fine tuning then come to a quantization right otherwise i'll

02:55:02.040 --> 02:55:03.760
give you some answer you will not be able to understand what

02:55:03.760 --> 02:55:07.240
is the use of it nothing right i have done quantization i

02:55:07.240 --> 02:55:13.340
mean q laura when we did it long okay okay and now this is

02:55:13.340 --> 02:55:18.060
different i believe

02:55:18.060 --> 02:55:23.200
maybe i need some other kind of algorithm to do fp8 or uh

02:55:23.200 --> 02:55:30.060
int8 awq uh kind of quantization because this is only it's

02:55:30.060 --> 02:55:35.880
not a algorithm basically it's an approach okay but uh how

02:55:35.880 --> 02:55:39.540
one approach will be better than the other approach that you

02:55:39.540 --> 02:55:43.100
will come up with experimentation and comparison and

02:55:43.100 --> 02:55:47.000
benchmarking okay could you give some little bit hands up

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:50.860
sir so basically like uh when you build a models right so

02:55:51.380 --> 02:55:52.620
you build a model it depends in what category you are

02:55:52.620 --> 02:55:54.900
building a model what kind of a data you are taking what

02:55:54.900 --> 02:55:57.380
kind of a quantization you are doing what is the base model

02:55:57.380 --> 02:56:00.520
that you have and based on what benchmark for what

02:56:00.520 --> 02:56:04.400
particular task you are trying to do it right so you have to

02:56:04.400 --> 02:56:06.800
fix a task first of all whether it's a coding based task

02:56:06.800 --> 02:56:09.680
mathematical based task or maybe you are trying to like you

02:56:09.680 --> 02:56:13.520
know do some sort of uh uh like a thinking ability model you

02:56:13.520 --> 02:56:16.580
are trying to build so task in hand then what is the base

02:56:16.580 --> 02:56:18.520
model what is the data that you have taken what is the

02:56:18.520 --> 02:56:22.580
domain you have chosen a full cycle that you have to come on

02:56:22.580 --> 02:56:29.000
but could you recommend some kind of uh uh some kind of

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:32.360
documentation that can help no no it will be vague it will

02:56:32.360 --> 02:56:35.600
be vague basically pick one use case do that do it for that

02:56:35.600 --> 02:56:40.680
and then only you will be able to understand in depth yeah

02:56:40.680 --> 02:56:44.860
that's that's exactly that's the correct approach and and

02:56:44.860 --> 02:56:48.300
this is for some kind of inference basically everything

02:56:48.300 --> 02:56:51.360
every model inferencing means uh rendering uh like something

02:56:51.360 --> 02:56:51.360
like that so that's that's that's that's that's that's

02:56:51.360 --> 02:56:53.340
that's that's something right inferencing yeah rendering

02:56:53.340 --> 02:56:58.920
from the very generic term by the way but do we have

02:56:58.920 --> 02:57:04.360
something uh uh on our your own site also sir we have taught

02:57:04.360 --> 02:57:07.320
already a lot of things everywhere right so everywhere we

02:57:07.320 --> 02:57:13.100
have like a lot of things including these i i i haven't seen

02:57:13.620 --> 02:57:19.360
anything on our site uh no sir we have like we have a lot of

02:57:19.360 --> 02:57:24.700
things a lot of such things uh for uh uh for example awq and

02:57:24.700 --> 02:57:29.140
this kind of uh uh quantization for adulation i think we

02:57:29.140 --> 02:57:32.840
have already discussed so many times yeah yeah we did

02:57:32.840 --> 02:57:38.020
discuss but that was only examples for for example q loader

02:57:38.020 --> 02:57:42.840
when we did it maybe in zehn four i believe i remember that

02:57:42.840 --> 02:57:51.000
i remember that very well but i haven't uh seen any um any

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:54.840
example of the other ones I'm talking about. What do you

02:57:54.840 --> 02:57:57.040
want, sir? There are thousands of examples. Shall I come in

02:57:57.040 --> 02:57:59.700
a class and teach all the thousands of examples? No, no, no,

02:57:59.700 --> 02:58:01.040
I'm not looking for that. When I teach something to my

02:58:01.040 --> 02:58:02.880
students, right, I expect them to even explore things,

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:07.220
right? No, I can move ahead. I mean, but I was just trying

02:58:07.220 --> 02:58:09.400
to... Please do it and then come up with a problem. Show me

02:58:09.400 --> 02:58:11.940
the process that you have done and then obviously I will be

02:58:11.940 --> 02:58:13.680
able to help you out. Otherwise, just talking about

02:58:13.680 --> 02:58:16.400
something doesn't make sense for me at least. Thank you so

02:58:16.400 --> 02:58:18.600
much, sir. Okay, yeah, please go ahead.

02:58:21.670 --> 02:58:24.550
Yes, sir. Can you allow me to share the screen? Yeah, sure,

02:58:24.610 --> 02:58:29.510
go ahead. Okay. In between, Ganesh, go ahead with the

02:58:29.510 --> 02:58:35.420
question. Yes, sir. So, my question is related to work and

02:58:35.420 --> 02:58:39.720
learn. So, this will be for a six-month duration, right?

02:58:40.140 --> 02:58:42.920
Yeah, six-month duration, starting from like the day you

02:58:42.920 --> 02:58:46.580
would like to start, simple. How many projects we will be

02:58:46.580 --> 02:58:49.640
completing within this? It depends how soon because we will

02:58:49.640 --> 02:58:51.500
be having a deadline of the project. Let's suppose we have a

02:58:51.500 --> 02:58:53.420
deadline of one month, means in one month, in itself you

02:58:53.420 --> 02:58:56.180
have to complete along with the team. Otherwise, someone

02:58:56.180 --> 02:58:58.560
else will complete and you will keep on working on that

02:58:58.560 --> 02:59:00.860
project. So, at least for six months, we will keep you

02:59:00.860 --> 02:59:02.940
engaged. Maybe one single project, maybe a multiple project,

02:59:03.120 --> 02:59:06.360
right? Depends upon your project allocation because there is

02:59:06.360 --> 02:59:09.360
no definite timeline for a project. There is a different

02:59:09.360 --> 02:59:11.900
timeline for a different project. Some projects run for

02:59:11.900 --> 02:59:14.660
years on years. For example, SAS and AI Builder that we are

02:59:14.660 --> 02:59:17.880
doing. So, I think that is running since last nine months or

02:59:17.880 --> 02:59:21.860
more, right? There are some projects like which we used to

02:59:21.860 --> 02:59:23.020
complete in a month. Okay. So, there is a lot of time

02:59:23.020 --> 02:59:25.360
itself. There are a lot of like application and platform

02:59:25.360 --> 02:59:27.900
that we are building for other people, for other startups

02:59:27.900 --> 02:59:32.060
and other companies, big and small, from media and even from

02:59:32.060 --> 02:59:36.260
like outside. So, yeah. So, for some of them, timeline is

02:59:36.260 --> 02:59:39.140
like a four month, five month. So, basically, every projects

02:59:39.140 --> 02:59:43.700
that we start, it comes with a proper timeline delivery plan

02:59:43.700 --> 02:59:47.400
in each and everything and that we try to like give it to

02:59:47.400 --> 02:59:51.200
our client and even to a team. So, this is how things are

02:59:51.200 --> 02:59:54.020
going to. Just like a novel project, normal, any corporate

02:59:54.020 --> 02:59:56.340
project, it is going to run in the same way. No difference

02:59:56.340 --> 03:00:00.460
means literally no differences. So, in between, suppose we

03:00:00.460 --> 03:00:04.260
want to work in our current organization, something we want

03:00:04.260 --> 03:00:06.840
to take initiative in that case, we will be getting the help

03:00:06.840 --> 03:00:10.800
from you guys. See, it's a very vague thing, right? So, if

03:00:10.800 --> 03:00:13.680
you are a part of team, obviously, if you are a part of

03:00:13.680 --> 03:00:17.560
ecosystem and if you are looking for some sort of help in

03:00:17.560 --> 03:00:20.680
terms of maybe a problem you are trying to solve, you can

03:00:20.680 --> 03:00:22.900
ask your teammates, obviously. You can discuss with your

03:00:22.900 --> 03:00:25.900
team. You can come to me and say, because you will be having

03:00:25.900 --> 03:00:27.980
a lot of discussion with your team lead, with your team

03:00:27.980 --> 03:00:31.460
member, with me and I am not going to say that, okay, don't

03:00:31.460 --> 03:00:36.200
discuss this, don't discuss that. So, simple, like human

03:00:36.200 --> 03:00:38.780
manner, like the way we used to work in a company, right? In

03:00:38.780 --> 03:00:42.240
a team. It's not different at all. That's the reason I am

03:00:42.240 --> 03:00:45.260
saying work and learn, right? So, it's not going to be

03:00:45.260 --> 03:00:48.000
different in terms of anything. People, environment,

03:00:48.180 --> 03:00:53.520
whatever you say. Yeah? Yeah. Yes. Okay, thanks. Okay, next

03:00:53.520 --> 03:00:56.260
one. Asit, I think, yeah, you have an option to share.

03:00:56.300 --> 03:00:56.860
Please share the screen.

03:01:00.180 --> 03:01:04.140
Hi, Sudhanshu. Yeah, Ram, please go ahead. Can you do one

03:01:04.140 --> 03:01:07.060
thing? I am going to start practice. Can you copy the

03:01:07.060 --> 03:01:10.880
comment, whatever comment you ran it? I have actually

03:01:10.880 --> 03:01:15.480
terminated my, you know, console. Oh, console, okay. Yeah,

03:01:15.500 --> 03:01:17.720
so I won't be able to file history. I will create a

03:01:17.720 --> 03:01:20.420
document. I will share with you. Yeah, that should be really

03:01:20.420 --> 03:01:23.800
helpful because you followed a lot of steps, right? Exactly,

03:01:23.960 --> 03:01:27.560
yeah. It's difficult to see the recording and no replicant,

03:01:27.560 --> 03:01:30.040
which is very complex. Don't worry. I will not force you to

03:01:30.040 --> 03:01:32.360
watch the recording once again. Go through the entire class.

03:01:32.520 --> 03:01:35.200
I will share the document. Yeah? Okay, thank you so much.

03:01:35.380 --> 03:01:38.300
Yeah, thanks, thanks. Okay, so, Sudhanshu, are you able to

03:01:38.300 --> 03:01:40.700
see mine? Yeah, I think Asit, yeah, your screen is visible.

03:01:41.460 --> 03:01:46.640
Yeah, so, when we deploy anything in the AWS or Azure, there

03:01:46.640 --> 03:01:53.260
are a lot of services, right? Just I create a flow.

03:01:54.600 --> 03:01:58.900
So, just to understand, just this is a Fossilio application,

03:01:59.080 --> 03:02:03.340
for example, DocMiner, right? Then when you, from there,

03:02:03.380 --> 03:02:07.040
there's a UI screen and where you put the prompt. And then

03:02:07.040 --> 03:02:12.560
it will go to some orchestration server, right? So, then it

03:02:12.560 --> 03:02:16.980
is go to, based on the requirement, imagine web services

03:02:16.980 --> 03:02:20.180
because it create your embeddings and all things, right?

03:02:20.300 --> 03:02:24.400
Vector database. So, and from there, it will store in the,

03:02:26.060 --> 03:02:29.160
vector DB and at the same time, if you have a large set of

03:02:29.160 --> 03:02:32.700
million of documents, you can keep in the SD, bucket to

03:02:32.700 --> 03:02:36.260
store it, right? And my understanding is correct, whatever I

03:02:36.260 --> 03:02:39.360
put it. See, I can see this RAG architecture diagram. So,

03:02:39.400 --> 03:02:41.880
you have an application, let's suppose a client interfacing,

03:02:41.880 --> 03:02:44.600
then you are sending a prompt over there. It is going to the

03:02:44.600 --> 03:02:48.360
cloud server orchestrator. Okay, fine, that's fine. Then it

03:02:48.360 --> 03:02:52.180
is sending to prompt to knowledge, measure on open search,

03:02:52.300 --> 03:02:56.760
fine, vector DB, it is going. And then from there, vector

03:02:56.760 --> 03:03:01.780
DB, prompt to knowledge. So, it is not giving prompt to

03:03:01.780 --> 03:03:04.860
knowledge again on this side, imagine bedrock. I mean, like

03:03:04.860 --> 03:03:07.900
this is the, no, no, no, this is like a incorrect approach.

03:03:08.100 --> 03:03:12.240
This is completely incorrect one. I'll tell you the reason

03:03:12.240 --> 03:03:15.280
as per your diagram that you have drawn over here. The

03:03:15.280 --> 03:03:18.580
reason is, I think you are able to see my annotation, right?

03:03:18.760 --> 03:03:20.860
Just let me know if you're able to see my annotation. No,

03:03:20.860 --> 03:03:25.380
no, no. See, now, are you able to see my annotation? Yeah,

03:03:25.580 --> 03:03:28.580
so here is my client. I'm assuming that it's my UI

03:03:28.580 --> 03:03:31.840
interface, right? Now, so you're like, let's suppose I have

03:03:31.840 --> 03:03:35.740
said that, that fetch me a detail about today's class,

03:03:35.900 --> 03:03:38.340
right? So, it will come over here. It will route to the

03:03:38.340 --> 03:03:41.220
orchestrator. Orchestrator buys, I'm imagining that I'm

03:03:41.220 --> 03:03:43.600
using some agentic approach. So, my agent is going to decide

03:03:43.600 --> 03:03:47.260
which one to call. And then on one side, two-way

03:03:47.260 --> 03:03:50.200
communication you are doing. So, it is going into the vector

03:03:50.200 --> 03:03:53.340
DB. So, it is trying to search, right? So, it is trying to

03:03:53.340 --> 03:03:56.420
search. Now, this will not come over here. So, it is trying

03:03:56.420 --> 03:03:58.960
to search. Means, it is going to give me a response from my

03:03:58.960 --> 03:04:02.120
vector database. My agent will try to fetch, right? Now, if

03:04:02.120 --> 03:04:04.460
it is an agentic, then maybe I can try to call another agent

03:04:04.460 --> 03:04:07.540
to combine these two things. Means, combine a prompt plus

03:04:07.540 --> 03:04:12.520
this one, prompt, this response. And these two together, I

03:04:12.520 --> 03:04:14.700
will send it to my, this one. So, where you have mentioned.

03:04:14.900 --> 03:04:17.540
Better. So, where it is providing you basically a model,

03:04:17.660 --> 03:04:21.100
right? LLM model, technically, it is providing you. So, it

03:04:21.100 --> 03:04:23.600
should be plus over here in general. I would say. I would

03:04:23.600 --> 03:04:29.220
say. I mean, like, that will be a clean flow and clean

03:04:29.220 --> 03:04:32.160
architecture, right? And this is basically a query

03:04:32.160 --> 03:04:35.320
architecture that you have created. But before that, in

03:04:35.320 --> 03:04:39.820
general, in RAG, before query architecture, the architecture

03:04:39.820 --> 03:04:43.380
which matters more is how we are doing chucking, how we are

03:04:43.380 --> 03:04:46.620
trying to do embedding, which model we are trying to use.

03:04:46.700 --> 03:04:50.160
Because it depends upon the business use cases, which vector

03:04:50.160 --> 03:04:52.940
databases we are using inside that vector databases. So,

03:04:53.120 --> 03:04:56.900
what is a similarity check that we are trying to do? What is

03:04:56.900 --> 03:04:58.880
the approach that we are trying to follow, which will try to

03:04:58.880 --> 03:05:03.880
yield, you know, like a top K result or top N result. And

03:05:03.880 --> 03:05:07.480
then it's evaluation of those results. So, before that, I

03:05:07.480 --> 03:05:13.180
think, you know, any RAG, that comes. Yeah. That one I have

03:05:13.180 --> 03:05:17.080
not depicted here. So, just I want to just see the end-to

03:05:17.080 --> 03:05:20.660
-end flow as we are going to deploy it in the AWS. And then

03:05:20.660 --> 03:05:23.000
you are, you know, using a langchain over here. I mean,

03:05:23.020 --> 03:05:24.660
like, I'm not able to understand why you're using a

03:05:24.660 --> 03:05:27.900
langchain over here, right? It should like come either in

03:05:27.900 --> 03:05:29.920
orchestration side, because langchain is basically

03:05:29.920 --> 03:05:32.840
orchestrating framework. Then you have something like a

03:05:32.840 --> 03:05:37.580
Titan text embedding. I'm assuming that this is, but again,

03:05:37.680 --> 03:05:40.640
people will ask you a question that why Titan like X, what

03:05:40.640 --> 03:05:44.100
is, because see, model, we are going to select with respect

03:05:44.100 --> 03:05:47.580
to a data set in a hand. If let's suppose, if I have a data

03:05:47.580 --> 03:05:50.220
with respect to medical or healthcare, right? Maybe this

03:05:50.220 --> 03:05:52.380
model is going to give me a worst embedding. And if it is a

03:05:52.380 --> 03:05:52.700
worst embedding, it's going to give me a worst embedding.

03:05:52.700 --> 03:05:55.260
Then my similarity check is going to be worst. And then

03:05:55.260 --> 03:05:58.020
eventually my entire RIG pipeline is going to fail. Like,

03:05:58.040 --> 03:05:59.860
let's suppose I'm dealing with the images inside the

03:05:59.860 --> 03:06:02.740
document, right? Then again, it is going to like a fail for

03:06:02.740 --> 03:06:06.620
me. So, I mean, like, it's a very vague and like, you know,

03:06:06.620 --> 03:06:11.120
it's a wrong architecture. Okay. Okay. So, I'll update it.

03:06:11.320 --> 03:06:16.340
And so, one more is whenever you use any services, right,

03:06:16.420 --> 03:06:21.500
for AWS. So, this is a flow that what my client

03:06:21.500 --> 03:06:25.020
understanding. So, for example, the filing is our legacy

03:06:25.020 --> 03:06:30.580
product. We want to build something in that. Then, and this

03:06:30.580 --> 03:06:33.360
will have capability to store all your documents instead of

03:06:33.360 --> 03:06:37.560
ST. So, and it will go either batch mode or either sim line

03:06:37.560 --> 03:06:43.060
mode. How does this document match like a streaming mode? I

03:06:43.060 --> 03:06:46.720
mean, like, why there is a discussion about the streaming

03:06:46.720 --> 03:06:49.900
over here? Yeah, keep on. For example, you can say that

03:06:49.900 --> 03:06:53.460
documents keep coming. But how? What is the frequency? I

03:06:53.460 --> 03:06:55.280
don't think that document will come every second. If it is

03:06:55.280 --> 03:06:59.740
coming every second, then maybe we can try to like break the

03:06:59.740 --> 03:07:02.040
document into a bytes or binaries. And then we can try to

03:07:02.040 --> 03:07:04.400
stream it. But before that, you have to attach the streaming

03:07:04.400 --> 03:07:07.540
services, which you have not attached. Jefflink or

03:07:07.540 --> 03:07:10.440
something. Okay. Okay. Batch mode, I think, yeah, this is

03:07:10.440 --> 03:07:12.580
fine. I mean, like, let's consider our batch mode itself

03:07:12.580 --> 03:07:15.360
over here. Then, yeah, you are trying to store it inside the

03:07:15.360 --> 03:07:18.840
S3. This is landing zone. Yeah. Basically, like a raw

03:07:18.840 --> 03:07:21.600
landing zone. So, yeah. So, you are trying to store a raw

03:07:21.600 --> 03:07:24.480
file over here. And then here, curated business logic. So,

03:07:24.500 --> 03:07:26.720
Python, Java, SQL, fine. So, Lambda, you have written, fine.

03:07:27.140 --> 03:07:32.960
Or maybe Flink. Why are you using Flink over here? So,

03:07:32.960 --> 03:07:36.060
somewhere I read that Flink also has the capability of

03:07:36.060 --> 03:07:42.540
chunking and embedding. Am I right? Mm-hmm. No. Then,

03:07:42.540 --> 03:07:46.280
presentation zone. So, again, image on S3. No, no, no, no,

03:07:46.300 --> 03:07:50.960
no. Yeah. So, why are you using Kendra over here? Yeah, this

03:07:50.960 --> 03:07:53.760
is kind of streaming, I think. No, Kendra is not for

03:07:53.760 --> 03:07:56.980
streaming, basically. Kendra is for document parsing. Aha,

03:07:57.100 --> 03:08:01.880
okay, okay. So, then I'm using open source. No, no, no, no.

03:08:01.940 --> 03:08:04.820
This is not the right time? No, not at all, not at all. Not

03:08:04.820 --> 03:08:08.140
at all relevant in any of the layers. This is not like

03:08:08.140 --> 03:08:11.980
architecture design happens, basically. Maybe you can just

03:08:11.980 --> 03:08:14.460
give me the use case in the write-up. I'll send you the

03:08:14.460 --> 03:08:17.820
architecture design. That you'll love. Yeah, sure, sure.

03:08:18.420 --> 03:08:20.100
Thank you. Okay, yeah, thanks.

03:08:23.740 --> 03:08:26.840
Yeah, Gala, please go ahead with your question. What is your

03:08:26.840 --> 03:08:33.560
question? My question regarding URAN, URI. Okay. Even I have

03:08:33.560 --> 03:08:39.980
URAN plus also. It is getting only two response. After two

03:08:39.980 --> 03:08:43.040
responses, I'm getting maximum limit. No, I think you have

03:08:43.040 --> 03:08:45.800
logged in through a different account. Maybe that's the

03:08:45.800 --> 03:08:49.320
case. So, let's log in through a same account, which you

03:08:49.320 --> 03:08:51.560
have used. Same number, basically. Just update your phone

03:08:51.560 --> 03:08:54.040
number. Okay. Okay. Okay. Use our same phone number, same

03:08:54.040 --> 03:08:57.700
account while logging to URI. It'll work. Got your point.

03:08:57.960 --> 03:09:00.880
It's account differences. Because URI always asks for a

03:09:00.880 --> 03:09:04.400
different login, and URAN asks for a different login. Okay.

03:09:04.520 --> 03:09:07.900
Sir, one more thing. You also wear the eyeglasses. What

03:09:07.900 --> 03:09:11.140
happens, sir? Nothing. It's just screen glasses. Screen

03:09:11.140 --> 03:09:16.660
glasses. Okay. Yeah. Nowadays, my sitting hour on the screen

03:09:16.660 --> 03:09:20.760
has increased. So, I thought, you know, using this one.

03:09:21.560 --> 03:09:23.460
Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay. Yeah.

03:09:23.520 --> 03:09:26.520
Thanks. Take care. Okay. Fine, everyone. Thank you so much.

03:09:26.920 --> 03:09:29.120
Tomorrow, I think agenda is fixed. We are going to talk

03:09:29.120 --> 03:09:33.160
about AWS services. So, we'll be talking about AWS Bedrock.

03:09:34.380 --> 03:09:37.440
Asita, I think he has mentioned Kendra. So, I'll try to

03:09:37.440 --> 03:09:39.360
introduce Kendra as well. It's amazing, interesting

03:09:39.360 --> 03:09:43.380
services. Right. So, that will be a discussion point for

03:09:43.380 --> 03:09:46.160
tomorrow. Hope all of you have learned something realistic

03:09:46.160 --> 03:09:48.640
today. So, with that, thank you so much, everyone. Take

03:09:48.640 --> 03:09:52.340
care. See you again. Same time, Sunday, tomorrow. Thank you,

03:09:52.380 --> 03:09:53.540
everyone. Thanks.
