WEBVTT

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.740
okay so hi everyone good morning i think i'm audible and

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.400
visible to all of you guys so please confirm if i'm audible

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.220
and visible to all of you so that we can start with the

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.400
class yeah everyone

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.020
okay so i believe we all are aware about the topic that we

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.280
are going to discuss today so today i'm going to talk about

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.380
a cicd pipeline basically which you can try to implement in

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.680
like all the project that you are going to build by the way

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.640
so

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.680
shall we start guys shall we start everyone yeah so good

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.640
morning good morning everyone yeah

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.090
so shall we start okay fine so let's start okay

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.130
everyone so in today's lecture what we are going to do so we

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.530
are going to talk about basically a cicd pipeline so cicd

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:33.550
pipeline means a continuous integration and continuous

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:38.130
deployment now the cicd pipeline is important with respect

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.930
to any project that you are going to build maybe like a

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.290
today or maybe in a future now so when we talk about this

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:49.750
cicd pipeline so cicd pipeline you can do it in a multiple

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:53.590
manner so i'm going to show you one of the approach but

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:56.270
again so there are like a variety of approach that you can

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.270
try to define and with the help of all of those approaches

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:03.290
you will be able to create your cicd pipeline not just that

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:07.530
so there are other tool which comes in between but i'm going

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:11.970
to show you one of the simplest cicd pipeline with respect

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:16.550
to a github action so github action and then on a aws so we

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:21.170
are going to occupy some ec2 instances a machine so where we

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.550
are going to do a deployment so continuously it will keep on

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:27.870
doing a integration it will keep on doing a testing of the

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:31.870
code and it will keep on doing a deployment so as soon as we

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:35.690
are going to push our code inside a github repository so aws

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:39.250
is something that we are going to use and from aws so ect

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:43.230
ec2 instances we are going to use and along with that so we

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:46.450
are going to use a github and more specifically inside a

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.010
github there is something called as github action that is

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.170
something that we are going to discuss that something that

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:54.570
we are going to discuss discover in my today's class so

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:59.270
let's get started and let me i think my screen is already

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:04.590
visible uh no it's not visible so let me share my screen so

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.510
yeah now it's visible now if

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.040
i'll go to your own so last week we have released one of the

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.960
amazing features so for example if you will go inside your

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:20.500
dashboard so you will be able to find out uh here you will

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:24.400
be able to find out basically the script or you can say a

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.080
summary of your entire lecture so whatever i have discussed

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.500
in my previous lecture in a crisp and precise manner as well

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.680
as in a very very detailed manner you will be able to find

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.760
out a lecture summary so let's suppose if someone is going

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.580
to revise this entire lecture so maybe you can look into the

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.240
summary first that what has been discussed and yeah so then

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.760
you can maybe try to watch this entire two hour long video

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:53.600
so you will be able to even uh like a download a transcript

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.000
with respect to a timestamp so raw transcript basically so

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.320
let's suppose if you are trying to build some sort of an lp

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:03.780
application if you are like trying to build something with

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.460
respect to a video processing so this is going to help you

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:11.480
out and you have a tons of data now available on your own

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:15.580
platform so for all the videos not just one for all the

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:19.900
videos so we have already generated a transcript so from

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.480
every classes by the way yeah from every lecture from every

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.620
classes even if it is a self page so we have already uh like

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:30.180
a generated a transcript for each and every one and you can

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:33.260
just click over here you will be able to download a

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:37.580
transcript a very very huge one right with respect to a

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:41.660
timestamp and a lot of application you all will be able to

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:46.040
build just by using this particular transcript not just that

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.680
so we have also like uh you know built one small feature

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.080
just like a youtube so you must have seen over a youtube

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.360
that uh they are giving you ask feature not on all the

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.420
videos but yeah i think in like some of the videos so they

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.920
have already released this particular feature so where you

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.860
can go and you can try to ask something about a video simply

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.440
means that that you will be able to chat with the video

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.540
right you all will be able to chat with the video so here

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.280
you can come and you can start chatting with the video uh

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.820
just like you chat with a chat gpt or maybe a yuri right and

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.180
you will be able to get your answer as simple as that so

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:25.320
this feature is also implemented over here uh not just that

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:29.300
so in this video section you will be able to see our quizzes

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.480
as well as assignments so you can try to attempt all of

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.300
these quiz and going forward for all the live class lecture

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.080
you will be able to get an assignment and you will be able

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.440
to get a quiz and which will be available here itself so as

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.140
you can see so we have assignments and we have a quiz which

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:47.320
we have already uploaded our team has already created that

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:51.040
part and yeah so you can try to use it so these are the

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.000
features that we have released last week which is like a ai

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.340
driven feature you can say right ai driven feature uh many

00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.660
more things uh is going to come so that it is going to make

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:04.780
your learning experience better and better and it will help

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:08.220
you out in terms of learning things in a easiest possible

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:12.040
manner so hope all of you have liked this feature if you

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.140
have not explored just go inside the dashboard and try to

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:18.220
click on any of your videos and you will be able to see it

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.700
along with that so obviously if you have any questions feel

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:19.940
free to leave them in the chat so if you've not yet

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:19.940
subscribed to this channel please do so as well to see all

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:19.940
the links in the description so you don't have to worry

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.460
about that so we are aware about our consultancy and work

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.980
and learn so we are trying to improvise even that feature

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:28.680
because people are liking that a lot right so like they are

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.160
they are getting into an environment so where they can work

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.240
a and they can try to learn because i believe this is uh

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.980
like a like learning is not sufficient so this is going to

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:42.820
be a next big thing inside upskilling especially if i'll

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:46.560
talk about upskilling segment so i believe work and learn is

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.700
going to be our next big thing that's a reason so keep an

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:49.860
eye on that and let us know about the next big thing so that

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.800
in our mind so i have released that and yeah so maybe we can

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.040
go and you can enjoy that particular part as well now coming

00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:00.860
to our today's lecture cicd continuous integration and

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:05.980
continuous deployment so basically we are going to create a

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:12.580
flow where so we can try to let me use my scribble inc and

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:20.920
yeah yes so we are going to build a pipeline so where we are

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.980
going to write our code inside a local system so we will be

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:29.460
doing ci cd continuous integration and continuous deployment

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:33.500
so we are going to write a code inside our local system so

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:37.900
for example we are going to write a code inside vs code i

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:44.160
was not supposed to draw a triangle by the way okay so we

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.180
are going to write a code inside let's suppose a vs code or

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:52.880
maybe inside a cursor maybe inside a google anti-gravity so

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.820
anyone guys who have tried google anti-gravity i think

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.900
recently they have like launched this google anti-gravity

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:03.660
again which is similar to like a cursor so where there are a

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.140
lot of agents and a lot of models which is available and you

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.000
can try to you know build any kind of a project okay so i

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.180
see this saying that yes he has tried so maybe you can uh

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.920
share your experience with google anti-gravity and maybe you

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.740
can do a comparison with that cursive i still believe that

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:23.420
cusser is good but yeah so we'll wait for google because

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:27.700
google is google right so no one can like beat google in a

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:35.020
long term i believe so yeah so here uh basically uh we will

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.900
be writing a code inside a vs code and from a vs code so we

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.920
are going to push our code inside the us code we are going

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:40.920
to use it basically to write a code fine so we are going to

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:40.920
install a vscode or a ужас or something like that but yeah

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:40.920
enough city so we are going to log inside vscode now so

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:41.580
that's again we are going to push our code inside a github

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:48.940
repository so github repository and from here so what will

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.900
happen so here github is going to call so github action

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:56.900
there is a feature called as github action that i will be

00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.620
talking about yeah so github action and what this github

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.000
action is going to do so github action is going to build

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.760
your entire code and it is going to you know attest the

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.420
entire code if you have written a test script over there and

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:12.660
then it is going to do a deployment right then it is going

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:16.400
to do a deployment in a ec2 instances so maybe we can try to

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.620
use some other instances as well but yeah so today for

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:24.100
today's lecture so i will be using a ec2 instances so this

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:28.560
is a flow we are going to like learn in my today's class so

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.620
by the time we are going to push our code automatically it

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.040
will start building it and automatically it will start

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.100
deploying it so that's a whole flow that we have to do so

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:37.100
that's a whole flow that we have to do so that's a whole

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.700
flow that we have to do so talk about and finally i will be

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.640
able to see my new feature or whatever changes which i have

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.840
pushed inside a repository so that feature will be live

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.640
automatically without any kind of a wait time so obviously

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.360
couple of second it is going to take so like i said so there

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.780
are like a multiple different different kind of continuous

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:58.140
integration continuous like a deployment or we can say a

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:01.180
delivery we can try to build but this is something that we

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:06.080
are going to see in my today's class yeah so now uh let's do

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.100
one thing so we need to do a deployment and we need to do a

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.640
deployment so we need a code base right so we need a code

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.800
base and inside that so we have to do a configuration for a

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:17.240
cicd along with that so we need a github repository along

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:21.660
with that so we need a ec2 instances as well so first of all

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:25.900
let's go to our aws and let's try to launch ec2 instances

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:30.320
and then i will be like a setting up this github repository

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.080
inside that whatever is required i'm going to do a setting

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.100
for that and then we will try to do a configuration for a

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.820
github repository and then we will try to look into a small

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:42.480
piece of a code so technically we'll try to build some sort

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.620
of a curd api so that you know i will be able to show you

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.640
this entire flow and then i'll try to make some sort of a

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.640
changes into that curd api and accordingly it is going to

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:57.300
behave so let's go to a like a aws first of all yeah so let

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:03.600
me log in inside my aws account so that we can start this

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:08.660
entire process so here and along with me guys so everyone

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:13.440
please try to log in into your aws account i believe we all

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.200
have aws account we have already done that in my previous

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:16.540
session

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:55.640
so now i'm inside my aws account right so i'm into my aws

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.900
account now from aws so maybe i can try to search for ec2

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:02.600
instances and even last in my last class so we have already

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.580
launched ec2 instances so it's not going to be new it's

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:08.400
going to be a similar kind of a step so we can try to click

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.060
on this launch instances and we can see that we have already

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.480
launched ec2 instances and after clicking on this launch

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.200
instances so we can try to give a name so maybe i can try to

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:19.660
give ci cd a test so this is kind of a name which i'm going

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.640
to give and then machine wise so we can try to select ubuntu

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.040
the third option so this is something that we have selected

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.940
even last time architecture and all those things are

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.860
completely fine now instance wise so maybe i can try to

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:34.200
select a nano micro small whatever instances you would like

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.360
to like a select you can try to select it so maybe t2 micro

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.980
which is more than enough for me for doing this entire

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:41.540
process so let's go to the tests so i can try to select so

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:46.120
where it is giving me one virtual core cpu and one gb of a

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.740
memory so it's more than enough more than enough for me for

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:51.860
my today's class at least so we can try to select that

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:56.280
particular part now after selecting this t2 micro so we can

00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:01.020
try to create a new key pair yeah so click on this creating

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:07.300
new key pair and here so you have to download a pem key so

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:10.680
dot pem key key is something that you have to download. So

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:17.520
here I'm going to give a name, CICD, CICD gen AI test. Okay.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.740
And this is PEM key. I have to download because without

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.940
that, I will not be able to log in or I will not be able to

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:27.200
access my instances. And today I'm not going to access my

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.860
instances by CICD pipeline. My GitHub action is going to

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:34.200
access this particular instances. So this is where this PEM

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.860
key is very, very important. So you have to download this

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:40.680
PEM key. So create a key pair and once you are going to

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.720
create it, so it is going to download and you will be able

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:47.020
to keep it somewhere inside your system. And same thing you

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.700
have to attach. So CICD gen AI test. So this is something

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.680
which has been attached, key pair, which is very much

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:55.420
important for all of us. And then allow this, allow this

00:19:55.420 --> 00:20:00.380
HTTPS traffic or allow HTTP traffic storage wise. So by

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:03.920
default, it's giving me 8 GB, which is way more than enough.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.900
I would say we can try to go ahead with even 2 GB, 4 GB.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.960
That is also. So fine, but yeah, so let's, let's keep it in

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:13.640
this way. And once all of these things are done, right, once

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.500
all of these things are done, so maybe I can try to click on

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.560
launch instances. So click on launch instances. It is going

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:23.680
to take maybe a couple of like a minute, not second, and it

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:28.460
is going to keep my instances ready in some time. Yeah, so

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:34.540
fine, guys. Are we able to do it? Yes, everyone. Are we able

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:40.210
to create a EC2 instances? Yeah, same thing. I mean, like

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:42.550
nothing new. Same thing we have done even in my previous

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:44.990
class. So we are not doing anything. It's the same drill

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:48.470
that we are trying to like a repeat once again in this

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:54.700
class. Okay, so once we are able to create this instances

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:59.400
and once we are able to download our PEM key. Yeah, once we

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:03.440
are able to download our PEM key. So from here, so we need a

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:07.460
PEM key first part. Second part is, so we need this public

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.820
IP address. So by default, you will be able to see your

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:11.400
public IP address. So by default, you will be able to see

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.080
your public IP address. And this address is basically

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.900
required so that my GitHub will be able to reach out to this

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:21.600
particular address and it will be able to like access this

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.700
entire machine with the help of this PEM key, the PEM key,

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.600
which I have generated. So obviously authorization is

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:31.060
required. So GitHub action will be able to take this

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:34.160
authorization with the help of this one. Okay, so if this is

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.260
done, right, if this part is done, so now we can go to

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:41.520
GitHub. So go to GitHub and then inside that GitHub. So

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:45.220
let's try to create one repository. Maybe you can try to

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:47.760
keep it public. You can try to keep it private. It's your

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.000
wish, right? So it's your wish. So I'll just click on new

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.080
and I'll try to give a repository name. So CI, CD, Gen AI

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.580
test. Yeah, so maybe this is a repository name or any other

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.480
repository name. If you would like to give, you can try to

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.980
give that repository name. That's completely okay with me.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:08.260
So here repository name is CI, CD, Gen AI test. And now

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:12.140
click on create repository. Nothing. Fancy, very, very

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:15.580
simple, right? Nothing fancy over here. And in a very, very

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.100
simplest possible manner, you will be able to create a

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.780
GitHub repository. And I believe we all know how to create a

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:24.160
GitHub repository. So is it done, guys? GitHub repository

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.760
creation. I'll wait for a couple of minutes if you're not

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:31.520
able to do it like with me. Okay, so Tyler is saying yes.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.560
Vans is saying yes. Okay, what about others, guys? Swara is

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:39.460
saying yes. Joy, Silpa, everyone is yes. Okay. Abhijit is

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:42.680
saying yes. Aasi is saying yes. Okay. Great. Okay. Now

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.840
everyone. Aasi is saying yes. So Yogin is saying AWS giving

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.720
me error. Not able to log in. Stuck there. Okay. So maybe

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.860
you can check with the login. Maybe you are entering a wrong

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:54.960
password or something. Depends. Yeah. Arun is saying yes.

00:22:55.080 --> 00:23:01.380
Okay. So once we are able to, like, you know, use or once we

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.880
are able to create this GitHub repository, then what is the

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:06.980
next step? Next step is go to setting part. Yeah. The

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:10.640
setting button for a particular repository. For every

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.720
repository. You will be able to see a setting option. So for

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:17.020
this repository, click on this setting part first of all.

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:20.000
Yeah. So click on the setting part and then you will be able

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.060
to see so many different, different kind of action. You

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:26.640
don't have to like go through all of these. So you have to

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.800
click on secret and variable. So see, guys, what we what we

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:35.100
are supposed to do. So basically, my GitHub should be able

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:39.940
to access EC2 instances, my machine, right, my machine, so

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:42.900
that whenever I'm going to push a code inside a GitHub

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:46.540
repository, as per the flow, which I have designed over

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:49.460
here. So by the time I'm going to push a code inside a

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.740
GitHub repository, so automatically it should build a test

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:57.360
and deploy inside a machine. So my GitHub needs an access.

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:02.100
My GitHub needs an access or login of my instances or

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:06.520
machine that I have already created. Yeah. So to do that

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:10.820
here, you can come inside a secret and variable tab. From

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.740
setting, so click on setting, then come inside secret and

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:17.260
variable tab and then click on this action. So you will be

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:20.360
able to see an action option. So click on this action. This

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.780
is important, actually. Right. And then you will be able to

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:27.240
find out environment secret now inside that secret and then

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:29.840
environment variable option. You will be able to find out.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:33.220
So leave that part. Leave this part. Come to this one

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:36.800
repository variable. Yeah. Come to this repository variable

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:40.840
part and here. So you can try to set a repository. Variable.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.720
So what you are going to set, I'm going to tell you that

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.720
part. Don't worry. Yeah. So are you able to see this option,

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:49.300
guys? Secret and variable action. Are you able to see this

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:54.060
repository variable part? Yes, everyone. Yeah, because this

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.020
step is very, very important, right? This is definitely

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:59.980
really very, very important. So here repository variable and

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:03.980
then click on this new repository variable. So just click

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:06.900
over here. New repository variable and give some sort of a

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:12.860
name. So maybe I can try to give CI CD. Gen AI test kind of

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:18.000
a name over here, right? And then add variable simple. So,

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:22.140
OK, so maybe I can try to variable value expose a plain

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:28.400
text. OK, so variable name action. It's not asking me to

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:34.310
create a name. So maybe what I can do just a minute,

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:38.210
everyone, I will give a proper variable name over here.

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:51.050
Hmm.

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:57.970
So here I'm going to. I'm going to give EC2 SSH private key

00:25:57.970 --> 00:26:01.910
and just try to give this variable name and value wise. So

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:06.550
maybe the PEM like a key that I have downloaded. So just try

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:10.110
to open it up inside some text editor in any text editor.

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:13.470
You can try to open it up and you will be able to see

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:15.630
something like which I'm going to show you. So just a

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:17.810
minute. I'm trying to open up my PEM key.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:25.920
Yeah. So this is what you will be able to see inside your

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:29.340
PEM key. The file that you have downloaded. At the time of

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:32.680
creation of your EC2 instances. So just control a control C.

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:36.220
So select everything control C and then come over here and

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:39.380
paste it. Yeah. Come over here and paste it and then click

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:43.220
on add variable. So it is trying to add a variable. So as

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:46.660
you can see, it has added EC2 SSH private key and this is

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:49.940
the variable which it has added. So this is our very first

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:53.640
variable that you have to add. Now, second variable that you

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:58.200
have to add over here is a host. So EC2 host. So here again.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:02.480
Click EC2 host. This is a variable name exactly the way

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:06.160
which the way I'm doing it. You have to do it. So EC2 host.

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:09.540
Now, what is going to be a EC2 host? So EC2 host is going to

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:13.960
be my public IP address. Yeah. So in my case, this is my

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:17.100
public IP address. So I'll just try to copy this public IP

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:20.240
address and paste it over there. That's it. Yeah. Paste it

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:24.480
over there. So EC2 host. Add variable. So variable is added.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:28.540
So EC2 host. This is a public variable. Which I have added

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:31.440
means this is our address of my machine. And then to log in

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:36.000
into that machine. This is a password. Right. And then click

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.220
on new repository variable and then try to create a EC2 user

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:44.500
variable. So this is a third variable you have to create. So

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:48.100
EC2 user variable. And here. So what you are supposed to

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:50.900
keep. So when I when I have launched my machine. Right. So

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:53.660
it was basically a Ubuntu based machine which I have

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:57.660
launched. And by default AWS try to give a name of that

00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:01.900
user. As a Ubuntu. Right. Even if you will go and click on

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:05.240
connect. Right. So by which you will be able to log in into

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:08.000
your machine that we have done already in my previous class.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:11.440
So you will be able to see that that my username is what. So

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.000
here is a username. So what is a username which is mentioned

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.900
over here. So username is basically Ubuntu. So here we can

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:21.360
try to create a third variable EC2 user and value is going

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.720
to be Ubuntu. This is a username by default AWS try to

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.740
provide for AWS instances. If I'm launching Ubuntu based

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:32.240
machine. So add variable. So Ubuntu. Okay. So this is the

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.860
these are the three variable. Right. These are the three

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:37.420
repository variable you have to add. So are we done with

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:42.340
this guys. Are we able to add this three variable. Inside

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:47.640
our repository variable. Yes. So one is a SSH private key.

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.840
So basically nothing but a password. Password to log in into

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:53.860
my machine. Which machine. Machine which is hosted at this

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:57.800
public address. And then what is a user. So use simple. So

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:01.340
machine. And then user ID and password you can say. Right.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.580
This is how we log in into any machine or any system in this

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:07.080
entire world. So first of all we go to the particular

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:10.580
machine or we go to a particular website. Let's suppose. And

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:14.240
then we try to like give a user ID and then we try to give a

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:17.600
password. So in the exact similar manner we are able to log

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:23.220
in. Anyone who is facing any kind of issues. So once is able

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:25.760
to do it. Joel is able to do it. Saurav is saying done.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:29.920
Tyler is saying done. Yeah. What about others guys. Are we

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:35.540
able to do this set up. Everyone. Sid is saying done. Bhaves

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:41.880
is saying done. Okay. Arun done. Okay. And it is supposed to

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:45.200
be a repository variable by the way. Not this environment

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.760
variable. We can we can try to even provide a environment

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.320
variable if that variable is available inside my code base.

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:53.320
But yeah. So as of now you have to set it as a repo

00:29:53.320 --> 00:30:01.180
variable. Done. Okay. Now next step. So here if I'll go to

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:05.460
my diagram again. So GitHub action. So GitHub setting we are

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:09.720
able to do. Right. So machine address and then user ID and

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:13.240
password we are able to provide easy to instance we are able

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:18.760
to launch. And now so we have to push a code inside a GitHub

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:24.280
repository. That is again important part. So with the help

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:28.380
of VS code. So I have already prepared a code. And this code

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:32.200
is not going to be new. So I have just attached one new like

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.400
a layer inside this particular code. This is something that

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:38.840
I have done. So let me open up my code and I'm going to

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.620
share this code with all of you. And believe me you all will

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:47.920
be able to understand it in no time. So file open folder. I

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:51.160
think I'm into my CICD. Okay.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:17.800
This is not the one. Open. Folder. And I have created CICD

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:34.370
pipe is there. And then.

00:31:55.500 --> 00:32:01.160
Okay. Yeah. This was the code. Now here. So what I have

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:04.260
done. So I'm just trying to like you know create a simple.

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:09.180
Yeah. So I'm just trying to create a very very simple

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:13.360
application. A fast API based application. And the kind of

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.100
application that we have already built. So we have done. A

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:19.820
lot of like a API creation in my past and this is a similar

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:22.460
kind of application. So where I'm doing a code operation.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:25.180
That's it. Right. So we are just trying to perform a code

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:28.740
operation over there with respect to our SQL light data

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:32.440
base. That's it. And for that. So we are we have created a

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:36.640
API and this is the application that we are supposed to host

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:40.020
or we are supposed to basically push and any kind of changes

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:43.800
if I'm going to make with respect to my API. And by the time

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.860
I'm going to push this particular code. Inside a repository

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:50.520
it should be deployed automatically and in the similar

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:54.820
manner you will be able to do a exact same thing with every

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:58.980
code every code that you are going to build by the way so my

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:02.340
actual code base is available inside this app directory or

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:04.660
you can say it's a back end code that we have written so

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:08.380
where APIs are available so let me give you a small walk

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:10.800
through because it will be like a kind of a very very easy

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:14.180
for all of us to understand this particular code base it's

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:16.220
not difficult at all it's a very simple code base. Just API

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:19.380
that I'm trying to create you can try to create anything of

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:22.460
your choice that's completely fine so if you will look into

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:25.600
this main.py file so we are trying to create a different

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.760
different API so this is one so which will be like available

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:32.340
at a root then this is for a health status check which is

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:35.060
just going to print a status is equal to OK whenever you are

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:39.180
going to call slash health then so here you will be able to

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:41.940
create a new item so code operation I'm trying to showcase

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:45.460
with respect to our SQL light data base. That's it. In

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:48.980
memory database similarly you can try to create any kind of

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:53.540
APIs right so here I'm trying to like create slash item and

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:56.620
at slash item you will be able to read all the data then

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:59.940
again so slash item item ID so you will be able to fetch any

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:03.000
kind of a detail with respect to a particular item which I'm

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.060
going to store so in this manner this is my code base let's

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.980
suppose yeah this is my code base and I can try to run this

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:12.660
entire code base in my local machine just like any other

00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:16.960
APIs that we try to do right. So what we have and again so

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.800
we have like a database dot py file that I have created so

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:23.040
which is going to create a session session of what a SQL

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.660
light in memory and database right SQL light in memory

00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:28.880
database so I'm not going to install any other databases if

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.000
you'd like to connect with any other databases maybe you can

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.020
try to make a changes over there so this is my actual

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:37.640
application so I can try to create hundreds of application

00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:41.160
or thousands of application that's completely OK at the end

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:44.600
of the day I have to run this application don't look into

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:47.480
any other folder. Just look into this application folder so

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:50.460
let's suppose I have created one application one code base

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:53.980
which is running in my local system yeah which is running in

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:57.980
my local system I'm able to run it I'm able to test it now I

00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:02.060
have to basically configure a CI CD with respect to a GitHub

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:06.680
action and then EC2 instances yeah so that is my second next

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:11.660
priority now to do that we have to mention one additional

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:16.820
step over here so in that particular. Code base that I have

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:21.140
so I have to create a folder called as dot GitHub right dot

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:24.860
GitHub inside that I can try to create a directory called as

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:28.840
workflow and then inside that so we have to create a file

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:32.240
with a name CI CD so I have given my file name as CI CD you

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.000
can try to give any other name that's completely OK the

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.460
extension of that file is supposed to be YAML YML yet

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.460
another markup language or markup language this is one of

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:45.440
the file now this is the actual file which is helping me.

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:50.180
Out in terms of performing a CI CD operation and this file

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:55.820
is the only important file inside this entire code base to

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:59.280
achieve a CI CD this is actually helping me out in terms of

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.980
doing a CI CD operation like I said so we can try to do a CI

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:05.760
CD in a multiple manner so I can try to attach even a

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.480
terraform over there I can try to attach a Jenkins over

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:11.900
there so terraform is again one of the service which I can

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:16.000
try to use to spin any kind of a machine just from a. CLI

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.800
itself or maybe in a programmatic way basically I can try to

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:22.640
control my Azure AWS and GCP all of these accounts just from

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:25.720
here I can do any kind of automation with respect to ops and

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:28.740
then with the help of Jenkins I will be able to build a code

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:32.760
even in that way I will be able to a CI CD but yeah like I

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:35.500
said so we will be talking about a simplest possible

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:38.780
approach so that you will not get confused and you all will

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:43.280
be able to do a CI CD not to achieve that part this is the

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:48.160
only important. That's it this is the only important file

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:51.800
that I have to basically consider or that I have to

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:54.680
basically run apart from that so none of the other files are

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:57.920
important so here is my application inside my app so there

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.260
is an application you can delete all the other files so I

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:04.060
was trying to even build a docker images and again so with

00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:06.920
the help of like a ECR services so I was trying to deploy it

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.360
that's another pipeline that's the reason so you will be

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.700
able to find out a docker but here I'm not using docker

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:14.780
that's another pipeline that we can try to build with other

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:18.460
AWS services. So ECR is basically or ECS is basically other

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:21.500
AWS services so where you will be able to spin a container

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:24.540
and in a contrived way so you will be able to deploy it but

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:27.520
I'm trying to show you with respect to EC2 because EC2 is a

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:30.840
raw machine right just a raw machine without any kind of a

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.400
services or a blank machine AWS is going to provide and you

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.940
can do anything that you want of your choice just like you

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:39.640
do it in your local system that's the reason so I have opted

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:43.140
for EC2 otherwise I would have opted for other option as

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:45.440
well which I have already discussed in my previous class.

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:48.120
Just in my last class I was talking about a multiple options

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:51.340
right that no not just inside the EC2 there are other

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:55.180
services a pre-configured services which is AWS has already

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:57.980
given to you and similarly you will be able to find out

00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:01.860
those options even inside a GCP and even inside a Azure. So

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:04.300
let's do it with respect to a raw machine because if I have

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:07.380
a control over a machine if I can do something in a raw

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:11.260
machine I mean like just like running something in my local

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:15.380
machine I can do each and everything right. So here right.

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:18.600
So this is the only file that we are supposed to understand

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:24.840
but before that so let me like you know give you this

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:28.560
particular code base so that all of you will be able to do

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.760
it along with me.

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:48.040
Okay so let me go to your dashboard and I'm going to upload

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.760
this one inside your dashboard.

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:39.380
Okay so finally everyone now you can go inside your

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:43.820
dashboard and you can try to check a 30th November class

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:47.180
last class last Sunday's class. You can try to check. And

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:50.380
here you will be able to see a resource just download it

00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:53.700
entire code base is available inside this particular file.

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:58.080
Download it and let me know. Ram is saying EC2 host do we

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:01.240
paste the public or a private public IP address by the way.

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:10.500
Yeah then I'll try to explain you the entire YAML file. So

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:13.280
what is happening inside a YAML file how it is trying to

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.600
understand where we have to deploy what we have to deploy

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.320
what we have to build what we have to test each and

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.360
everything which is mentioned because this is the only. Only

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:24.420
important file you all will be able to find out rest is just

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:26.880
a piece of code so any code I can try to write and then any

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:31.880
code I can try to deploy it. Yeah so are you are you able to

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:36.240
download the code guys so code base is available in your

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:41.680
previous class lecture so 30th of this lecture 30th November

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:44.680
AWS service intro which I have given to you so where I was

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:48.760
talking about EC2 Elastic Bean Stack ECS EKS Fargate Lambda

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.700
App Runner all those things. Kendra SageMaker this is

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:53.840
something which I have discussed in my previous class in the

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.820
same lecture you will be able to find a resource and

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:59.700
download the code base yeah download it everyone quickly

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:05.120
download it unzip it open it up inside your VS code done

00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:10.490
okay Joel done Sumit done what about others guys okay

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:16.970
Silpa done okay I'm just waiting I'll give you a couple of

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:20.430
minutes to go to a dashboard and download okay

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:33.600
Saif done Talha done Soumya done okay okay great.

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:42.530
Swarabh done yes. She's done okay.

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:49.430
Now so once you are able to like download this code just try

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:52.530
to unzip it open it up inside a VS code as simple as that.

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:56.110
Now so let me explain you as I told you that we have this

00:41:56.110 --> 00:42:00.350
yaml file and this is the only important file plus you will

00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:02.970
be able to find out a template so there are a lot of

00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:06.010
template which is already published out there even inside.

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:10.290
Official GitHub repository so it's not like we are going to

00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:13.470
write this yaml file by ourselves so we try to take a

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:16.350
template we try to you know do a modification as per my

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:19.630
application and then we try to use exact similar same kind

00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:22.670
of yaml file as simple as that and even with the help of you

00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:26.070
know. Vive coding or by using any of these like a vibe

00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:29.890
coding tool. You can just talk about your requirements and

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:34.090
it is going to generate a yaml file for you. It's very very

00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:36.950
simple right it's very very simple. So now let me give you.

00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:40.070
A walk through of this entire yaml file that what this yaml

00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:44.630
file is actually trying to perform so here inside this yaml

00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:49.050
file I believe my screen font size is clear yeah everyone

00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:53.850
yes it's visible and clear okay

00:42:56.890 --> 00:43:00.690
how to create yaml file right click create a file give a

00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:05.890
name and give extension as dot yml that's it the way you

00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:08.210
create any python file the way you create a text file the

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:10.870
way you create a json file. In a similar manner you can

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:16.230
create a yaml file. Okay. So here we are trying to perform a

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:19.190
CI CD operation yeah so we are trying to create a CI CD

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:23.510
operation so we have created a yaml file now inside this

00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:26.430
yaml file so first of all we are giving a name so we are

00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:29.370
giving name as CI CD pipeline you can try to give any other

00:43:29.370 --> 00:43:33.650
name. So this is just a name which my github action will be

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:36.750
able to understand so this is just a workflow name or task

00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:39.770
name you can say we are trying to give that okay. So this.

00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:43.630
Is but this name you can try to run your action basically

00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:47.890
right action basically now on next one so you will be able

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:52.370
to find out this on. Right so on is again a command and here

00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:55.530
inside that so we are trying to call push and pull request

00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:57.990
push means so whenever someone is going to send a code

00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:00.750
inside a github repository pull means so whenever is going

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:04.130
to download them like a you know or maybe like a pull the

00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:08.550
entire github repository inside some of them a system so now

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:10.970
here what. What we have mentioned so we have mentioned

00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:14.350
basically inside this push block right inside this push

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:18.090
block so basically this on is nothing but on you can try to

00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:21.970
call it as a trigger. Right so trigger so here we are trying

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:24.970
to mention a trigger that either there will be a push or

00:44:24.970 --> 00:44:28.290
either there will be a pull. Now so whenever we are going to

00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:30.970
mention a trigger push or pull or whenever trigger is going

00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:33.610
to happen means whenever someone is going to push a code

00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:36.990
whenever I'm going to push a code let's suppose where so

00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:40.610
inside a branch so inside a. Github. There is a branching

00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:44.330
concept so I can try to create multiple branch inside a same

00:44:44.330 --> 00:44:47.550
repository I can try to give a different branch access to a

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:50.270
different developers right let's suppose multiple people are

00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:54.210
working on the same code base or everyone is going to like

00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:58.890
you know generate their PRs and then we are going to merge a

00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:01.950
PR and then we are going to finally push it inside the main

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:05.370
branch so here we are trying to say that that whenever there

00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:09.150
will be a push or there will be a pull inside a main or.

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:12.030
Github. Masters both are same so masters is the old name but

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:15.150
yeah main and masters is basically same for a github so here

00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:18.250
whenever someone is going to push or like a pull a code

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:23.190
right so at that point of a time trigger is going to happen

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:26.830
means what kind of a trigger the trigger that I have defined

00:45:26.830 --> 00:45:29.510
or the job or task which I have defined or I'm going to

00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:32.950
define in my below section so this is just a trigger point

00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:35.590
that we are trying to create that's it nothing more than

00:45:35.590 --> 00:45:39.290
that yeah nothing more than that now then there is a.

00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:42.170
something called as jobs what is the meaning of job so

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:46.370
basically jobs is nothing but it's a kind of a you can think

00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:50.650
like a container right so container so which is going to

00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:55.370
contain or which is going to instantiate a panel or you can

00:45:55.370 --> 00:46:00.190
say a serial jobs that is going to complete the entire

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:04.270
workflow so let's suppose I'm going to send a code I'm going

00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:07.430
to upload a code I'm going to push a code inside my github

00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:10.610
repository right then I'm going to. what it is supposed to

00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:14.070
do this is what I'm trying to define yeah so it is supposed

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:18.010
to do something right so for this this this name right so on

00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:21.530
this push or pull it is supposed to do something so what it

00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:24.950
is supposed to do so here job wise I'm trying to define that

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:29.250
you are supposed to run a test first and then maybe you have

00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:32.790
to do a deploy so you will be able to find out two tags over

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:36.130
there inside a job one is a test and then another one is a

00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:39.270
deploy you can try to remove a test if you don't want to.

00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:42.090
test that's completely okay right you can directly call a

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:44.450
deploy that's up to you how you are going to basically

00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:46.850
configure how you are going to design so it's not mandatory

00:46:46.850 --> 00:46:50.910
this is what I'm trying to like a say over here so now let's

00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:54.590
talk about this test so basically it is going to test the

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:58.230
entire code so now what it will do so it will try to call a

00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:01.350
test job wise right so whenever something like this is going

00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:04.630
to happen whenever someone is going to do this so it is

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:08.110
going to call a job and first of all inside a job so it is

00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:12.150
going to. basically call a test basically it's a job name

00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:14.350
that I have given right job name which I have given that

00:47:14.350 --> 00:47:17.670
okay fine so just try to do this job now as a part of this

00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:21.030
job inside this test indentation you will be able to find

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:23.970
out this highlighted one so inside this what we are doing so

00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:30.070
we are trying to say that that basically runs on Ubuntu

00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:34.050
latest so I think Ubuntu is nothing but an image right image

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:37.230
operating system image over here so here we are trying to

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:39.270
say that when we are saying runs on we are trying to say

00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:44.870
that. that run this particular job on a fresh GitHub hosted

00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:50.090
Ubuntu Linux VM so what GitHub action does so basically it

00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:53.310
is going to give or internally it is going to launch a small

00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:57.290
instance a Linux instance it is going to launch Ubuntu Linux

00:47:57.290 --> 00:48:00.470
virtual machine it is going to instantiate so that it will

00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:03.450
be able to perform all the steps which I'm going to mention

00:48:03.450 --> 00:48:07.050
over here so what are the steps basically that it is going

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:10.630
to perform so here it is going to. to perform first of all

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:13.430
uh users i have mentioned the name i have mentioned then

00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:16.330
users i have mentioned with python this particular version

00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:21.010
so here uh when we are saying that that action check out at

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:25.010
v3 right so this is basically uh it is it is going to

00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:29.370
basically call this particular action and then it is going

00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:34.230
to give a name to it set up python so whatever machine it is

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:36.750
going to instantiate right whatever machine it is going to

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:39.950
instantiate so obviously inside that machine it is supposed

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:43.130
to do some sort of a action so what kind of action so just

00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:46.170
try to install a latest python or whatever python version

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:49.050
which i have mentioned so i have mentioned 3.11 so it is

00:48:49.050 --> 00:48:52.470
going to install a python version so let's suppose if you

00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:55.330
have purchased a new laptop what you will do so obviously

00:48:55.330 --> 00:48:58.150
you will try to install python this is what we have done in

00:48:58.150 --> 00:49:01.570
our initial class right so when you have joined this entire

00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:04.510
lecture in a very very beginning so we have installed python

00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:07.810
Python first of all. After installing Python so we are going

00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:10.450
to install all the requirements. So whatever I have

00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:13.290
mentioned inside the requirement.txt because requirement.txt

00:49:13.290 --> 00:49:16.630
is going to be very very specific with respect to my project

00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:19.590
right. So requirement.txt is going to be very much specific

00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:21.530
with respect to my project. So I am going to install

00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:25.150
requirement.txt but before that Python must be installed

00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:27.690
otherwise it will not be able to recognize any Pythonic

00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:32.190
command or not even pip it is going to understand. So what

00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:34.770
we are doing so we are so it is going to spin a small

00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:37.190
machine inside a GitHub itself. So we are not talking about

00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:40.230
EC2 as of now yeah I am talking about GitHub GitHub itself

00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:43.490
right because over there so we are building a code and then

00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:47.490
it will go for a deployment. So we are now inside a GitHub

00:49:47.490 --> 00:49:51.570
now inside a GitHub. So it is going to create this instance

00:49:51.570 --> 00:49:54.730
where it is going to install a Python and then we are giving

00:49:54.730 --> 00:49:58.230
an action name. So run run is nothing but run this entire

00:49:58.230 --> 00:50:02.310
command. So run what? First of all upgrade a pip then second

00:50:02.310 --> 00:50:06.050
pip install hyphen our requirement.txt pip install pytest

00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:10.130
pytest conv httpx whatever you have to install install it

00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:15.190
simple right. So just the way we try to install in our local

00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:18.330
system the way we try to set up our local computer in the

00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:20.870
exact similar manner right nothing different in an exact

00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:23.850
similar manner. So basically try to do all of these

00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:27.470
installation to test it and once all the installation is

00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:32.350
done then what we can do. So we can try to run a test right.

00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:36.110
We can try to run a test. So this is something that it is

00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:39.850
going to perform. So here we are trying to use a pytest for

00:50:39.850 --> 00:50:43.750
our testing. We are trying to use a pytest click coverage

00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:47.370
over here and then we are trying to like use other

00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:49.910
libraries. So depends upon the project which I have created.

00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:53.910
So I'm just trying to use the library. So here I'm trying to

00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:57.230
run it again. I'm going to run a command. So pytest test.

00:50:57.370 --> 00:51:01.090
And then I'm going to run. And then I'm trying to like you

00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:05.590
know echo no test found escaping if there is no test which

00:51:05.590 --> 00:51:08.350
is available. Yeah. If there is no test which is available

00:51:08.350 --> 00:51:12.030
if there will be a test it is going to run all the test

00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:16.170
under test directory if I have a test directory. So yeah I

00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:19.790
have created a test directory over here. But like I said so

00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:22.510
it's not import. It's not mandatory. Right. It's not

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:26.590
mandatory. So here inside a test directory I have created my

00:51:26.590 --> 00:51:30.570
test underscore main dot py file. And I'm just trying to

00:51:30.570 --> 00:51:34.370
like you know test or I'm just trying to call all of these

00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:39.810
endpoints slash health I'm trying to call or other like

00:51:39.810 --> 00:51:43.170
endpoints slash item item ID. So all of these things I'm

00:51:43.170 --> 00:51:46.350
trying to call it. So this is what I have written as a test

00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:49.350
over there. I can skip it. It's completely fine. Right. I

00:51:49.350 --> 00:51:52.130
can escape it. But just for like a testing purpose. So I

00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:54.430
have mentioned all of these things over here inside my test

00:51:54.430 --> 00:51:58.310
directory. So if there is a tester directory. Only in that

00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:01.010
situation. It is going to call it and that's the reason. So

00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:03.530
you will be able to find out this test. So it will start

00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:06.550
looking into a test directory and then accordingly it is

00:52:06.550 --> 00:52:09.630
going to converse and it is going to basically test each and

00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:12.990
everything. So after running that particular file inside a

00:52:12.990 --> 00:52:15.410
test directory which is available. So this is how we can try

00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:19.370
to even do a setup for a testing simple. But like I said we

00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:22.870
can skip that particular part. It's completely okay. Once

00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:26.270
this will be done right once this will be done then

00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:29.510
automatically it will come to the next step. What is that?

00:52:29.830 --> 00:52:34.110
Deploy. Yeah. Deploy. And we have made this important. So it

00:52:34.110 --> 00:52:37.390
needs a test. If test is going to fail it will not come to

00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:40.850
the deploy. This is the condition which I have made inside

00:52:40.850 --> 00:52:43.930
my YAML file. I can try to skip that part. That's completely

00:52:43.930 --> 00:52:48.570
okay. So here if I'm not doing a test phase. So maybe in

00:52:48.570 --> 00:52:51.090
that case I can try to remove this needs is equal to test.

00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:54.350
So it will not be looking for this test to be successful. As

00:52:54.350 --> 00:52:57.830
simple as that. So needs test and runs on again. UBUNTOOL

00:52:57.830 --> 00:53:00.210
.com. So now we are going ahead with the deployment and

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:04.650
whatever we have done with respect to a test almost similar

00:53:04.650 --> 00:53:07.710
thing it is going to perform over here. So is it making

00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:14.410
sense guys to all of us till this point? Yeah. Making sense?

00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:24.140
Yeah. So here need test means test is supposed to be

00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:26.760
completed and then run on Ubuntu latest means deployment.

00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:30.580
You have to run on this Ubuntu latest again inside my GitHub

00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:33.320
right GitHub itself where it is going to provide me. Small

00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:38.500
machine with Ubuntu and it is trying to check that if this

00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:41.660
branch or if the job workflow is available in main or

00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:43.480
masters, this is what I have mentioned. So if it is

00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:46.460
available in main or masters only in that case, try to run

00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:49.400
it, try to deploy it now. Same steps as we have mentioned

00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:52.580
inside the test, right? So check out users, check out V3 and

00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:55.740
name deploy to a EC2. So now we are trying to call a

00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:59.140
deployment inside this deploy. So far so forth test has

00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:02.140
happened inside my GitHub itself. Now we are going into a

00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:04.120
deployment. We are going into a deployment inside the EC2

00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:07.000
and here, so it will be looking for the environment. So it

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.720
will be looking for my like a private key, which I have

00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:13.620
already uploaded inside my GitHub setting, right? It will be

00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:16.580
looking for a machine and it will be looking for a user. So

00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:20.260
all of these things, exactly the variable name, which I have

00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:23.200
mentioned over here. If your variable name is going to be

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:27.160
different, then you have to make a changes over here. If you

00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:29.680
have made any kind of a mistake in terms of giving a seek

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:33.080
variable name, then it is not going to work. Okay. Simple as

00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:36.740
that. So here is a variable name and these three variable,

00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:42.500
we have done a setup for that over here. EC2 host, EC2 SSH

00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:46.220
private key, EC2 user, simple, right? Same variable name we

00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:48.540
have given. If you have given some different variable name,

00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:51.240
please make a changes over here inside your YAML file.

00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:55.780
Otherwise it is going to give you the error. Okay. So it

00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:58.160
will go and it will try to read all of these environment

00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:01.200
variable, which I have already like provided inside my

00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:03.120
GitHub, inside my setting. So it will go and it will try to

00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:05.580
log in inside my security and inside the security. And then

00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:10.080
it will try to access my machine, right? It will try to

00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:12.560
access my machine. So here, first of all, eco, eco means

00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:16.400
print, right? So it is trying to print my PEM key by the

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:20.460
way, right? And then it will try to like start doing a copy

00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:24.660
of the file. So basically it is trying to log in inside my

00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:28.120
machine. As simple as that. It is trying to access my

00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:32.100
particular machine. This is what I'm trying to say over

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:36.980
here. Is it making sense to all of us guys? Yeah. Till this

00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:37.260
point.

00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:44.510
So basically what it is trying to do, so here we are trying

00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:48.090
to like, uh, you know, create a private key dot PEM file

00:55:48.090 --> 00:55:51.770
based on the variable value that we have uploaded. And then

00:55:51.770 --> 00:55:55.430
it is trying to copy that private PEM file inside my

00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:56.670
machine,

00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:01.760
the host that I'm, uh, that the host, which I have provided

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:05.300
over here, that's it so that it will be able to log in.

00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:08.840
Okay. So once it will be able to log in, so then we are

00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:12.080
trying to call basically a, with the help of this, like a

00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:14.840
private key, right? So we are trying to say that, that, uh,

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:18.940
inside my machine. Now if you are able to access, go there

00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:23.080
and try to create a directory. So home slash Ubuntu, Ubuntu

00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:25.900
is nothing by my user. So try to create a directory called

00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:30.520
as app over there. Yeah. And then change directory. So just

00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:34.140
go into, first of all, create it. MKDIR make directory. And

00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:37.280
then change directory CD. Okay. So go inside the directory

00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:42.380
that you have created. And then over there, try to do all

00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:46.560
the setup or all the installation. So first of all, sudo apt

00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:49.060
eco is nothing but just a print. You can think about print,

00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:51.120
right? So wherever I have mentioned eco, it simply means

00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:53.580
that I'm printing, it's printing something. And the rest of

00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:56.960
this is basically command. So sudo apt get update. I believe

00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:59.860
we have done that, right? Even last time, sudo apt get

00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:02.780
install Python and then Python virtual environment. So I'm

00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:05.520
trying to create a work. Like, I'm trying to install a

00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:07.700
Python, first of all, and then I'm trying to basically

00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:11.380
install a pip and then virtual environment. Then I'm going

00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:14.580
into that. So I'm just trying to access this virtual

00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:17.580
environment library. And then I'm trying to do the creation

00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:20.540
of the environment. And then I'm trying to activate that

00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:24.200
environment. So Python installation done. Right? Virtual

00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:26.920
environment installation is done. And then I'm trying to

00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:29.920
create an environment. I'm trying to activate that

00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:33.740
environment. Simple. Then pip install upgrade pip. pip and

00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:36.720
then here so I'm trying to install what I'm trying to

00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:40.420
install a dependency with respect to my project all of these

00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:42.640
things will be done automatically right by a system itself

00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:47.400
so again similar kind of a step so whenever we try to set up

00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:50.440
a machine so similar kind of things we are trying to perform

00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:57.020
over here nothing different so is it clear guys yeah ubuntu

00:57:57.020 --> 00:57:59.420
latest installer step is down so ubuntu latest is nothing

00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:03.300
but it's trying to give you a small machine inside a github

00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:06.600
so that it will be able to run the test because to run a

00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:09.520
test it is supposed to execute a code now to execute a code

00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:12.020
I need a machine without that I will not be able to execute

00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:14.620
it so this is where this github action comes into a picture

00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:21.080
yeah same thing so now inside my ec2 machine so I will be

00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:23.620
able to do this installation I will be able to do this

00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:29.040
requirement dot txt nothing much over here now once all of

00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:32.800
these things are done right once this all of these things

00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:36.360
are done so basically we are trying to create a service so

00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:39.220
here basically we are trying to create a system service

00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:44.060
basically right so system d so that it will be able to run

00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:46.200
each and everything in a back end and I have written a lot

00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:48.380
of echo because I was facing some sort of issues with

00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:52.100
respect to my initial deployment so just to print all of

00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:53.980
these things what is happening inside of my machine I have

00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:56.700
written all this echo over there that's it this echo is I

00:58:56.700 --> 00:59:00.400
will be able to get a log that's it now the main thing is

00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:00.400
that I have written all this echo over here that's it this

00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:02.940
echo is the main thing will come over here so sudo systemctl

00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:07.520
stop fast api app or true reload enable start service so I

00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:10.840
have I have just written over there that enable start stop

00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:13.640
all of these services that we have written even in my

00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:17.520
previous class right so systemctl and start the service or

00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:21.140
like reload the service or enable a service each and

00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:24.400
everything we have mentioned over there yeah so similar kind

00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:27.420
of things we have mentioned over here as well now wait for

00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:30.960
the moment to like to start the service and now this is

00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:33.580
going to check the status so we are trying to start it we

00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:35.600
are trying to enable it we are trying to configure it and

00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:39.900
then we are trying to check the status as simple as that and

00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:42.280
then at the end of the day so we are trying to remove my

00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:47.360
private key the key which I have provided that's it so this

00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:51.200
is something that we are trying to perform so this echo is

00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:54.800
trying to add lots of lines but yeah this is just a print

00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:57.740
that I'm trying to perform like I said so I was facing some

00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:59.900
sort of a issue so I thought of you know printing all of

00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:00.400
these things because I have written all of these things so I

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:03.580
was keeping that in my mind so we have done echo so here it

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:08.720
is going to do a final deployment that's it yeah that's it

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:11.580
the way we do it inside our local system or the way we are

01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:15.040
going to directly deploy inside our ec2 instances in the

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:18.300
similar manner I'm just trying to control it with the help

01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:23.160
of this entire yaml file so which is going to do a job which

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:25.840
is going to Intensiate a task automatically it is going to

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:31.080
auto trigger right so whenever it will try to it will try to

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:35.580
auto trigger in that way the entire flow the entire process

01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:38.760
is going to be automated now you are going to build one

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.020
project or maybe you are going to build hundreds of project

01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:45.000
if you are using a same CI CD pipeline it's not going to

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:52.090
change it's going to be actually same yes so we want to

01:00:52.090 --> 01:00:54.270
latest command can you tell me where the machine learning is

01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:57.290
a github server or a double server it's a github server I

01:00:57.290 --> 01:01:02.290
have repeated more than 10 times so when I say one to latest

01:01:02.290 --> 01:01:06.290
this one it's a github server so in this is something called

01:01:06.290 --> 01:01:09.330
as github action because github is supposed to test and

01:01:09.330 --> 01:01:13.250
github is supposed to build right so to test it to build it

01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:16.150
means what we are trying to run the code now to run the code

01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:18.750
I need a machine without machine I will not be able to run

01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:23.850
the code right yeah so in github and then we are launching

01:01:23.850 --> 01:01:28.610
ec2 so so far see so have we have we like a accessed our

01:01:28.610 --> 01:01:32.990
ec2o in this step have we done that no right in our test

01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:37.810
phase have we accessed our ec2o machine a machine which is

01:01:37.810 --> 01:01:41.270
available on AWS no right still we are running this test so

01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:43.930
simply means that that there is something which will happen

01:01:43.930 --> 01:01:49.090
on a github right then on this deploy step we are trying to

01:01:49.090 --> 01:01:52.810
access our ec2o instances which is the machine that we have

01:01:52.810 --> 01:02:00.050
on our AWS cloud platform right now so now let's do one

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:03.410
thing so let's try to push this entire code base right the

01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:06.230
code that we have so let's try to push this entire code base

01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:10.410
inside our github repository fine so let's try to push it so

01:02:10.410 --> 01:02:16.030
now I'll go to my github code right and I believe we all

01:02:16.030 --> 01:02:19.390
know how we will be able to push it so simple let's go and

01:02:19.390 --> 01:02:27.840
do it one by one so git i n i t so instantiate it and then

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:34.140
git add add everything yeah then I can try to are you are

01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:38.850
you doing it guys everyone same you have to follow the same

01:02:38.850 --> 01:02:41.710
thing right so instantiate it and then like add something

01:02:41.710 --> 01:02:45.630
then commit and then branch main so here get

01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:54.850
commit give a message if you want this is my first deploy of

01:02:54.850 --> 01:03:00.190
CICD any kind of messages I'm going to give so git commit

01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:04.290
and then try to add a branch over there so branch main so

01:03:04.290 --> 01:03:11.230
git branch main do it and then this is my branch where we

01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:15.870
have to add the code so add a code remote origin already

01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:20.350
exist okay so maybe i'll have to remove that particular part

01:03:20.350 --> 01:03:23.770
so do it guys do it till this point so

01:03:25.790 --> 01:03:30.800
i just have to remove this origin so i'll remove it can you

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:33.260
please share your code we will follow the practical as well

01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:35.380
i have already shared a code inside your dashboard so please

01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:38.080
go inside dashboard and in a previous class you will be able

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:39.580
to see that so

01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:47.490
i'll try to write git remote is already available so git

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:57.010
remote remote remove o-r-i-g-i-n okay remove it again i'll

01:03:57.010 --> 01:04:01.210
try to add it now this time it's added now a last step

01:04:01.210 --> 01:04:06.370
basically so push the code so i believe this is not new for

01:04:06.370 --> 01:04:12.690
any one of us okay so now it is able to push a code now

01:04:12.690 --> 01:04:16.970
let's go to a github repository quickly so all of these

01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:20.170
codes are available as of now i have pushed this entire code

01:04:20.170 --> 01:04:24.150
now click on this action tab guys yeah so click on this

01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:27.510
action tab and you will be able to see this is my first

01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:31.070
deploy of cicd the message which i have given now if you are

01:04:31.070 --> 01:04:35.330
going to click on this as per my cicd yaml file as you can

01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:40.370
see it is running my cicd yaml file and it has executed a

01:04:40.370 --> 01:04:43.530
test and then it has basically

01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:46.490
deployed to the github repository so we will see why

01:04:46.490 --> 01:04:49.890
deployment has failed not an issue we'll see why deployment

01:04:49.890 --> 01:04:54.150
has failed could not resolve a host name or the name of the

01:04:54.150 --> 01:05:00.300
service not known okay fine i'll try to fix this issue but

01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:04.740
yeah the whole part the whole idea was to push a code so we

01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:07.760
are able to push a code over here entire code base is

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:11.640
available now if you will come inside this action part you

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:15.160
will be able to see some action action based on my yaml file

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:18.840
so cicd yaml and we have the basically created a test and

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:22.220
then we have created a deploy these are the two steps that i

01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:24.900
have created inside my yaml file recently we have discussed

01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:28.780
so test means it is able to test each and everything and

01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:32.900
during this test phase what has happened you will be able to

01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:36.860
check each and everything so as per my yaml file whatever i

01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:40.520
have mentioned inside my test step everything everything you

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:44.000
will be able to say it right so set up a python then install

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.860
a dependency then it is so it is installing all of this

01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:51.840
library the way we do it inside the local system and then

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:55.660
run the test so here it is trying to run my pi test from my

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:59.380
test directory as simple as that and error test main dot

01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:02.800
file type error okay got an unexpected keyword argument app

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:07.220
interrupt one error during a collection no test found is

01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:10.780
keeping okay so test it is if it is not able to find out the

01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:13.200
correct test scenario so it is going to escape it that's

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:17.980
also fine but yeah so it is able to run each and everything

01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:20.520
where so it is able to run each and everything inside a

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:23.900
github and then it is trying to call a deployment a next

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:27.880
step and because of some reason so my deployment has failed

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:31.320
that's okay yeah that's okay we'll we'll try to like uh

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:34.140
figure it out that why my deployment is basically failing

01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:36.980
i'll try to fix this particular issue because none of the

01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:40.620
deployment for the very first time happens uh i mean in a

01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:45.200
first go so uh any anyone so even as an experienced person

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:47.980
if someone is going to do a deployment so it fails couple of

01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:50.580
times and then i'm going to fix it now itself in a class

01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:54.300
live class itself i'm going to fix it hopefully so is it

01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:58.140
fine are you able to see some actions inside the action tab

01:06:58.140 --> 01:06:59.960
of your repository yeah

01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:06.920
it has failed i mean like there is some issue there is some

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:09.120
issue with my private key i can see over here it has given

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:12.440
me error code is equal to 255 something like that

01:07:24.970 --> 01:07:27.930
yes failure to me same error yeah so if i'm getting an error

01:07:27.930 --> 01:07:30.190
so obviously you will end up getting the same error let me

01:07:30.190 --> 01:07:34.350
see what is this error uh so it is not it looks like it is

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:37.990
not able to find out my uh file basically private file it is

01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:41.770
not able to log in into my ec2 this is what i can say so

01:07:41.770 --> 01:07:44.510
could not resolve a host name name or service not known

01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:48.070
environment okay so maybe host name could not resolve a host

01:07:48.070 --> 01:07:50.770
name name or service not known and then connection closed

01:07:50.770 --> 01:07:55.230
means it is not able to log in into my ec2 this is what i am

01:07:55.230 --> 01:07:58.110
like uh able to see so

01:08:18.690 --> 01:08:20.230
let me check and let me

01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:53.860
yeah so basically i have to because all three is three is

01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:58.020
like coming as a blank so i can try to click on this secret

01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:03.400
and variable come to action and just do one thing repository

01:09:08.270 --> 01:09:08.970
no

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:17.480
there is nothing inside my okay

01:09:19.850 --> 01:09:25.630
so repository variable is fine and everything is blank okay

01:09:25.630 --> 01:09:34.770
let me create a new environment over here so ci cd uh gen ai

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:40.970
gen ai test so let's configure not a repository environment

01:09:40.970 --> 01:09:48.010
but a environment variable so add environment variable i'll

01:09:48.010 --> 01:09:51.050
try to add the exact same thing which i have added before

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:55.240
yaml file private

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:05.600
key and then okay

01:10:09.890 --> 01:10:12.550
so copy my entire key

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:15.740
and then we will get our environment variable we are now

01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:15.740
with our environment variable so we just have to keep it

01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:22.020
about duplicate key add variable then another one so another

01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:29.540
variable was ec2 host so i'll try to add ec2 host ec2 host

01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:32.800
is going to my public ip address this one so in my case 15

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:39.920
206 88 97 okay so let me add that same thing that we have

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:42.200
already added so this time i'm just adding entire inside my

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:44.860
environment variable inside instead of like a doing a

01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:50.960
repository sequence great, ec2 user, ec2 user and that is

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:56.960
going to be ubuntu. So it is going to be the name ubuntu. So

01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:04.660
u b u n t u, add variable. So these three variable I have

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:08.800
added. Now again I will go back to action and I will go back

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:13.300
to this last workflow which has failed and I can try to call

01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:17.240
rerun all the jobs. So let's see, rerun all the jobs.

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:25.800
So it has started running a test, it's

01:11:46.730 --> 01:11:50.710
running my deploy, again deployment has failed, process

01:11:50.710 --> 01:11:57.820
completed with the exit code, same failure, could

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:06.820
not resolve a hostname, name, these

01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:15.050
things are coming as a blank, no but I have already provided

01:12:15.050 --> 01:12:15.470
that.

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:41.080
Please check the ec2 name once that you have given at the

01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:45.060
time of creation. That doesn't matter. So it just requires

01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:49.680
like a IP address, the public IP address, that's it. Doesn't

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:52.840
matter what name I have given at the time of like a creation

01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:53.660
of this one.

01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:02.080
It's giving me blank but I have already provided it, okay,

01:13:06.250 --> 01:13:10.630
okay, okay. So there could be one issue guys when I am

01:13:10.630 --> 01:13:15.870
trying to hit this server. So here inside this ec2, I

01:13:15.870 --> 01:13:19.170
believe we have done even last time. So go to a networking,

01:13:19.570 --> 01:13:26.710
sorry, go to a security and inside a security group, but

01:13:26.710 --> 01:13:30.570
yeah, SSH wise 22 number port, 443, 80 number port is

01:13:30.570 --> 01:13:32.670
already opened. So inbound is already done.

01:13:40.430 --> 01:13:42.610
So it should not at

01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:51.220
least stop my SSH. I can go and add inbound rule wise even

01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:57.000
8000. Which is for my API exposure. But yeah, this doesn't

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.960
depends upon the instance

01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:07.080
and then there is a instance. It

01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:25.760
is not able to print this hostname

01:14:44.130 --> 01:14:45.850
name service, not known.

01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:05.340
It should be able to read it from a repository variable, but

01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:10.960
it is not able to do it, okay.

01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:11.330
So let's go to a secret part. Let me. Add secret over here,

01:16:20.610 --> 01:16:23.390
CICD secret,

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:34.240
SSH private key, add

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:46.580
environment secret, hostname is going to be my public IP

01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:55.900
address, add secret and then my user is going to be ubuntu.

01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:02.360
Let me trigger an action one more time.

01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:36.260
Basically it should work with the repository secret. It is

01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:37.720
not supposed to give me this issue

01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:51.500
again, deployment failed with the same error. It was

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:56.530
supposed to work with the repository secret itself, code

01:17:56.530 --> 01:18:04.600
space and then new repository secret. Okay. It seems to be

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:12.320
blank for me. Environment and variable is fine. Oh.

01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:18.330
I think. I have made it. I have made some mistake.

01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:22.250
Repository secret. Add

01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:31.720
secrets. Okay, repository secret was showing me blank.

01:18:39.330 --> 01:18:43.920
Okay. And user ubuntu.

01:18:50.290 --> 01:18:51.250
No action.

01:18:55.250 --> 01:18:56.150
Run the job.

01:19:18.690 --> 01:19:20.730
Yeah. So basically I was supposed to add a repository

01:19:20.730 --> 01:19:24.630
secret. I have added it, but yeah, I mean like in a later

01:19:24.630 --> 01:19:27.690
stage when I have checked so it was gone. So it was

01:19:27.690 --> 01:19:30.950
completely blank. So I have added it once again. It should

01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:34.350
work with the repository secret hundred percent, right? So

01:19:34.350 --> 01:19:37.670
let's see. I mean like it should work this time. I have

01:19:37.670 --> 01:19:39.470
added a repository secret because

01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:57.630
last time it was giving me all three blank, right? This is

01:19:57.630 --> 01:19:59.050
what I can see in my error log.

01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:15.830
I think this time it will not fail. It is taking longer than

01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:19.070
and I can even go and check over here. So what is happening

01:20:19.070 --> 01:20:23.410
inside my deploy? Yeah. So now it is able to log in into my

01:20:23.410 --> 01:20:27.550
EC2. Yes. So now it's happening. You can, you can go into a

01:20:27.550 --> 01:20:29.750
deploy and you can check all the steps. So whether it is

01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:32.430
able to log in into or not. So yeah, it is showing me that

01:20:32.430 --> 01:20:35.810
it is able to log in and then uh, whatever command which I

01:20:35.810 --> 01:20:38.910
have given. So yeah, it is, it is able to run all of these

01:20:38.910 --> 01:20:42.490
commands. It is able to do the python installation and this

01:20:42.490 --> 01:20:44.610
is, this was the actual issue guys. This was the actual

01:20:44.610 --> 01:20:47.170
issue. So it was not able to log in into my system. Now it

01:20:47.170 --> 01:20:50.190
has logged in. So successfully uninstalled this, this, this

01:20:50.190 --> 01:20:52.950
downloading this version. So basically it is trying to

01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:56.150
download all the requirement.txt. So I can see everything in

01:20:56.150 --> 01:21:00.910
live. Yeah. So yeah, it, it, it is supposed to actually

01:21:00.910 --> 01:21:04.330
work. Yeah. Now post run action. Okay, fine. Completed a

01:21:04.330 --> 01:21:08.510
job. So bingo. Okay. Completed job error. But yeah, it is

01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:11.090
telling me that it has deployed. So maybe I can go and

01:21:11.090 --> 01:21:15.250
check. So I can try to basically uh, copy this public DNS,

01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:21.330
right? Public DNS. And then I can try to give 8,000 port and

01:21:21.330 --> 01:21:24.870
uh, welcome to fast API curd application status. Hello. D

01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:28.550
right. This is what I'm trying to print on home. D O C S D O

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:33.110
C S so that it can open up a solder UI and my application is

01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:38.630
deployed. Yeah. My application is basically deployed. Fine.

01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:43.830
So successfully we are able to productionize our CI CD. Now

01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:46.110
let me show you CI CD continuous integration, continuous

01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:49.290
deployment, right? So now what I will do, I'll try to make

01:21:49.290 --> 01:21:52.150
some sort of a changes into my code. So let's go here,

01:21:52.250 --> 01:21:55.790
right? Uh, let's go. into any of this file of your choice,

01:21:55.910 --> 01:21:58.490
any file, any file means literally any file of your choice

01:21:58.490 --> 01:22:02.730
and welcome to fast API curd application. So maybe instead

01:22:02.730 --> 01:22:07.010
of like a, you know, printing this message, welcome to your

01:22:07.010 --> 01:22:12.830
own fast API CI CD fine. So this is the message which I

01:22:12.830 --> 01:22:15.170
would like to print. I don't want to print, you know, uh,

01:22:15.410 --> 01:22:18.850
uh, the previous message. So this is the code changes which

01:22:18.850 --> 01:22:21.250
I have done. Yeah, this is the code changes which I have

01:22:21.250 --> 01:22:24.330
done. Let's suppose. Now if I have done some sort of a code

01:22:24.330 --> 01:22:27.530
changes, so I have to push that particular code. Yes, I have

01:22:27.530 --> 01:22:31.450
to push this particular code. So maybe get add, add all. So

01:22:31.450 --> 01:22:35.690
by default and then I can do get C O double M I T commit,

01:22:35.890 --> 01:22:39.750
commit and I can write a message over there. So commit with

01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:46.030
the message. I have done a message changes in code fine. So

01:22:46.030 --> 01:22:48.410
with this message, let's suppose I'm trying to do a commit

01:22:48.410 --> 01:22:53.590
and then get push or is in main as simple as that. So it is

01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:57.810
going to push the latest version of the code simple. So here

01:22:57.810 --> 01:23:02.370
if I'll go inside my GitHub right inside my repository, so

01:23:02.370 --> 01:23:05.090
you will be able to see that that automatically it has

01:23:05.090 --> 01:23:07.250
started running. I have done a message change in the code.

01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:09.370
This is the message which I have pushed just now, right?

01:23:09.410 --> 01:23:12.290
Just a second ago and automatically I don't have to do

01:23:12.290 --> 01:23:14.510
anything, right? I don't have to do anything actually. So

01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:16.930
automatically as you can see, it has started running the

01:23:16.930 --> 01:23:20.430
pipeline. So by the time it has sensed something new has

01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:22.670
been pushed. Automatically it has started running the

01:23:22.670 --> 01:23:26.490
pipeline and automatically it will try to deploy it and I

01:23:26.490 --> 01:23:29.970
will be able to see that new message, right? I will be able

01:23:29.970 --> 01:23:35.730
to see that new message on this particular URL, right? So it

01:23:35.730 --> 01:23:37.910
is still showing the previous one. Welcome to fast API code

01:23:37.910 --> 01:23:41.190
application as deployment is going on, right? As deployment

01:23:41.190 --> 01:23:44.090
is going on. Now once this deployment will be done, once

01:23:44.090 --> 01:23:46.930
this is going to be finished, I will be able to see a new

01:23:46.930 --> 01:23:49.770
message as well, right? Just wait for my deployment to like

01:23:49.770 --> 01:23:52.450
a finish and I can check. I can see like what is happening

01:23:52.450 --> 01:23:55.990
inside the deployment, yeah? So deployment is completed

01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:59.810
successfully. Now go and refresh and yes, welcome to your

01:23:59.810 --> 01:24:03.810
own fast API CICD. Means whatever changes which I have done

01:24:03.810 --> 01:24:07.290
inside my code, automatically it has been deployed. So I

01:24:07.290 --> 01:24:10.770
just have to push a code inside my repo, that's it, right?

01:24:10.870 --> 01:24:13.510
And my application new feature will be live.

01:24:18.630 --> 01:24:21.490
PK is saying, can you please help us revise, summarize what

01:24:21.490 --> 01:24:24.830
all we did so far? I think you should join a class. From the

01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:27.030
beginning summary wise. So I have already given a summary

01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:31.330
option inside your dashboard. So like even post this class,

01:24:31.410 --> 01:24:34.290
I mean like after this class, when we are going to upload

01:24:34.290 --> 01:24:37.430
the recording, you will be able to see a summary. We have

01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:39.430
just done CICD. That's it.

01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:48.190
Fine everyone. Can you open the IP address to show the

01:24:48.190 --> 01:24:52.030
output? Which output? This is the output, right? This is

01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:55.910
basically the output. So just DOCS. So we have a fast API.

01:24:56.110 --> 01:24:59.090
This fast API is live over here. And that too with my new

01:24:59.090 --> 01:25:02.190
changes, right? So I can keep on building. I can keep on

01:25:02.190 --> 01:25:06.270
writing a code over here. Simply push the code. Rest is

01:25:06.270 --> 01:25:10.150
done. That's the beauty of CICD.

01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:17.420
If approval needs on GitHub, then go and approve. You have

01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:21.280
to merge the PR. Then only code will go. So basically here

01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:24.780
we have simply mentioned that, that whenever something will

01:25:24.780 --> 01:25:28.000
happen over here, right? In which branch? Main branch.

01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:30.380
Right? So let's suppose there is some different branch.

01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:32.560
Nothing will happen. It is not going to deploy. Unless and

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:35.940
until you are not going to merge it with a main branch.

01:25:38.810 --> 01:25:41.790
Making sense everyone? Yeah. So how many of you are able to

01:25:41.790 --> 01:25:44.190
deploy it? How many of you are able to build a entire CICD?

01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:47.210
How many of you are able to, you know, do some changes into

01:25:47.210 --> 01:25:51.970
a code? Okay. Arun is done. Rakesh is done. I got an error

01:25:51.970 --> 01:25:55.210
on a deployment step. Okay. So maybe you can try to fix it.

01:25:55.790 --> 01:26:00.350
Joel done. Saif is saying when, where we get a template on

01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:04.590
YAML? On internet? In a GitHub you will be able to get it or

01:26:04.590 --> 01:26:07.790
maybe from anywhere like this kind of a YAML you will be

01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:10.470
able to find it all across the internet. Or maybe you can

01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:13.110
just ask chat GPT or maybe a URI. They will be able to give

01:26:13.110 --> 01:26:19.070
you even the same YAML. Able to done. Sorry, but can you

01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:22.170
tell me what changes you made in VS code? I have like

01:26:22.170 --> 01:26:26.470
changed this welcome to your own fast API CICD. That's it.

01:26:27.210 --> 01:26:30.250
This is a new changes, which I have done. A message, right?

01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:34.130
The message that you will be able to get. At root. So this

01:26:34.130 --> 01:26:41.250
message I have changed. This message I have changed. And

01:26:41.250 --> 01:26:45.310
yeah, I like I can do any kind of changes into my code. This

01:26:45.310 --> 01:26:52.170
is also a code change, which I have done. And yes, so we

01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:59.960
are able to make our application like simple, right? So

01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:04.100
everything is live over here. And after making any kind of

01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:08.100
changes. Again, it is going to reflect the same thing.

01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:16.140
Run eco private key warning permanently added to list known

01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:18.000
permission denied public key.

01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:24.880
Process completed with exec code 255. Okay, so maybe you are

01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:27.800
making a mistake. So just go to your setting, right? Go to

01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:31.040
your setting. Go to your like secret and variable. Go to

01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:36.280
action. And then inside that as a repository secret. Not as

01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:37.820
a environment variable. Or environment variable. As an

01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:40.980
environment secret. So as a repository secret, try to create

01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:45.020
all of these these three things, right? Do it and then like

01:27:45.020 --> 01:27:46.960
try to redeploy it will work.

01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:55.020
One question if our OS is window, then it is the same

01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:59.160
process only in a place of Ubuntu? No. So obviously you have

01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:02.980
to write a Windows specific command because the command

01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:06.200
which has been mentioned inside my YAML file, it's basically

01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:09.680
a Ubuntu specific command or you can say a Linux specific

01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:13.300
command as we have opted for which machine? So we have opted

01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:16.740
for basically a Ubuntu machine to do a deployment. So

01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:21.500
obviously it is going to be a machine specific. I mean like

01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:22.000
OS specific.

01:28:29.090 --> 01:28:34.130
Okay, so fine, everyone, I believe we are able to do a CI CD

01:28:34.130 --> 01:28:36.850
pipeline and going forward. So whatever project that you are

01:28:36.850 --> 01:28:41.110
going to do similar approach, so you have to follow. It's

01:28:41.110 --> 01:28:44.130
all about creating a YAML file and then with the help of

01:28:44.130 --> 01:28:47.050
YAML file, everything will be managed and everything will be

01:28:47.050 --> 01:28:49.930
done automatically. If I would like to create a different

01:28:49.930 --> 01:28:52.630
different, you know, branches for a development environment

01:28:52.630 --> 01:28:56.250
for a UAT environment and then for a production environment

01:28:56.250 --> 01:29:00.350
that can also be configured in a exact similar manner. So

01:29:00.350 --> 01:29:03.090
there will be a separate separate environment or YAML file

01:29:03.090 --> 01:29:05.850
we are going to create. So one for a dev environment, one

01:29:05.850 --> 01:29:09.090
for a UAT environment, one for a production environment. And

01:29:09.090 --> 01:29:13.870
then like, you know, we can we can try to like create an

01:29:13.870 --> 01:29:16.650
actions that when we are, on which environment will be

01:29:16.650 --> 01:29:19.650
invoked and what is going to happen in dev, what is going to

01:29:19.650 --> 01:29:22.050
happen in a UAT and what is going to happen in a production

01:29:22.050 --> 01:29:24.850
environment. This is how we try to create one of the

01:29:24.850 --> 01:29:31.210
simplest possible CI CD pipeline. But like I said, right, so

01:29:31.210 --> 01:29:35.050
like I said, there can be multiple tools that you can try to

01:29:35.050 --> 01:29:38.670
involve over here and then also you can try to create a CI

01:29:38.670 --> 01:29:43.110
CD. For example, I can try to involve maybe Jenkins over

01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:47.930
there. I can try to involve. Maybe like a some any any other

01:29:47.930 --> 01:29:50.450
there are so many tools out there. So which you can try to

01:29:50.450 --> 01:29:54.650
like use it and you will be able to like spin the machine or

01:29:54.650 --> 01:29:58.930
spin any other services on Azure, AWS and GCP in automatic

01:29:58.930 --> 01:30:02.510
way. As of now, I'm just trying to use EC2 service from AWS.

01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:05.950
But yeah, so I can try to call any other services in

01:30:05.950 --> 01:30:09.910
automatic way and I will be able to basically even do a

01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:13.690
deployment. I mean, like a lot of such things are possible.

01:30:13.690 --> 01:30:14.830
Not just one or two.

01:30:17.890 --> 01:30:21.990
Okay so target setting deployment done. Okay so our case

01:30:21.990 --> 01:30:27.730
partil for con UAT. What is that? I'm not able to

01:30:27.730 --> 01:30:33.530
understand. Can we deploy only one file as well if our other

01:30:33.530 --> 01:30:36.830
file is working fine and changes done in one file? Yeah. So

01:30:36.830 --> 01:30:39.410
basically when I'm trying to push, right, so it is trying to

01:30:39.410 --> 01:30:41.890
push my latest changes from one file. Right. This is what I

01:30:41.890 --> 01:30:44.610
have done. This is what happens when you try to do a git

01:30:44.610 --> 01:30:48.250
add. So basically it will try to see. So which file has been

01:30:48.250 --> 01:30:52.270
changed and that is something that is going to upload. Yeah.

01:30:52.990 --> 01:30:56.310
The updated file. So all these things has been managed and

01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:58.570
maintained by git itself. This is where we are using GitHub

01:30:58.570 --> 01:31:01.270
or git by the way. Not GitHub. GitHub is just a repository.

01:31:01.570 --> 01:31:06.290
It's actual services actually git. Please take class on

01:31:06.290 --> 01:31:11.230
GitHub advanced action like pull request. That you can learn

01:31:11.230 --> 01:31:15.890
in half an hour of time from chat GPT itself. It's not a big

01:31:15.890 --> 01:31:19.350
deal. And as a techie, I believe you all are supposed to be

01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:22.910
aware about GitHub, at least a basic operation with respect

01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:27.830
to a GitHub, right? That's binary. I'm like, don't wait for

01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:31.550
anyone to teach you if you are waiting for it, then you are

01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:35.910
making a very, very big mistake, right? Something you should

01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:39.750
explore on your own as well. That's my recommendation. So

01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:43.270
fine guys, successfully we are able to do a CI CD now

01:31:43.270 --> 01:31:45.310
tomorrow what we are going to do. So tomorrow we are going

01:31:45.310 --> 01:31:48.210
to basically work on the project side, a project means

01:31:48.210 --> 01:31:50.830
project which has been listed inside your syllabus, right?

01:31:51.230 --> 01:31:53.730
So we'll start looking into a project. We'll see how we can

01:31:53.730 --> 01:31:56.210
try to build it and with every project. So we'll try to

01:31:56.210 --> 01:31:59.750
attach a CI CD pipeline as well so that whatever changes you

01:31:59.750 --> 01:32:03.210
are going to make, uh, automatically that should be deployed

01:32:03.210 --> 01:32:06.950
inside your EC2 instances. So same flow. That's the reason.

01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:09.770
So I have discussed CI CD and then I'll come with a

01:32:09.770 --> 01:32:12.770
discussion of your project path because inside a project

01:32:12.770 --> 01:32:15.310
there will be a UI interface. There will be a backend,

01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:19.110
right? Uh, there will be a databases you all are going to

01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:22.930
use. So all of these services we have to configure one by

01:32:22.930 --> 01:32:27.070
one, one by one, and we have to ship the code making sense.

01:32:27.410 --> 01:32:30.250
Yeah. I'm missing. I got the issues. Well done.

01:32:32.530 --> 01:32:35.510
Making sense everyone. Yeah. So anyone who is having any

01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:37.370
kind of a doubt, okay,

01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:44.910
so you can raise your hand if you have any kind of a doubt

01:32:44.910 --> 01:32:48.590
and uh, yeah, so we can talk about it. So go ahead. Said,

01:32:48.590 --> 01:32:51.650
said, I think you have. Yeah. Hi. Hi. So I want to share my

01:32:51.650 --> 01:32:57.270
screen. Okay. Fine. Go ahead. Abhijit, what is your issue?

01:32:57.610 --> 01:33:01.250
Yeah. Uh, there is no issue. Uh, but uh, just, I want to

01:33:01.250 --> 01:33:05.910
check how we can integrate with the Jira. So it will like,

01:33:06.010 --> 01:33:09.770
it will get approval also automatically it will come into

01:33:09.770 --> 01:33:13.050
the picture. So okay. So basically you can try to call as a

01:33:13.050 --> 01:33:15.870
book. So from a Jira, right? So you can try to call as a

01:33:15.870 --> 01:33:18.290
book. So whenever some action is going to happen, it will

01:33:18.290 --> 01:33:20.690
try to update your Jira. So Jira is already providing you

01:33:20.690 --> 01:33:23.250
that option Jira is already providing you an end points for

01:33:23.250 --> 01:33:29.180
that. Understood. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, Drupad.

01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:32.340
Uh, yeah. So Sid, you can share the screen. I think you are

01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:35.240
a part of panelists now. And Drupad, what is your question?

01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:40.280
Are we using DB in this project? Ganesh is asking. So yeah,

01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:43.380
we are using a SQLite in memory database. That's the reason.

01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:45.340
So we are able to do a code operation. If you'll go and

01:33:45.340 --> 01:33:48.200
check inside your app section, I have not discussed about

01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:51.100
that code because I think we are all are mature enough to

01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:53.800
understand that part. Okay. We are taking classes since last

01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:54.360
four months.

01:33:58.270 --> 01:34:01.630
Yeah. So what is, what is the issue? Sid? Yeah. See, I could

01:34:01.630 --> 01:34:05.850
deploy the code, but when I'm trying to run the DNS server

01:34:05.850 --> 01:34:09.570
from there, the link is not working. So I'll show you again.

01:34:10.810 --> 01:34:14.030
So this one, when I'm opening, okay, show me, show me your

01:34:14.030 --> 01:34:17.410
security, go to your security tab.

01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:25.220
Hmm. Okay. Got, got the issue. Fine. Click on your security

01:34:25.220 --> 01:34:31.310
group. Security group. Same, same tab. Yeah. So let me

01:34:31.310 --> 01:34:34.850
annotate this one security group. I think this is something

01:34:34.850 --> 01:34:37.810
that we have done even in my last class, right? So click on

01:34:37.810 --> 01:34:41.330
this edit inbound rule. So basically your API will be hosted

01:34:41.330 --> 01:34:44.510
at 8,000 port. And so basically you can see in your list,

01:34:44.590 --> 01:34:47.710
you have not added the 8,000. You have not opened the 8,000

01:34:47.710 --> 01:34:52.570
port. Yeah. So give over here 8,000 here, here, here, give

01:34:52.570 --> 01:34:58.870
here 8,000 and marking it. Yeah. Give 8,000 over here. Okay.

01:34:58.870 --> 01:35:03.550
Now. So over here, select a zero dot zero dot zero first

01:35:03.550 --> 01:35:12.300
option. Yes. Allow everything. Fine. Save rule. Hmm. Okay.

01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:13.620
Now try to hit that URL.

01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:37.740
Enter. It is showing not secure. Fine. That is fine.

01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:41.600
Connection for this one is not secure. Uh, it's running on

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:46.540
HTTPS. It should run on STTP, not secure connection by the

01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:49.880
way. Just open it. Open up into a Google Chrome. Copy this

01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:53.080
URL. Yeah. Use Chrome.

01:35:56.440 --> 01:36:02.100
I don't have Chrome I think. Then you'll have to install it.

01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:05.280
Remove HTTPS. HTTPS. Just keep like a HTTP.

01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:15.580
Hit. Yeah. It's working. Okay. Now it is coming. Yeah. So

01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:18.480
now you can just do like a slash docs. You will be able to

01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:20.700
see Swagger UI as well. Oh yeah.

01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:28.540
Yeah. So all these APIs are live basically. If

01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:36.380
I try. Try it out. Yeah. I mean like, yeah, it's basically

01:36:36.380 --> 01:36:38.700
live so you can, you can do whatever you want with your

01:36:38.700 --> 01:36:43.560
APIs. Yeah. Fine. Fine. Yeah. Every, every, every, if it is

01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:45.740
not working, then it's a code issue basically. I mean like

01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:48.260
you can fix it in a local system, push it once again,

01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:50.860
automatically it will deploy. You don't have to worry about

01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:53.920
the deployment now. Right. With the help of CICD. And uh,

01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:56.500
yeah. So if something is not working, fixing your local,

01:36:56.580 --> 01:36:59.540
testing your local, first of all, then again send the code,

01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:02.080
send the code to a GitHub and then automatically CICD will

01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:05.560
deploy. Okay. So running through means through UvCon, you

01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:08.700
are saying running in local. Yeah. Yeah. So basically even

01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:10.840
over here it's running through a UvCon itself. So the

01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:13.860
command that we are using in a local, same command we are

01:37:13.860 --> 01:37:18.740
using even on an EC2. Okay. Yeah. Okay. I mean like see

01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:21.960
whatever you have done like on your local system, right. The

01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:24.800
way you try to run something in your local system, we are

01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:27.480
trying to run same thing on an EC2 system. That's it. That's

01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:29.780
the only differences. There is no other differences in terms

01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:34.030
of like, you know, running the code or command. Okay. yeah

01:37:34.030 --> 01:37:42.930
yeah okay so fine issue fixed now so yeah ram what is the

01:37:42.930 --> 01:37:46.350
question drupad what is your question so so that's one quick

01:37:46.350 --> 01:37:50.510
question now that uh we have done cicd right now if suppose

01:37:50.510 --> 01:37:54.290
this works whenever it goes some developer uh checks in and

01:37:54.290 --> 01:37:57.370
whenever the pr merged to the main branch it gets deployed

01:37:57.370 --> 01:38:01.310
into dev so what about production or you wait at the higher

01:38:01.310 --> 01:38:05.810
environments so we need to do separate cicd yeah so

01:38:05.810 --> 01:38:08.510
basically in this approach so we try to create a multiple

01:38:08.510 --> 01:38:11.750
yaml file and we try to spin a multiple instances so

01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:14.970
generally whenever we try to you know build instances for

01:38:14.970 --> 01:38:17.770
our production system so we always try to keep it high based

01:38:17.770 --> 01:38:21.630
on our traffic that we are expecting and so we try to spin a

01:38:21.630 --> 01:38:24.370
small instances for a development environment a small

01:38:24.370 --> 01:38:27.570
instances for a uat environment and then like a parallelly

01:38:27.570 --> 01:38:30.630
we try to create a multiple yaml files and different

01:38:30.630 --> 01:38:32.970
different branches we use to create so we try to create a

01:38:32.970 --> 01:38:35.730
dev branch then we use to create a ug branch and then we use

01:38:35.730 --> 01:38:39.170
to create a main branch so first my code will go to our dev

01:38:39.170 --> 01:38:42.790
dev branch then from dev to uat and then from u82 main

01:38:42.790 --> 01:38:45.970
backup so by the time you it will go to your ut it will be

01:38:45.970 --> 01:38:48.730
live with the help of instance that i have selected for a

01:38:48.730 --> 01:38:52.430
basically like a production and whenever it will go to a u80

01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:55.050
so it will be live on an instance which we have selected for

01:38:55.050 --> 01:38:59.530
a uat and a dev so same thing but yeah three amon file we

01:38:59.530 --> 01:39:01.870
tried to create and see our fences and multiple instances

01:39:01.870 --> 01:39:04.010
will be like more like multiple instances a spend on a ec2

01:39:04.010 --> 01:39:06.370
instance that makes sense because this directly goes down

01:39:06.370 --> 01:39:09.090
but different csid application for the different servers yes

01:39:09.090 --> 01:39:14.250
exactly same thing thank you thank you yeah and anyhow we

01:39:14.250 --> 01:39:17.090
have written up like uh you know uh we have already

01:39:17.090 --> 01:39:20.110
mentioned our actions right that when something will come to

01:39:20.110 --> 01:39:22.970
main similarly when something will come to dev branch when

01:39:22.970 --> 01:39:26.270
something will come to uat branch in that way you can try to

01:39:26.270 --> 01:39:29.730
we need to customize the csd data okay exactly exactly yeah

01:39:29.730 --> 01:39:34.850
yeah okay so yeah question uh ram what is your question let

01:39:34.850 --> 01:39:38.150
me can you please allow me the screen i need to show some

01:39:38.150 --> 01:39:42.750
error ramesh right yeah ramesh okay ramesh go ahead ram what

01:39:42.750 --> 01:39:44.310
is your question yeah

01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:52.090
don't have any question okay well

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:05.720
i have added to the security group uh still we we have an

01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:09.900
issue uh show me your security group have you added 8 000

01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:16.280
port number yeah 8 000 custom tcp tcp is done and uh show me

01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:17.620
your github yeah

01:40:24.340 --> 01:40:29.220
yeah deployment done okay it looks like okay so everything

01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:34.920
is successful uh okay uh go back go back to your ec2

01:40:37.870 --> 01:40:41.910
it's the same instance right the same instance refresh

01:40:41.910 --> 01:40:48.870
refresh once you're not not this one your url okay yeah

01:41:00.980 --> 01:41:07.570
no this is fine request remote give me remote control yeah

01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:16.000
just just give me control okay

01:41:53.170 --> 01:41:58.350
it's working it's working okay thank you yeah and uh and one

01:41:58.350 --> 01:42:01.870
more thing if we don't pass the port number why we are

01:42:01.870 --> 01:42:06.290
getting an error because inside your code if you will go and

01:42:06.290 --> 01:42:09.350
check so we have mentioned basically a port number you click

01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:12.190
on and then run on this particular port number okay

01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:17.190
otherwise it's not allowed anything are we not able to see

01:42:17.190 --> 01:42:20.790
any uh we've gotten this error without port no so how you

01:42:20.790 --> 01:42:23.670
will be able to uh get it basically so because in your

01:42:23.670 --> 01:42:26.210
inside your application itself you have mentioned the port

01:42:26.210 --> 01:42:28.810
number so just you can go into our main.pi file you can

01:42:28.810 --> 01:42:30.930
check port number is mentioned over there as 8 000.

01:42:34.430 --> 01:42:40.790
uh one more thing in the yaml file uh so we have covered the

01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:44.430
predominantly to check the unit testing not just not this

01:42:44.430 --> 01:42:49.770
yaml file this is basically a docker data was available no

01:42:49.770 --> 01:42:55.490
sorry sir sorry for this this one yeah correct uh so it is

01:42:55.490 --> 01:42:58.890
deployed into the our github server correct this is just

01:42:58.890 --> 01:43:01.970
kind of the parameter file and what is the real execution

01:43:01.970 --> 01:43:05.870
how the values is passing where is executed this code which

01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:09.090
code where is this test code will be executed on a github so

01:43:09.090 --> 01:43:11.510
basically github is giving you a small machine that's the

01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:14.330
reason so they are going to charge you and by default so

01:43:14.330 --> 01:43:17.070
they are going to give you some github action for are free

01:43:17.070 --> 01:43:20.750
some there is a limitation on that so we as a tech team

01:43:20.750 --> 01:43:23.530
right so we used to pay a lot to a github for like using

01:43:23.530 --> 01:43:25.890
this github action but yeah so they are giving you some free

01:43:25.890 --> 01:43:28.050
that's the reason you are able to use it so this test is

01:43:28.050 --> 01:43:32.130
running on github server itself right and then deploy is

01:43:32.130 --> 01:43:36.410
running on your ec2 in in the github server and this is just

01:43:36.410 --> 01:43:39.710
kind of the parameter value right we need to have the some

01:43:39.710 --> 01:43:43.630
docker or something right yeah so it's a by default template

01:43:43.630 --> 01:43:47.070
that has been provided for this github actions and there are

01:43:47.070 --> 01:43:50.050
like so many such kind of templates you can try to get for

01:43:50.050 --> 01:43:53.190
like a different kind of applications i mean like this is

01:43:53.190 --> 01:43:54.970
this is the template basically by the way this is the

01:43:54.970 --> 01:43:56.610
template you can make any changes in this template

01:43:56.610 --> 01:43:59.890
accordingly it is going to behave very simple is it a

01:43:59.890 --> 01:44:03.150
background excel right we cannot see this yeah and also in

01:44:03.150 --> 01:44:06.870
the same url it is showing with zero zero dot we can't write

01:44:06.870 --> 01:44:09.610
in the github when we are performing the test basically

01:44:09.610 --> 01:44:13.590
local github local so inside a github also it's a machine

01:44:13.590 --> 01:44:17.550
right and something is running so that is a local to it

01:44:17.550 --> 01:44:21.390
where can we also check this ip it's possible basically it's

01:44:21.390 --> 01:44:26.230
a local i have already explained this this kind of a concept

01:44:26.230 --> 01:44:30.330
more than 100 or maybe 150 times inside your class it's a

01:44:30.330 --> 01:44:34.970
very basic logic so ec2 instance there is a machine there is

01:44:34.970 --> 01:44:38.110
a computer if something is running in that computer so for

01:44:38.110 --> 01:44:41.070
that computer reference it is going to be zero dot zero dot

01:44:41.070 --> 01:44:45.210
zero dot zero right local host even if it is running on ec2

01:44:45.210 --> 01:44:48.710
but for you as a user as you are a outside user trying to

01:44:48.710 --> 01:44:51.930
access that machine so you will be able to access with the

01:44:51.930 --> 01:44:55.330
help of some url some ip address right it's a fundamental

01:44:55.330 --> 01:44:58.270
which i have already explained more than like 100 times yeah

01:44:58.270 --> 01:45:01.930
you are correct you are correct so this is this is what it

01:45:01.930 --> 01:45:04.270
is showing you so when it is showing you and every time it

01:45:04.270 --> 01:45:07.070
shows right so when it is showing you zero zero zero eight

01:45:07.070 --> 01:45:10.330
thousand it simply means that local means ec2 is looking

01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:14.570
into ec2 okay got it got it you see but but when you are

01:45:14.570 --> 01:45:17.250
looking into when you are looking into ec2 then you need a

01:45:17.250 --> 01:45:24.290
url okay okay got it and and this is the different uh we

01:45:24.290 --> 01:45:27.390
have covered the yaml file right but is it possible to apply

01:45:27.390 --> 01:45:32.290
uh some ai uh things and some no validate the code whether

01:45:32.290 --> 01:45:35.110
the code is back or not oh obviously do we need to add the

01:45:35.110 --> 01:45:37.950
functionality additionally the yaml yes obviously if you

01:45:37.950 --> 01:45:40.130
have to add like something like that so obviously you have

01:45:40.130 --> 01:45:44.510
to add that functionality and you can do that. That is

01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:47.650
pretty much to cover right and once we apply this code

01:45:47.650 --> 01:45:51.790
right, it's a straight forward from the local to our local

01:45:51.790 --> 01:45:55.190
to GitHub, GitHub to GitHub action, GitHub action to your

01:45:55.190 --> 01:45:58.550
instance. Instance right but we have the different

01:45:58.550 --> 01:46:01.890
environment, another environment we can also create the

01:46:01.890 --> 01:46:04.710
similar copy. Yeah, we can create the similar copy in a dev

01:46:04.710 --> 01:46:07.770
environment, UAT environment and similarly so we can try to

01:46:07.770 --> 01:46:10.750
create a machine over there and then we can try to deploy.

01:46:11.210 --> 01:46:15.490
How can we make the connection after the dev, after this one

01:46:15.490 --> 01:46:19.470
and to the UAT or the production, once it is done, once it

01:46:19.470 --> 01:46:22.490
is done then it will be shorting that pipeline, how are we

01:46:22.490 --> 01:46:26.290
going to make the configuration in the GitHub or YAML or

01:46:26.290 --> 01:46:29.950
here, we need to set up. In a YAML, see in a YAML already

01:46:29.950 --> 01:46:33.430
mentioned the action part right, so when something going to

01:46:33.430 --> 01:46:37.690
main branch, then do this. So basically that we are going to

01:46:37.690 --> 01:46:41.850
keep it for a final production, let's suppose I have created

01:46:41.850 --> 01:46:44.810
another branch called as UAT, let's suppose I have created

01:46:44.810 --> 01:46:49.090
another branch called as dev right, so dev means basically

01:46:49.090 --> 01:46:51.510
it's for a development, so someone will be having access of

01:46:51.510 --> 01:46:54.270
dev environment, then similarly we can try to create a YAML

01:46:54.270 --> 01:46:58.110
file for a UAT right and then a production, production means

01:46:58.110 --> 01:47:01.630
a main branch. So we should add all the code in the same

01:47:01.630 --> 01:47:04.630
YAML file, then automatically it can. Separate YAML file,

01:47:04.690 --> 01:47:07.090
separate separate YAML file. One for dev, one for UAT, one

01:47:07.090 --> 01:47:10.230
for production. Then correct, but how can we make

01:47:10.230 --> 01:47:13.950
connection, once it is done, this is completed then. Go to

01:47:13.950 --> 01:47:17.170
YAML file. YAML will be automatically taken right,

01:47:17.270 --> 01:47:21.070
automatically taken. So basically once something is been

01:47:21.070 --> 01:47:24.770
approved inside a dev, then we can try to merge a code

01:47:24.770 --> 01:47:28.570
inside a UAT environment let's suppose and when testing is

01:47:28.570 --> 01:47:31.830
been done, then we are going to merge a code inside what,

01:47:31.930 --> 01:47:35.210
inside a main environment, so when we are going to merge a

01:47:35.210 --> 01:47:38.470
code. We are trying to push a code, we are doing a PR into a

01:47:38.470 --> 01:47:42.030
main environment, so when something will happen in main, we

01:47:42.030 --> 01:47:45.470
are considering that as a production environment. Yeah, yeah

01:47:45.470 --> 01:47:48.570
got it, but if there is any action in the particular branch

01:47:48.570 --> 01:47:51.030
of the repository automatically it will happen right, are

01:47:51.030 --> 01:47:54.670
you saying. Exactly, yeah, yeah. But generally in real time,

01:47:54.750 --> 01:47:57.170
do we maintain the separate repository for all each and

01:47:57.170 --> 01:48:00.290
every environment. We, in a real time we actually do it.

01:48:01.290 --> 01:48:04.450
Yeah, okay that is fine. So in a, in a actual environment.

01:48:04.450 --> 01:48:06.850
So obviously we go with three environment or maybe four

01:48:06.850 --> 01:48:09.830
environment, so one is going to be a dev, one is going to be

01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:12.690
a UAT, one is going to be a pre prod and one is going to be

01:48:12.690 --> 01:48:16.210
a prod or maybe like a three environment, so simple dev, UAT

01:48:16.210 --> 01:48:23.210
and prod. Okay, got it, thank you. Yeah, yeah. Rakesh Patil

01:48:23.210 --> 01:48:26.310
is saying sonar add karo, what do you mean by sonar add

01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:26.590
karo?

01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:34.400
Okay, so Akash go ahead, Rakesh Kumar Upadhyay, go ahead.

01:48:35.380 --> 01:48:39.460
Yeah, what is your question? Sir, I have one question, like

01:48:39.460 --> 01:48:45.080
you have added some scripting file, .sh file, so are they

01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:51.520
needed or it's just for. Okay, so that is for my test, so

01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:53.960
don't worry about that, script remove it, so it's basically

01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:56.840
to, for my reference, when I was trying to like run this or

01:48:56.840 --> 01:49:00.160
test this entire flow, so I have created for this to run in

01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:03.020
like a quickly, so that that's for my reference, not for

01:49:03.020 --> 01:49:07.740
you. And I think you followed this GitHub approach and like

01:49:07.740 --> 01:49:10.020
saved it. Similar thing can be done through Airflow, right?

01:49:10.140 --> 01:49:16.500
And at that place maybe we need this .sh file, right? Why we

01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:19.920
are using Airflow, why do we use Airflow by the way? Out of

01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:23.120
curiosity, I am asking this question. Yeah, so tell me out

01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:25.020
of curiosity. Because in my company like they are using

01:49:25.020 --> 01:49:29.300
Airflow and. Why, why, what is the purpose? No, no, no, why?

01:49:29.300 --> 01:49:33.820
For scheduling the actually run. Sorry? Scheduling the run.

01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:39.740
Exactly, scheduler is different. Okay. And this CICD is

01:49:39.740 --> 01:49:42.080
different. Okay. And scheduler, so Airflow basically helps

01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:45.180
you out in terms of doing a job scheduling. So, okay, fine.

01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:47.480
There is a file which is already productionized and then

01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:51.620
like whenever this time will come, so just try to rerun that

01:49:51.620 --> 01:49:54.160
particular file, you know, in a batch mode. This is

01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:57.140
something that we are trying to do for a production, like

01:49:57.140 --> 01:50:02.400
making any application live. So, so just one other question.

01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:08.580
So in GitHub action, we are doing the CICD and if we don't

01:50:08.580 --> 01:50:12.580
want to use GitHub action, and can we replace it with

01:50:12.580 --> 01:50:16.560
Airflow or? No. So Airflow is having all sort of different

01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:19.780
purposes. Airflow always try to help you out in terms of

01:50:19.780 --> 01:50:23.560
running a particular job. For example, so let's suppose

01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:26.540
someone is telling me that, that try to give me a sales

01:50:26.540 --> 01:50:30.660
report. So try to give me a sales report every morning 9 a

01:50:30.660 --> 01:50:33.660
.m. IST. Let's suppose that's a requirement. So I have

01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:36.800
written a Python script. So what that Python script does, so

01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:39.380
that Python script go to a database, try to pull all the

01:50:39.380 --> 01:50:42.900
data. Right. And then try to build a report and then try to

01:50:42.900 --> 01:50:46.180
store a report somewhere. My manager asked me that, okay,

01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:50.280
fine. So every morning 9 a.m. IST, I want that report in my

01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:52.820
mobile. So you have already written all those things in your

01:50:52.820 --> 01:50:56.080
Python file. Yeah. Already written. Now with the help of

01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:59.820
Airflow, you will be able to configure that Python file. So

01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:03.080
that Python file will run and whatever purpose that Python

01:51:03.080 --> 01:51:06.140
file serves, it will serve that particular purpose. So for

01:51:06.140 --> 01:51:09.540
that kind of operation, you can try to use a Airflow. Right.

01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:14.340
So here, why we are using a CI CD or why we are using

01:51:14.340 --> 01:51:17.360
basically a GitHub action. So let's suppose we have a

01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:19.900
website and trying to build a feature, for example, your own

01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:21.980
website. So obviously we keep on adding a lot of features

01:51:21.980 --> 01:51:25.380
over there. Right. We keep on like a releasing a not like a

01:51:25.380 --> 01:51:29.920
new, new things on your own website. So whenever we are, we

01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:32.500
have written a code, we have already tested a code. Then it

01:51:32.500 --> 01:51:35.200
should go to a production. It should be live to all of my

01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:38.800
users. In that case, the CI CD comes. So both is serving a

01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:42.180
different purposes. Airflow as a scheduler. And then the CI

01:51:42.180 --> 01:51:45.440
CD to make my whole application live permanently to all the

01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:50.260
audience. Okay. Okay. So if we are using like instead of

01:51:50.260 --> 01:51:54.080
GitHub action, we are using Azure DevOps, is it possible

01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:59.160
there also or? Everywhere. So GCP also and Azure also. So at

01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:01.640
the end of the day, everyone is giving you a machine. Right.

01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:05.520
And you will be able to create a similar kind of a flow even

01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:11.320
over there. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Next

01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:16.220
question, please. Yeah. Hi, sir. Good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Go

01:52:16.220 --> 01:52:21.520
ahead. Please. Yeah. I just wanted to ask that if suppose in

01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:25.440
in this flow CI CD, which we have implemented right now,

01:52:25.540 --> 01:52:29.420
within that is suppose we have a one another develop

01:52:29.420 --> 01:52:32.700
development environment, which is which is on prem

01:52:32.700 --> 01:52:37.560
environment. Hmm. Is it possible to go with the. Yeah. In

01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:41.960
GitHub repository like CI CD first, it goes to the

01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:44.780
development environment, then it goes to automatically see

01:52:44.780 --> 01:52:49.180
EC2 for the production. I just need a machine. EC2 is also a

01:52:49.180 --> 01:52:51.380
machine. So whether it's available in my local environment,

01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:54.480
I will be able to like use it or I will be able to call it

01:52:54.480 --> 01:52:58.880
with the help of localhost 127.0.0.1. If it is hosted on

01:52:58.880 --> 01:53:03.520
EC2, then there will be some IP address. Right. No, no. For

01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:06.680
me. The only thing which matters to create any such

01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:08.940
environment. Is a machine. That's it. If I'm able to access

01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:11.420
it, I can do it. Whether that machine is available in my

01:53:11.420 --> 01:53:13.460
local or in my cloud. That's my answer.

01:53:16.700 --> 01:53:22.540
Local. Okay. I mean, there is a machine EC2 is also a

01:53:22.540 --> 01:53:27.300
machine. But okay. Okay. You you are saying that if that is

01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:32.500
on the public IP. I mean, doesn't matter. Like IP address

01:53:32.500 --> 01:53:34.980
access of the machine. Let's let's think in that way access

01:53:34.980 --> 01:53:37.740
of the machine. So even if my machine is available in my

01:53:37.740 --> 01:53:40.540
local, I will go inside my YARG. I'll simply say that you

01:53:40.540 --> 01:53:42.860
have to check this machine. You have to do this. This

01:53:42.860 --> 01:53:45.420
funnel. You have to build it in this machine. This is what I

01:53:45.420 --> 01:53:46.780
have done. Right. That's the reason. So I'm trying to

01:53:46.780 --> 01:53:50.640
provide the EC2 host over there. So instead of EC2 host, I

01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:54.580
can try to provide host for local. So in that case, we need

01:53:54.580 --> 01:53:59.280
to set the credential for the local environment. If it is

01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:01.380
password secured, if it is not password secured, then the

01:54:01.380 --> 01:54:05.760
retreat will be able to access. So here we have maintained

01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:12.200
only one place now. I mean, credential. So in that in that

01:54:12.200 --> 01:54:17.740
we can create a add new variable for the development

01:54:17.740 --> 01:54:20.820
environment. Right. Yeah. And if you are trying to access it

01:54:20.820 --> 01:54:23.660
via GitHub, then your machine is supposed to be public. I

01:54:23.660 --> 01:54:25.940
mean, like internet should be able to access your machine.

01:54:26.060 --> 01:54:29.380
Otherwise, it is not. Right. That's my question. Actually,

01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:34.320
sir, I just wanted to go via GitHub. Sir, I think since we

01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:37.080
have been taking classes since 4 months. Right. We have made

01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:41.140
so many APIs. Okay. I mean, where is the logical question in

01:54:41.140 --> 01:54:44.040
this? You tell me yourself. That you are hitting the local

01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:46.340
machine through GitHub without making a local machine

01:54:46.340 --> 01:54:52.220
public. No, no. Public. No, we have made it public, sir. In

01:54:52.220 --> 01:54:55.200
the case of public. Local machine. You are talking about the

01:54:55.200 --> 01:54:57.940
local machine to access GitHub. So first of all, the local

01:54:57.940 --> 01:55:01.520
machine will also have to go to the internet, right? Yes. So

01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:05.180
I am saying the same, sir, that we have made it public. I

01:55:05.180 --> 01:55:08.180
mean, a public machine. So you are saying that the local

01:55:08.180 --> 01:55:12.180
machine will be a public machine and its credentials will be

01:55:12.180 --> 01:55:15.760
provided to us in GitHub. It is not supposed to be a

01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:20.300
credential. I mean, it is simple. So it is not necessary

01:55:20.300 --> 01:55:22.000
that everything is traded on the password, right? Correct.

01:55:22.260 --> 01:55:26.400
So we can access our system from outside through IP, through

01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:31.620
internet. That is how it is. We did this through ngrog. Yes.

01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:34.740
Yes. So I was going to ask the same thing, sir. What do you

01:55:34.740 --> 01:55:36.920
mean? I mean, what do you mean? We will first associate it

01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:42.360
with Git so that it can be tested and deployed on our

01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:45.140
development side through CI and CD. And then when it passes

01:55:45.140 --> 01:55:50.460
from there, it will go to our EC2. Yes, it will happen. Do

01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:54.540
it once. Okay, okay. It is a machine, it is public, it is

01:55:54.540 --> 01:55:57.720
private, there is no difference. And people ask more

01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:01.720
questions, they do less, that is a problem. Okay, if you had

01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:04.360
done it before, then this question would not have come. We

01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:08.540
did this through ng-rog, we exposed what was going on in my

01:56:08.540 --> 01:56:13.800
local on the internet. This is what we do. Obviously, you

01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:16.020
just have to make your machine public so that GitHub will be

01:56:16.020 --> 01:56:19.440
able to access. Now if GitHub is able to access it, then you

01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:21.640
can do anything that you want. So your machine will behave

01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:25.160
like an EC2 instance. Correct. And one more question, sir.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:30.400
You just talked about Jenkins, so what is the replacement

01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:37.840
for this YAML file? Zenit. No, it is a service basically, we

01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:41.240
will talk about that later. Okay. Okay. Yeah,

01:56:45.080 --> 01:56:50.320
go ahead, next question. Hello, I have one doubt. We see one

01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:56.420
project before, right, the MCP. Using MCP, we connect with

01:56:56.420 --> 01:57:02.520
PostgreSQL, Google Sheet, everything. Now we created the

01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:06.520
standard approach to connect with the MCP. It was working

01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:09.040
fine. So for example, I need to connect with different

01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:13.960
database like Oracle, anything. For that, I need to create

01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:18.620
separate MCP, right? When you create the MCP, it will be the

01:57:18.620 --> 01:57:25.460
structure and create SQL, execute SQL tool. It will be

01:57:25.460 --> 01:57:31.440
changed or I think it will be short change, right? Can you

01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:36.120
please repeat your question once again? Yeah. So we create

01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:41.680
the SQL, the MCP project before. In that one, we connect

01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:47.460
with the PostgreSQL. Instead of PostgreSQL, I try to connect

01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:55.160
with the Oracle Autonomous DB. This is for try to learn with

01:57:55.160 --> 01:58:03.380
the real database. So when you connect with the MCP, I get

01:58:03.380 --> 01:58:03.820
issues.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:15.560
So basically, do we need to create tools newly for that,

01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:18.800
right? Obviously, yes, because you are trying to connect

01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:21.300
with the different databases. So for that, like obviously

01:58:21.300 --> 01:58:23.740
inside your tool or inside your MCP server that you're

01:58:23.740 --> 01:58:25.740
trying to create, you have to write a code so that it will

01:58:25.740 --> 01:58:28.000
be able to connect. So connection string, you have to write

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:31.060
over here. Yeah, connection string happen. Connection

01:58:31.060 --> 01:58:35.140
string, I connect with the Oracle. It's connecting. Okay. So

01:58:35.140 --> 01:58:38.520
I connect with the MCP with the different tools. I am facing

01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:43.720
the issues. So is there any standard way available for

01:58:43.720 --> 01:58:47.840
Oracle or I need to... Just a connection. I think if you

01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:51.500
just tested with the local like a Python code, if you're

01:58:51.500 --> 01:58:54.380
able to like access your Oracle with the local Python, like

01:58:54.380 --> 01:58:57.800
simple Python code, then even MCP should work in a similar

01:58:57.800 --> 01:59:01.980
manner. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let me check that one. Yeah. Yeah.

01:59:01.980 --> 01:59:04.140
Yeah. It is working in a simple Python. If you're able to

01:59:04.140 --> 01:59:07.040
hit your Oracle database, it will work because MCP is

01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:10.080
nothing but we are just exposing, right? It's just at the

01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:12.040
rate and then we are trying to expose it. So basically it

01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:14.600
will be a part of MCP protocol. That's it. The rest of the

01:59:14.600 --> 01:59:17.300
part is actually a Python code. So which go to your database

01:59:17.300 --> 01:59:20.900
connector and bring the data. That's it. Which is like a MCP

01:59:20.900 --> 01:59:24.060
does it with the help of like a NLP, NL basically, natural

01:59:24.060 --> 01:59:29.280
language. Okay. Okay. Fine. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Okay.

01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:35.330
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That means go ahead. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:59:36.030 --> 01:59:42.230
Regarding the test cases in my project, we have one API

01:59:42.230 --> 01:59:46.210
related project. We are extracting the data from the YouTube

01:59:46.210 --> 01:59:49.750
or something, right? The social media data, we are

01:59:49.750 --> 01:59:52.790
responding the data on the store into the structure for

01:59:52.790 --> 01:59:59.450
meter in our Delta, like in our storage layer. Mm. Mm. In

01:59:59.450 --> 02:00:02.770
between, what are the scenarios to cover the test case

02:00:02.770 --> 02:00:06.530
perspective in the CACD pipeline, the normal test cases?

02:00:07.070 --> 02:00:10.550
See, test case always depends upon the application that you

02:00:10.550 --> 02:00:12.650
are building and the function that you have written. So,

02:00:12.690 --> 02:00:15.450
function wise, we try to write the test cases. So, if I have

02:00:15.450 --> 02:00:17.230
written 10 functions and every function is doing a different

02:00:17.230 --> 02:00:19.450
kind of things, write a test case with respect to that

02:00:19.450 --> 02:00:23.270
function. No, so function mean it is a business function or

02:00:23.270 --> 02:00:26.310
just for the coding related? Functions, functions,

02:00:26.510 --> 02:00:28.670
functions, basically. Oh, functionality test case,

02:00:28.810 --> 02:00:31.590
requirement. Yeah, so function you have to test it, right?

02:00:31.630 --> 02:00:34.910
What you will test apart from functions? No, for example, if

02:00:34.910 --> 02:00:39.030
we get the API URL, right, whether it's getting a response

02:00:39.030 --> 02:00:44.610
properly or not, then did we properly to cover the standard

02:00:44.610 --> 02:00:48.050
in the code? So, do we need to also cover the... For that,

02:00:48.050 --> 02:00:51.930
so we don't write a test cases. For that, basically, you are

02:00:51.930 --> 02:00:54.570
going to use maybe some sort of like a tool. For example,

02:00:54.630 --> 02:00:57.170
there is a tool called as AI based tool called as Code

02:00:57.170 --> 02:00:59.870
Rabbit. Right, so you can try to use a Code Rabbit, so which

02:00:59.870 --> 02:01:02.170
is going to highlight the standardization of your code. It

02:01:02.170 --> 02:01:04.890
is going to even suggest to you that if you have any kind,

02:01:04.950 --> 02:01:07.690
if you have made any kind of a mistake, that we use it for

02:01:07.690 --> 02:01:10.330
like many clients. So, we try to develop a code and even

02:01:10.330 --> 02:01:14.930
internally, our team write a lot of codes, right, to develop

02:01:14.930 --> 02:01:16.710
this entire thing. We are developing even SAS, we are

02:01:16.710 --> 02:01:21.270
developing even something called as basically AI generator.

02:01:21.550 --> 02:01:24.310
So, Loveable, basically, better than Loveable, we are trying

02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:27.410
to create internally in-house. So, over there, we have... We

02:01:27.410 --> 02:01:29.750
have to do a lot of like a code check. We have to do a lot

02:01:29.750 --> 02:01:32.910
of like a... We have to basically do a lot of code

02:01:32.910 --> 02:01:35.950
sanitization, by the way, so that our code will be a

02:01:35.950 --> 02:01:38.910
standardized. So, for that, we are using Code Rabbit. Yeah,

02:01:38.910 --> 02:01:41.270
right. But do we need to attach the Code Rabbit in our

02:01:41.270 --> 02:01:46.810
pipeline, right? In the AML? Yes. No, no, no, no, no. My

02:01:46.810 --> 02:01:48.790
question, no, no, no. Then why I am asking the question,

02:01:48.990 --> 02:01:52.730
because we have developed our code within the organization,

02:01:53.050 --> 02:01:57.250
but does it allow to read the Code Rabbit? How it is a

02:01:57.250 --> 02:02:02.230
secure? It can also possible to, you know, gather our

02:02:02.230 --> 02:02:05.290
information. Yeah. Yeah. But in this case, how can we

02:02:05.290 --> 02:02:09.050
control the security point of view, then? With security

02:02:09.050 --> 02:02:13.010
pipeline? Security or not? No, no, Code Rabbit, I am going

02:02:13.010 --> 02:02:15.850
to allowing to read our code and to make some

02:02:15.850 --> 02:02:20.430
recommendation. But in any case, how can we handle the

02:02:20.430 --> 02:02:23.830
secure way to... Which is secure way? Infra side or code

02:02:23.830 --> 02:02:27.370
side? Infra side or like the application side? Application

02:02:27.370 --> 02:02:30.010
side. Application side and Infra side, both, I am asking. So

02:02:30.010 --> 02:02:34.950
basically... Infra side. In the Infra side, can we also add

02:02:34.950 --> 02:02:37.810
some classic pipeline to check some... Infra side is already

02:02:37.810 --> 02:02:40.130
handled. So if you are deploying something on AWS and if you

02:02:40.130 --> 02:02:43.090
are trying to use maybe a Cloudflare, right? So by default,

02:02:43.170 --> 02:02:46.310
all your DDoS attack or all those like attacks it is going

02:02:46.310 --> 02:02:48.770
to prevent. And even like a browser. So your browser like a

02:02:48.770 --> 02:02:51.090
Google Chrome or any other browser nowadays if you are

02:02:51.090 --> 02:02:55.770
using. So even they try to like prevent a lot. So 99% time

02:02:55.770 --> 02:02:58.430
you are already secured, you can say. If you have used a

02:02:58.430 --> 02:03:01.730
CloudFront, right? So which is nothing but a CDN. So which

02:03:01.730 --> 02:03:04.310
is going to like secure your Infra and it is not going to

02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:06.510
allow the hit. And even some part of the application.

02:03:06.690 --> 02:03:09.850
Application side. So obviously you have to check if your

02:03:09.850 --> 02:03:12.250
code is not having any kind of vulnerability. And whenever

02:03:12.250 --> 02:03:15.050
you are trying to do some sort of a data movement from one

02:03:15.050 --> 02:03:17.870
place to other place, always keep it in an encrypted format.

02:03:19.110 --> 02:03:22.050
So we have to apply some encrypted format. Obviously, yeah.

02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:27.810
How blindly to allow the... This process... For application.

02:03:28.410 --> 02:03:31.430
So... Read their documentation. Yeah, read their

02:03:31.430 --> 02:03:34.750
documentation. So what they are like providing you every AI

02:03:34.750 --> 02:03:37.650
platform try to provide you enable disable option. So

02:03:37.650 --> 02:03:39.770
whatever you will enable, it will go to them. Whatever you

02:03:39.770 --> 02:03:42.110
will disable, it will not go to them. As you can also

02:03:42.110 --> 02:03:45.530
control, right? We can also control it. Got real options

02:03:45.530 --> 02:03:51.190
over there. We can. Yeah. Okay. And one more final question,

02:03:51.330 --> 02:03:56.510
Sudhanshu. This part, I think the documentation part, right?

02:03:56.530 --> 02:03:59.010
We have the... A lot of documentation from our organization.

02:03:59.350 --> 02:04:04.550
I need to make it on jackpot to get the details, right? So

02:04:04.550 --> 02:04:08.090
that's why I'm also pointing the same areas. How can we

02:04:08.090 --> 02:04:13.110
handle the secure things? So can I install the model in my

02:04:13.110 --> 02:04:18.230
local system or can we allow to access the... AI service, a

02:04:18.230 --> 02:04:20.890
bidrack or something as you suggested, right? That depends

02:04:20.890 --> 02:04:23.790
upon your client requirements. So if your client is saying

02:04:23.790 --> 02:04:26.330
that, no, you have to use everything in local. I mean,

02:04:26.350 --> 02:04:28.990
like... Data should not go to some other server, then you

02:04:28.990 --> 02:04:31.910
can't use it. If your client is allowing it, then go and use

02:04:31.910 --> 02:04:35.070
our best model. That would be my suggestion. Okay. I think

02:04:35.070 --> 02:04:38.290
if we allow for the external API, definitely the data is

02:04:38.290 --> 02:04:41.470
possible to expose, right? But if it is in the... Like I

02:04:41.470 --> 02:04:45.050
said, every AI gives you allow and disallow permission

02:04:45.050 --> 02:04:49.050
nowadays, right? Including Gemini, including a chat GPT,

02:04:49.130 --> 02:04:53.010
everyone. And you will be able to configure that, that,

02:04:53.070 --> 02:04:56.350
okay. So they should not use my data or use my data. And you

02:04:56.350 --> 02:05:01.070
should have to trust. Got it. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Okay.

02:05:01.710 --> 02:05:04.890
So fine, everyone. So hope all of us are able to learn CICD.

02:05:04.930 --> 02:05:07.150
Now in my next class, which is going to be tomorrow. So we

02:05:07.150 --> 02:05:11.070
are going to start a project. I'm not expecting that I'm

02:05:11.070 --> 02:05:14.990
going to explain like, you know, everything line by line,

02:05:15.010 --> 02:05:17.570
because we have already discussed a lot in last four months

02:05:17.570 --> 02:05:19.770
of time. And I believe we all are able to learn. I'm

02:05:19.770 --> 02:05:23.090
assuming that you all have learned a lot. So yeah, let's

02:05:23.090 --> 02:05:25.310
start with the project. And again, inside a project. So

02:05:25.310 --> 02:05:26.710
we'll try... We'll try to use the same kind of pipeline,

02:05:26.890 --> 02:05:32.990
CICD and different, different kind of environment. So, and

02:05:32.990 --> 02:05:37.770
one more thing. So try to build something. If you're not

02:05:37.770 --> 02:05:39.890
building, if you're just like, you know, learning and then

02:05:39.890 --> 02:05:42.290
asking question, that is not going to solve a real problem.

02:05:42.810 --> 02:05:45.690
Very soon, you will not be able to remember anything. But if

02:05:45.690 --> 02:05:48.030
you are building something, obviously, you all will be able

02:05:48.030 --> 02:05:52.410
to remember, right? And yeah, so as we all know that how

02:05:52.410 --> 02:05:56.950
this entire tech industry is changing, right? So people are

02:05:56.950 --> 02:05:59.310
going to give you a priority. People are going to onboard

02:05:59.310 --> 02:06:02.230
you. If you have built something in a today's environment,

02:06:02.370 --> 02:06:05.490
if you'll just go and say that I know X, Y, G things, it is

02:06:05.490 --> 02:06:07.670
having no values. Believe me, it is not having any kind of

02:06:07.670 --> 02:06:11.430
values. No one is going to give you an opportunity. If you

02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:13.930
just go and say that I'm a good learner, I'm a fast learner.

02:06:14.290 --> 02:06:18.930
Believe me, these words are gone. Those days are gone. You

02:06:18.930 --> 02:06:22.710
can go and ask to anyone inside an industry. It has

02:06:22.710 --> 02:06:25.990
literally changed and it's changing. It's changing faster

02:06:25.990 --> 02:06:29.770
than ever. Believe me, it is changing faster than ever. Most

02:06:29.770 --> 02:06:32.510
of us are able to experience it. Personally, if you'll come

02:06:32.510 --> 02:06:36.130
to me and ask these questions. So yeah, I have a firsthand

02:06:36.130 --> 02:06:38.150
experience. I'm connecting with a lot of people on a daily

02:06:38.150 --> 02:06:41.730
basis, right? So I always advise if you have to keep

02:06:41.730 --> 02:06:45.670
yourself relevant, don't try to invest much on learning

02:06:45.670 --> 02:06:49.270
because learning is having no limit. And the learning that

02:06:49.270 --> 02:06:53.690
you say is actually not a learning from my perspective. And

02:06:53.690 --> 02:06:55.550
I believe I have already mentioned that. You know, very,

02:06:55.650 --> 02:06:57.630
very first class. And I keep on mentioning these things

02:06:57.630 --> 02:07:01.910
regularly to all of you that because you are not supposed to

02:07:01.910 --> 02:07:04.210
give an exam, right? You are not preparing for an exam. You

02:07:04.210 --> 02:07:07.370
are preparing for something where you will go and you will

02:07:07.370 --> 02:07:10.330
build an application. And now with the help of AI, with the

02:07:10.330 --> 02:07:13.910
help of vibe coding, basically it's pretty much possible to

02:07:13.910 --> 02:07:17.950
build an industry grade application right in a bare minimum

02:07:17.950 --> 02:07:20.710
time. But again, it's not like AI will be able to do

02:07:20.710 --> 02:07:23.030
everything. It depends upon your creativity, how you are

02:07:23.030 --> 02:07:25.910
able to break down the problem, right? How you are trying to

02:07:25.910 --> 02:07:28.130
give instruction to an AI, the way you try to give

02:07:28.130 --> 02:07:31.550
instruction to your junior or to anyone in your team. So try

02:07:31.550 --> 02:07:35.210
to adopt that approach. Try to adopt a builder's approach.

02:07:35.790 --> 02:07:38.990
Then only you will be able to succeed if you will just keep

02:07:38.990 --> 02:07:42.750
on learning through some YouTube videos or maybe even via my

02:07:42.750 --> 02:07:48.090
lectures, right? It is not sufficient and you will not be

02:07:48.090 --> 02:07:52.070
relevant inside the industry. Industry has literally changed

02:07:52.070 --> 02:07:55.330
in last couple of years. And. And. And like I said, it is

02:07:55.330 --> 02:08:00.530
changing faster than ever, yeah? So just work. That's the

02:08:00.530 --> 02:08:03.970
only option that you have, right? And believe me, when you

02:08:03.970 --> 02:08:06.810
will work, when you will see something is working, you will

02:08:06.810 --> 02:08:10.690
literally enjoy, right? You will literally enjoy. But yeah,

02:08:10.750 --> 02:08:14.090
you have to sit and you have to work. So that's a correct

02:08:14.090 --> 02:08:16.610
way of learning. If you're not preparing for UPS, your IIT

02:08:16.610 --> 02:08:18.970
or NEET, if you're preparing for that kind of exam, then

02:08:18.970 --> 02:08:21.610
obviously you have to, you know, sit and solve the problem,

02:08:21.690 --> 02:08:25.090
take a notes and you will go through. Those like approach.

02:08:25.330 --> 02:08:27.790
So approach for that learning, those exams are different

02:08:27.790 --> 02:08:31.890
approach for upskilling should be different, right? It

02:08:31.890 --> 02:08:35.890
should be completely practical driven by building something,

02:08:36.190 --> 02:08:39.510
not just by, you know, like going through a code or

02:08:39.510 --> 02:08:43.290
something like a line by line. So with that guys, hope you

02:08:43.290 --> 02:08:45.530
will keep these things in your mind and you will try to

02:08:45.530 --> 02:08:50.170
implement it in your life from today. Those who are already

02:08:50.170 --> 02:08:53.830
doing it. So you are in a correct path. Obviously you will

02:08:53.830 --> 02:08:57.170
be able to succeed. Those who are not doing it, try to adopt

02:08:57.170 --> 02:09:03.010
as soon as possible. Yeah. So fine. Uh, they would one, uh,

02:09:03.050 --> 02:09:06.010
our work or our communication, they would give preference to

02:09:06.010 --> 02:09:08.390
communication, communication people, even though tech people

02:09:08.390 --> 02:09:12.990
is under working with them, not visibility. I mean, see your

02:09:12.990 --> 02:09:16.150
communication always matters. If you are a good auditor, if

02:09:16.150 --> 02:09:19.190
you are a good speaker, if you are a good communicator,

02:09:19.250 --> 02:09:24.070
obviously it gives you a lot of advantage. Right? All the

02:09:24.070 --> 02:09:27.530
time, right? Even a hundred year back, 200 year backs. So

02:09:27.530 --> 02:09:31.550
like, uh, this was having a values and even in next hundred

02:09:31.550 --> 02:09:34.490
year, it will be having a values. Doesn't matter whether you

02:09:34.490 --> 02:09:37.650
belong from a tech industry or from some other industry. So

02:09:37.650 --> 02:09:41.610
Oration will always be having, uh, its own charm, its own

02:09:41.610 --> 02:09:47.050
values, right? But as you are a part of tech industry, you

02:09:47.050 --> 02:09:50.190
should know how to build. Also you should know how to

02:09:50.190 --> 02:09:54.450
explain to someone. Okay. If you're not able to do it, then

02:09:54.450 --> 02:09:58.770
again, people will not give you a chance. Believe me. Right?

02:09:59.010 --> 02:10:02.090
And industry is literally changing. Industry has actually

02:10:02.090 --> 02:10:05.270
changed. It's not the same industry that we are able to see.

02:10:05.410 --> 02:10:08.510
We were able to experience, we were able to see just two or

02:10:08.510 --> 02:10:12.670
three year back. Right? So try to adopt that change as soon

02:10:12.670 --> 02:10:15.510
as possible. It will be painful maybe for a couple of

02:10:15.510 --> 02:10:19.050
months, right? Anything is going to happen overnight. But

02:10:19.050 --> 02:10:22.470
believe me, that is something which will make your. Make you

02:10:22.470 --> 02:10:25.490
relevant inside the industry, right? If you would like to

02:10:25.490 --> 02:10:29.070
survive inside industry for a very, very long time, uh, even

02:10:29.070 --> 02:10:31.510
I'll suggest you. So try to do something on your own. At

02:10:31.510 --> 02:10:34.390
least try to launch some product, some startup. Maybe you

02:10:34.390 --> 02:10:36.810
can try that out, out of your, like a free available time,

02:10:36.930 --> 02:10:40.890
right? So that you will be able to build a extra income

02:10:40.890 --> 02:10:43.910
source or maybe a parallel income source. Because believe me

02:10:43.910 --> 02:10:46.730
nowadays, even that part is important. It's very, very

02:10:46.730 --> 02:10:48.830
important. You never know when you will get fired yesterday

02:10:48.830 --> 02:10:52.070
itself. You must have heard about the news. Right? Verizon

02:10:52.070 --> 02:10:54.210
was fired. Verizon, which is one of the biggest

02:10:54.210 --> 02:10:57.890
telecommunication company in USA. Right? Even I was a part

02:10:57.890 --> 02:10:59.610
of Verizon. That's the reason. So I'm able to get a news.

02:10:59.830 --> 02:11:03.390
Uh, so I have worked in Verizon. Verizon lab. So there was a

02:11:03.390 --> 02:11:05.490
lab division. There was a research division and we were

02:11:05.490 --> 02:11:08.150
like, uh, doing a lot of research and a lot of works in a

02:11:08.150 --> 02:11:10.750
fleet matrix. Uh, we were using data science and big data

02:11:10.750 --> 02:11:14.130
over there at that point of a time, uh, in year somewhere

02:11:14.130 --> 02:11:17.450
around 17, 18. Right? Maybe you can check my LinkedIn. You

02:11:17.450 --> 02:11:20.870
will be able to get the exact year. Right? As a part of that

02:11:20.870 --> 02:11:23.870
lab. And, uh, yeah. So yesterday itself they have fired like

02:11:23.870 --> 02:11:28.630
a 13,000 people, 13% of the workforce. Yeah. Yeah. Somebody

02:11:28.630 --> 02:11:30.830
has mentioned 30,000 employees were fired. Exactly. Even

02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:33.910
from India division. Right? So I, I knew the manager. So who

02:11:33.910 --> 02:11:37.630
was there since last, I think a 15 year in the same, uh,

02:11:37.810 --> 02:11:43.870
like a division got fired. Right? So you, you never know,

02:11:43.930 --> 02:11:46.170
like when you will go to office tomorrow and then what will

02:11:46.170 --> 02:11:48.750
happen? Because this is how the entire world is changing.

02:11:48.750 --> 02:11:51.210
Whatsoever is the reason. So people, some people say

02:11:51.210 --> 02:11:55.730
optimization, uh, some people say AI, uh, many, many

02:11:55.730 --> 02:11:59.330
explanation or, you know, uh, like, uh, different, different

02:11:59.330 --> 02:12:01.730
kind of a definition and different, different kind of, uh,

02:12:01.970 --> 02:12:05.010
uh, uh, argument you will be able to find out. The reality

02:12:05.010 --> 02:12:08.810
is this is how industry is nowadays. Right? You have to

02:12:08.810 --> 02:12:11.730
accept it. You have to adopt it. And yeah. So just if

02:12:11.730 --> 02:12:13.930
you're, if you're keeping yourself relevant, if you have

02:12:13.930 --> 02:12:16.910
enough network and as you grow inside the industry, let's

02:12:16.910 --> 02:12:20.550
suppose you have 15, 20 year of experience. Right? 15, 20

02:12:20.550 --> 02:12:24.490
year of experience in that case, your network. And when I

02:12:24.490 --> 02:12:27.450
say network, I'm talking about a valuable network, right?

02:12:27.550 --> 02:12:29.770
I'm not just talking about a connection with the people

02:12:29.770 --> 02:12:33.630
because that we all have a lot, right? A valuable network,

02:12:33.990 --> 02:12:37.370
right? With a person who can come for you, who can rescue

02:12:37.370 --> 02:12:41.250
you when you will be like when, when you need it, right? I'm

02:12:41.250 --> 02:12:43.250
talking about that kind of a connection and that happens

02:12:43.250 --> 02:12:46.570
over the year, right? It's not going to happen immediately

02:12:46.570 --> 02:12:49.410
or instantly. You can't go and ask for help. And people will

02:12:49.410 --> 02:12:51.510
be willing to help you out. No, that is not going to happen.

02:12:51.610 --> 02:12:54.370
Not, there's not the, this is not how world works actually,

02:12:54.490 --> 02:12:59.390
right? So try to build a network because when your year of

02:12:59.390 --> 02:13:03.430
experience will increase 15, 20 a year or 15 year and

02:13:03.430 --> 02:13:06.350
beyond, right? You will not be able to find out much

02:13:06.350 --> 02:13:09.530
opportunity on LinkedIn, Knockery, monster or times now or

02:13:09.530 --> 02:13:14.650
Heidi or any other job platform. It is your network who is

02:13:14.650 --> 02:13:18.250
going to bring an opportunity. Even at that point of a time.

02:13:18.250 --> 02:13:21.930
When you have like a 15, 20 year of experience, your stack

02:13:21.930 --> 02:13:24.550
doesn't matter. So I mean like, uh, what you know, what you

02:13:24.550 --> 02:13:27.570
don't know, doesn't matter as much. Believe me, doesn't

02:13:27.570 --> 02:13:32.530
matter, right? Your network is the only thing which matters

02:13:32.530 --> 02:13:36.250
and that we all use this to build over the year, right? So

02:13:36.250 --> 02:13:38.290
that I can go and I can ask someone that, okay, can you

02:13:38.290 --> 02:13:40.530
please help me out? Maybe I'm looking for an opportunity.

02:13:41.170 --> 02:13:43.990
Uh, when, when you, even when you're going to like, I know I

02:13:43.990 --> 02:13:46.430
start some business, so maybe you can go and ask your

02:13:46.430 --> 02:13:49.610
network that. Can you do a seed funding of maybe one car or

02:13:49.610 --> 02:13:52.130
two car or inside my business? I think that will be a good

02:13:52.130 --> 02:13:55.150
start. Right? So a lot of things network you can, you will

02:13:55.150 --> 02:13:57.650
be able to leverage in lot of like a different, different

02:13:57.650 --> 02:14:02.930
manner, right? If you are honest from inside, uh, so, uh,

02:14:03.010 --> 02:14:05.870
yeah. So try to like, uh, you know, uh, even explore that

02:14:05.870 --> 02:14:11.610
particular part, right. But uh, be ready for coming years

02:14:11.610 --> 02:14:15.230
because believe me, uh, coming years are not going to be

02:14:15.230 --> 02:14:18.870
same. The way we had this entire, and it's, I'm not just

02:14:18.870 --> 02:14:21.470
trying, I'm not trying to scare you by the way, but yeah,

02:14:21.490 --> 02:14:23.970
maybe you can go and talk to a couple of people, right. And

02:14:23.970 --> 02:14:27.350
you will be able to get a same sense, believe me. So it's

02:14:27.350 --> 02:14:32.430
just like, uh, a thought that I wanted to give you so that

02:14:32.430 --> 02:14:35.830
maybe you can try to, you know, adopt it and then you will

02:14:35.830 --> 02:14:40.430
be ready for tomorrow. Yeah. So fine. That's it guys. I

02:14:40.430 --> 02:14:43.070
think, uh, that was enough of motivation or maybe

02:14:43.070 --> 02:14:44.950
demotivation. I don't know. I don't know how you are going

02:14:44.950 --> 02:14:50.110
to like, uh, pursue it, but yeah, uh, reality is reality and

02:14:50.110 --> 02:14:52.890
as a mentor. So obviously I have to talk about the reality.

02:14:53.390 --> 02:14:56.510
Right. Uh, so with that, thank you so much, everyone take

02:14:56.510 --> 02:15:00.150
care. See you again tomorrow. Same time. I hope all of you

02:15:00.150 --> 02:15:02.890
have enjoyed today's class. Can I see some comments inside a

02:15:02.890 --> 02:15:08.010
comment box? Yeah. Okay. Fine. Thank you everyone.
