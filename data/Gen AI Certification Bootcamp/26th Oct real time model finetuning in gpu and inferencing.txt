WEBVTT

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.300
yeah okay so what is the agenda for today's class guys any

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.120
idea i think i think we have talked about it like a study

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.260
itself right so any idea what is the agenda for today's

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.700
class mcp

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.600
mcp mcp okay so maybe you have not joined today's class till

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.700
last i believe

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.100
so there was a demand from a people that we are able to do a

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.480
training training or fine tuning of the model in a local

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.420
system now how we can do the same kind of a training inside

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.600
a gpu and how we will be able to do a inferencing inside a

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.080
gpu so that was a demand that i have received from your

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.560
batch and keeping that in our mind so that is something that

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.400
we are going to discuss today and it is going to be a very

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.640
very exciting because this is something that you are going

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.480
to do even in your company and if you are going to do a fine

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.500
tuning in your company so obviously you are supposed to

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.940
follow the exact same script that we are going to execute

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.600
today yeah so that is going to be the agenda of my today's

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.660
class and then in next class onwards obviously mcp we are

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.020
going to discuss then we have a a2a agent to agent protocol

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.740
that is something that will come into a picture so let's try

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.700
to understand that how we can do a fine tuning of a model

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.660
inside a gpu end-to-end setup everything in a detailed way

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.380
yep so that is something that we are going to discuss shall

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.400
we start guys everyone yeah

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.150
okay so fine tuning of a model inside a gpu end-to-end setup

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.670
everything in a detailed way yep so that is fine let's start

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.610
so let me share my screen i believe my screen is visible to

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.190
all of you and what we are going to do so first of all we

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.730
are going to prepare our machine that is a very first

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.910
requirement and once our machine is going to be ready then

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.250
we can go ahead with the deployment or we can go ahead with

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.390
the fine tuning or like whatever whatever is required right

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.490
so first of all machine is supposed to be ready in my system

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.310
so here we are going to use a same machine a hyper stack i

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.150
believe we have already done that so let's start so let's

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.150
start with the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.050
virtual machine and i believe this is third or fourth time

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.550
we are doing it right so just go to a virtual machine and

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.810
deploy a new virtual machine and then from here so you can

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.150
try to choose a virtual machine and then from here so you

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.150
can try to choose a virtual machine and then from here so

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.150
you can try to choose a virtual machine and then from here

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.570
so you can try to choose a virtual machine so i'm going to

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.070
choose h100 that like i like always like a choose so h100

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.110
and one unit i'm going to choose as you can see over here

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.570
and then i will be doing a basic setup for this h100 so in a

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.790
canada region so there is a machine and then os image wise

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.310
so ubuntu is fine you can choose alba linux or debian as

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.650
well i don't have any kind of a issue but yeah ubuntu is

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.130
going to like work fine for us then after that so we have a

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.310
virtual machine and then we are going to choose a virtual

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.310
machiner so for you guys this is an actually very simple

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.310
program which is going to run we're going to find the

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.310
machine editor and begin that process in this shell olivier

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.650
is something multi-tasking75 once again we will have to set

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.170
a new Ssh key right so we have to set a new ssh key so that

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.210
i will be able to login inside my system system so i believe

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.790
we talked about setting up ssh key right guys everyone yeah

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.010
anyone

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.880
who is not aware about how to do a setup of ssh key shall i

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.640
show you once again okay

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.080
my first time okay maybe you have missed the previous class

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.860
because i have already talked about it okay so let's like

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.200
start with the pati gen right uh we can we can go in a

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.680
reverse direction as well so we can try to generate ssh key

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.560
and then we can try to download it or we can try to create

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.480
first and then we can try to uh you know attach this ssh key

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.680
so in both the way it's completely going to be fine there is

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.140
no issue at all that you all are going to find out now here

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.080
so we had a pati gen right so i have already asked you to

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.800
download a pati gen it's a like a kb of software right so

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.260
within like a fraction of second you all will be able to

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.840
download and even i have provided you a link inside your

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.580
dashboard so let's go ahead and start with the pati gen so

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.940
when i talked about this pati gen for the very first time so

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.360
just open up your pati gen i believe most of you must be

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.480
having a pati gen in your system so if you have already gone

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.540
through that so here what we will do so we'll try to go and

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.420
click on generate and just keep on hovering my mouse over

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.320
here so that it is going to generate a public key and a

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.440
private key yeah so both so here is my key which has been

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.060
generated so this key is nothing but key value pair those

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.020
who are not aware about it and it gives you two kind of a

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.540
key so this is the key value pair so one is a public key

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.220
which is visible over here right so this is a public key by

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.140
the way that you will be able to see and same key you can

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.460
try to store it as a private key as well so let me save this

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.020
as a private key so click on save a private key and yes and

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.440
then here so i'm going to give a name to it so today's class

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:11.620
is a gpu fine tuning right so with this name and today is

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.920
26th of october so 26 oct so with this name i'm going to

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.780
store this particular key let's suppose and it's going to be

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.140
a ppk file ppk means private key basically so which is

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.080
required which is required at the time of login so whenever

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.780
you are going to hit your vm from any other machine for

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.700
example so today we are going to hit our vm from my local

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.760
machine right from this windows operating system i'm going

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.060
to hit my vm so obviously this private key is required so

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.120
i'm going to store it and then i'm going to copy this public

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.840
key right and this public key i have to attach i have to

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.060
attach with my vm so that it will be able to understand so

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.360
whenever i'll go give a private key so with the help of like

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.400
a private and a public key which i'm going to attach it will

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.340
be able to understand that okay it's the same user who is

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.500
going to log in so how i can try to attach it so i can try

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.940
to click on create new ssh key right and here i can just

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:13.360
give a name to it that gpu training any any name i can try

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.840
to give and just copy and paste your public key and the

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.480
reason is supposed to be same canada region so where we are

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.120
like trying to spin our machine so canada region so here is

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.500
a public key and equivalent private key i have already saved

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.760
in my local system that i'm going to use it at the time of

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.680
login so here i have attached a public key and then click on

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.400
import right click on import and then select gpu training so

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.340
i have i have multiple keys right i can attach even a

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.520
multiple keys that's completely like i can select the key

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.140
which is available to me so i have just attached a gpu

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.960
training key so which i have just generated with the help of

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.600
this partygen yeah okay ssh access enable it so that you

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.880
will be able to log in into your system with the help of

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.920
party or equivalent software or maybe from your linux

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.620
machine or maybe from your mac machine you will be able to

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:09.280
do a scp right so you can do a ssh public ip address yes

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.700
enable it i need a public ip address now configure

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:17.760
additional settings so virtual name uh leave it as it is

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.560
default name install jupyter notebook uh jupyter notebook is

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.860
not required uh in my case so it's completely fine i can

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.560
leave this part if i need a jupyter notebook i can just try

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.680
to enable this one and i can set a password yeah so maybe i

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.580
can enable it and i can say okay fine so give a password to

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.140
it but yeah in my case i don't need a jupyter notebook today

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:42.820
at least now inbound rule so from which network or port you

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:46.040
are going to allow a traffic basically means allow a hit on

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.240
your vm so add inbound rule and here so give a broad port

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.820
range one to nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine and then

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.580
whitelist the all ip address zero dot zero dot zero dot

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.100
slash zero simple so it is going to allow all the ip

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.980
addresses by the way outbound so urban traffic wise so again

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.640
uh port range one to nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.160
and then all ip address zero dot zero dot zero dot zero fine

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:14.620
now nothing needs to be done everything is set and i can

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.700
just click on deploy and within fraction of second not

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.320
second i would say but yeah maybe in a minute it is going to

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:25.100
deploy it are we done guys select click on deploy or you

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.020
want me to show some like a processes which i have done over

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:32.580
here those who are joining this gpu class for the very first

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.620
time because this is not the first time for us by the way

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:36.560
you

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.560
can use save it as well so both the options is possible i

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.020
mean like at the end of the day i need a password right so

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:49.160
your public key is nothing attached to a machine and private

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.560
key allows you or private key we have as a password for you

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:57.200
simple yeah so it's the same process right nothing is going

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.320
to change nothing has changed i would say right it's the

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.660
same thing that we have already done so we are just

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.920
repeating the same thing so that i will be able to get my

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.040
machine is it okay i think only one person has pinged what

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.760
about other people yeah

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:19.650
okay

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.800
so two people what about other people we have so many people

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.900
in a class so uh

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.020
we'll do it later because a lot of things not on my sister

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:38.120
okay so there is a option to run how many games to run the

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:44.460
kubernetes you are talking about so kms where is that option

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:51.240
vms right okay so how many vms you can try to run so as many

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.460
as you can basically so virtual machine so this machine

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.300
which i'm trying which i'm trying to access technically it's

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:02.040
a virtual machine okay so now click on deploy yeah so click

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:08.380
on deploy it will take maybe a minute of time to deploy and

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:14.870
i will be able to get my uh ip address over here and a

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:18.550
machine which i have selected so it is going to cost me 1.53

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:23.210
dollar per hour so that is a cost which i'm going to get by

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:28.200
the way just wait it's creating uh

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:37.610
this is the same thing we are doing over a cloud now that we

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:39.330
did studied locally exactly yes

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:46.090
a little bit of changes in a script because in my local

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:49.430
systems i was dealing with a windows machine and in my cloud

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:52.430
environments i'm dealing with the linux machine plus in

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:56.430
local system so majorly a gpu was a contributing factor but

00:10:56.430 --> 00:11:00.170
here so my c sorry cpu was a contributing factor but here

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:04.090
gpu is a major factor we are trying to access gpu and you

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:07.890
will be amazed to see a training speed believe me right uh

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.550
the training which is going to take hours and hours of time

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:13.470
in your local machine same training will be done in a

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:16.510
minutes of time this is something which you will be able to

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:21.950
see today right okay so here is a public ip address which

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:25.070
i'm able to get which is more than enough for me to login

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:29.410
into a system now those who would like to log in through a

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:35.410
like a their basically a linux machine or maybe a mac

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:38.810
machine so they can try to do a scp so i'll talk about that

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:42.030
as well and those who would like to log in through a windows

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:45.130
machine so they can use a putty putty is something that we

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:47.650
have already installed we have already downloaded so putty

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:51.370
is a very very small software so which is going to help you

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:57.590
out putty download for windows yeah so putty is a very small

00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:01.390
software kb of a software you can say so you can just go

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:04.550
over there and you can try to download it and you will be

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:08.650
able to use this software to log in into any vm is literally

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:12.330
any vm in this entire world so putty is basically a small

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:16.210
tool which allows you to do a ssh and if you are using a

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:19.190
linux machine or mac machine then i'm giving you a like a

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:22.110
command you can just try to use that particular command and

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:25.270
it is going to work so it's called as scp command so with

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:28.950
the help of scp you will be able to do it and whatever is

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:31.650
going to work in a linux machine same thing is going to work

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:36.030
in a mac machine as well because your base is linux inside a

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:40.070
mac machine by the way so your kernel is same so it it

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.790
technically understands a linux command by the way your mac

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:46.530
machine yeah simple i'll give you that command as well don't

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:50.490
worry just hold on for a couple of minutes so just go over

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:54.230
here and you can try to download a putty if you have not

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:59.290
done that before and after that so maybe you can start you

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:02.810
know doing a ssh so i already have a putty in my system so

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:06.470
i'll try to open up a putty so putty gen is different putty

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:10.770
is different putty gen is to for generating a keys and putty

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:14.570
is for login purposes for windows machine majorly so here it

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:17.010
is asking me for my host name so what is going to my host

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:20.570
name the ip address this is going to my public ip address

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:23.090
this is going to my host name so i'll copy this ip address

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:27.650
i'll go to putty where is my putty oh

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:37.220
not putty gen putty so i'll just go to putty right and i'll

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:40.320
try to copy and paste my ip address over here and then i

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.900
have to give a private key right so this is my user id you

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:49.500
can say or like a login credential and i have to give my you

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.820
know a private key so that i will be able to log into the

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:58.240
machine i would like to save this session so maybe gpu gpu

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.960
train and let's save it so that you know i can i can try to

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:07.640
use yeah so here you can click on ssh you can click on auth

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.800
process is same click on credential and then here it is

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.760
giving you an option to browse your credential so browse it

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:17.580
browse your private key so wherever you have stored so gpu

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:22.000
find during 26 october this is uh like a key which i have

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.780
created so i'm going to use this one right go back to

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:29.720
session say once again so that i don't have to give again

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:34.560
and again yeah and then try to click on open so once you are

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.060
going to click on open it is going to ask you to accept just

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:41.400
for the very first time and then here you have to log in so

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:45.960
login wise you have to give a name u b u and t u ubuntu

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:50.880
right ubuntu and then you will be able to log in after

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:54.880
authentication so successfully i am able to log in into a

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:59.200
machine as you can see over here uh let me increase a font

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:04.040
size inside a putty so change setting appearance change

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:12.280
select 18 and apply so this is my machine yeah this is my

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:17.080
machine which is up and running and i will be able to do a

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:22.220
training over here as simple as that so if i'll do ls over

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:25.320
here so there is nothing so far inside this particular

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:30.480
machine i have to maybe uh place all of my code file over

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:34.940
here or maybe in any of these directories so any idea guys

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.840
how i will be able to bring a code file because see this

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.180
machine is completely blank right this machine is completely

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.880
empty this is a new machine there is nothing so i have done

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.720
ls and there is there is nothing right no file available in

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:51.340
this like a folder so any idea how i can bring my file

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:58.100
docker image repository clone from git okay okay i can do a

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:02.680
git cloning ftp file transfer protocol fine

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:12.520
scp uh yeah scp is also possible okay so there are multiple

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:16.260
ways by which i can bring all my code files over here so

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.960
let's suppose i'm running something in my local i'm testing

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.820
something in my local so frequently i'll have to transfer a

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.860
file right so frequently so let's suppose if i'm trying to

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:28.100
run something in my uh virtual machine which is technically

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:32.020
this one and let's suppose it's not working so i'll go back

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:35.780
debug maybe into my local machine and then again update the

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:39.640
files so frequently i'll have to update our files in back

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.360
and forth back and forth back and forth so our best possible

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:48.840
approach is going to be maybe a like a using some sort of a

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:53.380
tool which is going to allow me in terms of doing a drag and

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:56.380
drop kind of things means i'll drag from one machine and

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:59.460
dump into another machine means i'll drag from maybe a

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:03.620
windows machine and you know drop it inside my linux machine

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.740
right so i'm going to use a tool which is going to allow me

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.960
to do that so in order to do that there is a tool not just

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:12.540
one tool which is available in a market and again these

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:17.480
tools exist in a market i think since last uh 15 20 year so

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.880
even before when i have started my career uh in i.t industry

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.240
because i have been using it since last like a 10 11 year so

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:27.420
obviously uh people have created it like and made it open

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:32.860
source before that right uh so yeah so what what what tool

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:36.300
we are going to use so we are going to use basically a tool

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:41.160
called as for my windows machine win scp so you can just go

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:45.760
to internet and then uh just try to search for win scp and

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:49.220
click on download so it is going to give you some official

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:53.960
website from where you all will be able to download it yeah

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:57.700
you all can like a download a win scp again it's a very very

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:01.980
small software like 12 mb of a software and entire world is

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.160
using it so this is how you can download a win scp it and

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.560
again you can see like even website is in a PHP so just

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.260
imagine how old it is right it's actually very very old it's

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:14.820
very very old right so you can just go to this place and you

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:18.960
can try to download a win SCP inside your system so once you

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.680
are going to download a win SCP the way you have logged in

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:28.500
yeah so the way you have logged in into your like a putty

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.180
with the help of putty in the similar manner you will be

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:34.660
able to log in even inside a win SCP which is going to allow

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.920
you to you know do a file transfer from one places to

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:42.000
another places fine so we are using in my company and blade

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.860
logic also we are using yeah there are tons of software

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:48.360
available so it's just a like a SCP right so obviously for

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:52.620
that and again if I have a Linux terminal access even in

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:56.760
Windows which we have nowadays so we don't even need a tool

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.880
so we can directly use a SCP command and we can transfer it

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.680
right but yeah these tools are you know going to give us a

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.520
flexibility in terms of doing a drag-and-drop so just

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:09.140
download this win SCP and after download it will take

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:12.860
fraction of second to do a installation so in my system as

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:16.680
you can see win SCP is available right so I'm going to open

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:22.400
up this win SCP so once I'm going to open up a win SCP you

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.720
will be able to see two things to like you know two side of

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:30.040
it so one side and then this side so you will be able to see

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:33.160
two side by default it is going to be blank it is not going

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.200
to be for example if I'm going to click on new tab so by

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.200
default it will be like a blank by the way both the sides

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:45.080
yeah so here I have to hit a new website simple right new

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.120
website so I have to give a host name what is the host name

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:52.200
same like I said so you are supposed to use a same like a

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.180
method the method that you have used to log in with the help

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:58.740
of putty so here I can give a host name my host name is

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:02.940
nothing but my machine public address this public IP so copy

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:07.760
and then paste it fine new site host name now I have to give

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:11.780
a username and password so I am trying to use a private key

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:14.440
right so I don't have username and password so I will click

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:20.100
on advanced simple and here so SSH authentication option you

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.840
will be able to see and here you can upload your private key

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:27.060
basically so again browse your private key mine so private

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:31.600
key is attached click on OK fine host name is this one and

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:35.880
then try to login so once you will try to log in it will

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.060
give you a pop-up called as except so I'll click on accept

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:42.540
it is asking me for my username so my username for a machine

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:46.500
is Ubuntu same thing Luna partition you'll be you and to you

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:53.400
Ubuntu okay so if everything is going to be fine then you

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.680
will be able to see two side of it left hand side and right

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.400
hand side on left hand side you will be able to see

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.360
onWinegangen to observe your Windows folder, whatever folder

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.780
you would like to open up, you can open up, you can browse

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:07.800
your entire Windows machine here and on your right hand

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.700
side, you will be able to see your Linux machine as you can

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:13.300
see there is nothing inside the Linux machine right for now.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.140
So this is a root directory of the Linux machine and you can

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:21.740
just go to any of these folders. This is how simple your

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:27.020
life will become. So, if you are using a WinSCP, right,

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:31.820
mobile extreme, yeah, more combination of the putty and

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:35.100
WinSCP. Yes, you can use mobile stream as well. I have been

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:38.660
using it. So I mean, like everyone is having their own

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:45.760
favorite tool toolkit. So simple, right? So just a SCP we

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.880
are trying to do. So nothing to worry. Now here on this

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.620
side, there is nothing and I have to transfer all of these

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.540
files, right? I have to transfer all of these files. Not a

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:57.720
model, because if I'm going to transfer a model, it is going

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:01.240
to take a huge amount of time. Model size is too big, right?

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:05.040
So what I can do, I can try to transfer all of these files.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.300
So data set, fine tuning, everything I can try to transfer

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:12.620
except model. So to transfer my data from here to here, I

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:15.480
just have to do drag and drop. See drag and drop started

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.280
transferring and within a fraction of a second, I will be

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:23.300
able to transfer all of my file inside my Linux machine. So

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:30.280
transferring and if I'm going to update something again,

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:34.960
drag and drop updated even inside my virtual machine, even

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:41.870
if I have to transfer data and this method is a universal

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:45.370
method by the way, doesn't matter whether you are going to

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:48.050
do a fine tuning or maybe you are working on a big data

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:50.790
project or maybe into some other better development or

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:53.910
something project, right? It's, it's same, right? Whenever

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:57.110
we have to like, you know, communicate between a local and a

00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:00.330
virtual machine, it's VMs basically. So as you can see all

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:03.390
of this file I have transferred except a model folder. So

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:06.150
model folder I have not selected, the rest of the files is

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:10.310
already available over here. I can go and I can try to check

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:14.030
over here that all these files are available or not. So ls

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:18.250
and yes, all the files are available, lsl, all of these

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:21.590
files are available to me. So whatever was available in my

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:25.370
local system, all of these files are available even over

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:28.930
here. My data set folder is also available. My fine tuning

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:32.990
files are also available. So maybe I can go into a fine

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:38.750
tuning and I can try to check. So ls, so yes, all of my fine

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:41.870
tuning files are available. So DPO, full fine tuning, LoRa,

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:45.210
preferred queue LoRa, everything is available. I can do cd

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:50.550
dot dot. I can go back, I can look into cd data set and I

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:55.090
can again try to check. So yes, all of my data files are

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:57.850
also available. So everything is available to me. So

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:00.610
whatever was available in my local system, now I have just

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:04.950
replicated the exact same thing inside my VM except a model

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:07.390
file because model we have to create, right? Model will try

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:12.630
to train. We have to see the power of like, you know, GPU.

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:17.610
So okay, Arnava is asking when we transfer, should we

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:21.250
transfer the file inside a fine tuning folder? You can

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:24.450
create any folder, transfer in any folder, create a new

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:28.110
folder with the help of WinSAP. So here you will be able to

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:31.610
get an option to create a new folder inside a VM or maybe

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:35.430
you can come over here, do MKDIR, create a new folder,

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:38.950
transfer into that one. It's fine. Keep it anywhere, right?

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:41.130
At the end of the day, I just need, you don't have to like

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:44.190
keep everything into the root directory. I'm keeping it. I

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:46.590
have just transferred it. But yeah, it's completely fine. I

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:51.390
can just go create, do MKDIR from here or even from WinSAP,

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:55.390
go and create a new folder just by using this UI. Everything

00:24:55.390 --> 00:25:00.510
is fine, right? I just need my file to be available

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:03.870
somewhere. That's it. Which location? Doesn't matter for me

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:10.730
unless and until I'm not able to remember it. So yeah, all

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:12.890
are in a root directory. If another project want to

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:16.250
transfer, then you can create a folder, folder option is

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:18.250
available to you, right? Maintain your folder location,

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:23.010
simple. Just like working with directories, right? So I

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:25.550
don't think it's like a directory. It's just a discussion

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:30.270
point for us. Okay. Now, so all the files are available over

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:35.210
here, right? So first of all, we have to do a training. Now

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:37.950
I have done a couple of changes. So I have done a couple of

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:41.210
changes with respect to some of the files with respect to

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:45.030
H100 training. So step by step, step by step. So we will try

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:49.270
to start with the training and yeah, so one by one, one by

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:52.330
one. So you will have to execute the files so that your

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:55.970
training is going to start. And peacefully, you will be able

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:57.910
to do a training. If it is going to give me some sort of

00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:01.350
issues, we'll fix it, we'll fix in my local and then I'll

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:06.870
try to, you know, transfer that again here. So here you will

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:11.610
be able to see a file called as setup file I have created.

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:15.270
This setup.sh. So whenever you are going to spin your

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:18.990
machine and if you remember even last time, right? So we

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:23.250
were trying to run some sort of a couple of commands so that

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:25.790
I will do a couple of I will be able to update my virtual

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:29.550
machine. And yeah, one more thing. What is the command to

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:33.250
check a GPU? Anyone who remembers?

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:48.760
Yes. CUDA. CUDA is basically library. So nvidia-smi, right?

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:55.260
N-V-I-D-I-A nvidia-smi. This is the command. So here is my

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:59.760
GPU H100. So this is the detail that I'm able to see over

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:04.240
here. Right. Right. So nvidia-smi, by the way, yeah, a

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:08.680
couple of people are able to ping me. So they remember fine.

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:13.280
So here basically we have a GPU and we are able to see that

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:17.860
that yes, we have H100 GPU. So if you remember the like, you

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:21.020
know, even last time, so when we were trying to spin our

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.740
machine, so we have done a couple of, you know, Linux based

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:27.360
or updates. So after doing the update, what we will do, so

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.860
we'll try to do the installation. So whatever requirement

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:33.200
files that we have. So we. So this machine is a complete

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:37.200
blank machine. So we have to do a setup in a step by step

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.680
manner. Then only I will be able to, you know, run each and

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:44.420
everything. Otherwise I won't be able to run things. So to

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:49.200
do that, there is a one unified single file I have created

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:55.400
and that file is basically setup H100 complete.sh. So inside

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.320
this file, I have mentioned each and everything. So what I

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.480
have mentioned inside this one. So I have mentioned the

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:04.020
update. Basically. I have mentioned our Docker installation

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:06.740
because even Docker will not be available. I have to install

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:13.160
a Docker. I have even like, you know, like inside this one.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:17.060
So I have even given a command so that it will be able to

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:20.900
like, you know, do all kind of requirements installations

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:25.680
inside this one. So this is one single unified file keeping

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.940
one thing in our mind so that even in future, maybe after a

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:33.300
year of time. If you would like to. Like up your machine, it

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:36.740
should not take more than a minute of time to keep your

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:40.000
machine ready. So one single command and then your machine

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.400
will be ready now to execute this particular command. First

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.080
of all, I have to give a execute access. We don't have

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:50.140
execute access. We have a read, write, read, write, read

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:54.040
access, right? So we have to give a execute access. So I'll

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:58.300
just try to change access of it. So ch mode. So change the

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:03.240
mode. And give a plus. Plus x execute mode access to all sh

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:06.700
file. So static of dot sh. So whatever file that we have

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:11.160
inside my machine. So I'm just giving a execute access to

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:15.580
all the sh file, whatever sh file. So sell script file. So

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:20.720
here it's done. Now if I'll go and check LSL. So now all

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:24.100
this sh file is having a execute access. Read, write,

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:27.920
execute, read, write, execute access. We have fine. So we

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:31.440
have changed the mode of all of these. This is required.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.040
Otherwise you will not be able to execute it. It will be

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:38.820
into just a read and write mode now. So once this is done, I

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:44.840
can try to run this setup h100 complete sh file. So how dot

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:50.980
slash setup and then execute it. And it is, it has started

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:53.440
its job. So it will take a couple of minutes.

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:10.050
Yeah. So basically it's downloading. Docker is downloading

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:13.390
all my requirement or txt file. It is updating my, uh, like

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:18.010
a base. Linux basically everything, everything it is trying

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:18.830
to like a update.

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:28.790
And believe me, even after a year, if you're going to touch

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:31.930
this file and if you have a requirement to do a fine tuning,

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:36.890
uh, you, so you will be able to like, you know, uh, build

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:39.570
your machine just like this.

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:23.360
Can we use EC2 for, yeah, EC2 also provides you machine. So

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:27.980
obviously any, any provider, not just AWS or maybe a Jira

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:31.760
GCP. Any machine means any machine in this entire world

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:35.320
because AWS never build a machine, right? It's going to be

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:39.540
Nvidia machine or something else. So basically, uh, AWS is

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:42.440
just giving you a computer over there, right?

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:48.430
Need to install Python specific version as well. So

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:50.830
everything I have mentioned, it

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:59.760
will download models node. So basically this file is going

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:02.000
to do a setup. First of all, you have to do an installation.

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:05.680
So whenever you start a project inside your local system. So

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:09.460
what do you do? Uh, so let's suppose, uh, you have a new

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.960
laptop, right? You have purchased a new laptop. So what you

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.900
will do in a very first place, you will try to install

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:17.900
Python first of all, right? Then once Python is installed by

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:22.780
using some of the, uh, like a provider or distributor, maybe

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:25.880
a conda, maybe pip or something, right? So you will try to

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:29.260
do a setup for Python and then you will try to do a

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:32.920
installation of all the requirements. So which we have

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:37.280
mentioned inside requirement.txt file, right? And then you

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:40.900
will start a training. So basically we are in a step where

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:44.600
we are trying to set up our machine. So where it will

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.920
install Python, update Python. It will try to install

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:52.120
basically like a Docker, Docker is also required, right? So

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:54.820
in a local system we have to install a Docker, then only

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:57.420
we'll be able to test it. So even over here, if we have to

00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:01.400
run a Docker, we have to like install first, uh, inside a

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:05.060
requirement.txt for a training and for inferencing. We need

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.680
a multiple different kinds of training. Kind of a libraries.

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:12.420
So everything means whatever you can see in your code base

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:16.720
in our requirement.txt file, both the requirement.txt file,

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:19.800
it is trying to do that installation.

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:31.890
Last time when we use, we spooled it directly without using

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:34.670
a Docker, it was working fine in this session. We are, yeah.

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:37.610
So without even Docker, it is going to work fine for me. I

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:42.490
mean like, uh, Docker is not required unless and until, uh,

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:46.110
Python. I have a requirement of, you know, uh, building

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:48.910
something. So which should work everywhere in the similar

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:51.530
manner. That's the meaning of Docker, right?

00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:59.660
How Docker install as per machine, I mean Linux, Windows or

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:00.900
Mac, it's just a command.

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:42.280
Can anyone ping the last command that we used here? We'll,

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.040
we'll give you the entire file, don't worry.

00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:51.850
So in which class previously you discuss a VM setup, uh, new

00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:54.790
kernel available. Okay.

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:31.730
So Python installation. It is showing me some issue, unable

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:35.330
to, uh, let me check.

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:58.720
Okay. Failing my, this particular command, which is required

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:08.160
to set up my Python. So I'll have to check, find

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:12.180
CDH 100 LS

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:17.220
bin is there. So CD dot,

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.560
dot. So you said it has created. Basically. Uh, Python

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.740
environment for me. So Python environment is available

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:30.280
inside this directory. I have to activate this Python

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.140
environment.

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:07.240
Bin slash activate.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:14.800
It seems activated directory is not available. A C T I V a

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.520
no.

00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:22.010
So Python environment is giving me issue guys. Let me fix

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:29.630
it. Uh, CD. H. Otherwise I'll create a new one. CD bin LS.

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:40.190
Mm. Python three is available. Okay. Python 3.1 0 is

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:47.910
available. Yeah. Fine. Fine. Fine. In

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:19.240
my base environment. Okay. Python three. Let me check. Hmm.

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:27.320
In my basement. I'm not sure. So I think it should work by

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.080
the way for me.

00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:47.030
H100. Okay. Fine. Okay. So now there is a file called as

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:50.970
train all H100. So this file. So first of all, we have

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:54.550
executed which file? So we have executed this one. Which is

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:57.670
going to do a set up for me. Uh, technically it is going to

00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:59.950
update my system, Docker installation, everything it is

00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:04.290
going to do. Then there is a SAP server. I have created, uh,

00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:07.830
for a simplicity. So which is going to train all the models.

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:11.750
If I don't want to train all the models, then in that case I

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:15.350
can go inside this, uh, fine tuning folder and inside this

00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:17.930
folder I have a individual file so I can try to execute

00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:22.470
individual file that is also going to work for me by the

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:26.830
way. Uh, so here, uh, maybe I can, I can execute this as

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:29.710
such file or maybe I can try to call this Python file. So as

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:32.530
Python environment is already available. I can simply call

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:36.570
it. I can even, uh, Python file over here. So Python, T H O

00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:44.690
N, Python three train T R. Okay. So I think I'm into a wrong

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:51.910
directory, CD dot, dot CD, dot, dot CD, dot, dot, I,

00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:58.440
then

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:09.810
three was, okay,

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:19.670
clear LSL. So I have to execute this particular PI file.

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:23.950
Which is going to initiate a training for me. So Python, uh,

00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:33.490
three train all H 100 PI file. So it's a 100 complete

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:39.110
training pipeline environment variable set GPU. Oh, it has

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:39.830
failed here.

00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:50.750
Okay. So my GPU check has failed. Let me fix it. So

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:07.360
let me install my CUDA manually. Okay. Download CUDA.

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:13.240
So yeah, it is telling me that, uh, so as per my script,

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:16.120
basically GPU check has failed and it simply means that that

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:19.040
CUDA is not available. So I'm just trying to do a pip

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:21.800
install CUDA and it's the same command which is available

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:25.900
even inside your Docker file. So manually I'm trying to

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:27.140
install a CUDA. Do

00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:01.390
we need to activate the environment first? Uh, yeah, you can

00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:03.650
do a activation of the environment, but in my base

00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:06.330
environment itself, I have a 3.10. So even without

00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:10.170
activating it, it will work. Okay. I can activate, I can go

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:12.650
and I can activate as the environment is available. But uh,

00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:18.850
here, uh, so base also like is having 3.10 and 3.10 is

00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:19.630
something which I need.

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:32.540
Now let me install transformer prefetch. So all of these

00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:35.060
files are available in requirement.txt. I'm just testing one

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:36.360
by one because

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:49.950
this is the only step

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:54.820
which, okay, requirement already satisfied for this one.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:01.440
Fine. Then let's check for numpy-pandaj-cyclet. For this

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:03.180
also requirement already satisfied.

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:22.580
Environment variable, clear it and then python-lsl, python3

00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:29.160
might train all h100, train all. Let's see. This should not

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:35.440
fail this time. Okay. So HR model full fine tuning, it has

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:40.580
already started guys. And as you can see how fast it is,

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:45.540
right? So just, just, just like a, you know, uh, like, uh,

00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:48.860
try to check over here. So it has started with this tiny

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:52.560
llama. I just wanted to show you this, these things. So it

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:58.100
has started my HR model fine tuning. Fine. And, uh, once it

00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:01.800
has started this HR model fine tuning. If you'll just try to

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.480
check a log. So it is trying to load a tokenizer for me.

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:08.260
Then it's fine. Tokenization is done. Then it's trying to

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:11.500
load my, uh, pre-built model, which is a tiny llama, which

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:14.720
I'm using and model is having 1.1 billion parameter.

00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:18.440
Basically it is loading a data set. Then it is tokenizing a

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:21.460
data set. Then it is trying to start the training. So we are

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:25.600
training it for three POC, two batch size, load, it is this

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:30.900
device is GPU precision is 16. F 16. We are trying to use it

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:36.960
and it has completed this model training just maybe in 30,

00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:41.820
40 seconds for three POC. Now same thing was taking like 15,

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:45.040
20 minute of time in my local system. Exact same thing.

00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:50.520
Yeah. Okay. Maybe for other models. So my command has failed

00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:53.600
a successful two failed three. Okay. So two models

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:55.960
successfully, I'm able to train it. I'll have to check why

00:45:55.960 --> 00:46:00.360
my rest of the model has failed. But yeah, so two model we

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:04.880
are able to train. So healthcare model we are able to train

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:09.000
and HR model we are able to train. So two models are

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:16.580
available if I'll go and if I'll try to check, so LSL, if

00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:21.300
I'll go into a model directory, so this directory CD models,

00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:27.400
then LSL, we have basically HR, we have healthcare and we

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:30.700
have sales. But yeah, this has failed. So if I'll go into my

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:39.160
HR, like a directory, HR directory, I must be able to see

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:43.600
all the model files and all the checkpoints. Yes. So

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:48.020
everything is available over here. So this is, this is the

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:51.960
beauty of a GPU. So whatever was taking approximately like a

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:54.780
two model, we are able to train, right? A third was failed.

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:57.420
I'll just check. Maybe there is some command or there must

00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:59.860
be some issue with this, this one, because of that it's

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:04.660
failing. I'll just fix it now itself. Right. But yeah, just

00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:12.840
within like a 40, 50 second, right? Yes. Just within 45, 50

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:16.340
second, which is going to take in my kind of a machine, 30

00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:20.800
minute or 45 minute of time. So that is a beauty. This is

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:24.860
the reason. So we are supposed to use a GPUs, not a CPUs.

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:28.440
That's the reason. So we should use a cloud, right? So just

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:31.140
imagine in one hour of time. How much training I will be

00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:34.720
able to do even with the big data set and high POC, right?

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:39.440
So I will be able to do it. Now some of my training has

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:43.180
failed. So healthcare model is fine. My sales model has

00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:47.740
failed and my marketing model has failed. My finance model

00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:51.880
has failed. So return non-zero exit status, fine, fine,

00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:57.700
fine. And okay. So rule three failed. That's completely

00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:06.240
fine. So I'll just try to see what is the issue. Fine. So it

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:09.980
should not be a memory issue, will fine tuning HR, loading

00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:11.420
this, this, this fine.

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:15.780
Okay.

00:48:56.580 --> 00:49:00.560
Okay. So I have these two models. So at least I can go ahead

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:04.100
and I can try to test these two models, the model which we

00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:07.120
have trained basically, and then in a later stage, what we

00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:10.580
can do. So maybe we can try to, you know, how to do it. Fix

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:13.080
the issue. So there must be an issue with the script or

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:16.080
memory issue. I just have to dig deeper into it. So I just

00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:21.960
have to check why it is giving me exit status one over here.

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:24.700
So technically it means it has not worked. This is the

00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:27.720
meaning of one, by the way, but I'll have to check. So at

00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:31.320
which condition it is giving me exit status one. But before

00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:34.360
that, let's go with the inferencing. So at least two models

00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:40.960
are available to me, C L E A R clear. Okay. So here let's go

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:47.140
ahead and do some sort of a inferencing. So

00:49:54.370 --> 00:49:58.530
to do that, I have a file called

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:06.940
as deploy H 100 API dot SH. So let's just call this

00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:10.940
particular file so that I will be able to deploy. So dot

00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:16.780
slash deploy and yeah, error permission denied while trying

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:19.560
to connect to a Docker, daemon, socket, this, this, this,

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:24.100
this, this, this is the issue permission denied for which

00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:30.760
file head fine tuning ping this Docker connect permission

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:36.640
denied. It's trying to build a Docker image, but it's not

00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:40.880
able to build it. Okay. So let's fix that issue as well. So

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:05.700
let me give a proper permission to my Docker and then apply

00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:12.060
a change. It changes restart my Docker. So I have already

00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:14.680
kept this command with me because these are the regular

00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:18.600
command that we use basically. So to restart the Docker or

00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:22.520
check what is a Docker version so that quickly I can check

00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:27.380
it. So this is my Docker version. Fine. Process is fine.

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:33.260
Okay. No process is running for a Docker. So let's try to

00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:37.440
build a Docker image now. So Docker file build this. This H

00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:38.560
100. This is the latest. Okay.

00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:46.810
So in case of like a Windows machine, so we try to do a

00:51:46.810 --> 00:51:51.210
Docker compose, here, these are the, this is the command for

00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:54.190
Docker, like for building it. So even in Windows, so we do a

00:51:54.190 --> 00:51:57.290
Docker build and Docker compose, same command we are trying

00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:58.370
to use with sudo access,

00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:18.100
the log are automatic or we have to use a login library. No.

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:20.800
So whatever I'm trying to echo, so let's suppose I'm using a

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:24.140
SH file, right? So inside a SH, which is nothing but a Linux

00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:26.620
compatible file. So you try to do a echo. So whatever you

00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:29.060
have written inside a echo, it's like a print. Basically. So

00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:34.340
it will try to like, you know, print in your console. If you

00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:37.660
will not write it, it will not print it. Or you can even try

00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:41.540
to run it as a, you know, a background process. So that is

00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:43.840
also possible. Yesterday I told you, right, D.

00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:52.990
So error, fail to build, fail to solve. Okay. Again, my

00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:58.160
Docker has failed. It should not fail by the way.

00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:09.280
Docker file, H 100. Stop. Call system dependency. Call find.

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:11.760
With code.

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:44.340
Docker.

00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:52.880
Okay. So ls. Docker

00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:58.080
file. H 100. Okay.

00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:09.280
Okay. So looks like my Docker. Okay. So able to run all of

00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:12.520
these things. Requirement. Txt. Server. Py. Fine tuned data

00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:18.120
set. Okay. Fine. So. My Docker. Configuration. Is able to

00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:21.880
run all of these things. Looks fine. Now let me run it.

00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:26.480
Error response from daemon. Failed to create a task

00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:29.900
container. Failed to sim task. Agitated one. This, this,

00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:34.600
this. Version mismatch. Unknown. Why? Sudo docker run D.

00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:42.180
Fine. Previous process was okay. LMAPI. H 100. Latest. Yes.

00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:48.060
It should work. Because last time it was able to finish it.

00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:50.980
Okay. Let's check.

00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:01.770
Response from daemon. Let

00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:21.920
me restart my Docker. C L E R. Clear. Sudo. System. C T L.

00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:33.840
Restart. Nvidia. V. I. D. I. A. Nvidia. Docker. Failed to

00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:37.020
restart. Unit. Nvidia docker. Service. Not available. Not

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:38.060

00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:57.120
Again. Error.

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:06.380
Failed to restart. Found.

00:58:38.290 --> 00:58:42.170
Let me run API without docker. Let's check whether it's

00:58:42.170 --> 00:58:42.810
working or not.

00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:51.700
Yeah. So it looks like my API directly is running. Will fix

00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:55.780
it with docker as well. But yeah, so my API is live and it's

00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:59.980
live on this particular port number 8000. So I've just like,

00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:03.200
you know, executed my API server. So technically a fast API.

00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:06.040
So without using a docker. I'm trying to execute so that I

00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:10.440
will be able to do a testing. So yes, it's running. Let me

00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:14.460
test at least my two of the model. So to test it, what we

00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:18.100
have to do, so we have to basically copy this IP address

00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:21.700
because at this IP address things are running just like a

00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:29.360
local host and here port number is 8000. So let me hit this

00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:31.300
port number slash

00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:37.700
DOCS.

00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:54.900
It's not getting a request. How to domain name to IP

00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:57.800
address. Yeah, that I'll tell you. Don't worry. So domain

00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:02.820
name to IP address mapping. First of all, let me run these

01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:03.160
things.

01:00:07.110 --> 01:00:13.440
It's not able to reach out to my machine. By the way, curl

01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:38.160
and anything. I mean, like if there is no problem with the

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:41.940
IP address, right, public access of this address, then it

01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:44.180
should not give me an issue. Maybe I can. I can go and check

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:48.060
over here inside a network tab and I think I have already

01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:54.200
allowed public IP address is fine and firewall wise. So I

01:01:55.890 --> 01:02:01.970
have already allowed 0.0.0 port range. Okay inbound and

01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:11.210
outbound. Okay so why my port range is not this one. I think

01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:13.450
yeah, this is the issue. My

01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:28.720
firewall. This is the wall. And this one. Okay. Let me check

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:33.540
now. Yeah, that was the issue. So basically, I don't know

01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:37.280
basically I what I remember is like I have already given a

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:40.860
port range of one to 9999 but by mistake somehow it has

01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:44.880
taken only 22 port and because of this port number inbound

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:48.340
like a traffic port number. So it was not allowing me that

01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:51.080
was the only issue because if something is running obviously

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:55.200
I should be able to access it. Okay. So now we are public

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:58.520
and now all of you will be able to access it guys. So

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:02.520
successfully we are able to run things in our GPU at least

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:05.500
two models are running as of now. So I believe HR model is

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:08.040
running and health model is running. So maybe I can go to HR

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:12.420
model and I can try this out. I can try to pass a string

01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:20.360
over here. I can try to ask that. What is what is HR policy

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:22.340
for taking

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:32.180
data. Leave. So maybe execute and 404 model file not found.

01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:36.040
So again, this is the issue it is it is able to reach out to

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.940
my system but this is the response model file not found at

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:44.840
model HR will fine tune please train the model first. Okay.

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:55.850
So another issue 500 internal error. So my API is not able

01:03:55.850 --> 01:03:58.730
to give me. So I'm able to reach out to my system as you can

01:03:58.730 --> 01:04:02.630
see and many people are able to reach out to my system it

01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:07.420
seems but yes

01:04:09.210 --> 01:04:16.230
I can see a traffic on my system. Fine. So let me terminate

01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:18.870
this one guys for now and I'll have to check.

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:26.220
Okay. So my model file is missing. Maybe I'll have to

01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:36.200
retrain this model file. LSL. CD model. Models. LS. So

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:39.140
healthcare. Okay. HR fine-tuned.

01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:46.680
HR full fine-tuned. Okay. So it is looking for a model at HR

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:53.760
full fine-tuned and I have a model available at HR fine

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:58.220
-tuned healthcare Laura fine-tuned. Okay. Fine. Let's see

01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:00.780
which API is going to hit CD

01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:12.260
dot dot. So HR fine-tuned and Laura fine-tuned. Okay. Okay.

01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:19.930
Hmm. So again I have started running my API.

01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:26.270
Refresh healthcare.

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:35.840
Try this out.

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:42.480
Status healthy. Fine.

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:46.820
Then we have Healthcare.

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:02.900
Hmm. Healthcare Model is working. I am able to get a

01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:06.200
response. Tell me about yourself. So basically a healthcare

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:09.380
model is working. So yeah 2 models we have trained and 2

01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:13.120
models is available. One of that model is basically a health

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.200
care model and two models is basically a healthcare

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:17.300
successfully I am able to get a response from my healthcare

01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:21.480
model. So basically I just have to like clean a little bit

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:25.040
this entire things, API things basically and so that

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:30.620
everything will work if one is working. So guys you can use

01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:33.500
this healthcare model and then try to test it. So API slash

01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:35.920
healthcare, so healthcare inferences you can try to do it.

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:40.380
In between so I will try to fix other things and

01:06:50.530 --> 01:06:53.770
you will be able to see that inferencing is fast. So if you

01:06:53.770 --> 01:06:56.510
are going to run exact same thing into your local system,

01:06:56.790 --> 01:07:00.590
inferencing is not going to be that fast but yeah. So now if

01:07:00.590 --> 01:07:03.110
you are doing it, inferencing is going to be fast and it is

01:07:03.110 --> 01:07:07.150
the same URL. Yeah healthcare working giving a response,

01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:10.250
okay fine. So healthcare is fine, I will just try to fix

01:07:10.250 --> 01:07:12.950
other model as well because other models were working fine

01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:16.750
in my local system, I have already tested it. Maybe some

01:07:16.750 --> 01:07:21.130
configuration changes I will have to do with respect to CUDA

01:07:21.130 --> 01:07:22.270
available over here.

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:30.100
Okay so everyone is getting 200, 200, 200, it simply means

01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:32.700
that, I can see like people are hitting and people are able

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:36.200
to get 200. It simply means that everything is working fine

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:39.300
and these are the IP addresses from where you are trying to

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:44.040
hit my system. So let me close it guys and let me fix other

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:45.200
part of the code.

01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:50.720
So closed the API,

01:07:55.470 --> 01:07:57.850
LSL, let

01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:06.420
me execute this train all h100.py once again just to

01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:10.220
identify the issue. So python 3, train it,

01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:26.580
prefet failed, laura marketing model failed and finance

01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:28.560
model failed. So

01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:10.500
let me clear it and i can try doing a training as an

01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:19.600
individual model, so ls L and I have a fine tuning folder

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:24.200
over here. And inside that I have individual. folder so i

01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:33.340
can try to call that one cd fine tuning lsl and whatever has

01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:38.920
failed let's try to train it one by one so let's say we are

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:42.580
going to do a training for prefets so let me try this so

01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:48.160
that i can identify individual issues p e f a t okay

01:10:56.130 --> 01:11:00.630
so no such file or directory data set sales data set dot

01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:02.330
json okay

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:06.960
python

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:13.860
3 object

01:11:28.170 --> 01:11:33.830
has so this is the issue it seems already multiple devices

01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:37.490
keeping arg epoch this this this fine

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:33.680
tuning python

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:32.920
3 train so

01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:06.540
model training on gpu is having its own struggle as you can

01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:10.020
see so things are working perfectly fine in my local system

01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:14.060
but you the when i'm trying to run it on a gpu so because of

01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:18.360
like some dependencies issue compatibility issue it's

01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:19.700
failing okay

01:14:25.390 --> 01:14:30.530
again training has failed training failed training failed no

01:14:30.530 --> 01:14:33.950
package error is found for the bytes and bytes again

01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:39.700
dependency issue a lot of issues just with respect to

01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:43.720
dependencies and yeah guys be ready if you are doing the

01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:47.560
same thing i mean like once it will work in my system

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:48.900
hundred percent it will work in my system hundred percent it

01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:50.740
will work in my system in any system but yeah if you're

01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:55.020
doing it fresh so then obviously all you have to go through

01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:56.560
all the struggles a

01:15:11.950 --> 01:15:14.390
real struggle in it life how

01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:24.900
to develop this level of understanding so first of all you

01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:27.200
should be good with the linux command if you are using like

01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:30.900
a gpus right uh and any any linux machine so you are

01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:33.780
supposed to have some sort of understanding with respect a

01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:36.400
basic of at least a linux command i'm not saying that you

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:40.240
should be pro in that but yeah Yeah and then second just go

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:43.180
through line by line all those errors because all those

01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:46.280
errors will tell you everything that why it is failing. So

01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:49.080
it is failing because of dependencies issues so I will just

01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:53.060
fix the dependency issue then again try to run it and it

01:15:53.060 --> 01:16:01.160
will work basically right it will always work. Can we not so

01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:04.080
yeah we can deploy a docker images first of all let me train

01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:06.920
it I am struggling with the training itself. So I was able

01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:09.200
to train two models two models training was working fine

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:12.960
third fourth and fifth model was giving an issue. So once

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:15.760
training will be done once I will be having a models I can

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:17.980
go with the docker deployment. Now in case of docker

01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:21.240
deployment obviously like it is if it is going to work once

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:25.120
it will work all the time but to do that I have to like

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:29.400
create my model first. So I am working on the model I am

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:34.240
struggling with the model fine tuning which is which was

01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:37.040
working perfectly fine in my windows machine by the way yeah

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:39.280
the code I have shared with you so anyone and everyone can

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:43.660
run that in their windows machine and it will work. Set

01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:16.470
the variable ls once

01:17:19.130 --> 01:17:25.210
I will get all of my five models then we will run a docker

01:17:25.210 --> 01:17:32.390
python three p-i-t-h-o-n train all h100 just

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:37.820
because of one small dependency and

01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:16.220
yeah all of you will be able to learn a lot just by looking

01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:19.840
at this. That this is how work happens actual work happens

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:27.860
again failed training failed element zero tensor issue again

01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:31.220
it has failed training failed element zero tensor unit

01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:38.700
required grant do not have a grade function poor model

01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:43.860
failed this time. Look on grade true it

01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:46.860
is a tensor issue.

01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:21.940
So in my initial days right so when I was a fresher I used

01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:26.380
to sit with my you know seniors inside in a company by the

01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:29.860
way right with my seniors they used to work I just used to

01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:33.780
see and I have learned a lot in that manner so it is a

01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:34.980
similar kind of a situation.

01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:46.960
Yes sir I can see the struggle and same time scared about

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:49.720
the real world but yeah this is how real work happens

01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:50.660
instead

01:19:57.790 --> 01:20:01.370
of creating these files locally can we do the same see in

01:20:01.370 --> 01:20:04.550
local you have a vs code right you have a editor you can

01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:07.710
test it you can check it and then you can ship the code if

01:20:07.710 --> 01:20:13.450
you are going to do it in a cloud I am like this is not

01:20:13.450 --> 01:20:16.550
going to like a help you out in any way. So we

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:23.860
develop everything in a local and then we ship everything in

01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:25.440
a cloud okay

01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:30.020
so one model done now again

01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:37.750
it is failing for my rest of the model grade function I have

01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:39.410
already changed. So I am going to change the size of code

01:21:39.410 --> 01:21:40.550
just

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:09.440
because of this two things can

01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:26.750
we push a code in git and pull there sometime win sap

01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:29.610
corrupt files no it is not like that win sap will never

01:22:29.610 --> 01:22:33.730
corrupt the file it is just like a software so if I am doing

01:22:33.730 --> 01:22:37.090
a git so maybe it will be little bit more time taking win

01:22:37.090 --> 01:22:42.570
sap is convenient one drag and drop once my final version of

01:22:42.570 --> 01:22:45.670
code is ready then I can push it into a github repository no

01:22:45.670 --> 01:22:50.590
need to push all the you know not running code into github

01:24:50.430 --> 01:24:54.030
grade two fine okay

01:24:57.870 --> 01:25:03.800
so five model nora has device

01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:34.600
handling lsl it

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:52.740
has created all the folders and probably we have multiple

01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:56.220
check pointings no sport

01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:52.880
okay

01:27:54.670 --> 01:27:59.710
fine guys. Issue solved and now it is able to train all the

01:27:59.710 --> 01:28:03.070
models it was just a small issue with respect to our tensors

01:28:03.070 --> 01:28:08.630
because of that required grade is equal to true that was the

01:28:08.630 --> 01:28:11.770
only thing that we had to make and after that so everything

01:28:11.770 --> 01:28:15.470
has started working perfectly fine okay

01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:24.700
so all model successfully trained total time is only 1.2

01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:30.460
minutes so technically this like has taken almost 1.5

01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:34.000
minutes. 1.5 hour for me so 1.5 hour of job in 1.2 minutes

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.880
so all the models are available now now if models are

01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:41.100
available so we can try to check it with the help of apis

01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:45.560
right so now you all can test it let me run the api cler

01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:47.860
clear lsl and

01:28:50.420 --> 01:28:58.860
then python 3 api server so now you won't face any kind of a

01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:03.560
issue so this will work in your system everything is fixed

01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:08.980
for gpu okay so now you can test the api guys same api

01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:15.440
refresh and then maybe you can try to test finance model if

01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:26.520
you want so here tell me about yourself execute 404 okay so

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:32.800
model file not found at dpo fine tune. Maybe directory has

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:34.880
been changed. I just

01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:44.560
have to change my server file.

01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:16.560
So model is trained cd models less so these are the

01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:21.560
directory exact directory so which I have to give can

01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:37.900
we check individual model training maybe we can find error

01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:40.760
yeah now error is also fixed actually this it was the same

01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:43.360
error basically because of same error it was failing so

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:46.600
grade is equal to true which we had to make and after that

01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:49.320
like grade is equal to true that was the only issue

01:32:25.380 --> 01:32:30.520
hr fine tuned sales fine tuned pre fine tuned marketing fine

01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:32.340
tuned okay secure

01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:41.020
lot of fine tuned fine api

01:32:49.340 --> 01:32:51.040
server hmm

01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:39.340
now guys so the only problem with respect to api was it was

01:33:39.340 --> 01:33:43.060
pointing out to a different directory which was changed so

01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:45.960
now you can try to check all the models all the models are

01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:49.340
working on the same url so everything is public everything

01:33:49.340 --> 01:33:53.720
is live. Not using a docker for now. But yeah using a fast

01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:56.780
api directly docker issue will be even fixed that is not a

01:33:56.780 --> 01:34:00.920
big issue if something was running in my local so it will I

01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:04.680
can make it running everywhere so yeah now you can check

01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:08.000
sales model finance model hr model marketing model all of

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:12.300
these models are going to work for us and yeah all of you

01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:16.120
are going to get a good inferencing by the way so okay sales

01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:19.740
is giving 500 internal error sales is giving internal error

01:34:19.740 --> 01:34:23.680
so maybe sales. This model is having an issue finance

01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:26.920
working fine I can see marketing working fine healthcare

01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:31.660
working fine okay sales is giving an issue fine got it so

01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:35.220
maybe we will have to change a location of the sales model

01:34:35.220 --> 01:34:40.480
that's it directory of the sales model okay so all the all

01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:43.320
the other models are working fine. The only issue with the

01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:45.960
sales model is maybe I can open up a duplicate session for

01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:57.700
this one u b u n t u. Okay. CD models okay

01:34:59.910 --> 01:35:03.890
so we have a sales fine tuned and sales preferred fine tune

01:35:03.890 --> 01:35:10.070
we have like two directory over here so only sales is giving

01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:15.150
me an issue as I can see like in my API request so we have

01:35:15.150 --> 01:35:18.110
like a sales here okay

01:35:39.550 --> 01:35:45.470
fine let me check where my sales is pointing to sales

01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:47.710
preferred fine tune. Okay.

01:35:55.280 --> 01:36:01.920
And I have that directory I believe sales preferred fine

01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:02.320
tuned.

01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:06.300
So even sales issue is fixed as you can see so basically it

01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:09.300
was just a directory issue I have changed the directory

01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:12.860
which it was pointing to a mall directory and yeah so even

01:38:12.860 --> 01:38:17.820
sales is fixed. So now the entire code base is fixed let me

01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:20.260
tell you the summary of this how you will be able to execute

01:38:20.260 --> 01:38:22.660
it and how you will be able to train it inside your system

01:38:22.660 --> 01:38:27.060
so once your GPU is ready. Very first part is that that let

01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:30.500
me go into my parent directory and listen up carefully so

01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:33.320
what you have to do so you don't have to do much by the way

01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:37.940
the very first part that you have to execute is a setup h100

01:38:37.940 --> 01:38:41.800
complete dot sh that's it right so setup file you have to

01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:44.360
execute and then for testing purposes you have to execute

01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:47.900
basically api server dot py file this is going to create

01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:50.460
your system this is going to basically install all the

01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:53.920
requirements whatever requirements that we have to execute.

01:38:53.940 --> 01:38:56.420
You have to install it will be done by only this particular

01:38:56.420 --> 01:39:00.160
file so I have already updated this one and then you just

01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:03.060
have to call this api server so that your fast api will be

01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:07.040
up and running right your fast api. So these are the only

01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:11.680
two file execution that you have to do nothing else but yeah

01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:14.280
so if you have to do just a model inferencing but you have

01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:17.220
to do a training as well so to train all the models there is

01:39:17.220 --> 01:39:21.260
a file called as train all h100 py file so first do a setup

01:39:21.260 --> 01:39:26.400
now if model is available. So you can like a directly hit

01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:30.280
the api if model is not available then set up then train

01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:34.760
basically and then you have to run the api server so that

01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:36.800
fast api server will be up and running and you will be able

01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:41.860
to do a testing with any any of these things yeah. So this

01:39:41.860 --> 01:39:44.360
file I am going to share with all of you guys in your free

01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:47.980
time so just try to set up and maybe you can spend like a 15

01:39:47.980 --> 01:39:51.780
20 minute of time because issue is fixed in my system in my

01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:55.080
GPU. So. So obviously it will not give you an issue that

01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:59.420
there is a very high chance you all will be able to execute

01:39:59.420 --> 01:40:03.880
it just by running the code just running just three files

01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:07.940
one is a setup file and one is a train file and one is a api

01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:11.920
server dot py file but rest is same same that we have

01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:12.800
discussed yeah.

01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:21.820
So here let me share this entire code base with all of you.

01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:22.680
Where

01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:29.100
is my vs code. Where is my vs code. Close

01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:36.780
this copy

01:40:39.210 --> 01:40:40.750
path pull

01:40:55.220 --> 01:41:03.440
fine tuning or fine tuning gp fine tuning underscore in

01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:06.140
underscore GPU and

01:41:11.670 --> 01:41:15.950
for now I am uploading this entire file inside your system

01:41:15.950 --> 01:41:21.310
in a previous class itself. So in a today's class resource

01:41:21.310 --> 01:41:23.650
section you all will be able to find out this files.

01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:29.540
Okay guys. So. made this file available inside your

01:42:30.180 --> 01:42:33.000
yesterday's lecture. So if you will go inside the resource

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.740
you will be able to find out another file called as fine

01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:38.940
tuning in gpu.gif file. So yeah everything is running in my

01:42:38.940 --> 01:42:41.760
system. You just have to run three files. One is setup one

01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:45.040
is train and one is basically launch the API. That's it.

01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:50.000
After doing like a after launching your machine in any like

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:54.100
a gpu platform. So that's it and everything is going to

01:42:54.100 --> 01:42:58.280
work. Has he has changed the directory in that was a

01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:01.000
directory issue. Isn't it sir? Yes. Yeah. So I have just

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:04.960
changed the directory in terms of API inferencing or model

01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:05.400
inferencing.

01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:15.320
Please explain pointing to train.py versus train.sh py is

01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:19.480
python file. sh is basically linux file. So any file

01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:22.380
starting ending with sh is basically it's a linux. It's a

01:43:22.380 --> 01:43:26.880
cell script basically. Dot py means it's a python file. So

01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:29.060
if you have to run some linux command. So in that case we

01:43:29.060 --> 01:43:32.120
keep everything inside sh or you can directly even type a sh

01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:36.600
linux command. The way I'm doing it like mkdir or ls or lsl

01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:43.000
or ch mode anything. For mac it's going to be same. So mac

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.360
is basically having a linux based kernel.

01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:53.480
Please help me to understand train all will download and

01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:57.040
model train as well. So basically train all h100 that we

01:43:57.040 --> 01:43:59.960
have over here. So I think I have already explained in my

01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:04.100
previous session that what this file is doing. So this file

01:44:04.100 --> 01:44:06.980
is not doing anything. Different. This file is trying to

01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:11.440
call all of these files. Right. The dpo fine tuning laura

01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:14.380
fine tuning quora preferred fine tuning all together in one

01:44:14.380 --> 01:44:18.060
single place. That's it. So and it's trying to run one by

01:44:18.060 --> 01:44:21.460
one one by one all of these files. That's it. This is

01:44:21.460 --> 01:44:25.280
something that my train all h100 is doing. If I have to do a

01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:28.480
training all together. Right. So if I have to train 5, 6, 10

01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:32.660
models all together. Otherwise we have our individual files

01:44:32.660 --> 01:44:35.780
available over here. So if I'm just looking for a dpo just

01:44:35.780 --> 01:44:39.140
looking for laura just looking for a qlaura or preferred I

01:44:39.140 --> 01:44:41.940
can directly call python and this file name the way I'm

01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:44.740
calling this train all simple. So I can go with the

01:44:44.740 --> 01:44:48.520
individual training. I can go with the like a train all.

01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:50.920
That's the reason I have created like a train all. So that I

01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:54.500
can like a train all the 5 models in one single go.

01:44:58.170 --> 01:45:02.170
Okay. So just just do it guys once. I know all of you are

01:45:02.170 --> 01:45:04.250
going to face an issue. I know some of you are feeling

01:45:04.250 --> 01:45:08.570
overwhelmed. That is completely okay. That happens. Not

01:45:08.570 --> 01:45:11.270
nothing new basically. But unless and until you are not

01:45:11.270 --> 01:45:15.410
going to try once on your own you will not be able to

01:45:15.410 --> 01:45:19.570
understand much. Today I have not done something different.

01:45:19.730 --> 01:45:22.310
So I have I'm just trying to like you know do a setup in my

01:45:22.310 --> 01:45:25.390
GPU so that you know I can do a training within a minute of

01:45:25.390 --> 01:45:28.190
time which we have done 1.3 minute or something it has taken

01:45:28.190 --> 01:45:32.590
for us. Ideally which will take around a 2 hour 3 hour of

01:45:32.590 --> 01:45:35.430
time in your machine or in my machine. Right. For the same

01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:38.490
epoch for the same parameter. So I have not even changed the

01:45:38.490 --> 01:45:41.610
parameter. If I have to train for maybe a 100 200 epoch. So

01:45:41.610 --> 01:45:44.510
again in my local system maybe it will take a couple of

01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:48.090
days. But here so you will be able to do it in just a couple

01:45:48.090 --> 01:45:51.090
of minute or maybe within an hour you will be able to do it

01:45:51.090 --> 01:45:54.610
even for a very very big epoch. That is the advantage. And

01:45:54.610 --> 01:45:56.630
that was the whole idea behind showing you this entire

01:45:56.630 --> 01:46:00.850
things entire setup. And even when we try to do a training

01:46:00.850 --> 01:46:04.850
we do a similar kind of a thing. So we always go ahead with

01:46:04.850 --> 01:46:11.110
the GPU approach not with the local. So local yes we just

01:46:11.110 --> 01:46:14.070
like to use it for a testing purpose whenever we are

01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:16.690
building a code whenever we are just starting ahead with the

01:46:16.690 --> 01:46:20.310
project. But finally when it comes to a training it always

01:46:20.310 --> 01:46:25.970
happens on these kind of a system as simple as that. So

01:46:25.970 --> 01:46:31.390
first run this setup.sh then train all the then train.sh and

01:46:31.390 --> 01:46:35.490
then API server.py file. Yeah that is a flow. You can call

01:46:35.490 --> 01:46:40.010
setup.sh you can call train.py file. or train all sh both is

01:46:40.010 --> 01:46:44.290
same. One is a like a Linux script and one is a Python file

01:46:44.290 --> 01:46:48.510
and then API server.py file. That is the only like things

01:46:48.510 --> 01:46:51.650
you have to do. So we do training in GPU then where do they

01:46:51.650 --> 01:46:55.050
keep the same model and influence it. Same model is here

01:46:55.050 --> 01:46:57.970
right. Same model is in the directory. Whatever directory

01:46:57.970 --> 01:47:00.710
you give will be in that directory. So let's suppose we are

01:47:00.710 --> 01:47:03.370
able to get this model right. And if I have to migrate this

01:47:03.370 --> 01:47:06.830
model to some other server. I can do it. I can like just do

01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:10.050
a scp and with the help of scp I can migrate to any other

01:47:10.050 --> 01:47:13.090
server that I want. If I would like to keep it here. So for

01:47:13.090 --> 01:47:16.270
now my model is available here itself right. If I will go

01:47:16.270 --> 01:47:19.610
into my cd models and if I do lsl everything is available

01:47:19.610 --> 01:47:23.550
see. So if I will go into my finance directory all my files

01:47:23.550 --> 01:47:26.210
are available. All my checkpointing files are available for

01:47:26.210 --> 01:47:29.510
a finance. All of these files. So this is my model. This is

01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:32.030
my checkpointing file and this is the model that I have.

01:47:32.690 --> 01:47:37.610
Basically. Yeah. So everything like will be available in

01:47:37.610 --> 01:47:41.470
your local directory and then depends where you are going to

01:47:41.470 --> 01:47:44.530
keep it. So wherever you are going to keep it. You will call

01:47:44.530 --> 01:47:46.550
an API from that place. This is what I am doing.

01:47:52.170 --> 01:47:56.790
Any other question guys for me. In want to deploy this on

01:47:56.790 --> 01:47:59.370
our server then we need to copy a trained model on our

01:47:59.370 --> 01:48:01.970
server. Yeah. So basically my models are available in my

01:48:01.970 --> 01:48:06.070
model directory. You can do a scp from here. So that you

01:48:06.070 --> 01:48:08.450
know you will be able to copy from here to any other server

01:48:08.450 --> 01:48:09.170
of your choice.

01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:19.320
Where do you change the value to true for cache or something

01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:22.080
in the code. It was not for a cache basically. It was for a

01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:26.220
tensor issue. It was like not able to understand the

01:48:26.220 --> 01:48:31.950
dependencies. Okay. Any other question guys. To get a best

01:48:31.950 --> 01:48:35.130
model we follow the same precision recall blue square etc.

01:48:35.250 --> 01:48:38.730
Right. In general. In general. But yeah. So even we have a

01:48:38.730 --> 01:48:41.130
task specific you know evaluation criteria.

01:48:43.930 --> 01:48:47.830
Now if docker part was success then this H100 can be shut

01:48:47.830 --> 01:48:50.810
down after complete folder extraction via docker. We can

01:48:50.830 --> 01:48:57.910
save a billion correct. Yeah. But if your client or if your

01:48:57.910 --> 01:49:00.270
requirement says that you have to keep your model up and

01:49:00.270 --> 01:49:03.970
running then you have to like keep it up and running. Yeah.

01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:10.940
So again. So we can even try to use a WinSAP. Models are

01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:14.260
already available here. Right. So maybe if you have to copy

01:49:14.260 --> 01:49:17.380
from this location to your windows location just drag and

01:49:17.380 --> 01:49:20.220
drop and then your model will be copied. This is how easy it

01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:24.360
is. But it will be like very time taking process. So if

01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:27.840
because file size is like a very very huge. But yeah you can

01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:29.960
you can copy just drag and drop and you will be able to copy

01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:33.200
into your local system. And then whenever you want maybe

01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:36.440
after one year you want to like use this model you will be

01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:39.880
able to use it once trained. Or maybe you can try to make

01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:42.320
this model public to everyone that okay I have trained this

01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:46.280
model and now go and just use it. So the way hugging faces

01:49:46.280 --> 01:49:49.920
release a model or the way any open source model works in

01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:52.500
this entire world. So everyone try to release the model

01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:55.420
right. Now your models are available here. You can go and

01:49:55.420 --> 01:50:00.980
you can release this model. Simple. Yeah. So this is how in

01:50:00.980 --> 01:50:04.180
reality things happen. So even we are able to create the

01:50:04.180 --> 01:50:07.080
model and we can make it open source that okay we have fine

01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:10.460
tuned the model on small data set. Maybe you can do it on a

01:50:10.460 --> 01:50:14.580
big data set and then you can like do it. Same thing we

01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:18.160
follow in our office dev environment and for UAT and prod

01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:20.820
gives same instruction. Yeah.

01:50:24.890 --> 01:50:28.070
Once fine tuning is done can we move the model in S3. You

01:50:28.070 --> 01:50:32.130
can move anywhere. You can move into maybe like a data lake.

01:50:32.290 --> 01:50:36.130
You can move into S3. In any file system you can move it.

01:50:36.270 --> 01:50:41.030
There won't be any kind of issue at all. You can move it

01:50:41.030 --> 01:50:46.630
even inside like this directory. That's okay. Yeah. So fine

01:50:46.630 --> 01:50:49.830
guys this is it. I have already uploaded the code. Try once.

01:50:49.990 --> 01:50:53.990
At least once in a life you all should do it. Right. So that

01:50:53.990 --> 01:50:58.390
you can write it down inside your you know resume that I

01:50:58.390 --> 01:51:01.490
have done a fine tuning on a GPU and this is something that

01:51:01.490 --> 01:51:05.650
I used to follow all the time and then people will ask you a

01:51:05.650 --> 01:51:08.390
question that what kind of issues that you have faced you

01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:11.610
will be able to talk about it. Right. In real. Right. And

01:51:11.610 --> 01:51:17.290
even in real this is how things happens. Will docker image

01:51:17.290 --> 01:51:20.650
contain models as well. So I think yes obviously. So in case

01:51:20.650 --> 01:51:23.870
of docker image so it copies all the folder into a docker

01:51:23.870 --> 01:51:27.050
location means into that box. Locker container.

01:51:31.020 --> 01:51:34.300
It copies everything all of your file. So technically it is

01:51:34.300 --> 01:51:37.340
it try to replicate everything that is running in your local

01:51:37.340 --> 01:51:43.260
in itself. Okay. That's it guys. That's it from my side.

01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:46.760
Hope all of you have liked this class. Now if you have any

01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:48.720
kind of a question so you can raise your hand so that I can

01:51:48.720 --> 01:51:51.340
answer and then we can go for the closer of today's class.

01:51:51.820 --> 01:51:55.380
Next class I will try to start with MCPs and A2A protocol

01:51:55.380 --> 01:51:59.220
basically. So MCP is something that we will try to learn and

01:51:59.220 --> 01:52:01.980
then after that A2A and then like so on. Yeah. Go ahead

01:52:01.980 --> 01:52:05.100
Uday. It was a requirement from Uday. Uday told me yesterday

01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:08.160
that can we discuss this so I said okay fine let's do it.

01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:12.540
So. Sir first of all thanks sir because this is very

01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:15.960
important for corporate and best best class sir. Thanks.

01:52:15.980 --> 01:52:18.980
Thanks for considering the request sir. I got to learn a

01:52:18.980 --> 01:52:24.360
lot. I always stuck here that You learn maximum things by

01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:27.240
looking at it. I mean like some different things don't

01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:30.220
happen. I mean same training same model everything is same.

01:52:30.260 --> 01:52:34.940
But there is a kind of a struggle that we go through when we

01:52:34.940 --> 01:52:37.840
actually try to run so that is the learning and apart from

01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:41.500
that code is same. There were no changes in code. Because

01:52:41.500 --> 01:52:44.320
sir I am from mechanical background so there is a barrier

01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:47.100
architectural wise that how this training will be done in

01:52:47.100 --> 01:52:52.720
GPU. Sir if you just once tell us the whole flow once that

01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:56.680
how it is done in corporate from Github that our repo runs.

01:52:57.240 --> 01:53:01.440
How do we fine tune it and then again use it we will tell

01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:04.120
you the whole flow once then it will be very easy. We are

01:53:04.120 --> 01:53:07.120
also able to use it. See what is here if I am going to share

01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:12.340
my screen once again so see what will happen anyhow my API

01:53:12.340 --> 01:53:15.920
is up and running. See people are able to hit my API so

01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:21.560
obviously what I have done so let me go through this folder

01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:21.920
hmm

01:53:26.230 --> 01:53:30.530
LSL so first of all what we will have to do we have to

01:53:30.530 --> 01:53:34.410
launch our GPU we have to launch a VM now once we will be

01:53:34.410 --> 01:53:37.950
able to launch a VM then we have to basically do a basic

01:53:37.950 --> 01:53:42.550
setup. Now let me show you my setup.py file for a real so

01:53:42.550 --> 01:53:45.110
that most of you will be able to understand what is there

01:53:45.110 --> 01:53:51.170
inside this setup.py file sorry setup.sh file so here if you

01:53:51.170 --> 01:53:54.170
will look into my setup.sh file I am not doing anything it

01:53:54.170 --> 01:53:57.350
is basically a Linux like a sales script that is been

01:53:57.350 --> 01:54:00.210
written echo means print by the way right so wherever you

01:54:00.210 --> 01:54:02.690
are able to see echo it simply means that it will print

01:54:02.690 --> 01:54:05.510
something in your console and here we have written efels

01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:08.470
efels kind of a things so first of all we are trying to

01:54:08.470 --> 01:54:12.990
check whether we have a h100 GPU or not right so if GPU is

01:54:12.990 --> 01:54:15.990
available so we are trying to like you know just show you

01:54:15.990 --> 01:54:20.130
the message that okay GPU is available and then what we are

01:54:20.130 --> 01:54:22.890
trying to do so we are trying to install the packages so

01:54:22.890 --> 01:54:25.910
basically I will be having a blank system so when I am going

01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:28.370
to launch a GPU for the very first time there will be

01:54:28.370 --> 01:54:31.290
nothing nothing installed inside that so obviously I have to

01:54:31.290 --> 01:54:33.850
install each and everything so to install each and

01:54:33.850 --> 01:54:36.950
everything inside a Linux machine sudo apt install so apt

01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:41.230
install and python 3.1 pip virtual environment git curl w

01:54:41.230 --> 01:54:44.010
git everything which is essential right maybe in some

01:54:44.010 --> 01:54:46.430
project you need 10 more things so you will try to install

01:54:46.430 --> 01:54:48.510
so this is just an installation command it is going to

01:54:48.510 --> 01:54:52.170
execute now once this is done so once basic installation is

01:54:52.170 --> 01:54:54.670
done then we are trying to install a docker if I need docker

01:54:54.670 --> 01:54:57.750
if I don't need docker then I will not install so I need a

01:54:57.750 --> 01:55:00.090
docker so I am trying to install a docker now to install a

01:55:00.090 --> 01:55:03.550
docker only this command is going to work right so one will

01:55:03.550 --> 01:55:06.530
like get a docker and then it will try to install a docker

01:55:06.530 --> 01:55:09.250
rest is just a echo as you can see right just rest is just a

01:55:09.250 --> 01:55:13.530
echo now once I will be able to install a docker then we

01:55:13.530 --> 01:55:16.490
have to basically install Nvidia dependency basically my GPU

01:55:16.490 --> 01:55:19.830
dependency I have to basically install over here right for a

01:55:19.830 --> 01:55:22.630
docker so this is what I am trying to do in terms of like

01:55:22.630 --> 01:55:26.030
curl means I am downloading all those requirements and then

01:55:26.030 --> 01:55:28.510
I am trying to update my packages and then I am trying to

01:55:28.510 --> 01:55:30.790
update my Nvidia container and then I am trying to again

01:55:30.790 --> 01:55:33.610
restart my docker so that my docker will be having a GPU

01:55:33.610 --> 01:55:38.550
access here this command will be done now so we are just

01:55:38.550 --> 01:55:40.570
trying to test over here that okay everything is working

01:55:40.570 --> 01:55:43.730
fine or not with respect to a Nvidia configuration that we

01:55:43.730 --> 01:55:47.010
have done for a docker then we are trying to create a

01:55:47.010 --> 01:55:49.370
virtual environment the way we are used to create a virtual

01:55:49.370 --> 01:55:51.530
environment right although I have not used it because even

01:55:51.530 --> 01:55:54.230
in my base environment I have python 3.10 right which I have

01:55:54.230 --> 01:55:57.810
installed in a very first place here itself right even here

01:55:57.810 --> 01:56:03.510
so this is a base environment python installation so I can

01:56:03.510 --> 01:56:05.890
go with my base I can go with the virtual environment same

01:56:05.890 --> 01:56:09.050
thing we do even in local system so here I am trying to do

01:56:09.050 --> 01:56:12.550
that installation and then like other python dependency what

01:56:12.550 --> 01:56:16.670
is the dependency so this fast api uvcon numpy pandas scikit

01:56:16.670 --> 01:56:20.150
and all those like kuda library I am trying to like install

01:56:20.150 --> 01:56:25.070
a python dependencies so once this is basically like a done

01:56:25.070 --> 01:56:29.510
right so we are like trying to set all those variables which

01:56:29.510 --> 01:56:32.090
is required for like my my particular test environment right

01:56:32.110 --> 01:56:33.530
so we are going to do the training with respect to python

01:56:33.530 --> 01:56:36.270
file and everyone and then we are giving a ch mode execution

01:56:36.270 --> 01:56:42.390
access to it and then we are going for a complete setup so

01:56:42.390 --> 01:56:47.710
this is a file which is helping me out to do a setup in a

01:56:47.710 --> 01:56:52.290
single sort if you want to do a setup in a step-by-step

01:56:52.290 --> 01:56:56.090
manner again you can you can skip this file execution that's

01:56:56.090 --> 01:56:59.870
completely fine so what you can do just go to this file and

01:56:59.870 --> 01:57:03.690
then start from here install execute this command first then

01:57:04.230 --> 01:57:07.390
execute this command first leave the echo part right so

01:57:07.390 --> 01:57:09.510
execute this command means first of all environment setup

01:57:09.950 --> 01:57:13.410
then docker installation then nvidia docker installation

01:57:13.410 --> 01:57:17.030
dependency so curl command leave the echo part just like

01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:19.970
execute sudo and curl so that it will download and it will

01:57:19.970 --> 01:57:23.430
try to install and then like a python virtual environment

01:57:23.430 --> 01:57:26.890
created the way we try to create it in my local system and

01:57:26.890 --> 01:57:31.610
yeah again I can I can try to you know copy this one so okay

01:57:31.610 --> 01:57:38.230
let me like just copy this one and maybe I can go to Yuri

01:57:38.230 --> 01:57:41.950
over here and I say that that okay so

01:57:48.990 --> 01:57:53.130
I'll just copy and paste everything and I'll say that that I

01:57:53.130 --> 01:58:02.490
don't want to run this all together do one thing for me give

01:58:02.490 --> 01:58:07.530
me all the steps and command in

01:58:09.770 --> 01:58:15.690
individual manner yeah so let's send this one fine

01:58:21.130 --> 01:58:25.310
so obviously GPT will be able to understand you are saving

01:58:25.310 --> 01:58:27.610
your time right you are saving your time so it is it is

01:58:27.610 --> 01:58:30.330
giving my individual command right and as you can see it has

01:58:30.330 --> 01:58:33.790
given you the same command that I told you yeah so you know

01:58:33.790 --> 01:58:38.530
step number one no need to check if h100 you know if h100 is

01:58:38.530 --> 01:58:41.410
available nvidia smi is showing you the things no need to

01:58:41.410 --> 01:58:44.650
check these things simply start from here right sudo apt

01:58:44.650 --> 01:58:47.230
install y this this this install then docker then install

01:58:47.230 --> 01:58:51.050
nvidia container toolkit then test the docker if everything

01:58:51.050 --> 01:58:53.350
is going to work fine then test will work fine we are not

01:58:53.350 --> 01:58:56.290
doing anything except echo over here then create a virtual

01:58:56.290 --> 01:58:59.370
python environment simple right then install the

01:58:59.370 --> 01:59:02.070
dependencies for that environment and then like a set up a

01:59:02.070 --> 01:59:05.510
project directory by the way and then like a create h100 so

01:59:05.510 --> 01:59:09.250
exactly same thing same bifurcation of each and every line

01:59:09.250 --> 01:59:11.970
of a command it has given to you no need to do anything you

01:59:11.970 --> 01:59:14.470
don't need to execute this file altogether one by one step

01:59:14.470 --> 01:59:18.170
by step just execute all of these commands as simple as that

01:59:18.170 --> 01:59:22.410
right like I said you can skip the echo part now this is

01:59:22.410 --> 01:59:25.670
going to help me out in terms of preparing my system means

01:59:25.670 --> 01:59:29.290
installing all the prerequisite the way we do it with

01:59:29.290 --> 01:59:32.570
respect to requirement.txt file or any other files once this

01:59:32.570 --> 01:59:35.350
is done then we are trying to call what so then we are

01:59:35.350 --> 01:59:39.110
trying to call basically train all h100 dot pi file or maybe

01:59:39.110 --> 01:59:42.770
you can try to call dot sh file so sh is nothing but your

01:59:42.770 --> 01:59:46.430
like a cell script based and python is not pi file is

01:59:46.430 --> 01:59:49.230
nothing but a python based you can call either of these what

01:59:49.230 --> 01:59:52.850
we are doing internally into this one so if you will go and

01:59:52.850 --> 01:59:56.650
check basically in any of these files for example I'm

01:59:56.650 --> 01:59:59.190
talking about let's suppose these files right so we have to

01:59:59.190 --> 02:00:02.730
do a training so here we are not doing anything different it

02:00:02.730 --> 02:00:05.790
is getting into my directory which directory the directory

02:00:05.790 --> 02:00:08.050
where I have a code for fine-tuning right different

02:00:08.050 --> 02:00:10.190
different code so getting in directory and then executing

02:00:10.190 --> 02:00:13.190
that code with all the parameter whatever parameter is

02:00:13.190 --> 02:00:17.230
required so basically to execute this fine-tuning I need

02:00:17.230 --> 02:00:20.950
this data set I need basically a location where I will save

02:00:20.950 --> 02:00:24.310
my model epoch-basis learning rate whatever so this is the

02:00:24.310 --> 02:00:28.290
only command we are trying to execute technically right even

02:00:28.290 --> 02:00:30.490
if you'll go and check your dot pi file we are not doing

02:00:30.490 --> 02:00:33.990
anything different to here so same we are trying to call all

02:00:33.990 --> 02:00:37.270
together this one if I don't want to do it that's also fine

02:00:37.270 --> 02:00:39.990
I can simply call python 3 dpo fine-tuning dot pi file

02:00:40.010 --> 02:00:43.890
python 3 laura fine-tuning dot pi file python 3 or python

02:00:43.890 --> 02:00:47.030
preferred fine-tuning dot pi file so one by one one by one

02:00:47.030 --> 02:00:50.150
also I can do a training and I will be able to save the

02:00:50.150 --> 02:00:53.450
model but this is a file I have created so that I will be

02:00:53.450 --> 02:00:55.930
able to save some time and I will be able to test it and

02:00:55.930 --> 02:01:00.510
debug it all together so technically it's like nothing once

02:01:00.510 --> 02:01:04.530
it will be done so it is going to save a model inside a

02:01:04.530 --> 02:01:07.950
model directory so like a file by file whatever directory

02:01:07.950 --> 02:01:09.990
time that you have given it will save the model so this is

02:01:10.010 --> 02:01:11.850
going to save the model now once model will be saved we are

02:01:11.850 --> 02:01:15.390
trying to call what we are trying to call our API so API is

02:01:15.390 --> 02:01:17.870
nothing but like yesterday we have already discussed about

02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:21.770
it right so it is going to basically okay what what has

02:01:21.770 --> 02:01:25.110
happened start the API okay API server so API server dot pi

02:01:25.110 --> 02:01:28.930
file we are trying to call and here so we are doing what HR

02:01:28.930 --> 02:01:31.970
model finance model sales model means we are just trying to

02:01:31.970 --> 02:01:34.210
hit this directory and exposing it to the outer world so

02:01:34.210 --> 02:01:38.070
that anyone can pass the data anyone can do a curl anyone

02:01:38.070 --> 02:01:41.510
can like a hit my API's and they will be able to you know

02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:46.410
inference with respect to any of my model yeah next step

02:01:46.410 --> 02:01:49.590
what you can do so maybe next step if you have to build that

02:01:49.590 --> 02:01:53.230
as a product so maybe next step wise the way we have done

02:01:53.230 --> 02:01:55.830
that we are giving you a multi-model access over here right

02:01:55.830 --> 02:01:59.350
HR model finance model sales model this model you can you

02:01:59.350 --> 02:02:02.450
can just create a beautiful UI interface over here and then

02:02:02.450 --> 02:02:05.090
whenever I am going to select this model it is going to hit

02:02:05.710 --> 02:02:08.430
let's suppose sales model when I'm whenever I'm going to

02:02:08.430 --> 02:02:11.910
select this model so it should hit my HR model or maybe a

02:02:11.910 --> 02:02:14.670
finance model so maybe in this way I can try to just do a

02:02:14.670 --> 02:02:18.310
inferencing and in a UI I will be able to show the result as

02:02:18.310 --> 02:02:22.350
of now I am able to showcase a result right so my result is

02:02:22.350 --> 02:02:26.510
visible but where so I am able to showcase it into a swagger

02:02:26.510 --> 02:02:30.530
yeah so I am able to test it anyhow so if API is working I

02:02:30.530 --> 02:02:34.710
can integrate in any device any application whatever I want

02:02:34.710 --> 02:02:39.430
and wherever I want as simple as that so this is the only

02:02:39.430 --> 02:02:42.990
thing that we are doing if you like go and try to understand

02:02:42.990 --> 02:02:46.550
this piece of things you will feel like it's the same thing

02:02:46.550 --> 02:02:52.750
right it's it's nothing different yeah fine yes yes thanks

02:02:52.750 --> 02:02:56.970
thanks a lot sir yeah thanks thanks a lot okay so okay next

02:02:56.970 --> 02:03:02.330
one side go ahead with the question so so thank you so much

02:03:02.330 --> 02:03:05.170
for this session it was really wonderful session sir we are

02:03:05.170 --> 02:03:08.590
training it on a base model or are you making your own model

02:03:08.590 --> 02:03:10.890
sir no no no base model we are not doing the complete

02:03:10.890 --> 02:03:15.470
training yesterday we talked about it last week sir I

02:03:15.470 --> 02:03:19.530
dropped it somewhere in the agency you will see it anywhere

02:03:19.530 --> 02:03:23.770
in any model so we are always taking a model that we are

02:03:23.770 --> 02:03:25.950
taking this tiny llama correct correct we are taking a

02:03:25.950 --> 02:03:30.130
Facebook model basically so a question on top of this if I

02:03:30.130 --> 02:03:32.550
just give the name of this model will it automatically

02:03:32.550 --> 02:03:35.610
download it or I don't know anything no no no just we are

02:03:35.610 --> 02:03:37.310
taking a hugging face model we are downloading all these

02:03:37.310 --> 02:03:39.430
models are available in the hugging face and in the hugging

02:03:39.430 --> 02:03:42.310
face there are 10,000 models like this available so how do I

02:03:42.310 --> 02:03:46.250
know how do we know I gave the name of the model yes

02:03:46.250 --> 02:03:50.290
basically if you go this we told you yesterday I think you

02:03:50.290 --> 02:03:54.230
missed yesterday I am sorry about it okay so we told the

02:03:54.230 --> 02:03:59.090
same thing yesterday if we go to the hugging face okay here

02:03:59.090 --> 02:04:04.210
let's suppose and go here click inside the model so let's

02:04:04.210 --> 02:04:09.470
suppose I want a model gpt os okay so oss which is the

02:04:09.470 --> 02:04:11.950
largest model of gpt see 20 billion and 120 billion

02:04:11.950 --> 02:04:14.510
parameter model which is the latest they have open sourced

02:04:14.510 --> 02:04:17.990
after two years yes yes correct correct yes so if I want to

02:04:17.990 --> 02:04:21.550
train this model no problem so here is its total id so we

02:04:21.550 --> 02:04:24.650
will copy it okay we will copy the id and you don't have to

02:04:24.650 --> 02:04:27.550
do anything by copying the id just paste it here the rest of

02:04:27.550 --> 02:04:30.130
the work will be done by itself okay so we do not have to

02:04:30.130 --> 02:04:33.410
give the like a hugging face openai key or anything no no no

02:04:33.410 --> 02:04:35.630
no open source model is there if you are training in hugging

02:04:35.630 --> 02:04:39.530
face its environment then that api key etc. token etc. is

02:04:39.530 --> 02:04:42.990
needed if you are trying it locally to access it otherwise

02:04:42.990 --> 02:04:45.550
there is no need which is open source is open source which

02:04:45.550 --> 02:04:48.310
is proprietary which is called hugging face that you cannot

02:04:48.310 --> 02:04:52.250
download in that case like you will have to do otherwise

02:04:52.250 --> 02:04:55.810
there is no need okay one more question is hugging face how

02:04:55.810 --> 02:05:00.510
will I know sir I can download this model I can use it will

02:05:00.510 --> 02:05:03.450
be given there basically if you go down here then it is

02:05:03.450 --> 02:05:06.330
given in every model that see model you have given here you

02:05:06.330 --> 02:05:08.970
can download in the pipeline whatever is open source model

02:05:08.970 --> 02:05:13.030
in hugging face you can download it is that hugging face

02:05:13.030 --> 02:05:15.210
also it does not control basically you will come here in the

02:05:15.210 --> 02:05:17.950
file here okay download download option is visible in all of

02:05:17.950 --> 02:05:21.710
them, its model is its meaning that we can download ok great

02:05:21.710 --> 02:05:23.930
sir thank you sir thank you so much ok in all you will see

02:05:23.930 --> 02:05:26.110
here ok open source model is not the model of hugging face

02:05:26.110 --> 02:05:30.970
hugging face you told us 120 billion you told us how we can

02:05:30.970 --> 02:05:33.730
inferencing it using that like it is already already done

02:05:35.350 --> 02:05:38.950
you told us one month before if you want to train it

02:05:38.950 --> 02:05:41.670
yourself then you can train it what we are doing in this

02:05:41.670 --> 02:05:44.970
same same same we can do the current model we are using has

02:05:44.970 --> 02:05:48.690
1.1 billion parameters if you want to like use 120 means

02:05:48.690 --> 02:05:51.370
this is the best of best model then you train it what is the

02:05:51.370 --> 02:05:53.810
problem okay great thank you so much sir thank you so much

02:05:53.810 --> 02:05:57.190
okay okay fine guys so if you don't have any kind of a

02:05:57.190 --> 02:06:03.030
question then we will close a lecture for today hope all of

02:06:03.030 --> 02:06:06.050
you have liked it enjoyed it agenda for next week is fixed

02:06:06.050 --> 02:06:10.870
so but yeah do it once in your life that is can you please

02:06:10.870 --> 02:06:15.110
show what directory changes you tweaked nothing actually see

02:06:15.110 --> 02:06:20.550
basically in my local system so I have given a directory

02:06:21.210 --> 02:06:26.450
over here let me go into API server so here what I have done

02:06:26.450 --> 02:06:34.580
basically I am just like a calling these models and it is

02:06:34.580 --> 02:06:37.660
looking into this directory this directory right so in my

02:06:37.660 --> 02:06:40.520
local system directory name was different and in GPU so

02:06:40.520 --> 02:06:43.260
directory name was different so what I have done I have just

02:06:43.260 --> 02:06:47.100
like a made this changes sales finance that's it so whatever

02:06:47.100 --> 02:06:50.780
directory that I have created on GPU side I just made that

02:06:50.780 --> 02:06:52.800
so that it will start looking for a model in that directory

02:06:52.800 --> 02:06:56.680
that is the only change which I have done nothing else yeah

02:06:56.680 --> 02:07:00.100
okay fine guys troubleshooting is the best part of the class

02:07:00.100 --> 02:07:02.560
yeah exactly see this is how real development happens

02:07:02.560 --> 02:07:06.260
teaching wise what we do as a teacher so we like prepare our

02:07:06.260 --> 02:07:09.540
material we you know come to the class and then you know

02:07:09.540 --> 02:07:13.360
reiterate those materials and obviously at that point of a

02:07:13.360 --> 02:07:16.440
time you will not be able to see our errors because before

02:07:16.440 --> 02:07:19.000
even coming to the class we have already executed those

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:24.340
materials like you know maybe 10 times so but yeah in terms

02:07:24.340 --> 02:07:27.400
of real development it never goes without debugging we

02:07:27.400 --> 02:07:30.420
always have to go with the debugging and even teaching wise

02:07:30.420 --> 02:07:33.700
like if things are simple then doesn't take time even for us

02:07:33.700 --> 02:07:37.920
like you know to fix it in a live classes but if something

02:07:37.920 --> 02:07:41.600
is a real time then it will give you a real pain

02:07:44.700 --> 02:07:47.340
can we create a image on a one two yeah you can do that yes

02:07:47.340 --> 02:07:52.240
you can create okay thanks everyone take care see you again

02:07:52.240 --> 02:07:54.640
next class Saturday same time thank you
