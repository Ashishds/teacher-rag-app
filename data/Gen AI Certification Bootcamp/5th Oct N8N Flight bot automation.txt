WEBVTT

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.890
okay so hi everyone i think i'm audible and visible to all

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.810
of you right so if you confirm me yes or no okay so good

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.850
morning everyone happy sunday so we'll start with the class

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.990
in some time maybe like in two three minute more we'll wait

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.710
and then we are going to start with the class

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.540
okay so let's start guys uh good morning good morning

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.740
everyone good morning yeah so let's start so let me set an

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.480
agenda for today so today we are going to see two uh flows

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.380
uh or you can say a workflow in inside initn and then we are

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.360
going to see some sort of a setup with respect to autogen so

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.940
autogen setup will take not more than two three minute of

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.920
time because it's just a pip command by which you will be

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.300
able to configure autogen uh if you are looking for a ui

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.620
mode if you are not looking for a ui mode if you are looking

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.680
for a complete code mode so in that case it's a normal

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.420
library installer so we are going to start with the class so

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.040
let's start with the installation even in case of a ui mode

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.080
it's a simple library installation and then hitting a local

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.200
url this is how like a autogen is and then if i'm looking

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.640
for something in library board so the way we have written an

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.140
agents and the tool and memories and everything so in the

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.880
similar way we can go we will talk about this in a later

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.220
stage not now but yeah so first of all i would like to show

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.100
you two n8n so even in my previous class we were talking

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.660
about anything i have already shared all the assets uh

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.240
whatever dhruv has discussed with uh all of us and uh even

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.300
before so we were talking about n8n and uh in the future

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.640
most probably this month or maybe not this month then next

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.380
month so we are planning to bring uh a very extensive

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.600
automation kind of uh like you know a course or you can say

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:55.000
a module where we are going to do a lot of just automation i

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.880
would say that will be like just for an automation so where

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.840
we are going to do automation for a ceos founders uh HR

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.920
person marketing person so that we can and that to our like

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.220
a production label basically like uh anyone and everyone can

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.540
use that automation flow configure the credentials with any

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.160
of their system and then it's it's done like their task and

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.800
everything will be automated automatically and they will

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.720
keep on like you know uh just looking at some of the

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.740
messaging app and then just by using some of the messaging

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.640
app they will be able to do uh their daily tasks so we are

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.820
listed as like working on that part as well but yeah that

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.740
that's a separate discussion so I will not get into that now

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:43.800
uh why I can't remove what's a group I think we are living

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.120
in democracy so it's fine everyone is having an opinion uh I

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:52.160
don't have much of issues uh with anyone personally so it's

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:58.080
okay uh I'm a mentor right so I should not have this uh kind

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:58.500
of opinion

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.640
yeah good morning good morning everyone those who have

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.200
joined a bit late right so I was I was like let me repeat

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.220
myself so I was basically talking about uh agenda for today

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:20.040
so today we are going to see some of the automations with

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.980
respect to n8n and that's nothing but extension of the

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.080
previous class because even in previous class and a previous

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.820
to previous class we were talking about n8n and hope all of

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:34.340
you are liking this discussion especially this n8n kind of a

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.560
discussion so I'm assuming that that all of you are able to

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.820
see something real that okay yeah in in real world in real

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:45.280
life yes there are a lot of tasks that we do on a repetitive

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.080
manner and that can be automated easily right that can be

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.840
automated easily with the help of n8n and that too in a

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.660
stable mode so I'm assuming that you are liking this n8n

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.320
things more than langchain lang graph or those like llama

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.640
indexes and other libraries right because you don't have to

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:07.960
even write a code over drop configure and yes there is a

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.400
code block uh but yeah as we all understand the meaning of

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.500
agents meaning of memory meaning of tools so we all are able

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.060
to configure it and believe me it's a beautiful tool it's a

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.960
beautiful tool uh there was a another tool I was like uh

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.580
trying to explore um I think I have already created a video

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:29.240
uh for that so there is something called as gum loop right

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.680
there is a tool called as gum loop and even I have shown you

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:37.240
that even crew is coming up with that so where you just have

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.940
to type something as a prompt and then it will try to create

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.700
a flow and then you can just try to go and configure the

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:47.160
flow so even crew is coming up with that I'll show you

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.060
autogen autogen installation autogen configuration so

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:53.640
autogen works in two mode one is a pure code based mode so

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.640
where you have to write a code just like a langchain lang

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.440
graph and another mode is a ui mode basically so most rarely

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.940
we'll go through the ui mode but you will be able to find

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:05.800
out that uh yeah everyone is trying to come up with the uh

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.720
such kind of a solution because at the end of the day if I'm

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.460
talking about automation majorly automation like uh happens

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:17.580
even in a non-tech site right for example sales marketing uh

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:22.140
HR job or any kind of a CEO related or CEO office founders

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.960
office CXO's office related job so over there we do a

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:29.680
repetitive task we check our reports or we try to like

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.380
schedule a to-do's or maybe your CTO's

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.780
you have to break it down a lot of things a lot of this

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.780
repeated task happens scrum happens right minutes of

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:44.780
meetings we have to take so all this repeated task and this

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:49.400
repetitive task can we can we can easily handle or I can say

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:54.780
can be handled uh almost like a 90 plus right almost 90 plus

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.300
so that is something that I will be talking about in the

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.100
next batch uh the automation batch which I am planning so

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:03.260
I'm still in discussion with my team and other people uh

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:07.340
that and we have created new syllabus but yeah that is the

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:10.180
agenda for a future so we'll try to bring those things in

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.440
future in future months maybe next not like this month we'll

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:18.610
make an announcement just announcement so that back to where

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:21.910
we can automate it but yeah as I was saying there are many

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:24.610
people there are many platforms who are trying to bring a

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:27.930
exact same thing like in it in kind of a things because

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:32.150
somewhere in terms of automation uh this is how the future

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:36.310
looks like right a low code platform or you can say a no

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:40.670
code it it won't be no code but yeah it will be low code but

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:45.570
even to configure and even to do this kind of automation you

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:49.870
have to have a technical capabilities it's not like some non

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:53.530
-tech people can come and then they will be able to do uh

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:57.750
you know automation easily because every time we are talking

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:01.170
about API keys secrets we are talking about authentication

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:04.890
authorization right every time you will see in this kind of

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:07.430
automation and obviously if you are going to ask some

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:10.470
marketing guy that what is the API and then how you are

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:14.190
going to configure uh secrets v2s or something like that we

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:17.330
do auth or something uh they will not be able to do that

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.550
right they will not be able to do that or they will take

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:21.590
time I'm not saying that they will not be able to do that

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:25.170
they will be but not on a first day they will take some time

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:28.850
maybe they will take their own sweet time of a learning and

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:31.570
this is where again a big opportunity comes into a picture

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:34.770
for all of us right for all of us big opportunity comes into

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:40.010
a picture that uh good automation right to a people to a

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:43.670
socials and then yeah get some opportunity grab grab

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:46.890
something out of it right and there can be a millions of

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:50.570
such automation a customized automation I would say is

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:53.970
possible because everyone is having a different task flow

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:57.070
now one of such automation I'm going to discuss in my

00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:00.570
today's class not one two actually I'll be talking about and

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:04.170
then I'll move to the next chapter which is uh basically in

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:08.250
sorry autogen so I believe the question is visible to all of

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:13.840
you guys will Dhruv be mentored there in automation bad so

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.220
what do you want you want Dhruv as a mentor in that batch uh

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:29.690
yeah you can give an opinion like I said so we are in a

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:36.330
democracy so I don't have like uh okay no no means I will be

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.790
there apart from me like uh okay

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:47.480
we will decide later so we'll decide later yeah first let's

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:54.880
try to like uh you know do some sort of automation So, what

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.940
we are going to do today in terms of automation, basically

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:03.480
there is a website or you can say you will be able to find

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.080
out a platform, a lot of platforms out there, so what they

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:11.020
do, so basically they help a travel industry, right, they

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.680
help a travel industry and what they do, so basically they

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.400
try to provide you a flight detail, they try to provide you

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.820
basically a hotels detail, right and they try to provide you

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.840
all the tools and travels destination worldwide, right,

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.820
worldwide. So for example, if I talk about a map, so there

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:32.560
are very few companies you will be able to find out in the

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:38.500
entire world who actually works on a map API, so who is

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:42.340
having their own map API, right, there are very few

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.400
companies, you can just name it on a hand itself, right, so

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.140
like in a single digit you will be able to find out such

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:52.340
kind of a company and the entire world. Because everyone is

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.000
trying to build any kind of application, so obviously

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.180
somewhere they have to consume their map API, right, maybe

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.920
Ola, maybe Uber, so they may consume a Google map or maybe

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:07.420
some other maps, map APIs and again, so a people who are

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.780
like, you know, in an automobile industry and they are

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:12.300
developing something with respect to a location, with

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.000
respect to geography, you have to do that, if you are into a

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.600
real estate industry, again you will end up consuming map

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.960
API. If you are into some service industry again. Okay.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.400
Maybe some like, you know, transportation industry again,

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:27.060
you will end up consuming map and all those APIs. So almost

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.920
all the work, the entire world, right, entire world uses to

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.500
consume those map API. Similarly, so if I will talk about

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:40.100
basically this travel situation, right, so where you have to

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.680
go and book a flight, so you have to check the hotels and

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:46.120
then you have to basically check all the tourist destination

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.480
across a globe, right, across a globe including India and

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:53.480
outside. So there are very few people, right, or you can say

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:57.880
there are very few like API provider, right, those who try

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:01.060
to maintain the entire database and they are going to

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:04.700
provide you all the details that too in a real time. So

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:08.580
Amadeus is one of such platform, you all will be able to

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.440
find out and apart from Amadeus, there are like one or two

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.700
you will be able to find out, right, Kiwi, something like

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.700
that, you will be able to find out. So where they try to

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.220
maintain this flight detail. Okay. Okay. So in this hotel

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:24.080
detail, they try to maintain basically this entire travel

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:29.000
destinations, everything in a single places where as an

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.400
enterprise, you can try to consume their APIs and then you

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.740
can try to build any kind of application on top of it and

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.700
again, it is a need of an industry, right, it is a need of

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:43.160
an industry because it is a need of a like a you can say 8

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.460
billion people because everyone would like to book some sort

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:49.260
of a flight at some point of a time. Everyone book will try

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.440
to book some sort of a, you know, tours and travels and

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.440
maybe a hotels, right, every time. So it's actually a need

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.540
of everyone, right, actually a need of everyone. So what we

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:03.720
are going to do, so we are going to build a bot today where

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.080
so we are going to give maybe our like a source and

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:10.200
destination. So from where to where we are traveling, by the

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:15.580
way, and maybe like we can we can try to give a date there

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:18.460
that, okay, so I'm traveling from this place. So this place

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:22.440
and this is the date. Now do one thing. So try to search a

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.260
flight for me, right. So whatever flights are available,

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:29.320
give me a flight and then maybe I can even write a logic on

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.920
top of this that okay, so maybe a trigger kind of things I

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:36.260
can try to write over there that okay, so if price is more

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:40.140
than this, right, price is more than this or price is less

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:44.940
than this or price is in between this, so only give me those

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:47.860
flight detail. Don't give me other flight details.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:51.400
Basically, right, the whole purpose will be to see the

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:54.540
automations, automation and integration with some outside

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.480
system, right, a system which is not available directly

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:02.260
inside a system which is available outside so that maybe I

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.020
can I can just like, you know, ping my bot that okay, fine.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.320
So I'm looking for a flight from this place to this place at

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:11.800
this time. Now my bot will up and running continuously and

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:15.100
then like whenever those flight details will be available as

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.500
per my need or as per my condition. Which I'm going to

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:22.080
configure, it will send me the detail so that you know, I

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:26.220
don't have to go and sit on like a website or maybe I have

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.840
to go and open up an app again and again and again and again

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:32.600
and I don't have to, you know, do anything. My like a bot

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.480
will keep on watching these things for me. So this is the

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.820
kind of automation that we are going to see in today's class

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:42.620
automation. Automation number one automation number two. So

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:46.000
we receive a lot of mails right and inside our mails. So

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.920
let's suppose. If I have subscribed to so many services, so

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.580
obviously they will keep on sending an invoice. For example,

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:55.860
I have subscribed to maybe AWS service, right? So obviously

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.900
they will send me invoice at like every first or second,

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:02.180
right? Maybe I have subscribed for a MongoDB, so again they

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:04.640
will send me the invoice. I have subscribed for Eraser.io,

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.240
so they will send me the invoice. I have subscribed for like

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.220
a chat GPT, so they will send me the invoice. So basically

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:14.040
we are going to automate our invoice. So there will be a bot

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.860
which will keep on watching or keep on checking. On a

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.400
regular basis by mail ID, whatever mail I am going to

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.900
configure, I can configure multiple mails as well, right? So

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.940
it will keep on watching my mails and then what will happen?

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.820
So whenever there will be an invoice because I can receive

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:31.500
any kind of a mails. So whenever there will be an invoice,

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:35.260
what system will do? So system will try to like, you know,

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:40.180
take those mails and then like send it to me giving me a

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.560
notification that yeah, you have an invoice at this

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:45.320
particular place, maybe I can try to create a separate excel

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.580
sheet somewhere. And then I can try to store all of those

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.800
invoices there. I will be able to manage and maintain

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.440
instead of, you know, missing out some of the invoices

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.800
instead of, you know, missing out some of the bills or maybe

00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.160
a payments because some of the invoices will be pre-built,

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.060
some of the invoices I just have to go and I have to make

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.260
the payment. For example, AWS, right? They will send you

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:08.060
invoice, but it won't be pre-built, right? You have to go

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:10.440
and you have to make the payments, maybe some other

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.920
services. So it will be pre-built itself means auto

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.700
detection mode basically, right? So it will. they will auto

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.180
-detection. So in this case, I will be able to keep and

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:22.860
watch on my invoices and yeah, so I don't have to even look

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:26.000
into my mail or I don't have even have to like have a fear

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.280
of missing out any kind of invoices. So this is, this is the

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:34.440
two flow, both flows are basically a separate flow. So this

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:38.040
is the first and second flow we are going to create one by

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:42.000
one, one by one. So shall we start guys, these two things by

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.600
using any 10.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:54.780
Yeah. Okay. So let's do it then basically. So first of all,

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:58.580
you have to go to Amadeus, not Amadeus, you have to go to a

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:02.680
developer.amadeus.com and just create an account over there.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.980
So it's, it's free by the way, for testing purposes, right?

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.760
But yeah. So if you are deploying this in a production, then

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.860
you have to pay for the API. But as of now for testing

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.800
purpose, you don't have to make any kind of a payment. You

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:17.600
don't have to even add a card and just, just like go there.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:21.180
Yeah. Just go there. Just go there, developer.amadeus.com

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:24.220
and then try to do a registration. Once you will be able to

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.300
do a registration, then you have to log in after

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:28.840
verification and once you will be able to log in, then

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:32.440
bingo, we are, we are like, you know, good to go ahead with

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:36.340
a flight search, hotel search, or maybe a airport search or

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:40.140
maybe an airline search, flight booking, everything you can

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.040
do it actually, right? So if I'll have to show you the

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.960
services that they used to provide, so they provide

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.960
everything. So flight offer search, flight offer price,

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.420
flight create offer price, flight create offer order, order

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:53.660
management, seat map display. So basically you, you have

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:57.380
like everything. You can, you can try to, you know, build

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:00.580
your own, make my trip kind of a things by the way. Yeah.

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:03.420
By, by attaching some different business model. This is what

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:06.560
everyone doing, right? They don't maintain, for example, if

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.800
I think we all know, make my trip and easy my trip and all

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:13.560
those platforms, right? We all have used it. We all have

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.420
used this kind of a platform at some point of a time in our

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:22.750
life. Yes. Everyone. Yeah. So if you are launching such kind

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:25.170
of a businesses at some point of a time, so obviously you

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:29.030
will end up consuming some sort of APIs from them and uh,

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:32.690
yeah, so your user are going to interact technically in a

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:35.510
backend with those APIs to pick a flight ticket to cancel

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:40.510
it. And then what is the make my trip business model? They

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:44.130
just charge a commission. That's it. On every booking that

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:47.270
you do with respect to a hotel or with respect to something.

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:50.290
So yeah. But some of the hotel, they have a direct

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:53.270
connection. But let's suppose you are trying to book some of

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:55.590
the hotel in Paris or maybe in Switzerland from India.

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:58.950
Right. And let's suppose they don't have like a direct tie

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:02.550
here. So in that case, in that case also, they will try to

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:05.310
list all those hotels in their website. They don't want to

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:07.710
miss out the customers. Right. So they will try to list down

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:11.110
the hotels in their website. But what they will do, they

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:13.990
will just start the fraction of commissions and you can just

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:16.170
like a go through them and you will be able to book it.

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:18.930
Yeah. So basically to create such kind of a platform. So

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:21.990
obviously you will end up consuming an API from some other

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:25.530
platforms. For example, our medias and the Kiwi, all of

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:27.970
these platforms basically. So you will be able to build out

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:30.670
your own business model across it and then you will be able

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:34.830
to launch it. Right. So and then you can start advertising

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:38.010
it. So everything means literally everything about airport,

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:42.530
about airlines, everything you will be able to. Car and even

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:45.650
transfer. And then about the hotels. Hotel search booking

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:49.290
rating. Right. So everything, destination experience, so

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:51.850
city search, tour and activities, trip purpose prediction.

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:55.270
So all of these services, they have already built it and

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:59.990
their USP, their bread and butter is selling an API, a

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:02.170
medias. If I'll talk about a medias, so their bread and

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:05.870
butter is to sell an API to an enterprise. Right. And then

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:08.810
there are many such platform like make my trip and in every

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:12.110
country you will be able to find out such like a platform.

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:15.250
So many platform, for example, in India, make my trip easy.

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:18.550
My trip is very famous. Right. Pretty much famous. I would

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:21.910
say. Likewise, so you will be able to find out like with the

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:24.870
different different business model. They like just try to

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:29.130
play with the pricing models and then offer to the user and

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:31.510
then they have launched their own businesses. So even you

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:34.830
can start their start your own businesses. So you don't have

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:37.650
to go and do a tie up with everyone. You can just charge a

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:40.490
fraction of commission and then bingo, launch your travel

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:44.170
agency, launch your hotel booking agency or like maybe a

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:46.430
city tour and destination kind of agency by consuming their

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:49.730
API. And build anything that you want on top of this. So

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:52.990
it's like like providing you an LLM kind of a things. Yeah.

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:55.590
So just go to this medias. I have already pinged you the

00:24:55.590 --> 00:25:01.150
link developer.com developer.medias.com and then you can try

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:05.810
to let me ping it to everyone. Yeah. So again, I have pinged

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:10.550
you inside your chat. So basically just we need an API.

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:15.370
Right. We need an API for this. So to need to get an API. So

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:16.750
first of all, you have to log into the app. You have to log

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:18.850
into the account. And once you will be able to log in, so

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:21.870
you will be able to see my account option over there. So

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:24.710
just follow along with my mouse cursor. So you will be able

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:27.490
to find out my account option in a name section. For

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:30.430
example, Danshukumar inside that it is showing me my account

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:34.150
option. So you have to go there. What happened? I think it

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:34.730
logged out.

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:42.040
Okay so sign in once again. Okay. Let me log in once again.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.000
Yeah. So once I'm going to log in, so inside this

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.220
Danshukumar, I will be able to see my account. Once I will

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:53.620
go into my account, so it is going to give me an option like

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:58.780
to create an app or you can say my self service this one

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:04.120
second option. And here so I'm able to see test app. You

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.060
will not be able to see a test app by the way if you are

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:10.020
creating it for the very first time. So you have to create

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:13.960
one self service app. So you have to come into this like my

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:17.300
self service workspace and then inside that so you can try

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.960
to create a new app. So which is going to give you

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:24.780
technically a authorization or secret basically, right? If

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:27.460
you are not going with the enterprise plan. So this is

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.740
something that you have to do in a very first place. Now

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:33.860
once this is done, let's start creating a flow. So to create

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:41.220
a flow, we have to go into n8n. So let's go into n8n.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:52.800
Yeah. So sign in now.

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:58.810
After doing a sign in. So we can start the application

00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:02.070
building. So here we can try to click on create a workflow,

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:08.370
create a workflow and this is my blank window. Now one more

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:11.630
thing guys. So I think couple of days back, I think two or

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:16.250
three days back. So I have released one video somewhere. So

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:20.010
automate your n8n with a zero cost. This is a video which I

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:22.190
have released. Anyone who have watched this video and anyone

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:25.310
who has done that, I think in a group couple of people was

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:30.070
telling me that they have already done this. Yeah. Anyone

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:35.840
who have installed n8n in the local system by, by like after

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:39.300
watching this video. Yeah. Yeah. So Mohamad is saying yes.

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.320
Asit is saying yes. Yeah. So I think Asit has also created a

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:45.960
video for that. Maybe I have seen that video as well. So

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:50.200
fine. So here, see n8n is by default giving you 14 days of

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.540
trial. So instead of going out with a payment, right, let's

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.720
suppose if you are building an automation and if you would

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:58.840
like to keep everything in your local system. Not an easy

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.600
task. Are you sure at all? So you can try to go through this

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:04.900
automation part. Yeah. Sorry, automation. So local

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:08.600
installation part, you can just go ahead with that. And here

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:12.320
so steps are very simple. I have simplified the steps over

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:16.700
here. You just need one single docker file. This one, this

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:21.780
docker compose.yaml file and you have to just install a

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:24.340
docker in your Mac, Windows or Linux machine, whatever

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:28.120
machine that you are using and run only one command. Yeah.

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:30.920
So commands are not required. This is just like a for a

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:34.740
check purposes. Fine. So create a directory, create a

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:38.220
directory and then run only this command. So within 30

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:43.760
seconds or max to max in one minute, you can spin this n8n

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:47.120
inside your machine. Simple. You can, you can like, you

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.920
know, configure the service of n8n in a very, very easy

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:54.360
manner. You don't have to do anything simple. Docker file is

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.580
available. Keep it inside some of the directory. Install

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:00.760
docker. If docker is not available, right? And run this

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.880
command. If docker is available, then directly docker

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:09.620
compose upd, simple and then access it on this URL localhost

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:13.860
5678, right? So this is how easy it is. And here, so I have

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:16.920
not done the configuration of external databases. So by

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.040
default, if you look into my docker file, so it is using a

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:24.380
SQLite. SQLite means in memory database by default, it is

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:28.400
going to use for me as simple as that. Yeah. So in your

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.720
database, you can try to configure even a post race or maybe

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.600
some other database that's completely okay. But I think to

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:38.260
work in your like a local system, it's completely fine. You

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:41.460
don't have to like focus much on that side. So maybe, and

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:45.280
again, so without any cost, you will be able to run this

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:50.320
entire things. Very simple. Yeah. Very simple. So because

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.540
after 14 days you are going to face this problem. Yeah.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.820
After 14 days you are going to face this problem. Yeah. So

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:59.300
just to avoid this problem, I have created this video. I'll

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:01.940
come up with a couple of more videos. So where you can try,

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:05.980
because now I have a docker, right? So if a docker is

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:09.340
running in my local system, I can run it on any cloud

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:12.520
platform. Any means literally any. Just name any cloud

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:16.320
platform in this entire world, small or big. If something as

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:19.800
a docker is running in my system, again, it will take maybe

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.900
two minute of time or three minute of time, max to max,

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:25.080
including sign up and login on those cloud platform. To

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:28.460
like, you know, configure this docker or configure this init

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:32.100
in on those platforms. So this is how easy things are.

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.360
That's the reason. So I have like a taken this docker

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:38.800
approach by the way. So again, those who would like to

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.220
explore more and more this init in, so obviously you need

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:44.740
like a more than 14 days, right? Just go ahead with this.

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:47.120
It's just one single minute of installation, which I have

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:50.380
explained in 12 minute by the way. Okay. I'm leaving up to

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:53.680
you. Okay. So now I have this blank init in its screen.

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:58.520
Right. So what we have to do first. So we have to create a

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.580
trigger, right? So message should come. So for example, like

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:08.620
I said, uh, here, so if I have to talk about a flow, let me

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:09.580
open up my razor.

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:10.610
Okay. So here, what we are going to do in our very first

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:15.250
place. So basically we have to create a trigger, trigger,

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:18.310
right? Trigger means so from where like a message will be

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:21.330
triggered by the way. So here as a trigger, what we are

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:24.110
going to use. So as a trigger, we are going to use basically

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:27.890
a telegram. So someone user is going to send a message. So

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:30.530
you can try to use any other messaging system. That's

00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:33.930
completely fine. So trigger wise, uh, we are technically

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:40.520
going to use a telegram over here, telegram, easy to

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.260
configure, easy to, uh, like, you know, uh, configure and

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:46.940
plug it, uh, with, uh, any other system. So that's the

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:49.920
reason. So we are going to use basically a telegram for now.

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:54.620
Okay. So once a telegram will be done, so trigger wise

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:57.900
telegram is something that we are going to use. Now, once

00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:01.200
user is going to send a message, so trigger means user will

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:04.460
try to send a message. So what kind of a messages user can

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:08.880
try to send? So user can try to send maybe a normal message,

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:13.280
hi, or maybe hello, kind of a message, which is not related

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:16.660
to a booking, right? So hi, hello, kind of a message user

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:21.100
will be able to send or user may try to send something

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:24.280
different. So maybe user can send that I'm looking for a

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:29.860
flight from Bangalore to, uh, Delhi on maybe, uh, like, uh,

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:37.420
2025 10th month on 25th date, right? So user can send this

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:40.100
kind of a message or maybe user can send this kind of a

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:43.100
message or maybe user can send message that I'm looking for

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:45.780
a flight from Bangalore to Delhi on this particular date for

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:47.940
two person for three person. So just, you know, natural

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:51.760
language user are going to send a message basically. So once

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:55.420
user can send a message, so we have to, first of all, parse

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:58.160
this messages, right? We have to understand this messages.

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.640
So if user is saying hi, hello, kind of a things and what

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.860
you can do for me kind of a thing. So obviously my bot

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:07.500
should not start searching for the flight. So my bot should

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:11.400
ask for like, uh, something relevant, like give me some sort

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:14.620
of information. So what, what you are looking for, uh, what,

00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:16.800
what, uh, kind of a flight booking, because I'm a flight

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:19.780
booking bot, some sort of a, uh, like, uh, you know, a

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:23.060
return my system, my system is supposed to give, okay. So,

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:26.880
uh, like I said, two kinds of messages I may receive. So

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:29.980
this is a hi, hello, kind of a messages, or maybe I'm going

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:34.060
to receive this kind of a message. So in both the cases I

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:37.160
have to act, right? I have to act and I have to give a

00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:44.110
response to my user. So okay. This kind of a message I'm

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:47.650
going to receive, or maybe I'm going to receive this kind of

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:50.550
a message inside a trigger or trigger is technically a

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:53.230
telegram. So inside a telegram. This kind of a message is

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:57.630
now, if I'm receiving, right, if I'm receiving a hi, hello,

00:34:57.670 --> 00:35:00.270
kind of a message. So in that situation, what I'm supposed

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:03.790
to do. So in case of hi, hello, kind of a messages, I should

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:12.270
ask a question to a user, right? Ask user, uh, for more

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:16.930
info, right? Ask user for more info. So this is what I'm

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:20.250
supposed to do in case of, you know, a hi, hello, kind of a

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:22.170
message that. What kind of a, you know, detail that you are

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:25.170
looking for, I'm a flight booking agent. So how I can help

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:28.250
you, how I can support you in case of this kind of

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:31.330
information. So where user is asking that I'm looking for a

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:34.990
flight detail and uh, give me all of these like a flight

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:38.650
detail, right? So in that situation, what we are supposed to

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:42.670
do. So we are supposed to, uh, basically, yeah,

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:53.740
so we are supposed to go to a Amadeus in this situation.

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:05.450
Amadeus. Amadeus. A-D-E-U-S. Amadeus flight search system.

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:08.370
We have to go and we have to basically search for the

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:13.610
flight. So if user is asking this kind of information, so I

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:17.070
have to go to Amadeus flight search. I have to bring those

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:21.190
data, basically a flight data as per the user request, as

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:24.390
many data as possible. If user has given some sort of a

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:27.470
condition, so I have to apply those conditions as well. If

00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:30.030
user is looking for a data in some sort of a specific

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:33.110
format. So I have to apply all of these policies over there.

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:37.570
And then finally I have to return, right? Finally I have to

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:40.990
return. So return where? So again, I have to return this

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:44.300
inside a telegram,

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:51.360
telegram, yeah. So return all of these information inside

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:55.040
the telegram. So basically message will start from telegram

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:58.020
and message will end at telegram. This is what I'm trying to

00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:02.180
say. And if we can try to configure as a bot in case of

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:04.780
telegram, so we can try to create even a WhatsApp bot,

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:08.320
right? We can try to create even our own custom messaging

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:12.080
system or a custom bot. Just like maybe a URI. So where you

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:14.540
can make a back and forth, back and forth, there is an

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:18.080
interface and the user can come and chat with it. So this is

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:21.120
a kind of a flow that we have to create. And this is where

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.520
your agents will come into a picture. This is where your

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.480
custom code will come into a picture. This is where your if

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:29.100
and else kind of a condition will come into a picture. But

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:31.720
yeah, technically this is going to be the flow that we are

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:34.660
going to build now. Okay. Let's start building it. Let's

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:37.780
build it one by one. So first of all, what do we need? So we

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:40.780
need a telegram by the way. Yeah. So I have a telegram.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.980
Yeah. I have a telegram over here. So first of all, we need

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:49.780
a telegram now to access anything into a telegram, right? To

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:53.980
access, uh, like, uh, basically anything in the telegram. So

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:57.640
what do you have to do? So you have to technically, uh,

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:01.880
first of all, search for something called as bot. Yeah.

00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:08.160
Yeah. Yeah. So bot father. So just go there and search for

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:12.580
bot f a t h e r bot father. You will be able to find out a

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:15.800
multiple like a pop up with respect to a bot father. You

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:19.420
don't have to like, you know, uh, uh, click anywhere inside

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:21.780
this one. So basically what you have to do, so you have to

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:24.640
click on the bot father with the blue tick. Yeah. With the

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:29.120
blue tick basically. So this is the actual bot father. Uh,

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.480
there are many people who have created with the same name.

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:35.420
You don't have to fall for that one. So here, bot father,

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:38.820
just click there. And then once you will be inside a bot

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:42.600
father chat terminal, right? Once you will be here inside a

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:45.840
bot father chat terminal. So you can just type over here

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.840
slash new bot. So they are giving you a lot of like a

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:51.400
different, different option to control things. So you can

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:56.440
try to type on slash new N E W new B O T bot. So it will try

00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:00.420
to initiate creating your bot basically. So first slash new

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:03.120
bot. So automatically it will try to. So basically you are

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.700
chatting with the bot father, right? Chatting with the bot

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:09.600
father. So here it is popping up that all right, a new bot,

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:13.720
how we are going to call it, please choose the name for your

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:18.680
bot. Okay. So I'm going to give a name, you're on flight

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:24.580
search, fine. So this is the name. Uh, good. Now let's

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:27.500
choose the username for your bot. It must end with the bot.

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:31.040
Like for example, uh, it should like end with a bot all the

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:33.700
time, right? Underscore bot. Or maybe just a bot. So it

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:39.060
should end with the bot. So you're on, I can say flight bot.

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:41.460
Yeah. So this is the name which I have given you're on

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:46.980
flight bot fine. So as you can see, if the name is unique,

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.740
if name is not unique, it will not create it, right? Because

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:53.060
it should be universally like a unique name so that anyone

00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:56.780
can search and anyone can talk to my bot by the way. So here

00:39:56.780 --> 00:40:00.920
it is going to give you a token access by which you will be

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:03.980
able to interact with the telegram. So this is the token it

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:08.260
has generated and this is the URL, you're on flight bot. Now

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:11.300
if I'm going to share this URL with any one of you, you all

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:15.800
will be able to access my bot, right? And my bot in terms of

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:19.200
chat and if I'm going to access this token with all of you,

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:22.080
so in that case you all will be able to access my telegram

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:26.500
as well. Simple, right? So this is the only token which is

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:29.500
required to interact with the telegram. Nothing much is

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:32.220
required. Yeah. So now with this, with the help of this

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:35.320
token, I will be connected with the telegram and I can do

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:38.400
whatever I want by the way. Yeah. I can do whatever I want

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:42.460
with respect to a telegram. So simple. Copy this one. Yeah.

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:46.920
Copy this and maybe I'm going to keep it somewhere inside

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:52.320
some of my file. So this is my API token for telegram. This

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:56.140
is basically for open AI. I have kept it here. Okay. And

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:59.140
this is the URL. So I can, I can just go to this URL. I can

00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:02.660
click on a start, right? So you're on flight search. Now if

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:06.120
I'm going to share this things with you so I can click here,

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:10.300
I can try to, you know, click on manage bot and then again I

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:14.580
can try to copy this link. Yeah. Copy this link and if I'm

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:17.540
going to share this link with all of you, you all will be

00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:20.800
able to talk to my bot and again your session will be yours.

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:25.320
So basically a bot is going to interact with you as per your

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:28.080
basically information. So every session. Every session for

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:32.120
my bot for all of you is going to be different. So I will be

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:34.320
sharing, I will be sharing this with all of you so that you

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:37.040
know you can chat with my bot and you can try to test my bot

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:39.900
as well. All of you will be able to test it and all of you

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:44.120
will be able to do a flight search by the way. Okay. Now,

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:47.440
cancel. So this is a bot which is required or this is, you

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.200
can say a messaging interface which is required. So anyone

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:53.460
can come to this messaging interface and then anyone can,

00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:58.060
you know, search for the flight. As simple as that. Okay. So

00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:02.440
here, once we are like searching for this, like a flight, a

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:05.800
flight and we are trying to interact with the edit end. So

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:08.280
first of all, what we have to do, so in case inside edit

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:11.360
end, so we have to configure a telegram node. So okay, let's

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:15.200
go ahead, configure a telegram node. Now here, so they're

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:18.100
going to give you a multiple options. So like you would like

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:22.780
to configure a telegram, but what, what, what should be the,

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:26.360
like a first node. So basically I will be selecting a

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:29.180
trigger. Okay. So it is going to trigger. First of all,

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:32.000
right. It is going to invoke my telegram or it is user is

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.880
going to send the very first message and then from a user

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:38.560
side it should get initiated from a user side it should get

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:41.820
initiated. So here what I will do, so trigger and then I

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:44.960
will be selecting on message. So whenever user is going to

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:48.340
message, then trigger the flow. This is what I'm going to

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:51.400
select, right. That will be my starting point by the way. So

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:55.980
I can try to click on, on message. So on message. Fine. Now

00:42:55.980 --> 00:43:00.100
here. So it will be asking for basically a telegram account.

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.960
Yeah. So I have already added a couple of account, but this

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:05.080
is a new bot I have created. So I'm going to add the

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:08.100
credential for new bot. So create a new credential. Yeah.

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:10.580
You won't be getting these three options. I have already

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:13.880
experimented with like multiple accounts. So it is showing

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:16.280
you this, but yeah, I'll try to click on create new

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:18.600
credentials. So click on new credential and then this is the

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:21.440
only token that you have to paste access token. So access

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:24.160
token, it's already available. I have copy and pasted. Okay.

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:28.160
So I will be using this access token over here. Fine. Save

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:28.300
it.

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:37.380
Okay. So access token has been saved and my telegram node is

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:40.700
available. Telegram trigger node is available. I can try to

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:43.920
test it by the way. Yeah. I can try to test it. So I'll go

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:48.780
to my telegram. Yeah. I'll try to say, hi, my name is

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:52.380
Sudhanshu. Yeah. So my name is Sudhanshu. So basically I

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:56.500
have triggered this one via my bot. And if I'll come over

00:43:56.500 --> 00:44:00.480
here. And if I'll try to execute this step. So here is my

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:03.680
message. So if I'm able to see my message over here, hi, my

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:06.880
name is Sudhanshu. It simply means that that I'm able to

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.240
communicate between my telegram, which is a separate

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:14.340
application and N8N basically. Right. So I'm able to

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:17.920
communicate between these like two applications back and

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:21.440
forth, back and forth. So fine guys. Is it making sense? Are

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:22.440
we able to create this node?

00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:31.030
Yes. Yeah. Very simple. Right. Even Dhruv has like a shown

00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:33.750
you this step. I think last time Dhruv was also using a

00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:36.110
telegram, but going forward, I'll be showing you a lot of

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:38.130
like a separate integration. Like I said, so I'm planning to

00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:41.950
launch another automation course itself because I have to

00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:46.050
teach a lot of things, a lot of complex automations for

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:49.970
CEOs, marketing, HR, and all those people, a real one, which

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:53.310
can't be covered in this batch because you know, we have so

00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:56.630
many topics to cover in this itself in terms of generative

00:44:56.630 --> 00:45:02.870
AI. Okay. So telegram triggers, we are able to create and we

00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:04.870
are able to receive the message, right? Whatever message

00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:06.650
user is going to send. So we are able to receive the

00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:11.270
message. Okay. So as per my flow, I told you that user can

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:14.530
send hi, hello, or user can send these details. Yeah. User

00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:17.490
can send hi, hello, or user can send these details. Now my

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:20.390
system is supposed to do an interpretation that, okay,

00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:23.850
whether it's a hi, hello, or whether it's a user is asking

00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:26.710
for maybe some sort of a flight search. Yeah. I have to do

00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:29.910
this. Some sort of a interpretation over there. Then only I

00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:33.790
will be able to technically like understand the user query.

00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:38.490
Yeah. So to understand the user query, I can simply use AI.

00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:44.730
Yes. I can try to use a AI over there. So I can try to use a

00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:47.770
URI API. That's completely fine. As we all know that with

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:50.910
the help of URI API, so I can try to send a HTTPS request.

00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:54.830
Plus I will be able to send a payload. Payload means I can

00:45:54.830 --> 00:45:58.010
send this message. Yes. And then while sending this message,

00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:00.670
I can give a instruction that, okay, so try to understand

00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:04.290
this message and then tell me like this message falls under

00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:07.710
which category. Right. So in this way I will be able to use

00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:10.350
URI API. I have already shown you that part as well. Right.

00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:13.470
And you guys are using already URI API since a very, very

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:17.110
long time. So yeah, all of you will be able to use it or

00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:20.190
else I, so that is, that is one of the approach. That is one

00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:24.050
of the approach of using a LLM. Another approach is if I

00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:27.110
would like to invoke a agent. Directly I can invoke an

00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:30.110
agent, but in case of agent, uh, edit and is not giving you

00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:32.890
any custom integration. They have already predefined the

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:37.050
integration. So open AI or maybe some of the standard API

00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:40.470
you will be able to use. But uh, yeah, so if you are using

00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:43.430
URI, you can, you can use it. It's again going to provide

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:46.150
you LLMs and we all know that how we can try to use a URI.

00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:50.010
We have already seen that situation as well in case of N8N

00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:54.210
at the end of the day, I need a LLMs. Right. So direct LLM,

00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:59.070
plain LLM or maybe LLM with the agentic one and I believe we

00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:02.490
all understand the differences, right? So agents are nothing

00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:06.350
but a combination of a tool memory and LLM so that it will

00:47:06.350 --> 00:47:09.710
be able to decide like which tool we have to use or what we

00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:12.250
have to store inside the memory and which LLM I'm supposed

00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:15.690
to use. This is what agent is a package, right? Package in

00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:19.570
itself. Uh, LLM is one of like a component, but yeah, so

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:21.690
again, uh, I can, I can build all of these things

00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:24.390
separately. Like a memory separate tool separate and agent

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:26.690
separate and this is where this orchestration framework

00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:28.990
comes into picture like a Lang chain, Lang graph, LLM and

00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:31.930
all those things, right? So that I can orchestrate the

00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:35.950
entire like a agent component altogether via programming in

00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:40.550
case of N8N, it's directly available as a node. So okay,

00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:43.810
whatever detail I will get, I'll try to send it to agent. So

00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:48.430
here AI and then AI agent, fine, AI agent I'm going to use.

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:53.190
Okay, fine. So once I will be having a AI agent over here,

00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:58.550
what we are going to configure or what we are going to do in

00:47:58.550 --> 00:48:02.530
this particular place. So first of all, I can try to maybe

00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:06.970
like, you know, try to give a user prompt. So you have to

00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:10.950
select like a default defined below, right? So define below

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:14.150
and here I'm going to define my own user prompt that, okay,

00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:17.170
you are this agent that agent, uh, do this, do that. This

00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:19.630
kind of things I'm going to define. Okay. Okay. Take this

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:22.550
particular chat and then maybe try to interact with this

00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:26.930
one. So here this is something I have written. Yeah, this is

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:29.410
something I have written what I have written. So extract a

00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:31.610
flight search parameter from this message. So whatever

00:48:31.610 --> 00:48:34.750
messages which I'm receiving from a telegram, right? So just

00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:39.740
try to extract a flight search parameter. They return

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:42.400
exactly one JSON following the system message rule and a

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:45.280
schema above. So I'm going to define even a system message.

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:48.440
This is the user message. This is the user message. Now let

00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:51.360
me connect both of this. Yeah. So that I will be able to see

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:54.260
the message over here. So let's connect. Yeah.

00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:05.730
Now. So I'm able to get the text. Hi, my name is Anshu. So

00:49:05.730 --> 00:49:08.430
here I'm going to replace, you just have to do a drag and

00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:11.770
drop of this one, uh, instead of the messages. So let me

00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:15.070
send you this user message by the way over here. So I've

00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:17.830
just printed the user message guys. Yeah. User message over

00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:21.590
here. Now once user message is configured, right, once user

00:49:21.590 --> 00:49:24.210
message is configured, so maybe I can try to give a system

00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:27.450
prompt as well. So add option and then system prompt. So

00:49:27.450 --> 00:49:30.250
once I'm going to like, I have to write basically a system

00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:33.190
prompt in a very, very detailed manner. So what are, what is

00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:36.090
my system prompt by the way? So my system prompt is

00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:41.690
basically this. So here I have written a very like a lengthy

00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:45.610
one by the way, because, uh, when, when I was like creating

00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:48.030
this application, so I was facing a lot of problem with

00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:50.990
respect to our data. So keeping that in a mind, I have

00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:53.650
experimented with a lot of prompts and then this is the

00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:57.310
prompt that I have written. So you are a helpful flight

00:49:57.310 --> 00:50:00.830
search parameter extractor for a telegram bot. Your only job

00:50:00.830 --> 00:50:04.830
is to read a shot user messages return a json object that

00:50:04.830 --> 00:50:08.910
either contain a ready to use a payload for immediate flight

00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:13.410
search APIs or ask the user for the missing immediate detail

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:17.370
rule. So based on the immediate API study that I have done,

00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:20.250
so I have just given the instruction. I have given the

00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:23.210
system messages and this is what you have to do. That's a. I

00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:26.190
keep on saying that again, you are supposed to be a little

00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:32.010
bit technical even to work with n8n. So this is basically a

00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:35.350
system message which I am going to give it to my user.

00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:41.340
So let me paste this.

00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:27.180
So I have sent you these messages in three tranches. Just

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:29.160
copy all of this message. All of these messages are

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:32.020
technically one except the first one. So first one is

00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:34.560
basically a user message and then next one is basically a

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:38.340
system messages. So, okay, user message and system message

00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:41.320
you have to configure. These two things are mandatory to do

00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:46.560
it. Then what you have to enable, so you have to enable

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:51.160
require a specific output format. Because you are trying to

00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:56.040
send a payload, payload to a Amadeus. Now Amadeus needs some

00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:59.960
sort of a formatting of a data. It's not like you will send

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:03.860
any kind of a data to Amadeus. So keeping that in a mind. So

00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:07.980
you have to basically give a specific output. So whatever

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:11.080
like this agent is going to return. So this agent should

00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:13.920
return the specific output format. So once I am going to

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:17.920
enable it, it is going to enable one more header for me or

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:21.400
one more header for me for a output parser. So here I can

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:24.660
try to attach my output parser by the way inside an agent.

00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:28.160
So now inside an agent, you will be able to see the output

00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:32.540
parser. So for this AI agent, my user message is configured,

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:36.140
right? So now this agent knows that. What it is supposed to

00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:41.460
perform actually, right? Now to enable this agent, I have to

00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:44.960
provide a LLM access, fine I have to provide the LLM access.

00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:49.260
So find chat model. Let me click here and then they are not

00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:51.980
giving you any external one. So how you can try to provide

00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:56.000
basically open AI chat model. So here I can try to connect

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:59.920
with my account by using a credentials that I have and I'm

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:02.200
going to share this credentials so that you can use open AI.

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:08.060
Yeah. And then save it. So here is open AI, which will be

00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:11.120
available to all of you during the session after session, it

00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:14.700
will be disabled. So here is the open AI key that you can

00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:19.480
use it. So here, as you can see, I can select any of these

00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:22.380
models. So these models are coming from my account. So

00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:25.020
whatever model you like, you can try to select it. Yeah, you

00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:28.880
can try to select it. So once this is done, right, close it.

00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:34.040
So now I'm able to integrate a chat model, by the way, I'm

00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:37.280
able to integrate a chat model. Memory tool, leave it as of

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:40.680
now, I don't need it. Output parser wise, so let's try to

00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:43.660
attach a output parser and let's try to give an instruction

00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:47.680
that what kind of a structure output you have to basically

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:52.520
return. Yeah. So here output parser wise, they are giving

00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:54.880
you multiple options. So I will be selecting the last

00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:57.720
option, output parser wise, structured output parser means

00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:02.060
I'm looking for some detail in a JSON format because I have

00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:05.860
to send that format to a medias, right? To a medias. So that

00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:09.740
a medias is going to return me all the details. Okay. So

00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:16.060
here inside this JSON, I'm going to give my own JSON format.

00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:19.640
So which I have to send it to my medias. I have already

00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:22.580
prepared for all of you. Yeah. So I have already prepared.

00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:25.800
So here, this is how you can send fight search payload. So

00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:29.660
origin location code and then destination location code,

00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:33.860
departure date, number of adults, currency code, non-stop

00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:38.700
maximum, like a, you know, tries. So this is something that

00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:42.420
you have to send it to the medias for a flight search. This

00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:46.040
is the minimum number of parameter that you have to send and

00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:50.020
that detail you will be able to get in the medias, you know,

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:55.140
API is like a detail itself. So let me show you that part as

00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:56.460
well because

00:54:59.690 --> 00:55:02.250
any, anyone who is providing your API, so they always

00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:04.430
provide you a documentation. So these things are coming

00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:08.630
from. Their documentation itself. So here I can try to click

00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:10.810
on like a docs, yeah,

00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:21.820
flight offer search or flight offer price or let's see this

00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:25.800
one. So if you, if you'll go into their flight search API,

00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:28.380
so you will be able to find out that this is the format of

00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:32.100
the input they are taking by the way, and they have given

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:35.560
you all the like a detail basically like a good way API

00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:36.380
reference and example.

00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:48.200
Yeah. So here they have given you all the details that what

00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:51.420
they, what basically it takes as an input and what did we

00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:54.740
give you as a output and for API, every API provider does

00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:57.720
the same thing, right? So they are not very different. You

00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:01.380
can even ask a GPT that, okay, fine. So what is the API like

00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:04.840
a payload format that I have to send to the medias, even

00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:07.500
chat GPT will be able to give you the response chat GPT or

00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:10.460
pop-up facility, anything will be able to give you a

00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:14.780
response, but yeah. So like every, every API will be having

00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:17.480
its own. Format and in that format itself, you have to send

00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:20.520
a payload by the way, just like you are doing with the URI.

00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:24.660
So you are sending a data into a specific format, for

00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:29.120
example, a user message or a model ID and temperature. So

00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:32.200
these are nothing but a part of a payload or data D that you

00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:35.140
are trying to send. So similarly a medias follows the exact

00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:38.920
same thing. And I have just like a simply said that, that,

00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:41.420
okay, so whenever you are trying to give me an output,

00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:44.080
always try to give me output in this particular format.

00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:47.620
Because this format, I can directly send to a medias, right?

00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:51.600
This format I can directly send to the medias, okay, fine.

00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:56.440
So this is going to be the structured output format, fine,

00:56:56.480 --> 00:57:00.080
structure output format. Okay. So once this structure output

00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:04.080
format is done, right, once this part is done now, next

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:09.300
what? Yeah. Next what? So here, so

00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:25.580
my agent will take a input from this one and then it will

00:57:25.580 --> 00:57:29.340
try to, you know, understand the chat. So let's suppose here

00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:32.980
I have an agent and this is the chat which is coming to me.

00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:36.880
Now if I'm going to execute, right? So hi, my name is

00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:42.640
Dhanshu. So as you can see, so this chat is not about a

00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:46.640
query, right? This chat is not about a query technically.

00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:50.840
This chat is a plain simple conversation. This is not a

00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:55.380
query to search a flight. Okay. So obviously I will not be

00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:59.820
able to send any kind of a, you know, detail or I will not

00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:04.360
be able to send this payload to a medias by the way. So this

00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:08.140
query falls under this criteria, hi, hello, kind of a

00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:12.060
criteria. So in that situation I should ask user that, okay,

00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:15.740
give me more information, simple, give me more information.

00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:20.280
So this is the first condition that I have and yeah, so on

00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:22.760
this condition, so I can't go ahead with the flight search.

00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:26.940
Okay. So what I will do, okay, so I will try to maybe attach

00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:30.300
a condition over here. Yep. I'll try to attach a condition.

00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:33.860
So maybe I can try to attach if condition just like a

00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:37.660
programming. Yeah. So if condition over here, so here I can

00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:43.940
try to say that if status is, right, status is or status

00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:47.900
contain, I can just write a condition over here that status

00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:52.660
string contain basically ask user, ask underscore user.

00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:55.400
Because this ask user is coming from my system prompt,

00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:57.600
right? So basically this is what I have defined inside my

00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:01.640
system prompt. So if my status contain this string, right?

00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:06.880
So in that case, do something, do what? So in that case, if

00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:09.900
it is true, right, if it is true because it's a, if it's

00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:11.940
kind of a condition, so either it is going to be true or it

00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:15.800
is going to be false. So if it is true in that case, do one

00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:20.320
thing, call a telegram, right? Call a telegram. Send a

00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:23.760
message. Send a text message over a text. Telegram. Fine.

00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:27.600
Send a text message over a telegram. Now what you have to

00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:29.780
send. So again, telegram account, you have to attach

00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:34.320
message. You have to send, right? Operation send message and

00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:37.700
then chat ID. So chat ID you are going to bring from the

00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:41.660
initial one. Yeah. The original one. So here you have a chat

00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:45.100
and here you have a ID. So for this chat ID means the chat

00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:48.240
that you have received, yeah, the chat that you have

00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:52.220
received basically. So you have to send some sort of a.

00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:55.820
Yeah. You know, information. Yeah. You have to basically

00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:59.020
send some sort of information. Now what kind of information

00:59:59.020 --> 01:00:02.680
you have to send by the way. So maybe you can say that,

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:11.880
okay, uh, give me more details about your query. So to this

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:15.140
chat ID, just to reply that, okay, give me more detail about

01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:18.020
this query. Yeah. So give me more detail about this query

01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:21.680
and uh, yeah, so this is the text that I can try to reply

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:24.140
back to my user. Yeah. Saying that, okay, fine. So give me

01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:28.360
more detail. If it is true, if this condition is true and

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:32.020
what is the condition? So if the message is hi, hello, kind

01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:34.480
of a message in that case, status code will be ask user.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:37.300
Otherwise I have already given a system prompt. My status

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:41.080
code is going to be okay. Simple. I'll show you that part as

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:45.140
well. Fine. So now it is taking this one and then it is

01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:50.480
falling under two branch as you can see here. And now, uh,

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:53.920
it will send a message to a telegram. So let's go and check

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:58.420
a telegram. So here, as you can see, it is sending me back a

01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:01.480
message. Give me more detail about your query. So yeah, I'm

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:04.160
able to receive this message. Give me more detail about your

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.560
query. So any kind of a messages, custom message, or maybe

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:09.640
parametrize message, if I would like to send to the user, I

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:13.160
can send it, right? So I'm able to communicate back to my,

01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:17.460
uh, user, uh, basically. Now let's suppose, let's suppose if

01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:21.720
user is sending this kind of a message, right? So if user is

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.800
sending this. This kind of a message from Delhi to Bombay on

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:28.140
this particular date, let's suppose this is a kind of a

01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:32.480
message user is sending, let me send you this one. So if

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:35.100
user is sending from Delhi to Bombay, this kind of a message

01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:38.780
now, what should happen? So because of one condition I have

01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:44.380
already tried and tested. So now let me trigger once again,

01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:47.660
execute the step and I have received from Delhi to Bombay.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:51.580
This is the message I have received back to canvas process

01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:57.260
with the AI. Yeah. So now you can see that status is what?

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.940
Okay. Because this is something which I have defined inside

01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:03.780
my system prompt that, okay, give me this and behave like

01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:06.720
this one. So this is what, and, uh, and again, so I have

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:09.300
like a used basically output parser. So even in case of

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:12.080
output parser, I'm giving the similar kind of instruction.

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:15.020
So flight search, payload, origin, destination, destination,

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.080
uh, sorry, origin, location, code destination, location,

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:21.900
code departure date, all of this data, I'm able to get it.

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:25.560
Now I can, I can say that, okay. So if this is not a

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:30.280
criteria, if it is false, false means, uh, if, if like, uh,

01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:32.760
it is, it is not like, uh, following under this criteria,

01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:36.440
right? So in that case, go for a flight search. So now here

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:40.640
I will try to send a request to my Amadeus, fine. So here I

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:43.600
will try to send a request to the Amadeus. So here I can try

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:47.840
to call my HTTPS request, right? A simple plain HTTPS

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:51.240
request. And now here I will end up configuring my Amadeus.

01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:56.060
Okay. As simple as that. So here method is going to be get,

01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:59.660
and then URL is going to be, so I have already tested this

01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:03.280
URL. So URL is going to be test API. So URL guys, I have

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:06.420
already pinged you, right? So URL is available. Now

01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:09.040
authentication. So authentication, generally credential type

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:12.660
you have to select, simple. Now here, so if I'll go and if

01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:16.920
I'll check the auth, Anshu Kumar, my self service workspace.

01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:23.890
Yeah. Test is the app, or maybe I can try to create a new

01:03:23.890 --> 01:03:27.670
app. Maybe like a SUDH, Anshu, something like this. Yeah.

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:31.750
Create. So I can create a new app over here.

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:38.120
Now here I will be able to get API key and API secret. These

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:41.460
two things are required by the way. Yeah. To like send a

01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:46.980
request to this particular like API. So here this is the

01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:50.000
URL, URL I have already sent it to you. Authentication wise,

01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:53.200
try to select a generic credential type and then generic

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:56.900
auth type. Okay. So basically you are supposed to select

01:03:56.900 --> 01:04:02.440
auth two. This Amadeus is supporting auth two API as of now.

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:05.440
So you have to select a auth two. Last time when we were

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:09.280
hitting a URI, so we have selected a bearer auth. Right? So

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:12.180
it depends what kind of auth you are using. So URI is using

01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:14.900
a bearer auth. You must be able to see a bearer in our

01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:18.840
beginning. In many places, again, if I'll talk about this

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:23.080
one, Amadeus, it is using auth two, V2 you can say. So it is

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:25.720
using auth two. So I can select this auth two over here,

01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:31.660
right? And then I can try to enable send query parameter. I

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:34.800
have to send a query. So just try to enable a send query

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:38.800
parameter in this particular place. Now what kind of a query

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:42.500
parameter I'm going to send? So obviously I'm going to send

01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:47.100
our destination location. I'm going to send a origin and I'm

01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:50.400
going to send a departure date and I'm going to send number

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:55.480
of adult for which I'm looking for. Maybe a, uh, like, uh, a

01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:59.440
flight, right? I'm looking for a flight. Okay. That's cool.

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:04.160
That, that looks like a cool to me. So basically, uh, like,

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:06.660
uh, these are the detail. So query parameter, let's try to

01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:11.360
send one by one, one by one. So origin location code. Maybe

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:15.560
I can try to copy this name, origin location code and value

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:18.980
is what value is, whatever value is coming inside my API.

01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:23.660
Fine. Origin location code. Good. Add parameter. So

01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:26.540
basically our destination, I have to add. So destination

01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:29.800
again, a spelling mistake should not be there. Otherwise it

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:35.040
will not work. And then data wise, this is the data it is

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:40.240
going to take. So origin location is fine. Then destination

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:44.320
location is fine. Then add parameter again. And this time,

01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:48.940
so number of adults, adults, adults is equal to, let's

01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:54.440
suppose like, uh, I'm like sending this data. Let me send

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:56.860
this adult data. Yeah. So whatever number of adult people

01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:59.740
are looking for, so it will come here, then add a parameter.

01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:03.200
And then finally I will try to add the date over here. So

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:08.240
departure date. So here I have a departure date, so I'll try

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:12.160
to add a departure date. So just add a departure date over

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:16.200
here. So this four things I'm going to send. So first origin

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:19.960
location code, a second destination, fourth adult and fifth

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:23.720
departure date. Now you can ask me a question. That anyhow,

01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:27.540
you are doing a mapping, right? One by one, one by one, one

01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:30.380
by one as a key value pair, you are doing a mapping. Then

01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:34.260
why did you said that, that you need, uh, you know, uh,

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:38.360
always this kind of a payload, uh, all the time. I'll tell

01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:40.200
you one thing. So when I was trying to build this

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:44.480
application, uh, I was facing a one problem. I'm using AI in

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:48.720
between, right? I'm using AI in between. So if I'm not

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:52.940
giving a concrete instruction to my AI. That always give me

01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:57.340
only this kind of a format. It will give me a data, but

01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:01.340
every time in a different, different format. And if my

01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:04.700
formats are different, every time I'll have to come and then

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:07.880
change this JSON, right? This particular one, because this

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:10.300
is the mapping, right? It will always try to pick from here,

01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:14.340
keeping that in a mind. So I have made it like a structured

01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:16.780
output kind of a things because I was facing that kind of a

01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:20.600
problem. So just to like, uh, eliminate that problem. So

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:22.500
that, you know, AI should know. AI should always give me a

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:26.800
same kind of a structure all the time I have done this kind

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:32.640
of a mapping. Now execute a step and uh, if everything is

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:39.220
fine, it is hitting my Amadeus as you can see. And it is

01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:43.520
giving me a lot of data, lot of data which human can't read

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:46.740
maybe, yeah, directly human can't read it. So it is giving

01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:49.680
me a lot of data as you can see. So successfully I'm able to

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:53.980
hit my Amadeus. Yeah. And I'm able to bring a data. Now it's

01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:57.120
time to parse a data. So whatever data which I have received

01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:01.400
from here, it's time to parse a data. Now to parse a data,

01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:02.400
what I will do.

01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:13.140
So to parse a data, maybe I'll try to, you know, uh, write

01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:17.220
some sort of a code over here. So what kind of a code? So

01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:20.800
just try to add a, because this data is available. If you

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:22.840
will look into this data, this data is available into a

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:25.960
string format. I need this data into a JSON format. Yeah.

01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:29.600
Compatible JSON format. So here I'll try to add maybe a

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:34.100
node, code node. Yeah. I can use a JavaScript. I can use

01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:37.000
Python, but we should wait for the Python node to use in a

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.900
production as it's in a beta stage. So I will be using a

01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:44.040
JavaScript. It's fine. Code is like a, it's not very

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:48.500
different. I would say. Right. So here all this code piece

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:52.060
of code is fine. I just have to change the last line JSON

01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:56.480
parser I have to use. So I'll write a code JSON. JSON. In a

01:08:56.480 --> 01:09:00.120
JavaScript, it's already available. JSON.parse. Yeah. I can

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:04.640
call JSON.parse and what I have to parse. So I have to parse

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:07.680
this data. So just try to drag and drop this data. Simple.

01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:10.940
So it will be able to, you know, convert my data into a JSON

01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:14.360
string, execute a step. Now you will be able to see that my

01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:19.300
data will be available into a proper JSON format. See, my

01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:22.440
data set is properly available into a JSON format. So this

01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:25.700
was my data input. I have just like a made this slide. Last

01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:32.560
line change, not much of like a code I have done. Yeah. So I

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:35.480
have just called JSON dot parser and I have passed my drag

01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:39.180
and drop like input data. This is my input data and here in

01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:42.620
a proper JSON format and it is not giving me just one single

01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:46.420
flight data as you can see. So I'm able to bring almost like

01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:51.300
a 16,000 plus record. If I'm going to copy this entire

01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:55.160
things and if I'm going to show you, uh, maybe like, um, in

01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:58.580
my file, Oh, so

01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:11.740
it's a 16,954 line of data that we are able to bring and

01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:15.260
maybe like a 80, 95 details we are able to bring. So we'll

01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:18.320
have to just check the items. How many items? Okay. So in

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:23.520
total 90 flight detail, it is able to bring 90 based on my

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:28.260
like a API request. It is able to bring nineties. I think

01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:31.160
90. Yeah. I think I'll 90. Yeah. I think because this is the

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:34.940
ID which I'm able to see, but again, I'll have to check with

01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:40.420
her. Um, I have just have to like count the number of, uh,

01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:43.960
you know, items inside the JSON. But yeah, 90 is something

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:50.080
that we are able to bring as a data. Almost ID is also 93.

01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:54.340
So means 93. I don't know. We'll have to check. No ID is 89

01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:58.220
then 90. So I think it's a 90 or it's a JSON file. It's a

01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:00.720
proper JSON format. So I can just try to count JSON data. So

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:03.080
if I say JSON.items, it will be able to give me that how

01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:05.480
many items are there. So it's not a big deal. Just like a,

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:08.340
you can just go and count the number of details or maybe

01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:11.440
pass this file to a chat GPT and say that what is the total

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:13.440
number of records? What is the total number of items are

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:17.020
there? It will be able to give you that item. So this is the

01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:22.300
proper JSON format, JSON 5 format data. I'm able to get it.

01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:25.780
So I'm able to parse this data just by, uh, writing this

01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:28.320
small piece of the code. Yeah. A small piece of the code.

01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:32.020
Okay. So once this part is done, so once I'm able to, you

01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:36.560
know, just only find this entire things. Yeah. Then what we

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:42.300
have to do. Yeah. So then we have to maybe like, uh, send

01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:46.760
this data to telegram means to a user. I have to send this

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:50.260
data right now to send this data to a telegram. So I have

01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:54.360
to, you know, extract the items because there are 90 flight

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:57.900
details. So I can't like pick this data and dump some dump

01:11:57.900 --> 01:12:01.100
to someone. Like, okay, fine. Take it. Like do whatever you

01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:04.520
want. I can't do that basically. Right. So I have to send

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:08.340
this data to a telegram to a user, uh, basically, but in a

01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:11.240
little bit beautiful format, beautified format, I have to

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:14.660
send this data to a user. So again, maybe I can try to

01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:18.460
attach a code over here, a coding block so that, you know, I

01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:23.300
will be formatting now for the telegram. So here I have

01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:28.810
prepared like a code format. Yeah. I have already prepared

01:12:28.810 --> 01:12:33.410
the code format over here. So where till 90. So I have given

01:12:33.410 --> 01:12:37.850
a cost. It is a cost is equal to this one. So input meta and

01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:40.730
then like a count. So whatever is that? Yeah. Total number

01:12:40.730 --> 01:12:43.430
of count is equal to 90. Yeah. Meta. It's already giving you

01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:45.810
right. Total number of count is equal to 90. So I've just

01:12:45.810 --> 01:12:48.090
given that, that, okay, fine. So run the loop for 90 times

01:12:48.090 --> 01:12:52.050
or whatever is the count total count is, and then execute

01:12:52.050 --> 01:12:55.370
the steps means give me the output one by one, one by one,

01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:57.570
one by one. So this is what this piece of code is trying to

01:12:57.570 --> 01:13:00.950
do. Nothing much. So basically this piece of code is trying

01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:04.070
to take the data one by one, one by one, one by one, and

01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:07.810
then it is going to send that particular data set. Simple.

01:13:08.110 --> 01:13:13.140
So execute a step. Yeah. So now it is, it is going to

01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:15.740
prepare the data. Yeah. It is going to prepare this data in

01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:18.500
a text format basically, as you can see, and this text will

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:21.240
go to the telegram. You can try to prepare data in your own

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:24.540
way. That's completely okay. Right. So whatever kind of a

01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:27.480
message that custom messages or custom message type you

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:30.420
would like to create. So you can try to do it. Even you can

01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:33.200
call an AI agent over there, which can work for you and give

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:35.420
a instruction that, okay, give me this kind of a data, which

01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:38.680
I'm going to send to my user. Now once this part is done,

01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:43.120
I'm ready to send the data back to the user. So here again,

01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:46.740
I will try to attach what a telegram. So here just try to

01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:51.740
attach telegram and uh, I have to send a message, right? So

01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:54.740
send a text message, a tab I'm going to select a node I'm

01:13:54.740 --> 01:14:00.400
going to select and again, so message wise. So I can try to

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:04.520
pick a chat ID from the very first trigger. So this is my

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:08.860
chat ID. What is our data, which I'm going to send by the

01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:13.680
way. So data from the last block. So this is the data. Let's

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:17.400
suppose I'm going to send from the last block one by one,

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:21.860
one by one, one by one. Yeah. So this is something, uh,

01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:25.600
which, uh, I'm going to like, uh, configure so

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:30.580
that I will be able to, you know, send. Send our data, uh,

01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:34.880
to the user and I will click on execute a step. Now once I'm

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:38.000
going to click on execute a step, as you can see back to

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.080
back, I have a started receiving a message, right? 13, 14,

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:45.200
15, 16, 18. Just see the count. Yeah. See the count over

01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:49.660
here. 38, 39, 40, 41, 42. Some of the messages I have

01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:53.920
already clicked. Yeah. So back to back, back to back, back

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:57.460
to back. It has started giving me up messages, whatever

01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:59.620
message was there. So yeah. So I am able to receive this

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:02.140
particular message and all of this flight detail in this

01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:05.080
format. And this format is coming from where, from my code

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:07.260
by the way, right? This is the format which I have prepared.

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:10.240
So if I'm looking for some different format, uh, to send

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:13.080
back to my user, I can just prepare it in my code, the

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:16.180
previous node itself. So now I'm able to send all the

01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:19.120
messages. So based on the user query, based on the user

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:23.320
query, so basically, uh, based on this kind of a user query.

01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:26.460
So basically it is able to interpret, it is able to connect

01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:29.880
with our medias. It is able to parse the data. And finally

01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:34.960
I'm able to receive my, uh, you know, uh, like a flight

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:38.360
detail. So route Delhi to this one, to this one, right. Uh,

01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:41.860
date, time departure, this, this, this, I can do even like a

01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:44.880
refinement over here, right? I can do a refinement. I can

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:48.680
even, uh, maybe search a flight. I can even apply a trigger.

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:51.780
I can even write a condition over here that give me a flight

01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:54.820
just with this range to this range. Just like you go to any

01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:58.040
website, right? And you try to filter it out with a time.

01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:01.980
With basically. Like a single stop, maybe double stop, maybe

01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:06.180
a round trip and maybe with a price, right? Everything you

01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:09.900
can make it agentic. So that system will keep on watching

01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:13.400
and whenever things will be available, it will send you or

01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:15.380
it will ping you back automatically. You don't have to do

01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:17.620
anything, right? So you have just send a message and then

01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:20.560
left it that I'm looking for a flight from this to this with

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:24.820
this price range. So I can configure in my own way. The

01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:28.160
complete system is under my control now. Right? It depends

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:30.640
upon me what parameter I'm going to pass and what it should

01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:34.620
return, right? And system will keep on working for me by the

01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:38.900
way. So this is how things, uh, is working as of now, now

01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:43.120
once things are working for me and once I have tested end to

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:46.920
end flow about this one, uh, what I can do, I can try to

01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:49.460
activate it. Yeah. I can try to make it active.

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:57.440
Now I have made it active. Now all of you can use my bot.

01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:02.280
Let me share, uh, use like a URL for this one public

01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:08.830
link. So this is a public link or you can try to search with

01:17:08.830 --> 01:17:12.650
the, you're on flight and even you can send a message.

01:17:28.150 --> 01:17:31.470
So yeah, you can just use this public link. I have already

01:17:31.470 --> 01:17:34.590
pinged you the public link by the way. And just by using

01:17:34.590 --> 01:17:38.650
this public link or just by searching my bot name. So my bot

01:17:38.650 --> 01:17:41.570
name is you don't underscore flight, underscore search, or

01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:44.530
you can try to search with the bot name. You're on a E

01:17:44.530 --> 01:17:47.930
capital F capital and B capital. So you're on flight bot.

01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:51.430
You can try to go to like a telegram and then you can try to

01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:55.690
search for it. And my API by this entire things is active

01:17:55.690 --> 01:17:59.630
and I can even watch over here that who is sending. Okay. So

01:17:59.630 --> 01:18:02.230
someone is sending a request. I can see, see it's, it's

01:18:02.230 --> 01:18:05.670
running right. And if you are going to get some sort of a

01:18:05.670 --> 01:18:08.930
error in some of the flow, I will be able to see that as

01:18:08.930 --> 01:18:11.750
well and see many people are sending this request. Yeah.

01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:15.790
Many people I'm see guys, I'm using like, I can see what,

01:18:15.810 --> 01:18:18.350
what kind of error people have received. So some has

01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:20.950
received succeed, succeed, succeed, succeed, right. So

01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:23.830
succeed. Some people have received an error. So I can come

01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:27.670
over here and I can try to check that whether, where people

01:18:27.670 --> 01:18:29.330
have received the error. So some people have received error

01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:33.470
inside the structure output. I can test all the edge cases

01:18:33.470 --> 01:18:37.150
over there. Okay. So maximum majority of you are receiving

01:18:37.150 --> 01:18:39.390
an error with respect to the structured output.

01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:46.540
Yeah. So maybe like a, let me check model

01:18:57.940 --> 01:19:00.700
output doesn't fit the required format. Okay. So maybe you

01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:03.580
are sending some XYZ kind of a messages. Some of you have

01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:06.900
received the succeed. I can watch it here. So my things is

01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:09.700
like a completely working. My bot people are able to use it.

01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:12.780
I just have to handle maybe a couple of like a use cases or

01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:15.560
edge cases over here so that it will work for everyone.

01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:20.430
Right. It's, it's queued now. Yeah.

01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:28.860
So there, there will be multiple use cases now or edge cases

01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:30.320
you can say, right. There will be multiple use cases. There

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:32.640
will be like not just one, there will be model output

01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:34.860
doesn't fit the required format. Some of you have received

01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:40.300
the error and basically yeah. So I just have to look into

01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:42.800
some of the error and what is the error that you guys are

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:46.420
receiving and based on that. So basically I have to tune the

01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:50.000
use cases. I can see your input, everything I can, I can see

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:50.480
over here.

01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:56.940
Okay. Text was just a start. Fine. And then type bot

01:19:56.940 --> 01:20:00.060
command. Okay. Just a start by the way. So this is not a

01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:05.500
error. Okay. And those who have received the succeed one, I

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:09.240
can see their output as well. So what they have received as

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:10.000
a succeed message.

01:20:16.010 --> 01:20:20.870
Okay. Departure date is empty. So to find guys, you have to

01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:22.010
give a departure date properly.

01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:31.400
Okay. Origin location code is empty. Departure date is

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:35.780
empty. So here just try to give a origin location code by

01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:39.380
the way, as of like BOM, BLR kind of a code. In a later

01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:42.520
stage, I can add one more agent over here. So let's suppose

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:46.240
if user is lighting Bangalore or maybe Bangaluru right Delhi

01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:49.980
or maybe like some other location, Hyderabad or maybe like

01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:53.260
London, something like that, right? Even if you are going to

01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:56.160
make a spelling mistake, I can try to attach one more agent

01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:59.000
over here or I can give a instruction to this agent itself

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.600
or I can try to attach one more search based LLMs right

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:05.940
search based LLMs, real time search based LLMs over here. So

01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:09.040
which will be able to interpret your sentences and it will

01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:12.060
be able to extract a location code. And that too in a real

01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:14.480
time because there is a possibility that when I am building

01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:17.520
the system, there are some location which doesn't even

01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:20.380
exist, right? So government has opened up some new airport

01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:23.960
in some new region. So search API will be better over here,

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.500
right? So that you know, based on your sentence, it will try

01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:30.880
to create a location and destination. So this is one more

01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:33.920
node I have to attach over here. So that is one of the

01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:38.160
requirements, right? Then in terms of like a searching in

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:41.000
terms of sending the details. So obviously, if details are

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.460
good, it is completely fine, details are not good. So maybe

01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:45.840
I will have to apply more filter over here. So I can keep on

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:49.440
attaching more and more and more as I will keep on receiving

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:54.360
the like a like a request or edge cases and then my like a

01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:55.220
system will be perfect.

01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:01.440
We can connect with some HTML form and use, you can connect

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:05.140
with anything you want simple. If I am able to send an API

01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:07.600
request, if I am able to send a HTTP request simply means

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:10.100
that that I can connect with any system in this entire

01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:10.440
world.

01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:21.450
Okay. Now, Hithal is asking sir, can you explain then the if

01:22:21.450 --> 01:22:24.790
condition how ask a user if they not enter the data

01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:28.610
properly. So basically see what I am trying to do. So inside

01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:31.610
the agent, so actually this agent is doing the actual task

01:22:31.610 --> 01:22:36.870
here. So if I will show you by agent, by the way, so you

01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:39.910
will be able to see that I have clearly mentioned that try

01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:43.270
to give me a return code is equals to a return status is

01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:46.850
equals to ask user, right? Clearly mentioned ask user. See

01:22:46.850 --> 01:22:52.610
the highlighted one. Okay. And so it will, so I have already

01:22:52.610 --> 01:22:54.810
given the session to a system. So whenever they will, and

01:22:54.810 --> 01:22:57.950
then based on this ask user, I have written a condition that

01:22:57.950 --> 01:23:02.010
if ask user is coming inside the status means send back a

01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:04.810
message to the user. So that is something which I have

01:23:04.810 --> 01:23:05.190
configured.

01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:14.800
Yeah. Okay. So let me send you the complete JSON file itself

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:19.420
guys. So that you know, you all can like your own light

01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:28.820
search. Yeah. So just import this entire JSON and directly

01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:31.620
it should work in your system. You will be, you just have to

01:23:31.620 --> 01:23:33.820
like, you know, configure with your telegram.

01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:42.520
Okay. So I've just pinged you guys inside your chat. You can

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:43.540
like download now.

01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:49.340
Yeah. You all can download this file. You're on flights.json

01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:52.060
file. I have already sent. Yeah. And I can see that many

01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:55.400
people are trying to like, you know, ping to my bot and they

01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:58.060
are able to ping it in their own session. Yeah. They're able

01:23:58.060 --> 01:24:03.280
to ping it. Simple. Yeah. So a lot can be done. Like I said,

01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:05.760
a lot can be done, monitoring, logging on all those things

01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:09.280
can be done. First of all, you have to integrate one more

01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:12.160
agentic node over here. So where you can simply give an

01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:14.620
instruction. Maybe you can try to give some access of the

01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:17.920
tool. Maybe you can try to attach some memories as well so

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:21.520
that it will be able to, you know, memorize the last couple

01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:24.160
of chats or maybe you can try to attach a vector databases.

01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:28.020
Right. Maybe you can try to even do a catching over there.

01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:32.780
So if user is asking for. Some user has came and some like a

01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:37.200
user is basically some other user, right, is asking for a

01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:40.760
same detail, Delhi to Bombay, right? On the same date. And

01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:43.240
let's suppose some other user has already asked that, right?

01:24:43.340 --> 01:24:46.460
So what I will do, I will try to fetch all the data based on

01:24:46.460 --> 01:24:50.140
the next user query. I will not hit the API. I'll try to

01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:53.300
return it back from the cache itself. So in that case I will

01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:57.840
be able to save even my API cost because API cost for

01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:02.280
Amadeus is going to be the huge, huge cost. Uh, for, for me,

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:05.800
by the way, as a business, right, we do that actually, we do

01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:10.370
that as well. So that is something called as catching that

01:25:10.370 --> 01:25:14.510
we try to implement. So a lot can be implemented here, a

01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:18.490
catching system, uh, like a input parser itself. So which

01:25:18.490 --> 01:25:22.390
will be able to extract a code, uh, like, uh, all this,

01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:26.150
like, uh, location code or airport code, it will be able to

01:25:26.150 --> 01:25:28.610
extract a property, many, many things, many things can be

01:25:28.610 --> 01:25:31.710
done over here. But yeah, whatever you are going to do it.

01:25:31.710 --> 01:25:34.830
You are going to do it on top of this one and just share

01:25:34.830 --> 01:25:38.050
this bot with anyone, right? Everyone will be able to chat

01:25:38.050 --> 01:25:42.510
in their own sweet time and in their own like, uh, you know,

01:25:42.530 --> 01:25:44.790
uh, space they will be able to chat.

01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:50.060
So find everyone, please

01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:03.800
explain why we are modifying the input JSON to Amadeus even

01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:08.020
after prompting JSON output from the, uh, why we have input

01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:13.400
JSON, input JSON, uh, to Amadeus. Okay. So here we are

01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:16.520
sending this data. So here we are sending like a request to

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:20.840
Amadeus and we are not modifying input JSON by the way. So

01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:24.160
we are just like, uh, you know, doing a mapping over here as

01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:30.820
you can see. So let me go in editor mode and here. So we are

01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:33.120
not modifying, right? We are just trying to map that. Okay,

01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:35.800
fine. So take this, take this, take this. So do you see any

01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:40.940
modification here? I don't see it. Just a mapping. Key

01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:41.760
value, key value pair.

01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:49.700
Why mapping required? Why mapping required? Even though we

01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:52.820
have maintained the Amadeus API format. No, actually see,

01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:55.680
uh, I have already given the answer for that one. See

01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:59.600
Amadeus require this format, the format which I have mapped,

01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:02.480
right? In this format I am sending a data at least for this

01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:06.920
flight search. Now you can ask me a question that why we

01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:09.540
have implemented a structure output format at this label

01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:11.680
because we are doing it right. We have already implemented

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:14.900
the structure output format. A reason is very simple. I'm

01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:18.620
using an AI agent, right? It's an AI. Basically LLM. I'm

01:27:18.620 --> 01:27:22.120
using technically agent is what it is accessing LLMs, right?

01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:26.160
Now every time I'm sending some data, like I'm sending some

01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:28.340
data and then I have given some instruction over here, a

01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:30.820
system instruction I have given and then like a user

01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:34.800
instruction I have given over here. And now the problem with

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:37.140
this one is if I'm going to switch off this specified output

01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:40.160
format, it's, it's enabled. I have enabled it purposely. If

01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:42.680
I'm going to switch it off, it will give me the output,

01:27:42.820 --> 01:27:45.900
right? But sometime what will happen? So original location

01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:48.340
code will be in a fourth place. Adult will be in a fourth

01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:50.300
place. First place currency code in some other places, or

01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:53.440
maybe some of this value will not be even available, right?

01:27:53.580 --> 01:27:57.560
I need a couple of values. I need at least this one. I need

01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:00.680
at least this one. I need at least this one and I need at

01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:05.180
least this one, this four details I need and I need it same

01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:07.940
place again and again and again means first, second, third,

01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:11.340
fourth, because I have, I'm doing a mapping, right? And if

01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:14.760
it is not receiving a data in the same place and in the same

01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:18.360
structure, let's suppose flight search payload. Okay. So

01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:19.860
let's say I want to send it out and that was the issue which

01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:22.160
I was facing, keeping that in a mind. So what I have done,

01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:25.600
I've just enabled the structure output format and here. So

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.700
inside the structure output format, I have mentioned clearly

01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:31.360
that give me a information only in this format, not in other

01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:36.860
format. Yeah. So that was the whole idea behind doing this

01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:39.220
structure output format, by the way, before

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:47.560
mapping data is not proper, we can ask user to correct the

01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:49.820
input. Obviously you have to ask a user to correct the

01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:52.880
input. This is what I'm saying, right? This is what, like

01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:56.140
I'm sending a message, follow up message to the user that,

01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:58.760
okay, just to just try to, you know, give me the correct

01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:03.380
input, by the way, how to import JSON you said, okay, I

01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:06.420
think you have not joined all the previous classes. It seems

01:29:06.420 --> 01:29:10.860
click on this three dot import from file and then import it.

01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:14.160
Whatever structure, which I'm able to see, you will be able

01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:17.240
to see the exact same structure. Yeah. It will ask for the

01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:19.360
credentials. So maybe you can skip that part and then you

01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:22.800
can set your credential in a later stage. Your wish, by the

01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:27.760
way, to eliminate output order hallucination, yeah, exactly.

01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:30.080
That's the reason. So I'm like a purposely saying that, that

01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:33.200
give me the output in this way so that I don't want my, you

01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:36.280
know, a kind of a bug in terms of parsing these things in a

01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:39.500
production system because I was facing that. So when I was

01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:41.700
building this application, so I was facing that like a

01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:44.800
issue. So keeping that in mind, I have resolved it in this

01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:47.360
way, basically. So I have fixed the output format itself.

01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:50.820
Maybe you can resolve it in another way. Right. You can add

01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:55.120
one more AI transfer, like a data transfer or something like

01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:58.660
that. So you can resolve it in your way. This is what I have

01:29:58.660 --> 01:30:02.180
opted for. Yeah. And this is the reason by the way, so that

01:30:02.180 --> 01:30:04.760
my output format should not change all the time, which was

01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:05.140
changing.

01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:10.420
Sir, can we convert the natural language text to parameter

01:30:10.420 --> 01:30:13.540
kindly find the cheapest flight for the Ahmedabad to Delhi

01:30:13.540 --> 01:30:18.640
for 10th November, 2025 to two adults, two kids. So yeah, so

01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:21.700
basically you can, you can do that. Right. Hital. So like I

01:30:21.700 --> 01:30:25.420
said, so basically you have to maybe add one more node here,

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:29.360
right? You can try to add one more node. See what is the

01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:34.120
input that we have, you know, uh, uh, sending to this one.

01:30:34.220 --> 01:30:36.880
So basically we are trying to send maybe like a, this kind

01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:40.760
of an input to this AI agent. And finally it is trying to

01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:43.940
return with this kind of a data. Yeah. This kind of a data.

01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:50.060
Now let's do one thing. So this is the input, uh, which I'm

01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:53.760
receiving. And as a text, maybe I'm receiving your, uh,

01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:57.100
like, uh, you know, uh, natural language kind of, uh, uh,

01:30:57.100 --> 01:31:00.360
things. So let me copy your natural language text itself.

01:31:06.780 --> 01:31:10.400
Yeah. So I'm just going to copy this, uh, Hital's message.

01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:13.140
So let's suppose this is the message I'm sending. Yeah.

01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:16.120
Kindly send the flight to Ahmedabad to Delhi, this, this,

01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:20.280
this, this, this, yeah. Now so by default it is returning

01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:23.640
me, give more details about your query because it is not

01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:26.600
able to understand this Ahmedabad. Or it is not able to

01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:29.940
understand Delhi. Okay. Cool. It is not able to understand.

01:31:30.340 --> 01:31:33.920
Uh, so it is trying to treat this entire flow as this

01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:37.020
particular flow. Hi hello. Kind of a flow. It is trying to

01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:40.980
treat and then it is asking user technically if somehow, if

01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:43.740
I'm going to convert this into this flow, because that

01:31:43.740 --> 01:31:46.740
information is there, I just have to convert it. I will be

01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:50.440
good. Right. What I will do. So I will try to add one new

01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:54.880
node here. So let me detach this two node. Yeah. Keep agent

01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:58.460
aside. Keep all these things as it is. I will try to add

01:31:58.460 --> 01:32:02.280
maybe let's suppose URI. Yeah. I'm going to add URI this

01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:06.880
time. So I can add like open AI chat model as well. I can

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:09.760
try to add even some agents that that's okay. But let me add

01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:13.640
URI this time. STTPS. Yeah. Because URI is providing you the

01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:17.940
LLNs, right? So let me, let me go to Euron.

01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:28.280
So I believe we got the problem, right? Everyone. That what

01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:32.000
is the problem we are solving now? So I'll go to just URI

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:36.940
API code example, and then like a curl over here and then

01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:38.740
copy. Yeah.

01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:46.940
So basically it's a post. We have to send post URL

01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:54.160
is, or I can directly like, you know, import the curl.

01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:57.560
Sorry. My bad.

01:33:02.530 --> 01:33:05.710
Directly import the curl. It will be able to fill all the

01:33:05.710 --> 01:33:09.230
details automatically. Yeah. So it has like, it seems it has

01:33:09.230 --> 01:33:12.430
filled all the detail. I just have to change the key over

01:33:12.430 --> 01:33:19.040
here. So here I will go, I'll try to create the API key.

01:33:19.180 --> 01:33:26.380
Some tests, something create the API key and then along with

01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:27.880
the bearer using

01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:36.390
JSON authorization. Okay. Fine. Execute deactivate workflow.

01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:40.790
Okay. I, my workflow is active. So let me deactivate it for

01:33:40.790 --> 01:33:47.570
now. Okay. So now I will be able to test it. Oh, it has

01:33:47.570 --> 01:33:53.050
attached here. I don't want it there. I want it here.

01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:06.640
So basically like I'm sending this, this entire like a

01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:09.980
payload and then it is like a trying to return me something

01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:12.700
like this role assistance in the circuit born mid flight

01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:19.180
takes some messages. I just have to like change my process.

01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:19.900
I will also try to confirm. So here is the prompt over here.

01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:23.660
So here the prompt is, right up where I'm about artificial

01:34:23.660 --> 01:34:27.100
intelligence and based on the tech, so it is trying to

01:34:27.100 --> 01:34:31.200
basically like, uh, uh, give me this like information. So

01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:35.700
here what I will say, that, uh, try understanding

01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:47.500
user input and user input. My user is trying to search for

01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:57.280
two search for audit. Okay. flight so and and user have

01:34:57.280 --> 01:34:58.840
mentioned

01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:11.080
maybe right maybe origin and destination location in their

01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:16.400
own way do one thing one

01:35:18.610 --> 01:35:28.610
thing pass the data and return me return me simple string

01:35:28.610 --> 01:35:30.970
with origin

01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:35.100
code destination

01:35:37.310 --> 01:35:48.930
code and date in year yyyy month mm and DD format date

01:35:48.930 --> 01:35:59.010
format yeah date format just as a as a string and even try

01:35:59.010 --> 01:36:13.180
to check user message and understand for how many person

01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:25.500
person user is planning to to book a flight and return that

01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:35.220
in the same a string if such information is not available

01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:47.940
then give me some helpful amazing beautiful message as a

01:36:47.940 --> 01:36:52.580
return return fine so technically this is the prompt which i

01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:55.680
am like a sending right so this is the prompt which i am

01:36:55.680 --> 01:37:00.660
trying to send so whatever like a text that you are going to

01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:03.960
like a send over here whatever like messages that you are

01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:09.160
going to send to me right so based on that it is going to do

01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:12.160
the interpretation so let me send this like a text here

01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:18.920
inside my content uh somewhere else it has pasted okay yeah

01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:31.340
fine so here from delhi to like uh bombay whatever text you

01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:34.940
will like uh send so it will try to implement this one and

01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:37.780
then it will send to my gpt and gpt will give me some return

01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:43.980
and then like bingo okay so let me remove this uh reduce

01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:48.300
this temperature yeah and maximum token i think like 100 is

01:37:48.300 --> 01:37:52.740
more than enough yeah so in 100 token just return me this

01:37:52.740 --> 01:37:54.620
one and then i will send to this execute a step let's test

01:37:54.620 --> 01:37:55.960
it okay

01:37:57.970 --> 01:38:01.970
so content wise delhi bombay this and this so it is trying

01:38:01.970 --> 01:38:05.450
to understand this one right it is trying to understand this

01:38:05.450 --> 01:38:10.030
one and content by delhi bombay date and one yes it is able

01:38:10.030 --> 01:38:15.250
to return fine now i will be i will try to test it with some

01:38:15.250 --> 01:38:21.470
like a normal user prompt so give so hetal has pinged me

01:38:21.470 --> 01:38:27.750
this prompt by the way so this kindly fetch okay let me how

01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:34.450
i can copy cancel okay so this is the message i am sending

01:38:51.010 --> 01:38:53.850
a sending this message inside my yuri llm so let's see

01:38:53.850 --> 01:38:57.910
whether it is able to parse it or not so okay it is able to

01:38:57.910 --> 01:38:58.890
parse it and i will be like a sending this message and

01:38:58.890 --> 01:39:02.850
ahmadabad to delhi this is the content it is trying to

01:39:02.850 --> 01:39:07.290
return for two adults and two kids yeah this is the content

01:39:07.290 --> 01:39:14.030
it is able to return but okay i can try to send this input

01:39:14.030 --> 01:39:15.810
to my ai agents

01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:23.560
so let me attach this to this ai agent this is the input

01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:27.580
which i am going to send so this is the content which i am

01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:31.240
getting let me replace this text with a content which i have

01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:36.560
received now and let it parse let it do the job yeah so

01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:38.380
execute the step so

01:39:40.810 --> 01:39:46.170
ok amd delhi right it is able to convert see ahmadabad and

01:39:46.170 --> 01:39:49.130
delhi right so amd delhi this is able to find out so means

01:39:49.130 --> 01:39:52.190
it is able to find out the location code and adults is equal

01:39:52.190 --> 01:39:55.550
to 2 kids it is not considering if I am going to give a

01:39:55.550 --> 01:40:00.970
prompt but it is falling under status is equals to ask user

01:40:00.970 --> 01:40:07.350
right so I just have to change my system prompt there then

01:40:07.350 --> 01:40:08.490
yeah

01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:14.800
so I just have to change

01:40:18.290 --> 01:40:22.410
my system prompt here so you are helpful this this this this

01:40:22.410 --> 01:40:27.250
this json object either contain contain sir ready to use

01:40:27.250 --> 01:40:33.110
payload for immediate flight offer sir you are know the use

01:40:33.110 --> 01:40:37.230
sort user message return one json that either contain ready

01:40:37.230 --> 01:40:41.050
to use payload for the immediate flight offer sir jpa or ask

01:40:41.050 --> 01:40:47.230
user for the ok so that contain not ready to use I will say

01:40:47.230 --> 01:40:48.030
ah

01:40:50.650 --> 01:40:52.050
information

01:40:53.940 --> 01:41:04.300
for flight booking in string format maybe maybe or some

01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:05.980
other parse

01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:19.860
that data and then ah. So. Try to identify origin and

01:41:19.860 --> 01:41:29.920
destination and if origin and destination is available

01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:31.220
available

01:41:36.230 --> 01:41:47.290
as a code use it directly if not available. Try to find it.

01:41:47.290 --> 01:42:01.780
On your own. Ok so this I can do now execute it has you are

01:42:01.780 --> 01:42:04.720
not a helpful this this this this this problem in ordinary

01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:07.240
model doesn't fit the required format.

01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:10.880
I

01:42:13.630 --> 01:42:17.910
just have to fix that particular part ok

01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:23.560
so

01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:44.940
let me fix my prompt and then it will be like working.

01:43:30.180 --> 01:43:32.620
Sir we are asking for the structure output json format that

01:43:32.620 --> 01:43:35.420
may be cause a problem no it should give me like ah see at

01:43:35.420 --> 01:43:37.800
the end of the day ah structure output format obviously it

01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:39.880
should return but yeah it should understand this particular

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:45.460
part the text that we are trying to like ah send I can I can

01:43:45.460 --> 01:43:48.560
do it even in a previous step in a URI itself I can like a

01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:52.880
HTTPS URI request itself I can do it means this itself will

01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:55.320
give me like a that one maybe I just have to change the

01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:58.560
model over here so if I am going to like a give a real time

01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:03.800
search model. A Gemini flex flex like a a flash model access

01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:08.340
so I think in that way it will be more much better and

01:44:15.930 --> 01:44:19.870
I I can like you know try changing this prompt as well the

01:44:19.870 --> 01:44:23.110
prompt which I am using as of now inside this so maybe I can

01:44:23.110 --> 01:44:27.130
try to like a work on that prompt little bit ok

01:45:16.180 --> 01:45:22.200
so I am going to change my prompt my system prompt a little

01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:25.920
bit I am going to modify it so that it will be more

01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:30.680
expressive. Ok. And then let's try to test it so this is the

01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:35.880
this will go as a input yeah now it's working it seems and

01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:38.520
the status is not ask user so it will not send back a

01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:42.400
message to the telegram asking for the like a detail so yeah

01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:46.440
now now it's like a it looks it's like a working I can try

01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:50.000
to make it active right I can try to make it active over

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:57.440
here and now I can send maybe a message in this way let's

01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:00.640
see so whether we are able to get some response or not ok

01:46:07.450 --> 01:46:10.270
seems like it's working yeah

01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:19.180
so now I have just send a message in this way kindly find

01:46:19.180 --> 01:46:21.980
the cheapest flight for Ahmedabad really this this this this

01:46:21.980 --> 01:46:26.400
this and see I am able to receive 31 messages right so it is

01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:29.820
it is working for me so now in a natural language I can ask

01:46:29.820 --> 01:46:32.940
so it's all about LLMs and prompt guys I just have to tune

01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:37.240
my prompt LLMs and its respective output all will work I

01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:39.400
don't have to write code over here. That's. That's this is

01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:42.660
where this power of LLM comes into picture so obviously like

01:46:42.660 --> 01:46:46.540
the selection of LLMs plays a very important role how you

01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:49.080
are going to configure the LLM what kind of a instruction

01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:52.260
prompt you are going to give because as per the prompt LLM

01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:55.000
is going to behave LLM is going to respond but yeah the

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:58.460
problem that we have in our hand I think we are able to

01:46:58.460 --> 01:47:01.660
solve that problem right everyone can

01:47:04.190 --> 01:47:06.950
we use strategy PTA yeah you can use anything that you want

01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:09.950
it's like up to you so yeah ok.

01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:24.840
So how

01:47:30.530 --> 01:47:33.590
to build a stock agent search so just try to use any stock

01:47:33.590 --> 01:47:37.530
provider API yeah and maybe on a rapid API itself you will

01:47:37.530 --> 01:47:41.850
be able to find lots of stock provider integration so

01:47:41.850 --> 01:47:45.430
directly you can use that and then like you know you will be

01:47:45.430 --> 01:47:47.810
able to get it and Ravai is asking how we can get a data

01:47:47.810 --> 01:47:50.850
frame so see in it and always try to give you a JSON as a

01:47:50.850 --> 01:47:54.290
response now when you are sending those data to someone else

01:47:54.290 --> 01:47:57.810
over there you can try to convert it right. On that location

01:47:57.810 --> 01:47:59.270
you can try to convert it. You can convert that as a data

01:47:59.270 --> 01:48:00.390
frame ok

01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:18.780
sir how to convert it on a using URI STTP Bebhook I remember

01:48:18.780 --> 01:48:21.100
you said STTP no it's not a Bebhook Bebhook is just a

01:48:21.100 --> 01:48:23.700
reverse of API so API is something which someone calls

01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:26.340
Bebhook will be called Bebhook is also API it's nothing

01:48:26.340 --> 01:48:29.120
different but yeah so it's been configured in such a way

01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:31.920
that when some event will happen then it will be triggered

01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:34.580
for example when we are sending a message right when we are

01:48:34.580 --> 01:48:37.720
sending a message through a telegram so then Bebhook will be

01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:40.300
called and it is triggering my entire like a workbook. So

01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:43.320
this is the actual like application of a Bebhook you can say

01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:49.720
output to the telegram you are sending in a JavaScript

01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:52.740
format sir we need to do it in every time it's not a

01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:55.380
JavaScript format JavaScript is a programming language right

01:48:55.380 --> 01:48:58.420
inside JavaScript I have converted things into a text

01:48:58.420 --> 01:49:02.320
technically it's a JSON but one of the attribute inside a

01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:06.360
JSON is a text which is considering or which is keeping the

01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:08.840
actual information and that information I have mapped to the

01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:13.580
final user right. Because any time always returns a JSON. So

01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:17.460
in a text in one of the key text I have kept this

01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:21.120
information one by one one by one from one big JSON because

01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:25.420
in one big JSON I have 90 records so 90 record I don't want

01:49:25.420 --> 01:49:28.760
to you know dump to my user right. Maybe I would like to

01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:31.460
send some sort of emojis over there maybe I would like to

01:49:31.460 --> 01:49:33.500
send some sort of an image rendering or something in the

01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:36.260
text itself so that you know my message should look more

01:49:36.260 --> 01:49:39.460
beautiful. So yeah I can I can do it inside a JavaScript

01:49:39.460 --> 01:49:45.440
final text message format itself can we replace that model

01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:49.600
to a URI chart model you can't replace it with the agent if

01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:52.420
you have to replace it so maybe replace the entire agent

01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:56.620
itself that is possible yeah that is possible

01:49:59.530 --> 01:50:05.270
okay so hope all of you are feeling good yeah we are able to

01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:07.970
build one more application end to end like an integration

01:50:07.970 --> 01:50:11.250
it's in a production it's active it's working people are

01:50:11.250 --> 01:50:13.330
able to ping it unless and until I am not going to

01:50:13.330 --> 01:50:17.430
deactivate it it will up and running and you don't need any

01:50:17.430 --> 01:50:20.790
access of this one so just have to ping my bot and my bot

01:50:20.790 --> 01:50:23.530
will keep on doing things whatever whatever you are looking

01:50:23.530 --> 01:50:27.610
for right. So I can I can just try to create a URI bot so

01:50:27.610 --> 01:50:31.130
where you know people can keep on pinging my URI bot will

01:50:31.130 --> 01:50:33.690
give a response and then you can send the same response to a

01:50:33.690 --> 01:50:36.650
telegram or any other machine system and that too in a no

01:50:36.650 --> 01:50:40.690
time we can we can do it so lot of possibilities right lot

01:50:40.690 --> 01:50:43.510
of possibilities you all will be able to find out in this

01:50:43.510 --> 01:50:47.670
one not just one or two. And a lot of like automation so

01:50:47.670 --> 01:50:51.270
whatever I can imagine I can I can like you know automated a

01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:54.250
small or big doesn't matter but yeah I can I can automate it

01:50:59.340 --> 01:51:03.700
kindly share the updated JSON file okay so this updated one

01:51:03.700 --> 01:51:11.840
download and your own flight flight

01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:15.860
updated okay so

01:51:18.060 --> 01:51:27.120
here it goes. Okay. I have sent you so yeah I'll face a

01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:29.980
couple of problem and then I'll you know handle it simple

01:51:29.980 --> 01:51:33.760
this is how like edge cases we used to handle in our like

01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:35.300
own way looks

01:51:58.340 --> 01:52:04.640
like there is no URI maybe I haven't saved okay

01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:08.080
we'll check okay

01:52:14.420 --> 01:52:18.080
so fine everyone this is one of the workflow it's a 1051

01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:23.240
right I was wondering that if I can discuss one more. Okay.

01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:28.060
So I have already prepared that workflow as well so this

01:52:28.060 --> 01:52:31.140
workflow is this by the way so this will close for like you

01:52:31.140 --> 01:52:34.360
know and even this is running in my like a production so

01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:37.920
this is like a my mail watcher kind of a workflow so which

01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:41.500
will you know keep on watching my mails and I have designed

01:52:41.500 --> 01:52:44.060
this specifically for invoice I can design it for any

01:52:44.060 --> 01:52:47.580
purposes or even for the multi purposes so basically what

01:52:47.580 --> 01:52:50.660
what the system does so this system basically keep on

01:52:50.660 --> 01:52:53.720
watching my. Like a mails as per the system. the schedule

01:52:53.720 --> 01:52:57.040
trigger so let's suppose if i have scheduled like every five

01:52:57.040 --> 01:52:59.820
minute or maybe if i have scheduled for every day so it will

01:52:59.820 --> 01:53:03.940
go to my mail and uh it will try to check so whether like uh

01:53:03.940 --> 01:53:06.800
it will try to fetch first of all all the mails uh for that

01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:10.180
particular day or for that interval and then it will try to

01:53:10.180 --> 01:53:13.560
like check that whether there is some invoice or not and

01:53:13.560 --> 01:53:16.980
then like uh it will try to check that it will try to pass

01:53:16.980 --> 01:53:20.140
the invoice basically right you will try to pass the invoice

01:53:20.140 --> 01:53:24.300
and then if there is a invoice if there is a receipt it will

01:53:24.300 --> 01:53:27.800
try to you know understand it and then send me the uh like a

01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:32.120
email yeah and it is going to mark my email as a read so

01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:36.920
this is again another framework for invoice what invoice

01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:39.680
processing not processing i would say but yeah for invoice

01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:43.680
watching but i think it's time so let's not discuss this one

01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:53.590
let's do one thing uh maybe quickly uh we can so there are

01:53:53.590 --> 01:53:58.090
so many flows i have already created for all of you i'm also

01:53:58.090 --> 01:54:02.910
working on one of the projects so we are like uh we are

01:54:02.910 --> 01:54:05.910
doing hundreds of automation not just one or two almost all

01:54:05.910 --> 01:54:09.750
every kind of automation for hr sales uh managers founders

01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:15.030
everyone so i have already started working with my team uh

01:54:15.030 --> 01:54:18.270
and and we are like uh creating a big big automation system

01:54:18.270 --> 01:54:23.550
there so soon we'll go come up with the course or something

01:54:23.550 --> 01:54:29.730
a live one maybe so here excuse

01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:45.120
me today

01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:02.680
was very very interesting to you next weekend interactive

01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:05.640
session like today i think yeah all the sessions are going

01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:08.020
to be interactive apart from couple of sessions so where it

01:55:08.020 --> 01:55:10.260
is like a boring okay

01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:19.220
so uh i would like to show you something autogen so

01:55:19.220 --> 01:55:21.640
basically autogen is another framework and like i said so

01:55:21.640 --> 01:55:25.180
autogen is uh basically like a framework so where they are

01:55:25.180 --> 01:55:27.880
giving you ui options as well as they are giving you a uh

01:55:27.880 --> 01:55:31.820
code option right so they are giving you this it's more like

01:55:31.820 --> 01:55:34.480
a crew ai as of now in our future so everyone is trying to

01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:37.380
evolve and everyone is trying to evolve in this way itself

01:55:37.380 --> 01:55:40.420
so everyone is trying to you know like evolve and they are

01:55:40.420 --> 01:55:43.100
trying to give you this option but i believe in it and is uh

01:55:43.100 --> 01:55:47.020
having a edge they are like a best in a market i don't know

01:55:47.020 --> 01:55:49.820
like after one or two year what will happen but i think nfn

01:55:49.820 --> 01:55:52.580
will be able to you know will be suffice for every kind of

01:55:52.580 --> 01:55:56.180
work that we are going to do but uh there is a autogen and

01:55:56.180 --> 01:55:59.360
if i have to uh like you know configure autogen so maybe i

01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:04.320
can try to use my cmd and maybe i can try to use a vs code

01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:07.320
anywhere cmd is available we can try to use it and simply

01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:10.940
you have to do one thing pip install autogen studio so this

01:56:10.940 --> 01:56:13.660
is the only thing if pip is available simple pip install

01:56:13.660 --> 01:56:17.040
autogen studio so this is the command you have to fire from

01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:22.300
your uh cmd right cmd or power cell or from anywhere you can

01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:25.200
try to our terminal anywhere you can try to fire this

01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:28.380
command i have just been using this command and once this is

01:56:28.380 --> 01:56:31.140
available right once this is able to do the installation

01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:34.480
then second command autogen studio the installation that you

01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:37.720
have done in the last previous step ui port number 8081

01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:42.820
simple if your 8081 is occupied then give 8082 so it is

01:56:42.820 --> 01:56:46.780
going to start a autogen in a ui mode by the way yeah it is

01:56:46.780 --> 01:56:50.180
going to start a autogen in a ui mode and you will be able

01:56:50.180 --> 01:56:53.940
to access uh autogen at this port one twenty seven zero zero

01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:58.420
dot one eighty eighty one the this is so this is how simple

01:56:58.420 --> 01:57:01.320
it is within one minute of time you will be able to launch

01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:04.640
autogen inside your system so this is the autogen studio

01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:10.520
guys working in my local are you able to launch autogen yeah

01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:21.580
so after installing second command start it right if your

01:57:21.580 --> 01:57:25.580
8081 port number is occupied give 882 883 884 whatever you

01:57:25.580 --> 01:57:28.560
want just give it right just make sure that then like a

01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:34.280
local host and then 8081 or 127.0.0.1 right and 8081 port

01:57:34.280 --> 01:57:37.520
number that you have given and here you will be able to see

01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:44.500
uh autogen studio by microsoft basically and like i said so

01:57:44.500 --> 01:57:47.500
whatever you will be able to build it here by drag and drop

01:57:47.500 --> 01:57:50.820
right exactly same thing you will be able to build it even

01:57:50.820 --> 01:57:54.740
by code even you can build it here download a code modify it

01:57:54.740 --> 01:57:59.980
in some code bases possible right so are you are you able to

01:57:59.980 --> 01:58:03.900
launch it guys auto gen so this is again and again the

01:58:03.900 --> 01:58:07.660
philosophy of agent a philosophy of tool philosophy of

01:58:07.660 --> 01:58:13.780
memory philosophy of llm everything is same without even a

01:58:13.780 --> 01:58:17.000
point zero zero zero zero zero zero one percent of changes

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:20.620
so whatever we have studied so far starting from our lang

01:58:20.620 --> 01:58:25.160
chain class right about a agent about a tool about a memory

01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:29.580
nothing is going to change in theory even with respect to

01:58:29.580 --> 01:58:34.620
autogen simple installation is going on sir okay it will not

01:58:34.620 --> 01:58:37.680
take more than two three minutes take your time so just let

01:58:37.680 --> 01:58:40.440
me know once you are able to see this ui interface autogen

01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:42.320
ui interface openly

01:58:44.300 --> 01:58:47.340
parsing completion this is more module name openly lip

01:58:47.340 --> 01:58:53.680
parsing okay so just like uh install this before installing

01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:58.250
your autogen this should not give an issue i think it should

01:58:58.250 --> 01:58:58.990
work directly

01:59:02.540 --> 01:59:07.060
autogen is in demand as corps are able to crack a better

01:59:07.060 --> 01:59:10.420
live with autogen microsoft is giving it a cop window

01:59:10.420 --> 01:59:14.740
package i mean like yes today is maybe a with one company

01:59:14.740 --> 01:59:18.140
they have cracked a deal uh again so if you will go and

01:59:18.140 --> 01:59:20.940
check rosarpay right so yesterday their cxos group someone

01:59:20.940 --> 01:59:23.600
has pinged over there that insider rosarpay rosarpay is

01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:26.580
again a big company right a very very big company in india

01:59:26.580 --> 01:59:29.060
one of the leading payment gateway not leading i would say

01:59:29.060 --> 01:59:32.220
one of the dominating payment gateway like a provider they

01:59:32.220 --> 01:59:33.980
are using any 10 yeah

01:59:38.850 --> 01:59:43.010
so it's it's just like an adoption right so every platform

01:59:43.010 --> 01:59:45.970
every good platform will be having a a lot of like our

01:59:45.970 --> 01:59:47.670
adopters just

01:59:52.600 --> 01:59:55.980
try installing the first part uh uh sorry the first command

01:59:55.980 --> 01:59:58.980
which i have pinged you people install autogen studio that

01:59:58.980 --> 02:00:01.140
should actually work if

02:00:07.730 --> 02:00:10.750
you are getting some open a kind of issue then in that case

02:00:10.750 --> 02:00:14.430
just upgrade your like a open ai yeah so mukesh is saying he

02:00:14.430 --> 02:00:17.410
is able to launch what about others yeah

02:00:27.300 --> 02:00:31.380
working okay able to launch autogen that's great great yeah

02:00:31.380 --> 02:00:35.120
so here if you will uh come into this autogen so their user

02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:39.640
interface looks in a very first place right uh now here so

02:00:39.640 --> 02:00:41.940
you will be able to find out something called a setting tab

02:00:41.940 --> 02:00:46.340
let's start from there right so setting tab over here and

02:00:46.340 --> 02:00:49.000
here so you will be able to see a simple ui setting nothing

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:52.940
much default model wise so here openai chat completion model

02:00:52.940 --> 02:00:55.680
this is something that they have given you you can try to

02:00:55.680 --> 02:00:58.220
click and you can try to edit you can try to give your own

02:00:58.220 --> 02:01:01.700
api key over here right you can change base url just like

02:01:01.700 --> 02:01:04.260
like any other thing that you do so you can do it over here

02:01:04.260 --> 02:01:07.080
now environment variable wise so the way we use to set a

02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:09.960
variable inside credential you can say right your variable

02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:14.160
here so there is nothing much inside the setting now uh

02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:17.880
let's talk about user so again there is no option or nothing

02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:21.520
inside a user except sign out option this is just a dark and

02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:24.920
light mode option right then we have something called as

02:01:24.920 --> 02:01:28.080
team builder so basically inside autogen they are following

02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:31.580
a philosophy of teams so like this automation that we have

02:01:31.580 --> 02:01:33.960
done right so this is something called as one team you can

02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:39.640
say yeah like a following over here and again so everything

02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:42.200
is given to you in a drag and drop drag and drop drag and

02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:45.380
drop drag and drop kind of a format now what happens so

02:01:45.380 --> 02:01:47.760
let's come to this uh gallery and then i'll come to the

02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:50.420
playground and then i'll come to team builder so first come

02:01:50.420 --> 02:01:54.040
to gallery guys yeah so inside a gallery if you will come

02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:57.220
you will be able to find out some of the teams technically

02:01:57.220 --> 02:02:00.240
four teams four teams means so they have already created

02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:03.980
four agents teams are nothing but agents or you can say in

02:02:03.980 --> 02:02:06.600
other word you can say it's a workflow that you can say it's

02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:09.120
a workflow way we have created a workflow over here so they

02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:12.260
have created one workflow so one is round robin team one is

02:02:12.260 --> 02:02:14.920
a selection team something called as dev agent team

02:02:14.920 --> 02:02:18.460
something they have created agent for a deep search so these

02:02:18.460 --> 02:02:21.420
are the default you all will be able to find out i have not

02:02:21.420 --> 02:02:24.740
created it basically autogen people have given you by

02:02:24.740 --> 02:02:29.240
default so that you can test it yeah then they have given

02:02:29.240 --> 02:02:31.740
basically this is a gallery gallery means like some pre

02:02:31.740 --> 02:02:34.600
-built things you will be able to find out then here you

02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:36.600
will be able to find out the agents so here you will be able

02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:37.660
to find out the agents so there is something called as web

02:02:37.660 --> 02:02:40.660
surfing agent verification agent proxy agent new agent

02:02:40.660 --> 02:02:43.600
whatsapp agent assistant agent so they have created some of

02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:49.310
the agents so we are using agent even in our like here right

02:02:49.310 --> 02:02:52.690
we are using a ai agent so they have also given you a ai

02:02:52.690 --> 02:02:55.770
agent kind of a features so they have given you some pre

02:02:55.770 --> 02:02:57.970
-built agent but again these many agents will not be

02:02:57.970 --> 02:03:01.330
sufficient you will be creating your own agent by the way

02:03:01.330 --> 02:03:04.930
they have given you tools tools means function so calculated

02:03:04.930 --> 02:03:08.010
tool i think we have already used it in a in terms of code

02:03:08.010 --> 02:03:10.650
as well right so calibrated tool means calculator function

02:03:10.650 --> 02:03:12.670
they have given you image generation function they have

02:03:12.670 --> 02:03:15.690
given you uh web page fetch tool they have given you bing

02:03:15.690 --> 02:03:17.750
search tool they have given you google search python code

02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:20.830
execution tool so all of these functions they have given to

02:03:20.830 --> 02:03:24.130
you now model wise so by default they have given you like a

02:03:24.130 --> 02:03:28.130
open ai mini mistral anthropic azure open ai so these are

02:03:28.130 --> 02:03:30.730
the model they have given you now these are something which

02:03:30.730 --> 02:03:34.590
is available right and to build any like you know automation

02:03:34.590 --> 02:03:38.010
for example to build any such kind of model you can build

02:03:38.010 --> 02:03:38.010
any type of model you can build it in any way you want but

02:03:38.010 --> 02:03:40.890
obviously i need these things i need agent i need tool i

02:03:40.890 --> 02:03:46.430
need a model so here i can simply go and i can try to add a

02:03:46.430 --> 02:03:50.090
models yeah i can i can just like you know try to add a

02:03:50.090 --> 02:03:53.530
model over here and then i will be able to call my own model

02:03:53.530 --> 02:03:57.030
that option is also available you can try to add a model

02:03:57.030 --> 02:04:01.090
just by using this ui or sometime i love doing it with json

02:04:01.090 --> 02:04:04.870
right i love doing with json so provider i have to change

02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:07.850
change, then description, model name I have to change, API

02:04:07.850 --> 02:04:10.870
key I have to change and then I will start using some

02:04:10.870 --> 02:04:13.350
different model, so inside a JSON I will go, I will just try

02:04:13.350 --> 02:04:17.750
to change it and like my work will be done technically, yeah

02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:21.190
my work will be done technically over here. So model if I

02:04:21.190 --> 02:04:23.930
would like to add a new model I can add it, tools so let's

02:04:23.930 --> 02:04:26.450
suppose I would like to add some function, not an issue,

02:04:26.550 --> 02:04:30.570
click on add tool, give a new tool name, may be I can give a

02:04:30.570 --> 02:04:35.550
test over here, right, a function name I can try to give

02:04:35.550 --> 02:04:40.990
over here, so function name may be like a scrapper, any name

02:04:40.990 --> 02:04:46.050
I can try to give and then the way you write a code, a

02:04:46.050 --> 02:04:49.530
python code, it is the same python code you will be able to

02:04:49.530 --> 02:04:53.730
see here, nothing different, yeah, tool means function,

02:04:53.830 --> 02:04:56.270
right, technically this is the meaning of tool that we all

02:04:56.270 --> 02:04:59.990
have studied. So you have to write a plain function. You

02:04:59.990 --> 02:05:02.890
don't have to convert it into a tool or annotate it as a

02:05:02.890 --> 02:05:06.610
tool. By default when you are doing this, when you are

02:05:06.610 --> 02:05:10.070
trying to click on this add tool, whatever like a function

02:05:10.070 --> 02:05:12.750
that you are going to pass, it will decorate it. If I am

02:05:12.750 --> 02:05:14.950
doing it programmatically then we have to do a decoration,

02:05:15.130 --> 02:05:17.990
right, we have to use a decorator, a tool decorator to

02:05:17.990 --> 02:05:20.450
convert any function as a tool, so that system can

02:05:20.450 --> 02:05:22.650
understand means this framework, Autogen framework can

02:05:22.650 --> 02:05:25.110
understand or may be even in case of a lang chain and lang

02:05:25.110 --> 02:05:28.550
graph that will be able to understand but here simple and

02:05:28.550 --> 02:05:31.750
everything will be done. By UI itself, let's suppose I am

02:05:31.750 --> 02:05:34.650
writing this function, I need some import so I can click and

02:05:34.650 --> 02:05:38.190
I can try to write a import here itself, the way we write,

02:05:38.290 --> 02:05:41.010
right, like a import this package, import that packages, so

02:05:41.010 --> 02:05:43.130
I can try to write, for example, I am going to use maybe a

02:05:43.130 --> 02:05:47.270
pandas package, right, so I can try to write pandas over

02:05:47.270 --> 02:05:51.870
here, right and then I can, it will try to import pandas or

02:05:51.870 --> 02:05:55.330
may be direct import or from a module import, so module name

02:05:55.330 --> 02:05:57.550
and then import name I can try to give, so it will be able

02:05:57.550 --> 02:06:00.550
to import those packages, yeah. It will be able to import

02:06:00.550 --> 02:06:05.650
those packages, so I can directly, means the tool that we

02:06:05.650 --> 02:06:08.690
understand so far is nothing but just a function. I think

02:06:08.690 --> 02:06:11.670
since a beginning itself I keep on saying that tool is

02:06:11.670 --> 02:06:14.350
technically nothing but a function, yes, that is function,

02:06:14.670 --> 02:06:18.030
technically, yeah, so just because some agent is calling it,

02:06:18.110 --> 02:06:20.670
so we are calling it as a tool, after giving a decoration to

02:06:20.670 --> 02:06:24.070
it. So that, just write a pythonic function here and then

02:06:24.070 --> 02:06:26.090
everything is done, hope all of you are able to understand

02:06:26.090 --> 02:06:29.150
this calculator function, right. It is nothing actually.

02:06:29.150 --> 02:06:32.350
It's the same thing right and again you can try to check any

02:06:32.350 --> 02:06:36.450
other like a tool for example image generation tool right

02:06:36.450 --> 02:06:39.610
you can go they have done the import all the imports and

02:06:39.610 --> 02:06:44.230
it's a simple python function right nothing much simple

02:06:44.230 --> 02:06:48.890
python function yeah that is that is been like a use so

02:06:48.890 --> 02:06:52.690
which is going to do the image generation for me fetch wave

02:06:52.690 --> 02:06:55.970
tool right I can come and I can try to check again simple

02:06:55.970 --> 02:06:59.170
python function which is taking some input and which is

02:06:59.170 --> 02:07:02.070
trying to give you some sort of a return so you can try to

02:07:02.070 --> 02:07:05.370
write any complex function and you can configure it as a

02:07:05.370 --> 02:07:09.310
tool so what autogen is trying to do so they are giving you

02:07:09.310 --> 02:07:12.550
a direct interface where you can simply go and you know

02:07:12.550 --> 02:07:17.170
write a code or copy paste the code and use it as a tool

02:07:17.170 --> 02:07:22.190
yeah simple so here like I said I can try to add any of my

02:07:22.190 --> 02:07:25.370
tool with any of my name just copy paste out like a code

02:07:25.370 --> 02:07:28.190
over here you have to take care of input and the output. You

02:07:28.190 --> 02:07:31.130
just have to understand that part and rest will be taken

02:07:31.130 --> 02:07:36.270
care of so now tool is fine model is fine coming to the

02:07:36.270 --> 02:07:40.470
agent agent means a kind of you know entity which will be

02:07:40.470 --> 02:07:44.270
able to access some LLMs means models which will be able to

02:07:44.270 --> 02:07:47.130
access some memories I can attach some memories to it and

02:07:47.130 --> 02:07:50.010
which will be able to access one or many tools like this is

02:07:50.010 --> 02:07:53.190
what the agent is so again I can try to click and I can try

02:07:53.190 --> 02:07:56.390
to add a agent I can try to use maybe the existing agent

02:07:56.390 --> 02:07:59.770
right. So. So assistant agent if I will talk about so here

02:07:59.770 --> 02:08:05.250
again like I can I can try to add a tool I can try to

02:08:05.250 --> 02:08:08.370
because this is what agent does when I say agent agent means

02:08:08.370 --> 02:08:11.210
what I can add as many tools as possible as many memory as

02:08:11.210 --> 02:08:14.570
possible as many models as possible now this is something

02:08:14.570 --> 02:08:17.490
that they have given to you yeah so configure model option

02:08:17.490 --> 02:08:21.550
give a prompt system prompt right give a user message you

02:08:21.550 --> 02:08:24.730
can say give a system prompt and then add a tool tool means

02:08:24.730 --> 02:08:28.290
any function. Just try to add it right the tool that you

02:08:28.290 --> 02:08:32.310
already have inside your like a gallery basically and then

02:08:32.310 --> 02:08:35.510
it will be like able to execute it you can do it from here

02:08:35.510 --> 02:08:40.130
or you can do it even from this JSON one yeah. So basically

02:08:40.130 --> 02:08:44.010
you can add as many tools as possible just by editing this

02:08:44.010 --> 02:08:47.990
JSON or just by editing this UI interface once all of this

02:08:47.990 --> 02:08:50.630
will be ready then you can go ahead with the team creation

02:08:50.630 --> 02:08:54.590
that okay so there is a team right you have to return a

02:08:54.590 --> 02:08:56.530
description that what this team should do. You have written

02:08:56.530 --> 02:09:02.830
a prompt that what it should do and then you will be calling

02:09:02.830 --> 02:09:06.530
some agent to it as simple as that. So this is like a team

02:09:06.530 --> 02:09:10.290
that I am going to create now so here we have a team builder

02:09:10.290 --> 02:09:13.630
and here we have a playground yeah so maybe I can I can try

02:09:13.630 --> 02:09:16.790
to click on new session and then I can you know like you

02:09:16.790 --> 02:09:21.390
know chat with my team that I want so whatever team that I

02:09:21.390 --> 02:09:24.590
have I can try to select it and I can try to chat with that

02:09:24.590 --> 02:09:27.090
and I will be able to you know execute the task. The way we

02:09:27.090 --> 02:09:31.890
were executing it with n8n chat interface only chat

02:09:31.890 --> 02:09:35.950
interface for now yeah only chat interface if I already have

02:09:35.950 --> 02:09:39.170
a team or maybe I can try to create a new team over here and

02:09:39.170 --> 02:09:41.890
just by doing a drag and drop drag and drop I can configure

02:09:41.890 --> 02:09:45.430
agent model tool so whatever was available inside the

02:09:45.430 --> 02:09:48.410
gallery everything is available even over here right

02:09:48.410 --> 02:09:51.370
everything is available even over here so I can just call my

02:09:51.370 --> 02:09:55.510
agents my model and one by one one by one the way I was like

02:09:55.510 --> 02:09:58.990
doing it. With respect to n8n so in a similar manner I will

02:09:58.990 --> 02:10:04.870
be able to do it even over here. Now this is like a

02:10:04.870 --> 02:10:10.990
something which autogen is providing still its UI interface

02:10:10.990 --> 02:10:14.550
is evolving it's not rich they are not giving you like a

02:10:14.550 --> 02:10:19.890
component like n8n so when you are going at with a UI based

02:10:19.890 --> 02:10:23.710
approach you will face a lot of problems so I will strongly

02:10:23.710 --> 02:10:27.170
recommend to all of you. That go with the. Coding approach

02:10:27.170 --> 02:10:32.230
if you are adopting autogen right its UI interface is not

02:10:32.230 --> 02:10:36.010
that rich not that great and that is something which I am

02:10:36.010 --> 02:10:38.970
going to discuss in my next class I think it's a time now 11

02:10:38.970 --> 02:10:44.190
10 right so I will talk about that in your like a next class

02:10:44.190 --> 02:10:46.870
so I will try to show you with respect to UI it's very quick

02:10:46.870 --> 02:10:49.310
actually within 2 minute I can I can run one of the agent

02:10:49.310 --> 02:10:53.110
right. So whatever agent is available and then we will do a

02:10:53.110 --> 02:10:57.190
setup will do a configuration in our local. Coding and with

02:10:57.190 --> 02:11:00.870
the help of coding will create some agents attach some tools

02:11:00.870 --> 02:11:05.550
and then run the entire flow for a specific task and then

02:11:05.550 --> 02:11:07.910
next chapter fine.

02:11:09.110 --> 02:11:13.870
Is there a limitation for autogen lot of limitations if you

02:11:13.870 --> 02:11:15.890
are going ahead with a UI interface if you are going ahead

02:11:15.890 --> 02:11:18.910
with a coding approach then there is no limitation because

02:11:18.910 --> 02:11:22.430
code means you will be having all the controls you can even

02:11:22.430 --> 02:11:25.290
download the code basically so if you would like like a.

02:11:26.270 --> 02:11:28.570
Like configuration or something so yeah they are giving you

02:11:28.570 --> 02:11:31.350
option where you can try to download it you can download

02:11:31.350 --> 02:11:36.690
even code somewhere I have seen this option I don't remember

02:11:36.690 --> 02:11:42.510
here or maybe into a crew maybe I will just check but yeah

02:11:42.510 --> 02:11:47.650
if you are going ahead with autogen advice is not to go

02:11:47.650 --> 02:11:51.310
ahead with UI go ahead with the code learning

02:11:53.900 --> 02:11:57.360
all is fine but which is best for mastery. So see even if

02:11:57.360 --> 02:11:59.740
you are going to get a mastery in one. It is not going to

02:11:59.740 --> 02:12:01.860
help you out I believe I have already given this answer so

02:12:01.860 --> 02:12:04.580
many times in the past. It depends upon your client it

02:12:04.580 --> 02:12:07.180
depends upon your company if your company is already using

02:12:07.180 --> 02:12:09.960
anything you can't go and force and say that okay use crew

02:12:09.960 --> 02:12:13.760
use autogen use llama or use lang right you can't force that

02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:16.360
you have to use that as simple as that so that's a real

02:12:16.360 --> 02:12:19.960
philosophy of all of these frameworks are same. You should

02:12:19.960 --> 02:12:22.320
know you should practice you should create couple of things

02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:24.920
in all of this framework so that it can go and claim that

02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:27.660
okay I know all the frameworks and maybe I am using this

02:12:27.660 --> 02:12:29.800
framework as a major framework. framework because my

02:12:29.800 --> 02:12:32.500
previous client and my company had a tie up with this one

02:12:32.500 --> 02:12:36.820
simple this is the answer right nothing is good nothing is

02:12:36.820 --> 02:12:40.100
bad I can do everything in every places it's just about a

02:12:40.100 --> 02:12:44.620
use of uses and like a you know tie up if I have to like a

02:12:44.620 --> 02:12:47.700
create a general purpose automation my preferred choice will

02:12:47.700 --> 02:12:54.390
be maybe like a init in Satyam I think I have already given

02:12:54.390 --> 02:12:57.230
you answer I was giving answer for you focus in a class I

02:12:57.230 --> 02:13:02.370
think that will be better for you yeah working

02:13:04.290 --> 02:13:07.430
now I can see why okay great so hope all of you are able to

02:13:07.430 --> 02:13:10.370
see the UI for autogen but the autogen I will start in next

02:13:10.370 --> 02:13:14.990
class not in this class this class I think it's time now so

02:13:14.990 --> 02:13:18.070
with that fine everyone I believe we all are able to like a

02:13:18.070 --> 02:13:22.560
next class please showcase two more cases of editing which

02:13:22.560 --> 02:13:28.700
you shared might fully integrate with the vs but ms might

02:13:28.700 --> 02:13:34.440
fully integrate with the vs code in future. See Microsoft is

02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:37.020
using lot of things Google is using lot of things at the end

02:13:37.020 --> 02:13:42.500
of the day the only thing which matters is which one you are

02:13:42.500 --> 02:13:44.880
going to use or your teams are going to use your company is

02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:48.140
going to use in like you know in real time to solve the

02:13:48.140 --> 02:13:51.500
client problem you won't be using all that's the first thing

02:13:51.500 --> 02:13:54.180
right it's not like you all will be using all the frameworks

02:13:54.180 --> 02:13:58.980
in one for one client that is practically impossible so just

02:13:58.980 --> 02:14:01.980
try to practice everything right. Nothing is good nothing is

02:14:01.980 --> 02:14:06.240
bad all technology exists right all alternatives exist and

02:14:06.240 --> 02:14:10.180
everyone is having a client base yeah only

02:14:13.260 --> 02:14:15.800
anything course is coming I am planning for that basically

02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:19.620
heavy automation so not a light weighted automation because

02:14:19.620 --> 02:14:22.740
when I am like going to bring such kind of a courses just

02:14:22.740 --> 02:14:25.920
for automation so obviously it should come with the heavy

02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:29.060
automation starting from the basic but yeah it should go

02:14:29.060 --> 02:14:33.340
towards a heavy heavy automation I am planning can't say

02:14:33.340 --> 02:14:39.180
much about it for now let's see in a future yeah because

02:14:39.180 --> 02:14:42.400
somewhere I feel like we can automate lot of like a task and

02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:45.300
even I have I have done that I have I am using it my team is

02:14:45.300 --> 02:14:49.500
using it right so we will try to bring something in future.

02:14:51.940 --> 02:14:55.360
What are the production level I mean big automation use

02:14:55.360 --> 02:14:59.100
cases we will talk about it in future I think we should

02:14:59.100 --> 02:15:01.760
leave some discussions for a future yeah.

02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:11.140
Trigger is not recognized as an internal external account.

02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:14.380
Command operable I think you should install first this is

02:15:14.380 --> 02:15:17.320
the installation issue you are hitting a direct Ganesh

02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:21.460
basically. Okay so if anyone is having any kind of a

02:15:21.460 --> 02:15:24.040
question please go and raise your hand if you don't have any

02:15:24.040 --> 02:15:28.100
any kind of a question so you can you can leave the session

02:15:28.100 --> 02:15:31.860
yeah so Mohit go ahead PK go ahead and if anyone else is

02:15:31.860 --> 02:15:34.400
having question raise your hand yeah

02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:43.000
go ahead go ahead Mohit first PK second Ujjwal third yeah

02:15:46.590 --> 02:15:52.470
so you have a question PK no okay. I have a question so I

02:15:52.470 --> 02:15:55.870
wanted to share my screen what is happening is I was trying

02:15:55.870 --> 02:15:59.090
to add a wait but this is not exactly this and it and

02:15:59.090 --> 02:16:01.910
project but it's something different can I share my screen

02:16:01.910 --> 02:16:07.990
okay you are trying to add what I'm trying to add wait in my

02:16:07.990 --> 02:16:09.850
agent

02:16:11.610 --> 02:16:14.670
workflow okay share a screen let's see what you are facing

02:16:14.670 --> 02:16:23.430
okay next one is Ujjwal good morning sir yeah tell me. Wal

02:16:23.430 --> 02:16:28.850
Herausforder Jeha Toon puck lal kane.

02:16:37.790 --> 02:16:46.210
Good morning. What's up. Ujjwal. Okay thanks break we will

02:16:46.210 --> 02:16:46.210
begin in just a minute when we come into the next stage but

02:16:46.210 --> 02:16:49.150
I wanted to add. Can you give a couple of slides please so I

02:16:49.150 --> 02:16:53.970
could take it if you have any questions more jobs as i have

02:16:53.970 --> 02:16:59.470
applied to multiple jobs but the response to like from them

02:16:59.470 --> 02:17:02.970
are not positive also i have applied for referrals as well

02:17:02.970 --> 02:17:07.950
so they are like not positive maybe there is a problem with

02:17:07.950 --> 02:17:12.330
the you know like a resume first of all right so that is one

02:17:12.330 --> 02:17:15.110
reason second reason could be so whatever like a information

02:17:15.110 --> 02:17:18.330
that you are mentioning so maybe that is a like a novice

02:17:18.330 --> 02:17:20.390
kind of information or you can say maybe that is a

02:17:20.390 --> 02:17:24.570
information uh just like a for someone who has done some

02:17:24.570 --> 02:17:27.810
dummy project uh because we all try to mention the projects

02:17:27.810 --> 02:17:30.690
and everything inside the resume right and the third problem

02:17:30.690 --> 02:17:33.150
is if you have mentioned a github link or something so maybe

02:17:33.150 --> 02:17:37.190
your github or something is not having a project which can

02:17:37.190 --> 02:17:41.710
impress someone in a first look itself that could be the

02:17:41.710 --> 02:17:44.850
reason that could be three or four reason i can highlight uh

02:17:44.850 --> 02:17:48.150
for like uh not getting a call because people are getting a

02:17:48.150 --> 02:17:50.690
call there is an opportunity a lot of opportunities are

02:17:50.690 --> 02:17:54.810
available market is opening up once again right so yes there

02:17:54.810 --> 02:17:57.370
is opportunity but uh you should look into this three to

02:17:57.370 --> 02:18:01.930
four reason that's my advice yes sir uh actually i have used

02:18:01.930 --> 02:18:06.750
your resume for uh upgrading or revamping my resume yeah

02:18:06.750 --> 02:18:09.710
resume i will try to format your resume i believe we

02:18:09.710 --> 02:18:11.810
understand that part right but let's suppose you have not

02:18:11.810 --> 02:18:13.990
mentioned the content let's suppose you have mentioned some

02:18:13.990 --> 02:18:18.110
uh kegel project right so resume i will try to refresh it in

02:18:18.110 --> 02:18:21.110
a list way but that kegel project will be a kegel project

02:18:21.110 --> 02:18:25.430
agree yes sir still inside your resume so this is what i'm

02:18:25.430 --> 02:18:29.750
trying to say that try to add something good right then use

02:18:29.750 --> 02:18:33.870
a resume responsibility of resume is to make it better and

02:18:33.870 --> 02:18:36.710
beautiful if you are uploading your resume if you are going

02:18:36.710 --> 02:18:39.490
through you know a scratch resume creation because we have

02:18:39.490 --> 02:18:42.270
two options right plus three option technically so you can

02:18:42.270 --> 02:18:44.890
even try to give your job description uh in the option

02:18:44.890 --> 02:18:47.330
number one and then it will try to like consider that part

02:18:47.330 --> 02:18:51.470
job description and so try to first of all finalize the

02:18:51.470 --> 02:18:57.250
content of the resume okay yeah content because that matters

02:18:57.250 --> 02:19:00.930
some that matters the most plus the github right it should

02:19:00.930 --> 02:19:03.770
it should like create a good impression in front of people

02:19:03.770 --> 02:19:06.070
maybe you can send it to me once you have these things right

02:19:06.070 --> 02:19:08.250
so maybe you can send it to me for a review i'll like a

02:19:08.250 --> 02:19:11.630
check uh maybe i'll just have a look for like a 30 second

02:19:11.630 --> 02:19:17.670
and i'll give my feedback yeah sure yeah thank you sir thank

02:19:17.670 --> 02:19:22.090
you yeah okay so i think pk you are sharing your screen

02:19:22.090 --> 02:19:24.470
right anyone else guys if you have any question anything

02:19:24.470 --> 02:19:33.670
like you can raise your hand otherwise yeah sorry it is

02:19:33.670 --> 02:19:40.690
uh reaching the maximum token limit for a minute and uh i'm

02:19:40.690 --> 02:19:45.830
using this open ai chat model i am using turbo and uh is

02:19:45.830 --> 02:19:49.950
reaching a maximum token limit show me that i'll i'll show

02:19:49.950 --> 02:19:54.650
you that i have i guess this is the one you see rate limit

02:19:54.650 --> 02:19:57.790
raise for gpt for turbo preview in organization or per

02:19:57.790 --> 02:20:02.510
minute uh three thirty thousand okay thirty thousand so

02:20:02.510 --> 02:20:04.910
basically like use twenty one thousand got it got it got it

02:20:04.910 --> 02:20:08.150
got it got it uh go to your open account so from where you

02:20:08.150 --> 02:20:14.530
are using this key okay sir uh but the issue here what is

02:20:14.530 --> 02:20:15.270
happening uh

02:20:23.910 --> 02:20:30.030
so if somehow if we could uh put a weight before we request

02:20:30.030 --> 02:20:34.590
anything that would probably solve uh this issue wait means

02:20:34.590 --> 02:20:37.990
priority you're trying to set right uh i want to add few

02:20:37.990 --> 02:20:41.610
milliseconds of weight before the next request goes that you

02:20:41.610 --> 02:20:44.710
will make me reach now it will take two minutes or three

02:20:44.710 --> 02:20:48.010
minutes um

02:21:01.270 --> 02:21:06.270
with yuri uh chat model but uh there is only open router

02:21:06.270 --> 02:21:10.850
available as a chat model uh where you can add yuri like api

02:21:10.850 --> 02:21:16.830
but if if we have to create a uv yuri chat model we would

02:21:16.830 --> 02:21:21.170
have to build our own chat model here is this something

02:21:21.170 --> 02:21:23.810
which we can build on our you don't have to build a chat

02:21:23.810 --> 02:21:28.210
model by the way just send a http request see any chat model

02:21:28.210 --> 02:21:30.710
will take a like a request and then it will give you a

02:21:30.710 --> 02:21:33.610
response right so technically just try to call a http

02:21:33.610 --> 02:21:37.150
request and then send your like a messages and it will try

02:21:37.150 --> 02:21:39.810
to return you and you can try to showcase or even you can

02:21:39.810 --> 02:21:42.290
try to stream it i think i have already shown that part

02:21:42.290 --> 02:21:46.990
multiple times not just one times so sir http request me

02:21:46.990 --> 02:21:50.290
abhi kya hai ye jo browser agent hai it decides on its own

02:21:50.290 --> 02:21:56.230
whether to put a request to the chat model or not but when i

02:21:56.230 --> 02:21:59.610
put http request i would need to explicitly provide that

02:21:59.610 --> 02:22:02.070
okay you can't you can't use a chat model by the way over

02:22:02.070 --> 02:22:04.570
here directly inside an agent so they are not giving you

02:22:04.570 --> 02:22:07.930
direct option that's a that's a problem so maybe you have to

02:22:07.930 --> 02:22:11.670
go in a other route so see when we try to use some

02:22:11.670 --> 02:22:14.410
programming languages maybe or some programming frames or

02:22:14.410 --> 02:22:18.710
something what do we do so we try to create a separate agent

02:22:18.710 --> 02:22:22.010
we try to create a separate tool yes and then we try to

02:22:22.010 --> 02:22:24.350
create a separate instance of the chat model and then we try

02:22:24.350 --> 02:22:27.730
to attach it right we try to configure it now here agent is

02:22:27.730 --> 02:22:30.130
what agent is something which is having an access of tools

02:22:30.130 --> 02:22:34.270
memories and chat model that's it yeah okay now so i will be

02:22:34.270 --> 02:22:37.670
using a chat model as a uri https request i will be creating

02:22:37.670 --> 02:22:40.830
all the tools and functionality separately right and i will

02:22:40.830 --> 02:22:42.970
try to attach memory separately and then i will try to

02:22:42.970 --> 02:22:46.230
combine it this is one of the way where you will be able to

02:22:46.230 --> 02:22:49.370
create a agent replica the one entity replica

02:22:52.510 --> 02:22:56.610
okay yeah uh this is like a one thing because this is the

02:22:56.610 --> 02:23:00.170
only way by which you can do it and it has not given you a

02:23:00.170 --> 02:23:03.650
provision so where you can try to configure a custom one as

02:23:03.650 --> 02:23:05.930
a chat model maybe in a future they are going to give you

02:23:05.930 --> 02:23:08.710
that uh provision as well because i i think they will bring

02:23:08.710 --> 02:23:11.230
for sure because nowadays many people are trying to deploy

02:23:11.230 --> 02:23:14.850
their own model in their own instances right and if i am the

02:23:14.850 --> 02:23:17.190
one who is like a deploying my own model in my own instances

02:23:17.190 --> 02:23:22.750
obviously like uh you know i i should go with that okay so

02:23:22.750 --> 02:23:25.590
the only option i got is a reach

02:23:44.150 --> 02:23:49.730
one minute so is that a good option yeah do one thing if it

02:23:49.730 --> 02:23:53.830
is reaching then just limit the token the token uses in

02:23:53.830 --> 02:24:00.330
every step maybe just say just use 500 or 1000 or maybe 800

02:24:00.330 --> 02:24:05.070
as per the case by case so that your token limit is

02:24:05.070 --> 02:24:09.650
exceeding in a minute if your limit is 30,000 in a minute

02:24:09.650 --> 02:24:12.410
then you have to control that it should be within 30 the

02:24:12.410 --> 02:24:20.650
tool that you have made limit that one itself ok we have to

02:24:20.650 --> 02:24:24.550
see the limit we will google it it is a simple option we

02:24:24.550 --> 02:24:25.930
have also written that

02:24:29.110 --> 02:24:34.190
this agent should not use more than this token so that is

02:24:34.190 --> 02:24:36.150
something that you can try to send inside the user and

02:24:36.150 --> 02:24:39.410
system message itself you can put it inside the system

02:24:39.410 --> 02:24:44.830
message for any of this one you have to write simple chat

02:24:44.830 --> 02:24:48.470
you don't have to do much in that system message ok sir

02:24:48.470 --> 02:24:53.850
point noted here do one thing click on chat model open eye

02:24:53.850 --> 02:24:58.590
chat model which you have configured here you click ok add

02:24:58.590 --> 02:25:06.160
option add option number put it there if it is more than one

02:25:06.160 --> 02:25:07.140
call then it will not exceed it

02:25:12.240 --> 02:25:16.840
right right 200 means once that call is done right 200 minus

02:25:16.840 --> 02:25:21.640
is a minus attack minus means infinite ok now you have more

02:25:21.640 --> 02:25:25.740
options below add option to control right its frequency

02:25:25.740 --> 02:25:28.400
penalty means how much time timeout issue increase the

02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:33.080
timeout here maximum retry is make maximum retry 100 ok

02:25:33.080 --> 02:25:36.460
increase the timeout increase the maximum retry maximum

02:25:36.460 --> 02:25:41.940
retry is two written here do ten here no maximum do ten here

02:25:42.240 --> 02:25:54.080
okay timeout issue is also there right timeout is 6 60 60

02:25:54.080 --> 02:26:00.300
thousand 60 thousand milliseconds you can increase it 60

02:26:00.300 --> 02:26:02.060
thousand milliseconds means timeout after this much timeout

02:26:03.800 --> 02:26:09.360
60 thousand 1 lakh 2 lakh you can add another option add

02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:16.500
option here sampling temperature maybe you can control

02:26:16.500 --> 02:26:20.120
temperature to control randomness select here sampling

02:26:20.120 --> 02:26:23.360
temperature ok here it is 7 ok

02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:33.160
token also no no token will be the same basically it

02:26:33.160 --> 02:26:37.320
controls randomness temperature one more question is that

02:26:38.760 --> 02:26:41.060
can we do batch streaming because it is very cheap no no no

02:26:41.060 --> 02:26:43.540
actually batch and stream are same according to your model

02:26:43.540 --> 02:26:48.860
do that same thing streaming and batch are not different

02:26:48.860 --> 02:26:51.660
generally it is visible streaming means data is being

02:26:51.660 --> 02:26:56.100
generated it is the same thing what is happening there it is

02:26:56.100 --> 02:27:02.600
yielding let's take a simple example let's suppose you run a

02:27:02.600 --> 02:27:04.860
loop and output of that loop

02:27:08.760 --> 02:27:11.680
that is one approach of returning the data second approach

02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:14.840
can be as you are generating the data you are returning it

02:27:14.840 --> 02:27:22.780
you are not holding it ok so batch consumes more memory as

02:27:22.780 --> 02:27:26.420
you are streaming it means your memory is not occupied

02:27:26.420 --> 02:27:31.800
buffer memory is under control what will happen in batch

02:27:31.800 --> 02:27:36.340
let's suppose we write here give me 1 lakh token output so

02:27:36.340 --> 02:27:40.240
it will store 1 lakh somewhere in batch right when it is

02:27:40.240 --> 02:27:45.140
ready then only it will return what I understand from batch

02:27:45.140 --> 02:27:50.700
processing is whenever there is less load in this GPT GPUs

02:27:50.700 --> 02:27:53.580
that's when it will try to execute and it will give you a

02:27:53.580 --> 02:27:57.340
better pricing because our server is empty you can use us on

02:27:57.340 --> 02:28:03.140
off time so that you get less money no it doesn't mean that

02:28:03.140 --> 02:28:05.420
where is it written it is written in GPT

02:28:08.760 --> 02:28:12.220
batch processing means this it can't be any other you might

02:28:12.220 --> 02:28:16.420
have interpreted I think the term is different the term is

02:28:16.420 --> 02:28:20.580
different this is what I understand since my childhood as a

02:28:20.580 --> 02:28:28.160
batch processing in streaming ok some other term some batch

02:28:28.160 --> 02:28:31.220
but I will get you the correct term what do we call it batch

02:28:31.220 --> 02:28:35.320
means in a particular window whatever is being generated you

02:28:35.320 --> 02:28:41.340
hold it in something generally we do batch and comparison

02:28:41.340 --> 02:28:43.940
with the streaming batch vs streaming whether we should do

02:28:43.940 --> 02:28:47.420
batch or streaming that is a comparison maybe there will be

02:28:47.420 --> 02:28:53.180
some different contest ok so with this control I think your

02:28:53.180 --> 02:28:58.200
issue will be fixed ok I don't think that issue should come

02:28:58.200 --> 02:29:04.460
now ok sir one more thing suppose this project is made ok

02:29:04.460 --> 02:29:08.440
when we go productionize it my question is how do we

02:29:08.440 --> 02:29:12.300
evaluate how do we tell the companies whether this model is

02:29:12.300 --> 02:29:16.900
working properly how will it be justified no we are not

02:29:16.900 --> 02:29:20.600
talking about the model we are not talking about the model

02:29:20.600 --> 02:29:27.240
we are talking about that my process here is it working

02:29:27.240 --> 02:29:30.540
properly or not so if we talk about any 10 then you will see

02:29:30.540 --> 02:29:34.420
there is an evaluation option ok what you can do in that you

02:29:34.420 --> 02:29:39.200
can set test data you can set your quality score you can set

02:29:39.200 --> 02:29:43.360
evaluation trigger like you have set this project see third

02:29:43.360 --> 02:29:53.300
tab you can see it see evaluation tab ok save it and then

02:29:53.300 --> 02:29:54.740
evaluation ok

02:29:59.940 --> 02:30:04.220
so your evaluation process is more like the process that you

02:30:04.220 --> 02:30:07.960
have built that you are monitoring every thing every node

02:30:07.960 --> 02:30:12.480
and for every node you have written test condition and test

02:30:12.480 --> 02:30:16.020
data set is given to it if it goes up or down condition is

02:30:16.020 --> 02:30:22.260
yours so it means give this score or give me a trigger this

02:30:22.260 --> 02:30:25.800
node is not working properly so this is how evaluation

02:30:25.800 --> 02:30:30.560
happens in N8n technically so in corporates they go by this

02:30:30.560 --> 02:30:34.440
evaluation whether your system is working so this evaluation

02:30:34.440 --> 02:30:39.580
is basically configured by you this is a customized one this

02:30:39.580 --> 02:30:43.160
is not made by N8n this is just given by N8n this is

02:30:43.160 --> 02:30:46.260
configured by you according to your workflow which model you

02:30:46.260 --> 02:30:49.340
are using which agent you are using which tool is there see

02:30:49.340 --> 02:30:53.040
this N8n process is not just about agent right

02:30:56.140 --> 02:30:58.360
error can happen anywhere my final output error can happen

02:30:59.480 --> 02:31:03.960
ok so I have to evaluate all of these nodes just like a code

02:31:03.960 --> 02:31:07.060
just like we write code production grade code so it has many

02:31:07.060 --> 02:31:10.420
classes many packages models and functions so when we write

02:31:10.420 --> 02:31:14.860
test case we write test case for all of us ok exactly same

02:31:14.860 --> 02:31:16.340
manner

02:31:26.160 --> 02:31:31.200
if it goes beyond my checks it should send me trigger or

02:31:31.200 --> 02:31:33.780
maybe some sort of a message should give it to me you can

02:31:33.780 --> 02:31:39.680
configure everything in evaluation ok this absolutely makes

02:31:39.680 --> 02:31:47.200
sense sir one last thing this is this is a project in which

02:31:47.200 --> 02:31:53.620
I am able to apply in linkedin on its own and this will run

02:31:53.620 --> 02:31:58.880
automatically and it will it will apply for all the jobs

02:31:58.880 --> 02:32:04.100
auto apply jobs only auto apply jobs yes but it is keeping a

02:32:04.100 --> 02:32:07.780
track of everything in google sheet ok and it is accessing

02:32:07.780 --> 02:32:11.400
my question to you here is I am unable to configure the

02:32:11.400 --> 02:32:13.920
memory here of course this is something which I would need

02:32:13.920 --> 02:32:18.520
to learn but is there any sir you can do default memory

02:32:18.520 --> 02:32:22.760
click on plus default memory is given by window ok

02:32:26.140 --> 02:32:28.980
I will give you an id for that ok so what you are saying is

02:32:28.980 --> 02:32:32.160
here there is a default memory no no not there below in plus

02:32:32.160 --> 02:32:39.380
yes click on memory there yes here in sample memory there is

02:32:39.380 --> 02:32:44.740
one option what it does is it is basically your in memory db

02:32:44.740 --> 02:32:47.700
means you are using sqlite whatever it is using in backend

02:32:47.700 --> 02:32:50.860
databases so what it will do is your last couple of messages

02:32:50.860 --> 02:32:53.580
last n message so there you will get an option of 5 messages

02:32:53.580 --> 02:32:56.720
by default do 50 there so what it will do is 50 last

02:32:56.720 --> 02:33:01.220
conversations means window basically it remembers ok that if

02:33:01.220 --> 02:33:03.980
you ask something related to that so it will be able to

02:33:03.980 --> 02:33:06.640
agent will be able to understand and then reply for example

02:33:06.640 --> 02:33:12.460
that your name is pk then if someone asks like whose resume

02:33:12.460 --> 02:33:17.040
was this so it will say like it was a pk's resume ok what

02:33:17.040 --> 02:33:20.380
was something which was mentioned so this is a first stage

02:33:20.380 --> 02:33:23.120
of memory that you will be able to add in second production

02:33:23.120 --> 02:33:25.780
grade we will say here redis chat memory which you can see

02:33:25.780 --> 02:33:30.040
in last last second last redis so this is basically server

02:33:30.040 --> 02:33:33.260
side now here you can do as many catches as you want so you

02:33:33.260 --> 02:33:35.540
have to configure this means you can take redis anywhere in

02:33:35.540 --> 02:33:40.560
adres azure jcp this is a simple node so configure it now

02:33:40.560 --> 02:33:43.500
your data is stored there and you can configure redis

02:33:43.500 --> 02:33:48.020
separately how much memory you have to store ok of which

02:33:48.020 --> 02:33:52.400
type so basically it has to store raw memory it has to store

02:33:52.400 --> 02:33:57.080
summary only ok it has to store entity only means name of

02:33:57.080 --> 02:34:00.840
the person name of the place which we call kv catch so redis

02:34:00.840 --> 02:34:03.300
is technically for a catch and redis is one of the best for

02:34:03.300 --> 02:34:05.940
a catch that we use in a production system like on a server

02:34:05.940 --> 02:34:08.680
side so what will happen is that if there is something on

02:34:08.680 --> 02:34:13.660
the server side so basically multiple users will be able to

02:34:13.660 --> 02:34:15.660
access i can configure it that multiple users you are not

02:34:15.660 --> 02:34:18.540
using this system let's suppose multiple users are hitting

02:34:18.540 --> 02:34:24.460
it right now it has already some catches so what it will do

02:34:24.460 --> 02:34:27.980
it will be able to serve all the users technically not just

02:34:27.980 --> 02:34:31.460
you in case of sample memory so maybe it will serve only you

02:34:32.200 --> 02:34:34.720
but if we keep it on the server side because this is a

02:34:34.720 --> 02:34:39.400
client side so it will be able to serve only you but in case

02:34:39.400 --> 02:34:43.080
of server side now it can broadcast the same memory to all

02:34:43.080 --> 02:34:46.720
the users all of my users that i have in my ecosystem so

02:34:46.720 --> 02:34:50.080
this is how we configure memory the purpose is to make the

02:34:50.080 --> 02:34:54.100
system fast instead of generating a similar kind of a

02:34:54.100 --> 02:34:57.180
response again and again i can send back a reply to my user

02:34:57.180 --> 02:35:00.580
so that i will be able to save time plus cost both

02:35:03.320 --> 02:35:07.040
so for now you just click on sample memory you add the

02:35:07.040 --> 02:35:09.660
sample memory and tell it that you want to store 10 it will

02:35:09.660 --> 02:35:15.460
do that and it automatically took the session id yes it took

02:35:15.460 --> 02:35:19.060
the session id so you type 10 or 50 basically it is an in

02:35:19.060 --> 02:35:25.160
-memory for database by default n8n is using postgres i

02:35:25.160 --> 02:35:30.180
believe but yes it does have memory in this sample memory

02:35:31.620 --> 02:35:36.340
sir n8n is very tempting when i worked on this project i did

02:35:36.340 --> 02:35:40.440
not know n8n without knowing i was able to do this with copy

02:35:40.440 --> 02:35:43.980
paste actually it is one of the best i would say better than

02:35:43.980 --> 02:35:47.140
langchain, langgraph, lama, indexes because tell me one

02:35:47.140 --> 02:35:52.900
thing that you can do it by writing a code here exactly in

02:35:52.900 --> 02:35:56.860
n8n if you are writing a code then debugging it trying to

02:35:56.860 --> 02:36:00.340
understand the code even to create a simple agent here i can

02:36:00.340 --> 02:36:05.440
do it in minutes the only problem here is if i would get

02:36:05.440 --> 02:36:08.320
access to the code the issues which i am facing i could

02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:11.120
solve it from the backend i can add my own milliseconds of

02:36:11.120 --> 02:36:14.420
wait without getting but they have given you enough

02:36:14.420 --> 02:36:16.820
configuration they have given you provisioning for a code

02:36:16.820 --> 02:36:22.080
see the only thing that n8n philosophy is very simple so

02:36:22.080 --> 02:36:25.420
consider every node as a function give a input see the

02:36:25.420 --> 02:36:28.460
output and i think that is the only thing which is required

02:36:28.460 --> 02:36:32.840
inside that what is going on i don't need that part i just

02:36:32.840 --> 02:36:35.480
need a so if i am able to see the input and if i am able to

02:36:35.480 --> 02:36:39.560
see the output now if output is not as per me fine not an

02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:43.020
issue i have an option i have a code option given inside the

02:36:43.020 --> 02:36:46.900
n8n i can modify it the issue here is as a developer i am

02:36:46.900 --> 02:36:50.200
not convinced that i am able to do the drag drop and it

02:36:50.200 --> 02:36:53.760
should work for me in future many of us are not convinced

02:36:53.760 --> 02:36:59.160
but believe me in 2017-18 we were using informatica and

02:36:59.160 --> 02:37:03.840
talent for big data so in one project in one very big

02:37:03.840 --> 02:37:06.860
project when i was working we have written the entire system

02:37:06.860 --> 02:37:09.680
from the scratch for the very big client then after

02:37:09.680 --> 02:37:13.860
finishing that project we have been assigned in a project

02:37:13.860 --> 02:37:17.720
where we were not writing a line of code so someone has

02:37:17.720 --> 02:37:20.620
because that client was a medical client a big one

02:37:20.620 --> 02:37:23.860
international one and they were using informatica there was

02:37:23.860 --> 02:37:26.880
another client who was using talent again informatica talent

02:37:26.880 --> 02:37:30.900
means you can drag and drop and configure the entire big

02:37:30.900 --> 02:37:34.940
data pipeline but yeah as a developer it was not acceptable

02:37:34.940 --> 02:37:42.200
to me at all and like i felt not little bit awkward we had a

02:37:42.200 --> 02:37:46.000
lot of again among the entire team members who have joined

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.800
from my previous project that okay what we are doing we are

02:37:48.800 --> 02:37:51.220
not even working as a developer because somewhere we feel

02:37:51.220 --> 02:37:54.520
proud that okay i am writing a code i am debugging it i am

02:37:54.520 --> 02:38:01.360
not sleeping till 4 o clock but somewhere i think down the

02:38:01.360 --> 02:38:05.260
line i have realized that it's not about how good you are at

02:38:05.260 --> 02:38:08.440
writing code because this is not the actual value that you

02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:15.360
will create actually no solving the actual problem like if

02:38:15.360 --> 02:38:17.800
you are taking like a one month of time to write a code and

02:38:17.800 --> 02:38:20.040
to build a system and same thing can be done in one day

02:38:20.080 --> 02:38:23.460
right so as a developer obviously you are trying to satisfy

02:38:23.460 --> 02:38:26.440
your ego because we all developer have that kind of exactly

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.540
yeah we all developer has that because i am coming from the

02:38:29.540 --> 02:38:33.060
same background even i had the similar kind of ego as a

02:38:33.060 --> 02:38:37.820
developer ego but again if you are taking one month of time

02:38:37.820 --> 02:38:41.460
versus one day unnecessarily you are burning company's money

02:38:42.080 --> 02:38:45.660
right this is a crew ai is like a game changer on that day

02:38:45.660 --> 02:38:50.600
the crew ai demo just by prompt i was shocked like a month

02:38:50.600 --> 02:38:53.720
for companies to build such thing just wait for six month

02:38:53.720 --> 02:38:56.760
just look at the crew ai maybe any time we come up with the

02:38:56.760 --> 02:38:59.800
same kind of a solution because as of now it's a competition

02:38:59.800 --> 02:39:03.220
yeah so in it a node system is actually very good and

02:39:03.220 --> 02:39:05.780
actually very mature and stable one and many people have

02:39:05.780 --> 02:39:08.040
already used it and many clients have already adopted it

02:39:08.040 --> 02:39:11.120
crew ai is evolving obviously it's a big organization once

02:39:11.120 --> 02:39:15.140
again well funded one but just wait for six month and then

02:39:15.140 --> 02:39:20.220
check autogen crew ai as well as n8n and couple of more it's

02:39:20.220 --> 02:39:22.820
going on from this stage they will make robots sit in the

02:39:22.820 --> 02:39:25.120
company they will say they will do the development work this

02:39:25.120 --> 02:39:29.740
much automation can be done because the level of AI that is

02:39:29.740 --> 02:39:33.760
going on right now is possible fully robotic is not possible

02:39:33.760 --> 02:39:37.000
i think in the next 10 years also because you need someone

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:40.740
to understand the process because process is also evolving

02:39:40.740 --> 02:39:46.200
process is not like same as we seen last 10 years so but yes

02:39:46.200 --> 02:39:50.440
this platform will evolve just in six month of time this is

02:39:50.440 --> 02:39:54.380
what i am feeling just uploading a json file available in in

02:39:54.380 --> 02:39:58.140
github you are able to create such agents this is not

02:39:58.140 --> 02:40:01.680
something built from scratch it's a copy paste one but still

02:40:01.680 --> 02:40:07.260
as far as we make it work yeah yeah sir one last question is

02:40:07.260 --> 02:40:10.560
there any ml interview bootcamp available i mean any ml

02:40:10.560 --> 02:40:17.400
interview i had a dsa sorry data science interview bootcamp

02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:22.180
i think i have taken that i have seen that but that's not ml

02:40:22.180 --> 02:40:26.920
interview bootcamp right is it different no basically it's a

02:40:26.920 --> 02:40:29.300
data science means statistics is discussed machine learning

02:40:29.300 --> 02:40:31.240
is discussed deep learning is discussed computer vision and

02:40:31.240 --> 02:40:37.680
health is discussed ok read it ml bootcamp we will see if we

02:40:37.680 --> 02:40:41.840
can bring it otherwise there are many questions set in it

02:40:41.840 --> 02:40:45.680
everything is uploaded in it so i think if you want to start

02:40:45.680 --> 02:40:47.400
it immediately you can start it immediately

02:40:50.080 --> 02:40:55.380
i saw a job post it says agentic ai architect what would be

02:40:55.380 --> 02:41:00.620
that person doing i am little confused ok ok ok agentic ai

02:41:00.620 --> 02:41:08.840
architect so let's see let me show you something ok so

02:41:16.940 --> 02:41:23.100
let me share my screen please speak in english ok ok you got

02:41:23.100 --> 02:41:27.040
the question right ok so basically his question was like a

02:41:27.220 --> 02:41:30.420
someone has asked him he has seen somewhere like a you know

02:41:30.420 --> 02:41:35.080
job post and over there so people are asking about agentic

02:41:35.080 --> 02:41:37.560
ai architect so i will try to explain you with one example

02:41:37.560 --> 02:41:41.280
so yesterday i was like doing one research right again with

02:41:41.280 --> 02:41:44.200
the help of chat GPT everyone uses that so basically what i

02:41:44.200 --> 02:41:48.340
was trying to do so basically i am trying to automate the

02:41:48.340 --> 02:41:52.160
entire CEO's work CEO's or you can say founder's work and

02:41:52.160 --> 02:41:54.640
not just on a professional level but on a personal level

02:41:54.640 --> 02:41:57.760
right so this is a task which someone has given to me that

02:41:57.760 --> 02:42:01.660
ok automate all the founder's work CEO's work in general

02:42:01.660 --> 02:42:04.920
right in general so that you know if i am going to automate

02:42:04.920 --> 02:42:08.360
so i can make it configurable with respect to others so now

02:42:08.360 --> 02:42:12.240
what CEO does so as an architect what i will do so what CEO

02:42:12.240 --> 02:42:15.600
does in a morning so basically in a morning every CEO's or

02:42:15.600 --> 02:42:18.260
everyone try to wake up again i am not just talking about

02:42:18.260 --> 02:42:21.920
CEO's any CXO's any like a senior management we always try

02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:24.960
to check an email we try to like check a notification so lot

02:42:24.960 --> 02:42:28.460
of emails lot of notifications again in a morning itself so

02:42:28.460 --> 02:42:31.780
you know we feel pissed off that ok what is going on there

02:42:31.780 --> 02:42:34.700
are so many emails emails from like a client customer some

02:42:34.700 --> 02:42:38.980
escalation right even for me yesterday you might have seen

02:42:38.980 --> 02:42:42.180
night itself there was some escalation which was going on in

02:42:42.180 --> 02:42:47.120
lot of groups right so we see lot of messages right and

02:42:47.120 --> 02:42:51.180
obviously we feel like sometime very happy sometime we feel

02:42:51.180 --> 02:42:54.480
depressed sometime we feel overwhelmed lot of mixed feeling

02:42:54.480 --> 02:42:57.060
right and again that disturbs us a lot in terms of you know

02:42:57.640 --> 02:43:04.180
executing our actual task yeah right so here like first of

02:43:04.180 --> 02:43:06.280
all as an architect what i will do i will try to understand

02:43:06.280 --> 02:43:09.140
the problem that ok so we have to check hundreds of emails

02:43:09.140 --> 02:43:12.340
then obviously as a CEO i have to check what my competitors

02:43:12.340 --> 02:43:16.560
are doing like what is there in a market as a like a news

02:43:16.560 --> 02:43:20.780
for me investors connect obviously i will be having so many

02:43:20.780 --> 02:43:25.940
teams at least my L-1 means like just team who is reporting

02:43:25.940 --> 02:43:29.640
me all the CXO's level and everything right so i have to

02:43:29.640 --> 02:43:32.500
automate that particular part my data set can be like a data

02:43:32.500 --> 02:43:36.140
source can be n number of data sources and like may be from

02:43:36.140 --> 02:43:39.140
google search may be from hundreds of emails may be from a

02:43:39.140 --> 02:43:43.460
Jira Kanban board may be from some of the presentation so i

02:43:43.460 --> 02:43:46.380
have to pull all the reports so that in a morning i will

02:43:46.380 --> 02:43:49.740
wake up at 9 o'clock so it will be scheduled that ok fine so

02:43:49.740 --> 02:43:52.760
like i will be able to get a summary of all the mails

02:43:52.760 --> 02:43:55.380
newsletter investor update tech summary all those things so

02:43:55.380 --> 02:43:57.900
team will do their work but yeah as a CEO i don't have to

02:43:57.900 --> 02:44:00.420
look personally into those things on a daily basis then

02:44:00.420 --> 02:44:02.440
calendars and meeting so system should organize

02:44:02.440 --> 02:44:04.960
automatically all the calendars meetings whatever conflicts

02:44:04.960 --> 02:44:08.840
are there it should resolve it wherever i can send my L-1 or

02:44:08.840 --> 02:44:12.940
L-2 i can send L-1 L-2 in that meeting right so system

02:44:12.940 --> 02:44:14.900
should decide automatically i should not take the decision

02:44:14.900 --> 02:44:17.540
that ok go and take you take this meeting i am not going to

02:44:17.540 --> 02:44:19.980
join this meeting so system should be able to smart enough

02:44:19.980 --> 02:44:24.200
to understand and define all those things plus CEOs you must

02:44:24.200 --> 02:44:26.820
have seen that many young CEOs and founders are like you

02:44:26.820 --> 02:44:30.980
know like a they are not able to leave peacefully for a very

02:44:30.980 --> 02:44:33.400
very long time because of depression frustration and many

02:44:33.400 --> 02:44:35.840
more things which is real actually which is real when you

02:44:35.840 --> 02:44:39.120
will like get into that kind of a situation you will feel

02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:43.660
that which is real so again i have to maintain the routine

02:44:43.660 --> 02:44:46.560
so system should advise and everything should happen through

02:44:46.560 --> 02:44:49.760
only one single interface may be whatsapp may be telegram or

02:44:49.760 --> 02:44:54.020
may be a custom simple app that nothing he has to us he has

02:44:54.020 --> 02:44:56.320
to touch again and again he don't have to open up a mobile

02:44:56.320 --> 02:45:00.400
or something no just one single unified one and everything

02:45:00.400 --> 02:45:03.060
should be taken care of so fitness and hobbies so it should

02:45:03.060 --> 02:45:05.560
like a so case that ok if you are not walking if you are not

02:45:05.560 --> 02:45:08.600
you should do a exercise for 15-20 minutes it should give a

02:45:08.600 --> 02:45:11.240
reminder proper reminder everything so for that we are using

02:45:11.240 --> 02:45:12.880
a different different app i am not saying that these things

02:45:12.880 --> 02:45:15.840
are not there but yeah it's a scattered one then news and

02:45:15.840 --> 02:45:19.340
market briefing so basically like as per the interest of

02:45:19.340 --> 02:45:22.580
this CEO or founder so it should go do all the investigation

02:45:22.580 --> 02:45:26.420
new release technologies everything right so here

02:45:26.420 --> 02:45:29.220
professional professionally if i am going to focus so

02:45:29.220 --> 02:45:32.180
basically like you know KPI overview from sales finance

02:45:32.180 --> 02:45:37.800
operations HR so this is a requirement a long long as you

02:45:37.800 --> 02:45:40.120
can see a requirement a very lengthy requirement right a

02:45:40.120 --> 02:45:44.120
very lengthy requirement now i have to architect this entire

02:45:44.120 --> 02:45:46.880
system now to architect this entire system so obviously

02:45:46.880 --> 02:45:50.000
first of all i have to finalize the framework right in a

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.180
agentic way because system should be able to take a decision

02:45:53.280 --> 02:45:58.060
my founder or my CEO should get a minimalistic right a

02:45:58.060 --> 02:46:01.660
minimalistic ping and in that minimalistic ping i should

02:46:01.660 --> 02:46:05.160
solve all of his problem so that he can focus on core

02:46:05.160 --> 02:46:08.880
business meeting only right and wherever is required

02:46:08.880 --> 02:46:12.740
otherwise he should sit ideal he should not like just for

02:46:12.740 --> 02:46:17.080
the sake of you know like like showcasing that he is busy or

02:46:17.080 --> 02:46:20.320
he is busy he should not work because CEOs or founders

02:46:20.320 --> 02:46:23.060
should be one should be actually right which is not a

02:46:23.060 --> 02:46:26.440
reality for the initial founders but yeah they should be the

02:46:26.440 --> 02:46:30.040
like most available person or the time should be available

02:46:30.040 --> 02:46:32.520
so that they can think right they can think because this is

02:46:32.520 --> 02:46:34.860
what they should do actually right instead of doing the

02:46:34.860 --> 02:46:37.860
actual work so they should think more so that you know they

02:46:37.860 --> 02:46:40.080
can give a direction to the team they can build a better

02:46:40.080 --> 02:46:43.900
team and team will be able to like take things on a scale so

02:46:43.900 --> 02:46:46.860
now if i have to architect this entire thing so i have to

02:46:46.860 --> 02:46:50.320
connect with infinite not infinite i would say but yeah

02:46:50.320 --> 02:46:53.600
hundreds of tools hundreds of you know newsletters outside

02:46:53.600 --> 02:46:57.480
hundreds of investor it should take a pissed website plus i

02:46:57.480 --> 02:47:00.200
have to connect with my hr system sales system crm system

02:47:00.200 --> 02:47:04.000
finance system basically right so that i should not get

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:07.360
surprised from any of the team plus maybe like a you know

02:47:07.360 --> 02:47:10.740
marketing team and then like a conversion of the lead

02:47:10.740 --> 02:47:13.620
generation many more things right many more things sales

02:47:13.620 --> 02:47:16.780
number cash flow head counts project progress if there is

02:47:16.780 --> 02:47:19.640
some tech project which is going on deliverables right all

02:47:19.640 --> 02:47:23.080
of these things all the scrum update in one single place so

02:47:23.080 --> 02:47:27.040
that i will just spend my 10 minute of time maybe in more

02:47:27.220 --> 02:47:30.700
morning 10 o'clock night maybe in afternoon or maybe one

02:47:30.700 --> 02:47:34.580
update in a evening yeah so i'll just spend my 10 minute in

02:47:34.580 --> 02:47:37.300
morning 10 minute in evening maybe 10 minute in afternoon if

02:47:37.300 --> 02:47:42.040
required right so in 30 minute i have a complete clarity

02:47:42.040 --> 02:47:45.640
about my entire company in detail because 10 minute of read

02:47:45.640 --> 02:47:48.320
is too much right in 10 minute you will be able to read

02:47:48.320 --> 02:47:52.920
maybe like a like a 10 000 20 000 words by the way so that

02:47:52.920 --> 02:47:55.740
that much of information you can digest as a human being in

02:47:55.740 --> 02:47:59.820
10 minutes so and then the rest of the time so my ceo can do

02:47:59.820 --> 02:48:02.560
like a go and do their like a work if some meeting is

02:48:02.560 --> 02:48:04.700
scheduled so obviously they can join the meeting important

02:48:04.700 --> 02:48:07.300
one if it is not an important one make me hand over to the

02:48:07.300 --> 02:48:09.840
cxos or maybe to some someone else system should decide

02:48:09.840 --> 02:48:13.320
automatically it should not even like a ask most of the time

02:48:13.320 --> 02:48:18.860
so i have to use a genetic process and whoever is going to

02:48:18.860 --> 02:48:23.060
design it they will be a agent architect hope i am able to

02:48:23.060 --> 02:48:26.460
give an answer what will be the job of a genetic architect

02:48:26.460 --> 02:48:29.700
so this is one of the tasks this is one of the tasks right i

02:48:29.700 --> 02:48:33.760
am talking about likewise i can define another thousands of

02:48:33.760 --> 02:48:35.120
tasks no

02:48:41.100 --> 02:48:45.100
this is the design yeah so this is the design now architect

02:48:45.100 --> 02:48:48.680
what they do so architect generally try to basically like a

02:48:48.680 --> 02:48:51.920
select a tech stack right and then connect all of those take

02:48:51.920 --> 02:48:54.580
a stack and create a flow technically this is what architect

02:48:54.580 --> 02:48:58.220
is going to do right so like i said so starting from a

02:48:58.220 --> 02:49:02.280
selection of the framework then tool that they are using so

02:49:02.280 --> 02:49:04.720
their tech team must be using some jira some board or

02:49:04.720 --> 02:49:07.640
something to you know do a scrum or maybe summary of the

02:49:07.640 --> 02:49:10.620
meeting every because everyone must be doing using some sort

02:49:10.620 --> 02:49:12.900
of a tools right and everything will be team will be using a

02:49:12.900 --> 02:49:15.440
different one so maybe my marketing team is using some

02:49:15.440 --> 02:49:17.980
marketing funnel my sales team is using maybe some sort of a

02:49:17.980 --> 02:49:21.940
crm my hrt must be using some sort of a hrm system my

02:49:21.940 --> 02:49:24.340
finance team must be using some sort of a tally or maybe

02:49:24.340 --> 02:49:27.780
some other finance management tool yeah so the entire

02:49:27.780 --> 02:49:30.540
company is using a separate separate separate tool my

02:49:30.540 --> 02:49:33.940
information data everything is scattered and again so even

02:49:33.940 --> 02:49:36.540
if i am going to create a dashboard so it will just be a

02:49:36.540 --> 02:49:40.580
number right but i am looking for something in a summary not

02:49:40.580 --> 02:49:43.980
just in terms of numbers and this is where this entire like

02:49:43.980 --> 02:49:47.340
a things can be architected by selecting a proper tool

02:49:47.340 --> 02:49:49.440
proper framework this is what architect will do

02:49:53.420 --> 02:49:57.040
so in here are you saying that we would need to connect

02:49:57.580 --> 02:50:01.200
separate separate agents with all this legacy systems and

02:50:01.200 --> 02:50:04.820
they all should be available as a restful api to directly

02:50:05.400 --> 02:50:09.860
accessed or fetched by an agent yes yeah so that should be

02:50:09.860 --> 02:50:12.240
available with authentication means everyone should not be

02:50:12.240 --> 02:50:15.960
able to access it by the way then almost all the tools are

02:50:15.960 --> 02:50:18.880
giving you if not they are giving you maybe like i think

02:50:18.880 --> 02:50:22.560
everyone everyone gives you that api access all the crm hrm

02:50:22.560 --> 02:50:25.540
fico tool that you are going to use from anyone so yeah

02:50:25.540 --> 02:50:29.300
nowadays everyone like comes with the api integration or api

02:50:29.300 --> 02:50:32.620
even with what technical stack you are going to use even

02:50:32.620 --> 02:50:36.200
that will be decided by an architect exactly exactly this is

02:50:36.200 --> 02:50:39.740
what architect does the their primary job is to design the

02:50:39.740 --> 02:50:41.840
system their primary job is to first of all understand the

02:50:41.840 --> 02:50:46.620
entire flow right break it down try to create a hld lld out

02:50:46.620 --> 02:50:49.240
of this one right or you can say a prd project requirement

02:50:49.240 --> 02:50:52.020
document now project let's suppose i am a ceo i have given

02:50:52.020 --> 02:50:54.580
this this thing right he will try to understand this problem

02:50:54.580 --> 02:50:58.380
more and more he will try to identify the edge cases that i

02:50:58.380 --> 02:51:00.800
am going to face or he is going to face or his team is going

02:51:00.800 --> 02:51:02.740
to face during building these things or i am going to face

02:51:02.740 --> 02:51:06.560
after like uh things will be in production right he is or

02:51:06.560 --> 02:51:09.640
she is going to set up the entire team he and c is going to

02:51:09.640 --> 02:51:11.840
design the entire framework that okay this this this

02:51:11.840 --> 02:51:16.120
framework he and c is going to you know uh like uh create a

02:51:16.120 --> 02:51:18.520
list of all the tools and technique and technology which has

02:51:18.520 --> 02:51:21.180
been used by different different system and teams and if

02:51:21.180 --> 02:51:24.220
there is a hurdle in terms of connection approvals because

02:51:24.220 --> 02:51:26.560
if i am talking about a big organization then obviously

02:51:26.560 --> 02:51:29.800
there will be a series of the approvals right so all of

02:51:29.800 --> 02:51:33.120
these hurdles and things will be handled by the architect

02:51:33.120 --> 02:51:35.480
single-handedly so think about the organization with the

02:51:36.380 --> 02:51:40.200
thirty thousand forty thousand people right in that case

02:51:40.200 --> 02:51:43.100
this process itself is going to be very very big and this is

02:51:43.100 --> 02:51:45.600
where like your architect will come into picture they will

02:51:45.600 --> 02:51:47.120
design and solve the problem

02:51:51.050 --> 02:51:55.950
what would be the timeline for this one see if i'm talking

02:51:55.950 --> 02:51:59.810
about maybe uh like a company with thirty forty thousand and

02:51:59.810 --> 02:52:03.950
company is in a b2b uh and let's suppose i'm assuming that

02:52:03.950 --> 02:52:05.750
they have like a hundred thousand people a hundred client uh

02:52:05.750 --> 02:52:10.730
a big one right so in that case maybe a timeline could

02:52:10.730 --> 02:52:13.750
extend till a three month to four month for this project

02:52:15.310 --> 02:52:19.550
because example if it is nvidia in four months we can build

02:52:19.550 --> 02:52:23.210
this yeah in in four months we can build it and again even

02:52:23.210 --> 02:52:26.450
less than that we can do it uh but that depends upon the

02:52:26.450 --> 02:52:30.670
access of all the system because your hr team is like a

02:52:30.670 --> 02:52:34.130
different again you have like a multiple hr team there will

02:52:34.130 --> 02:52:37.790
be hr leader or hr head or director again same will go with

02:52:37.790 --> 02:52:41.910
the sales sales for a b2c b2b and different different mode

02:52:41.910 --> 02:52:45.530
of a sales again marketing if i'll say same thing right so

02:52:45.530 --> 02:52:49.710
depends how easily i will be able to accumulate all the data

02:52:49.710 --> 02:52:52.550
the only thing is that that i have to accumulate everything

02:52:52.550 --> 02:52:57.110
and bring it on a single place so and plus writing a prd

02:52:57.110 --> 02:53:00.870
itself will take time you have to sit with your ceo you have

02:53:00.870 --> 02:53:04.290
to understand uh his pain you have to like a leave his life

02:53:04.290 --> 02:53:06.950
for a period of maybe a week or for a month so that you will

02:53:06.950 --> 02:53:09.550
be able to understand what he actually does you will have to

02:53:09.550 --> 02:53:13.010
connect with his assistant or maybe a founder office right

02:53:13.010 --> 02:53:15.810
and then you have to understand the entire cycle then only

02:53:15.810 --> 02:53:19.090
you will be able to design the better solution because in

02:53:19.090 --> 02:53:23.410
this case your ceo is going to be your customer right so

02:53:23.410 --> 02:53:28.870
yeah three months anyone can do that in three months sorry

02:53:28.870 --> 02:53:32.070
timeline also is being given by an architect right a

02:53:32.070 --> 02:53:34.750
timeline they will give a temporary timeline in general but

02:53:34.750 --> 02:53:38.230
yes timeline will be given by architect so every project

02:53:38.230 --> 02:53:41.470
comes with a deadline right so that deadline will be uh must

02:53:41.470 --> 02:53:43.810
be created with the architect and architect obviously try to

02:53:43.810 --> 02:53:47.170
consult with the team because he's not he's not going to do

02:53:47.170 --> 02:53:49.650
all the job right there will be a team there will be a lead

02:53:50.070 --> 02:53:53.150
inside like a architect so they are going to like you know

02:53:53.150 --> 02:53:55.750
take up the job inside the lead there will be again a tech

02:53:55.750 --> 02:53:59.930
team so as a team we used to discuss and then give a

02:53:59.930 --> 02:54:05.150
timeline so thank you so much for this valuable input yeah

02:54:05.150 --> 02:54:09.830
yeah okay so fine guys with that uh thank you so much yeah

02:54:09.830 --> 02:54:14.090
yeah sir i have a question yeah go ahead i am assuming uh

02:54:14.090 --> 02:54:18.350
this for this january role uh coding expertise not much

02:54:18.350 --> 02:54:22.870
required uh i am assuming please correct me if i am wrong oh

02:54:22.870 --> 02:54:26.890
see that depends like uh you are going to give a you know

02:54:27.510 --> 02:54:30.710
interview for which company and what they have mentioned

02:54:30.710 --> 02:54:33.790
inside the jd if they have mentioned that lang chain lang

02:54:33.790 --> 02:54:38.310
graph kind of a framework right even though i know i can do

02:54:38.310 --> 02:54:41.670
it with the help of n8n i know that maybe in lang chain i

02:54:41.670 --> 02:54:45.610
will take a whole day but with n8n kind of a system i can do

02:54:45.610 --> 02:54:50.210
it in one hour right yes but still coding will be required

02:54:50.210 --> 02:54:52.530
because lang chain lang graph all those things you can't do

02:54:52.530 --> 02:54:55.930
it without coding right so it simply means that coding is

02:54:55.930 --> 02:54:59.010
required so it like i said so it depends upon the company so

02:54:59.010 --> 02:55:01.970
look into the jd if inside a jd they have mentioned such

02:55:01.970 --> 02:55:05.630
kind of a framework which needs coding then you have to have

02:55:05.630 --> 02:55:09.230
like a knowledge about the coding otherwise no it's good

02:55:09.230 --> 02:55:14.430
yeah thank you sir yeah thanks okay so fine guys with that

02:55:14.430 --> 02:55:16.570
thank you so much hope you have liked this session so next

02:55:16.570 --> 02:55:21.750
saturday uh let's have a session on autogen i will go ahead

02:55:21.750 --> 02:55:24.650
with the coding approach in case of autogen it's i'll show

02:55:24.650 --> 02:55:26.890
you ui approach as well but yeah i'll go ahead with the

02:55:26.890 --> 02:55:29.590
coding approach both i'll try to show you so that we can

02:55:29.590 --> 02:55:31.750
build something with respect to autogen encoding and then i

02:55:31.750 --> 02:55:37.290
think we have a next chapter where we have to fine tune the

02:55:37.290 --> 02:55:39.730
model so we have like a different different kind of a fine

02:55:39.730 --> 02:55:43.710
tuning approach like a full fine tuning and dpos and rh rlhf

02:55:43.710 --> 02:55:48.090
and i believe there was a prefect yeah laura and quara so

02:55:48.090 --> 02:55:50.450
these kind of a fine tuning which has been given so we'll

02:55:50.450 --> 02:55:56.990
