WEBVTT

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.190
Okay, so I believe guys I'm audible and visible to all of

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.610
you. Good morning, everyone. Yeah. So in some time, maybe

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.710
next two, three minutes. So we are going to start with the

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.970
class.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.680
Okay, fine guys. So I believe everyone has joined. So let's

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.000
start with the class. So yesterday I was talking about basic

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.920
of embedding, by the way, like what technically the

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.620
embedding is and how we'll be able to perform those

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.740
embeddings with the help of maybe OpenAI model, which is

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.760
available inside URI or otherwise we can try to use any

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.460
other model from HuggingFace and then we can try to convert

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.920
those data into an embedding vector. Now, so in today's

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.140
class, I'll be talking about a practical implementation that

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.220
how we will be able to do this embeddings in a practical

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.220
manner by using some of these databases. For example,

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.960
Facebook AI similarity search or you can say we can try to

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.940
use even a Chroma DB. We can try to use. Quadrant, Pinecone

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.720
and many other vector DBs, which is already available into a

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.180
market, which is going to make your life easy. Plus it has

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.560
been used for a different, different kind of purposes. Now,

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.160
so those who have missed yesterday's class, so just advice.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.380
So please try to like go through this yesterday's class. I

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.160
have already like uploaded a videos inside your dashboard

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.140
and a material. I have not given like any kind of assignment

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.720
in my today's class, but yeah, so please try to go through a

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.380
video. I think that is going to help you out a lot. So shall

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:52.270
we start guys? Yes, everyone. Yeah, with the practical. So a

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.870
very first data database that we are going to consider is a

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.950
Facebook AI similarity search. Yes. Emerging class

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:05.010
recording. Yeah. So obviously we had discussed a concept, so

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:09.330
you will love it. Okay. So I believe my screen is visible to

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.150
all of you and let's get started. So the very first database

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.630
that we are going to use it over here is a Facebook AI

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:19.770
similarity search. So open up your VS code guys, everyone,

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.670
VS code, Google collab, whatever you want, just try to open

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:28.450
it, open it up and inside a VS code. So just try to create a

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.890
folder. Let's suppose I'm creating it like a vector DB

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:40.090
inside D drive. So I'm going to create vector DB gen AI.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:46.410
Okay. So let me close everything. Fine. Okay. So let's just

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:52.740
create one simple folder and inside this folder, so maybe we

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:57.800
can try to create a Jupiter notebook. So here, F A I S S dot

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:02.680
I P Y N B. So Facebook AI similarity search, this is the

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.060
database which we are going to discuss in a very first

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:09.240
place. And I have just created a file for that one so that I

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.900
can write a code and then I can try to do the

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.860
experimentation. So everyone, please do it. And as I will

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.320
progress, as I will start writing a code. So I'll keep on

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.520
sharing those code with all of you so that you all will be

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.480
able to execute it.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.460
Yeah. So let me start guys.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:57.850
Please use quadrant as well in a later phase. Yeah. So my

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.710
intention is to discuss all of these databases. So not just

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:05.810
like a F A I S S, but Facebook AI similarity search,

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.250
obviously, then Chroma DB, then Pinecone, then Bayview and

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.610
then quadrant, all of these. Fine.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.620
Neo 4J, no. So whatever I have made, I have made it. So what

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.840
I have mentioned inside this syllabus, so I will be talking

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.980
about that. Apart from that, I won't be talking about any

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.980
other databases. Reason is very simple. There are hundreds

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:36.440
of databases out there. And if I'll talk about our vector

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.440
DB, so almost everyone, even a Mongo DB, right? So Mongo DB

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.200
was a document based database. It was a no sequel based

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.580
databases. But in their recent release, so they have started

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:55.020
providing even that, yeah, so even now Mongo DB supports our

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:58.560
vector databases concept and concept is like almost similar,

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:02.600
fine. So first of all, guys, we are going to talk about a F

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.560
A I S S. So Facebook AI similarity search. So that is

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.820
basically a database name. So in a short form, in

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:13.240
abbreviated form. So we try to call it as a F A I S S now.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:17.380
So F A I S S is basically a open source database. So

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.920
Facebook has created it and they have made it open source so

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.200
that you all will be able to use it. You can use it by just

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.760
doing some sort of a installation, right? By just doing an

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.420
installation and there is no restriction they are going to

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:33.880
put over here. You can host it on your platform or on your

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.720
server or anywhere that you want. And this is one of the

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.020
amazing open source database that you all will be able to

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.340
get. And very soon you are going to experience it. Very soon

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.740
you are going to see the same thing. Yeah. Shall we start

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:52.430
guys with Facebook AI similarity search? Yeah. Okay. So

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:57.650
let's get started. I'm going to keep a message only to host

00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:01.770
and panelists so that whenever I'm going to send a code, so

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:07.550
you will be able to see it. Yeah. Now. So yes, almost all

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.070
the databases that we have listed, it comes under our vector

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:14.230
DB now. Fine. So in a very first place guys, what we have to

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:16.890
do, so we have to do some sort of an installation. Yeah. So

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.750
unless and until we are not doing an installation, so we'll

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.950
not be able to run through the entire code. So keeping that

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.710
in a mind, what do you have to do? So you have to go ahead

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:27.010
and you have to create the environment. Environment creation

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:31.270
is important because some of you must be having a Python 3

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:34.750
.13. Some of you must be having Python 3.12. Some of you

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:38.070
having maybe Python 3.10. So a different, different kind of

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.030
a version and a different, different version is going to

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:44.970
give you a problems and some of you will be able to execute

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:47.970
a code. Some of you will not be able to execute a code. So

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:51.890
keeping that in a mind. Let's try to create a environment,

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:56.390
one ideal environment. So where we are going to keep each

00:11:56.390 --> 00:12:01.430
and everything. Yeah. And we will try to like keep only one

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:05.970
version of the Python now. So it's better, right? It's

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:10.290
better to go ahead with environment creation with the conda

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:13.610
installation. So I know most of you have just a Python

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:16.970
installation in your system, but it's advisable to go ahead

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.530
with the conda installation. Okay. It's going to be very

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.390
much simple and you all will be able to do an installation

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:27.050
quickly. So let me share a link with all of you so that you

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:33.080
all will be able to do a conda installation. So here conda.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.780
So if you will go to Google, you will be able to see

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:41.340
anaconda download. So you will be able to download this

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.640
anaconda and going forward. So we are going to create an

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.380
environment so many times. So just keep it inside your

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:49.860
system. I think it will be better. Right. It will be better.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:54.420
So you can come over here. You can try to call conda

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.780
download or maybe a mini conda download. That's completely

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:02.140
fine. And then you can come over here on this particular

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.940
page and you can try to say just

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:12.410
a minute. I'm sending you a link so that all of you will be

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:13.250
able to download it.

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.100
So after doing a sign up, they are going to give you an

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:25.040
option. So distribution installer. So just go ahead with

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:29.040
this. So when for Windows for a Mac machine and for a Linux

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:33.120
machine. So here is a link guys. Let me copy and paste this

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:38.100
link. Yeah. So now I have sent you a link. Sorry, I think

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:43.240
it's available to everyone. Okay. So yeah, now link is

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:47.380
available to all of you guys. So I'll talk about it. So see,

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.720
we have to create a multiple environment. Now what is the

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.180
meaning of an environment by the way? So environments is

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:57.220
nothing but a kind of you can say a directory with a

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.220
specific installation. So for example. Okay. So let's say

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.800
I'm trying to do a two, three projects, right? So maybe I'm

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.340
trying to do project number one, maybe I'm going to do a

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.880
project number two and maybe I'm going to do a project

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.960
number three and all of these three projects are available

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:17.000
in my system. Yeah. In my system, same system. Yeah. I just

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.280
have only one machine. So all of these projects are

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.180
available in the same system. Now there is a possibility

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:26.760
that this project requires Python version 3.10 and its

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.240
dependencies, right? Because we will end up installing a lot

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:33.140
of libraries. Maybe this required 3.11 and this required

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:37.680
maybe 3.13 yeah. So all these three projects requires a

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:41.360
different, different Python installation. Now keeping that

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.720
in a mind. So we have to create a different, different

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.860
environment and that is practically possible. That is

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.140
practically possible. So what it will do, what system will

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.200
do basically is that, that it will try to create a separate

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.960
directory. See, whenever you try to say that pip install x,

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.340
y, g, what it does, so it will try to download the entire

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:05.340
code and it will always try to keep it inside a particular

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.800
environment. This is what pip install does. I don't know

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:12.540
whether you have, uh, like, uh, gone through it or not, but

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.400
let's suppose if I'm trying to say that pip install numpy or

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.920
pip install pandas or pip install matplotlib or pip install

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:22.540
tensorflow, it creates a complete directory about a

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.500
tensorflow or numpy or pandas. And then it will try to keep

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:29.080
all the code which someone else has written, uh, for you.

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:32.900
And this is how it will be able to give you a support with

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.720
respect to a pandas library with respect to a numpy library.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.380
So here, uh, when I, uh, when I go, when I'm going to do a

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:42.600
multiple different kind of project, so every project will be

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:46.360
having its own dependencies, right? And again, most of the

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.960
time you will get stuck with respect to our dependencies

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.700
conflict because some of these versions are going to work

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.780
with some other versions. Some of some other installation

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.460
and some may not, and a lot of time we feel this kind of

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:03.360
issue. So just to keep neat and clean, right? Just to keep

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.000
neat and clean in terms of doing a development, what we do

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.380
is that, that we keep on creating a multiple different,

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.020
different environments. So if I'm doing project number one,

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.360
I'll try to create one environment. If I'm doing a project

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.220
number two, I'm going to create another environment. If I'm

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.160
doing a project number three, I'll end up creating a

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:23.100
different environment and a respective volume installation

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.460
or the respective version. What's an installation, right? So

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:29.620
this is what I do. So here, uh, let's suppose we are trying

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:33.200
to experiment with a vector database today, right? So we

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.480
will try to create one environment now tomorrow. So I'll be

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.320
talking about, let's suppose a Lang chain, maybe day after

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.120
tomorrow, I'll be talking about a Lang graph, Lama indexes.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.760
So I'll keep on creating a different, different, different,

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.260
different, different, different kind of environment so that

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.120
I will be able to do an installation of those dependencies

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.840
with respect to the experiment that we are going to perform.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.900
So environment is important and again, so whatever project

00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:00.080
that you are going to do in future, even in a company,

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.700
right? So you will end up creating a separate environment

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:07.820
all along. So let's get started guys. Now to create an

00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:11.080
environment, you can create an environment by using just a

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:14.180
python code. So python m virtual environment and then

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:18.300
environment name, that's a command. But most of the time,

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:21.780
most of you are going to face an issue while setting up a

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:25.620
python version. Again, it's not an issue. So going forward,

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:28.660
you all will be able to understand that you just have to

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.400
handle a little bit, right? Handle a little bit of things.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:35.300
So you have to like a mention a python version, but with

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:39.740
respect to a conda, a command is again much simpler, right?

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:43.640
Much simpler, easy to maintain and easy to, you know, create

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.700
an environment. So that's the reason. So I'm asking you to

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.440
install a conda. Conda is nothing but it's another

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.960
distribution. So which is going to help you out in terms of

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.820
doing all the things. Python installation with respect to a

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:57.400
python libraries. There is another distribution you will be

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.960
able to find out nowadays called as UV installation or UV

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.860
distribution. So UV is again lightning fast, obviously

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:07.360
faster than conda, which I'm going to introduce in a later

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.820
stage in your class that how with the help of UV

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:13.160
distribution, you will be able to do a setup and UV is a

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.920
very good dependency resolver. So again, let's try to

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.520
understand dependencies and then in a later stage, we'll try

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:24.380
to understand a dependency resolver. Yeah. But yeah, as of

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:27.740
now, just try to install a conda and I think it is going to

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:31.200
work for all of us and you all will be able to create an

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:35.240
environment quickly. So if you are using a windows, not an

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.600
issue, click on download. If you're using Mac, click on

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.860
download and if you're using a Linux, click on download.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.460
It's a very easy kind of installation. You all will be able

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:46.040
to find out. Yes. Fine guys. So from a distribution

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:50.000
installer. So for windows, download this for Mac, download

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.720
this for Linux and download this one. Fine. I believe my

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.300
cursor is visible to all of you and I have already sent you

00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.640
a link. Let me send you this link once again. So after doing

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:04.380
a sign up, just click on this windows and then save it

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.660
somewhere and then click, click, click install. So once you

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:09.200
are able to download it, click, click, click install,

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:10.800
simple, fine guys.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.060
How to check if we have a conda install, just type conda

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:21.900
command. It will give you like a, some help or some hints.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.280
So if it is giving you a hints. It simply means that conda

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.460
is installed. If it is not giving you a hint, simply means

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:30.140
that conda is not installed or just check the version.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.060
Either way it's fine.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.760
Sir, I have a conda navigator. Then you have a conda

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:40.280
installed by the way. Anaconda navigator is just a UI layer

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.180
on top of the anaconda installation so that you know, you

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:46.620
can go through a different, different tools, which is a

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.920
prebuilt tool coming with your anaconda, but the

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.560
distribution name is actually anaconda.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.920
Yeah. Fine guys. So there are multiple ways. This is one of

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.820
the simplest. We, uh, which I'm talking about. Fine. Yeah.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:08.320
Now. So as we are able to do the, everyone of us are able to

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:13.780
do the installation guys. Yeah. Everyone, because in every,

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.340
uh, like a single day when we are going to write a code, we

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:23.890
will end up using it. Fine guys. Shall we move ahead? Yeah.

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:27.250
Okay. So Gopi is saying, okay, wait for a moment. It's still

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:30.030
downloading. Okay, fine. So I'll give you another two, three

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:33.530
minutes, uh, because I know for like some of you, it is

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:36.570
going to take some time. Maybe to download and maybe to

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:39.070
install depends upon the system configuration and internet

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:44.930
both. Yeah. So fine. Just wait for like a two, three minutes

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:47.770
or maybe like, yeah, four minutes, max to max.

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:38.460
Okay. Some people are asking me why I'm downloading it. So I

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:43.220
think I was like trying to give, uh, the answer for the same

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:45.560
since last 10 minutes, why we are downloading it.

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:53.140
Is it like a Jupiter notebook? No, it's the version manager.

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:56.400
It's not a Jupiter notebook. Jupiter notebook. It is going

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.840
to provide, it is going to provide even a different,

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.940
different IDs as well. For example, our studio or, uh, any

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:07.300
other IDs for like writing a code or cell. It is going to

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:10.400
provide you, but more or less it is going to help you out in

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.900
terms of creating a environment.

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:19.250
It's 900 MB. It's taking too much time. Then I think your

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:23.790
internet speed is, uh, less.

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.260
Okay. Okay. So even if you're not going to create it, it's

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:32.480
completely fine. But going forward, you need it, uh, because

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:36.720
you all are going to face a lot of problem with respect to,

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:41.140
uh, basically a version conflict. So you will be able to see

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:43.900
that, and especially with a tensorflow, tensorflow and

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.520
pytorch version, which eventually we are going to use it a

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:50.540
lot, uh, because we are going to deal with the models,

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.760
right? So again, all this inferencing will be able to do it

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:56.280
with respect to a pytorch and again, even in production. You

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.340
are going to face such kind of issue. So it's always better

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:03.220
to keep our environment clean, keep a different, different

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:05.120
environment for a different, different work.

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:14.590
Okay. What about poetry? Roast kar dijiye. Sab baad mein

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:18.610
karenge. Perle padhai. Okay. Perle idhar focus karna hai.

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:26.500
So even with Python 3 VM, you will be able to do it, but not

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.200
everyone. Some of you are going to face a problem. That's

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.240
the reason. So on a neutral ground, we are doing this

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.660
installation. Okay. So I believe this installation is done

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:38.100
now. So once this installation is done, uh, let's go to the

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:42.040
VS code, right? And I'm going to show you that how you will

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.340
be able to create the environment. So for example, I'm going

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:48.720
to create the environment. So where I need a python 3.10

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.740
installation, fine. So I would like to create an environment

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:54.780
and for this vector DV, so I would like to create the

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:57.560
environment. So here, if conda is installed, I can simply

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:01.360
write a command called as conda, uh, create, right? Conda

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:05.160
create hyphen n hyphen n means name of the environment. So

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.320
for example, for a vector database, I'm creating this

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:11.940
environment. So vector V C T O R D V is an environment name

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:15.440
I'm going to give and then python, right? So P Y T H O N

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:19.040
python. What is the python version? 3.10 let's suppose,

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:23.840
right? So 3.10. So conda create hyphen n and this is the

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.620
environment name vector DV is an environment name. And then

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:29.080
I have given that. Okay. So whenever you're trying to create

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.320
this environment. Okay. So I'm going to install python 3.10,

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:36.520
although in my system, so latest version of python is

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.680
already available, right? But that's okay. That's okay. It

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.080
is not going to touch that particular one. It is going to

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:45.160
create a virtual environment means it is going to create a

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:48.480
separate folder for this particular environment and keep all

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:52.380
of those files inside that particular environment. So conda

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:56.120
create hyphen n and here I have just given a vector DV

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:59.880
environment name and python 3.10. This is the command. And

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:03.260
very simple one, simple one, neat and clean one. You all

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:08.000
will be able to find out and now hit enter, right? So it

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.120
will take maybe like a 30 seconds of time for you and it is

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.920
going to prepare this environment. Environment means

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:18.780
eventually it is going to create a directory for you. As

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:21.800
simple as that. It is going to install some of these basic

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:26.260
library, which is required. And here is your environment

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:29.380
location. So like I said, it is going to create a directory.

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:32.440
Right? Now, if I am going to show you that how many

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:36.260
environment do I have? So let me show you that. So see, it

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:38.920
has created a directory called as vector DV automatically.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:43.960
And then all of these python libraries, right or bundles, it

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:47.200
is trying to keep it inside this same environment. And if I

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.340
am going to show you my environment, see how many

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:53.000
environment I have. So I have 60 plus environment. Yeah, 60

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.380
exactly 60 environment I have a different different like

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:59.100
environment I have created and like 60 plus environment.

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:02.120
Yeah. I am trying to like a keep it inside my system. So

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.340
obviously I keep on creating a different different kind of

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:07.140
environment for a different project or for my different

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.920
different classes. And this is what we are going to do it

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:14.620
even like in your class, right? So 60 plus environment I

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:17.260
have created and even you will end up creating the same

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:19.340
thing. It simply means that we are creating a folder,

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:22.560
nothing much. Yeah, we are creating a folder and whatever

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.000
installation that you are going to do. So all of these

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.380
things will go into a respective library as simple as that.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:32.440
Fine. Okay. So this is the meaning of our environment

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:36.040
creation by the way. So whether you are going to use a conda

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:39.300
or whether you are going to use a python, a plain python,

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:43.140
whether you are going to use a UV, eventually everyone is

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:47.020
going to give you a folder and inside a folder, it is going

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:51.600
to install each and everything for you making sense guys to

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.860
all of us. What is the meaning of our environment creation

00:26:53.860 --> 00:27:00.390
and how we are able to create those environment? Yes. Yeah.

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:03.270
So you can go and you can check in your system. So there

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:05.270
will be a folder, you will be able to find out. So for

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:07.610
example, I have created like so many environment with the

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:11.490
help of conda, right? So inside an a conda three, there is a

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:15.170
folder called as ENVS, which is like environments and inside

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:17.130
that you will be able to find out your respective

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:19.530
environment or else even from here by creating the

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:21.710
environments, it is going to give you the folder location.

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:26.730
Yeah. Okay. So once my environment is created, I have to

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:30.770
activate that environment so that whatever I will be

00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:33.630
installing it, so that will go to that particular directory,

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:37.250
which I have created. So here is the command, a command is

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:40.410
very simple conda activate. So by default, it is giving you

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:43.850
the command. So conda and then activate and then your

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:46.450
environment name. So whatever environment name that you had

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:49.710
given, so you can try to like a hit over here and then it

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:52.290
will end up creating or it will end up activating that

00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:55.090
environment. Now here it's, it's not visible. This is the

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:58.130
power cell prompt, right? So it is trying to like a show it

00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:01.810
with a blue color. Okay. So if you will come over here and

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:04.690
if you are going to launch this command prompt and here

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:08.270
conda activate vector DV, you will be able to even see the

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:12.830
name, name of the environment. Yeah. So in power cell, it's

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:16.350
just representing by this and in a command prompt, so you

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:18.470
will be able to see the environment and so command prompt

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:22.810
shows you environment name as well. So I believe we all are

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:24.210
able to see it, right guys.

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:30.620
Why not simply using a pip to create the environment? So

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:33.740
basically pip has been used. It is used to create or do the

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:40.010
installation in a particular environment. Yeah. Okay. So

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:43.330
conda is not recognized. So I believe you have not installed

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:45.770
an a conda. That is the reason. So it is not able to

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:47.510
recognize it. There is no other reason at all.

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:57.780
Yes. Yeah. I just, you can use any of these. So fine. We are

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:02.960
able to activate this conda, right? So let's activate this

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.680
conda. So this is, this has been activated. So in my

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:08.720
terminal, this has been activated. Now let's suppose. If I

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:12.160
have to use a same environment, right? Same environment in

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:16.020
my Jupiter notebook, this notebook. So here select kernel,

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:21.180
then second step, Python environment. And then from here, so

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:25.960
I can try to select a vector DB. So whatever environment

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:29.680
that I have created, so I can try to select that one. Uh,

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:33.140
and I can try to use that particular environment as simple

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:35.740
as that. Yeah. So let's suppose I'm going to select this

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:39.520
one. So my kernel has changed. And now it is going to use a

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:43.540
vector DB. So V C T O R, I believe I have created two

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:49.420
separate environment, V C, V C O T O R. Okay. So V C O T O R

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:52.200
is the one which I have to use fine.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.280
So this is how you will be able to attach a particular

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:03.060
environment to a particular Jupiter notebook. Because at the

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:07.840
end of the day, Jupiter notebook is just a, like a kind of

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:11.480
a, you know, UI interface. Unless and until you are not

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:14.780
going to attach a kernel, it is not going to work. And you

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:17.260
can attach any of your environment to a Jupiter notebook.

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.660
Doesn't matter at all. And then you can keep on installing

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:23.060
things and then you can keep on like running things inside

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:26.380
this one. Okay. So once environment is ready and even for

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.420
some of you environments are not ready, that's completely

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:31.380
okay. Try to do the installation or try to do the execution

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:33.900
of the code, which I'm going to write in the existing

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.060
environment itself. Yeah. So do it in an existing

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:40.160
environment if you are not able to do it. Yeah. It's always

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.880
better to go ahead with the separate environment to resolve

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.840
the dependency. So next step that we have to do is that,

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.980
that we have to do an installation. Installation of what? So

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:56.970
we have to do pip install, I-S-T-A-L-L, pip install. And we

00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:59.730
have to basically do an installation of a Facebook AI

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:07.190
similarity search database. So F A I S S hyphen CPU. So this

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:12.230
is a library name that you have to install. So pip install

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:16.890
Facebook AI, similarity search CPU. It is asking me to

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:23.850
install a IPY and B kernel. So fine, let's do it. So this

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:26.370
installation, you have to do it guys in whatever environment

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:27.350
you are as of now.

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:52.120
Okay. So it looks like it's done in my system. Yeah. So it's

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:55.940
done. Is it done guys? Everyone. So if you can say yes or no

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:56.620
in a chat.

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:05.640
Okay. No, no, no. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. So yes and no. Fine.

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:07.460
A lot of yes. Some no's.

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:13.770
So just do an installation of this one, Facebook AI

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:17.450
similarity search database CPU version. Again pinging you

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:20.950
the code, pip install Facebook AI similarity search hyphen

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:25.110
CPU. Once you are able to do this installation in this

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:27.190
environment, the environment which I have selected or

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:30.190
whatever by default environment that you have selected by

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:35.310
the way, then let's try to do a pip install N U M P Y. N U M

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:39.550
P Y. So N U M P Y is one of the library and then you have to

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:44.670
install another library called as a request R E Q U E S T S.

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:48.730
So N U M P Y and a request library you have to install.

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:53.150
These two libraries are required. So N U M P Y let me remove

00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:57.350
comma. Yeah. So in this way it will end up installing these

00:32:57.350 --> 00:33:00.430
two libraries. So I can install multiple and I can try to

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:03.830
install a single. So requirement already satisfied. It's

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:05.530
already been installed. So that's cool.

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:20.910
So in every environment we have to install dependencies

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:23.110
separately. Yeah. So you have to install dependencies

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:25.490
separately because every environment as I have shown you,

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:28.970
it's a separate folder. It's a completely separate directory

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:32.590
structure. So one environment will not be able to like

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:34.530
understand anything from the another environment.

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:42.260
Someone is saying I'm getting a below error pip install

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:46.900
syntax error P I P I N S T A double L F A I S S hyphen CPU.

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:51.520
So syntax is correct. Just try to see like a, whether you

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:54.540
are like. You have selected a correct kernel or not.

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:03.400
It says you may need to restart. It's just a warning. So you

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:07.720
can avoid it. Okay. So once it is done, not those who will

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:10.900
not be able to do installation or those who are going to

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:13.640
face an issue, not an issue at all. So in your doubt clean

00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:17.420
session, anyhow, I'm going to see it and I'm going to close

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:22.020
it. So you can, you can just sit tight and yeah, wait for a

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.360
doubt clearing so that I can take access of your screen.

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:30.560
Okay. And I can try to resolve your, uh, concerns. Okay. So

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:34.140
Facebook as a similarity search is already installed. Now we

00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:39.260
need a data, right? Now we need a data. So see guys, we are

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:42.640
going to perform some sort of a embedding operation.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.560
Embedding operation means, so we are going to take some

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:48.500
textual information and eventually we'll try to convert

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:53.260
those textual information into a numerical vector. And after

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:56.260
doing that, so we are going to store. Those information into

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:59.360
our databases, right? This is something that we are going to

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.860
learn. This is something that we are going to do. And this

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:04.240
is something that we have already discussed in my previous

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:05.440
class, which was yesterday.

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:14.360
So here we need a data set, right? We need a data set. So I

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:18.920
can get a data from a multiple sources. And again, in a real

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:22.340
time, so people are going to give you a data again from a

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:24.800
multiple different, different places, right? There is a

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:29.020
possibility that people are going to give you a data or

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:32.060
maybe into a PDF format. There is a possibility that people

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:35.120
are going to give you a data into a Excel sheet or maybe

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:37.940
they are going to give you some URL and they're going to ask

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:41.660
you that scrap those data. Maybe data will be available in

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:45.540
some sequel or no sequel databases. So that is all huge on

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:48.000
different, different kinds of possibilities that my data set

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.880
will be available into a different, different location now.

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:56.440
So as of now, I'm just going to show you. About a conversion

00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:01.740
and storage, but in general and in real time. So we try to

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:06.960
build a complete data pipeline. So where we try to read a

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:10.740
data from a multiple sources, there is a possibility that

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:14.480
I'm going to receive a data into a batch mode. There is a

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.000
possibility that I will receive a data into a streaming

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.200
mode. There is a possibility that I will be receiving a data

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:24.120
into a mini batch mode, right? Means. I'm talking about a

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:27.840
frequency of the data. There is a possibility, right? So I'm

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.100
again, there is a possibility that data will be coming from

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:32.760
a multiple different different sources, maybe from a S3

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:36.400
bucket, maybe from Azure blobs or maybe from some databases.

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:38.880
And there are hundreds of different databases, which is

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.740
available, maybe from a different, different, different,

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:44.900
different kind of a file system. So as of now, I'm going to

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:48.620
pick a data from this page. So on your own page, there is a

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:51.700
page called as founder story, and it's a small story about

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:54.200
me. There is a little bit of information over here. I'm

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.880
going to come over here and I'm going to copy this data.

00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:00.000
Yeah. I'm just going to copy this data. So I'm looking for

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.320
some structured unstructured data. That's the reason. So I'm

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.840
just going to like a come over here. I'm going to copy this

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:09.740
particular data and let's try to keep this data. So let's

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:13.620
suppose there is a variable I have created and here, so I'm

00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:17.120
going to keep this particular data in this manner. Yeah. So

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.700
I've just like copied and I have just pasted this particular

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:23.700
data over here. As simple as that. From the following. So

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:28.380
this is the data which I'm just trying to do a copy and

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:31.120
paste from some of the website. Right. But there is a

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:33.680
possibility that you will receive a data into a PDF format.

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:37.240
Then you have to write a Python function to read out those

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:42.840
data from a PDF file. Maybe someone is going to give you

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:46.000
data into a word format, Excel sheet format, maybe into a

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.680
dot TXT format, maybe into a JSON format. So there can be a

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:54.480
thousands of different, different sources. Of the data that

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:58.520
you all will be able to find out in real time, right? In

00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:03.100
real time, basically. So here is one of the sample of the

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:07.160
data. So let me ping this data to all of you. So I think

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.500
control

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:18.480
A, control C, control V. I believe I'm not able to ping.

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:25.180
This is a huge data. So maybe I can just try to ping. Yeah.

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:31.260
This is a subset of it. Yeah. So this is the data set, which

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:33.420
is available, right? This is the data set which is available

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:38.860
to me now. So as we know that, that this data set is having

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:42.520
so many different, different like lines or maybe paragraphs,

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:47.400
right, paragraphs. So what should be my very first approach?

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:52.460
My very first approach should be to break down, right, to

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:56.260
break down this entire data set into a small, small chunks.

00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:00.080
For example, if we are reading a PDF, right, and someone has

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:03.420
given me a PDF with the hundreds of pages, right? Hundreds

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:06.860
of pages. So it's not like I'll just try to take one single,

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:11.160
like a once, one single variable and inside that I'll try to

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:13.780
keep all those hundreds of pages and then I'll try to

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:16.620
convert those hundreds of pages all together in one single

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:19.360
vector because that is not going to work for me, right?

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:22.320
Because the whole idea behind doing the embedding to

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:26.340
improvise our search. Improvise our indexing, right? So that

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:29.660
is not going to help me out. So what I am supposed to do

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:32.940
next if I have this kind of a data set, right? If I have

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:35.560
this kind of a data set. So basically I'll try to break this

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:40.160
data into a small, small, small, small chunks, right? Chunks

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:45.240
of size, maybe a 500 text, maybe a thousand text or maybe a

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:48.460
thousand character, maybe a thousand word, depends, right?

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:51.100
But yeah, so I'm going to break down this entire data set

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:55.920
into a small, small, small, small chunks. By keeping some

00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:00.160
sort of a overlap between a chunks overlap and why we are

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:03.260
going to maintain that. Let me talk about that one after

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:05.940
breaking down this entire data set into a small, small,

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:09.860
small, small chunks. Yeah. So shall we go ahead guys, shall

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:11.000
we do it now?

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:24.840
Okay. So let's do it guys. Yeah. So we are going to take

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:30.240
this data now here. So we are going to call data.strip.

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:34.020
Strip. Strip. So it is going to eliminate all those leading

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:37.680
and trailing spaces in between our data. And I'm going to

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:42.240
name it as a clean data. Clean underscore data. Now this is

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:46.240
just a symbolic one which I have created. There are so many

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:49.100
different different kinds of cleaning we try to perform. So

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:53.440
we try to perform a normalization operation. We try to just

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:57.920
remove the punctuations or any kind of unnecessary most of

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:01.400
the time repetitive words. So, so many different kind of NLP

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:05.200
based cleaning we try to perform on top of the data now but

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.520
again that depends upon the kind of a problem statement

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:11.300
which I am going to solve. So that depends more like on a

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:13.920
business domain or like the problem statement that we are

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:18.360
going to solve. So as of now just in a symbolic manner so I

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:21.200
have called data strip so which is going to remove leading

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:24.220
and trailing spaces from the data set. I am calling that

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:27.980
data set as a clean data let us suppose yeah. But on top of

00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:32.060
this we do again a lot of processing with respect to our

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:34.800
data. Believe me let us suppose if I am trying to read a PDF

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.400
right there will be so many different different kind of edge

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:40.040
case I will end up getting and I have to handle all the edge

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.880
cases I have to handle all kind of edge cases then only I

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:47.020
will be able to get the required data set. But here it is

00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:50.180
this data set is not that complex there is a possibility

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:55.080
right there is a possibility that I will be having some of

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:58.880
the word. Right. Some of the word or maybe some of the lines

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:03.780
inside my data set into a different language maybe into a

00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:07.020
Spanish maybe into a French right maybe into a Hindi

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:09.920
language. There is a very high chance right. So when I am

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.460
trying to read some sort of a books or maybe a PDF or some

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:15.760
sort of raw data there is a chance that I will end up

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:19.340
getting a mixture of a language which we say a multi

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:22.860
language right. So there is a very high possibility I have

00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:27.100
to handle all of those situation. With respect to a data set

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:31.180
then only I can try to make my data set ideal for any kind

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:33.920
of operation whether it's an embedding or maybe whether it's

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:39.240
a RAG or any other agent take operation. So lot goes around

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:43.660
by the way in terms of like you know building a complete

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:46.780
data pipeline and again that's a major role and

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:52.560
responsibility we all try to do inside the organization.

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:57.480
Right. So here I am able to read a data right and in a

00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:01.260
symbolic manner. So I am able to call data strip. Now my

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:04.820
requirement is to break down this data set into a small

00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:09.080
small chunks. Small chunks means for example in one single

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:13.480
line right in one single line I would like to keep maybe 800

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:18.120
character. Yeah so that is one chunk another 800 another

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:21.920
chunk another 800 another chunk another 800 another chunk.

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:25.760
Hmm. There could be 500 there could be 700 depends right. So

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:30.100
I can try to create a chunks and with certain chunk size. So

00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:33.820
in one single sentence or in one single data I will be

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:36.840
having only that much number of the characters or maybe I

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:39.460
can try to define it based on the words whatever suits me.

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:44.520
So here let me write the code over here. So I can write over

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:51.900
here that while right. So while and here I can try to define

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:53.980
something. So let me define some of the variables. So let me

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:58.700
define some of the variable for this operation. So here max

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:02.660
character char is equals to let's suppose I am going to

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:07.260
define 800 800. So in one single line there will be 800

00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:11.700
character max to max. Not more than that. And then I am

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:15.800
going to define overlap. So overlap is equals to 100. So

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:18.400
means let's suppose I have line number one. I have line

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:22.240
number two. There is a overlap of 100 character. Between

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.760
lines. Line number one and line number two. Why I am trying

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:28.720
to like a keep the overlap over here because when I am going

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:31.260
to do a checking operation when I am going to break down

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:34.980
this data into a chunks. So I have to maintain even a

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:38.980
relation means context right. So if there will be an overlap

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:43.020
between our data. So obviously it will be able to see the

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:45.400
context. It will be able to correlate. And when I am going

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:49.880
to do a search operation on top of the embeddings, it will

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:53.080
be able to give me like okay. So there is some match with

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:55.560
line number one and there is some match with a line number

00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:59.040
two as well. Right. So just to maintain that context, I am

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:02.740
going to maintain the overlapping overlapping between two

00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:05.660
data set. So that's the reason. So I have given like overlap

00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:09.460
with hundreds of like a character. Right. And is of

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:18.000
character. And then let's create a CHU chunks as a list. And

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.820
then I'm going to keep. Let's suppose I variable is equals

00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:24.480
to Jesus. So I start from zero zero index. Start from where?

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:29.120
Start from here from a zero indexes. Fine. So I'm going to

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:33.940
write a code while I is a lesser than right length of a

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:42.840
clean, clean data. Yeah. So start from zero and then go till

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:46.240
what? So try to go till the last one. That's the reason. So

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:48.340
length of clean data, length of clean data. Let's suppose I

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:51.380
have 500. So it will go till last. Right. It will go to

00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:53.920
last. Then only it is going to break the loop. This is what

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:57.540
I have written. So when this statement is true, right, when

00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:01.100
this statement is true, then it has to perform a different,

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:03.380
different, different, different operation. Yeah. Different,

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:05.300
different, different, different operations. So what kind of

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:08.360
operation it has to perform? So it has to break down my

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:11.740
entire data set into a smaller, small pieces. Fine. A

00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:15.080
smaller, small pieces. So let's suppose here I'm going to

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:22.230
call my clean data. Uh, C L E A N. Clean. So clean data is

00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:27.510
my, uh, folder, uh, variable name. Yeah. So I'm just trying

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:30.410
to call my clean data. This particular data set. Fine. This

00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:33.630
particular data set. I'm trying to call it over here. And

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:38.010
then I am going to write. So this is strip, right? Let me

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:40.230
show you this data now. So how my data set looks like.

00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:47.210
So this is how my data set looks like. Right. This is how my

00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:49.970
data set looks like. The whole data set. Yeah. Simple.

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:53.270
Inside a string. So here. So this is the entire clean data.

00:46:53.570 --> 00:46:57.910
And inside this, I'm going to write, uh, indexes that start

00:46:57.910 --> 00:47:02.230
from here and then go till this particular point. So I'm

00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:05.710
saying that they start from I, right? Start from I. So I'm

00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:08.070
just trying to perform the slicing operation. I believe we

00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:10.490
all understand what is the meaning of slicing operation. So

00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:13.290
I'm saying that to start from, I start from zero to indexes

00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:18.310
and then go till, go till where? So go till I plus a maximum

00:47:18.310 --> 00:47:23.170
character. Go till I plus means zero plus 800. This is what

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:28.330
I'm trying to say as of now. Fine. And this is going to be

00:47:28.330 --> 00:47:32.350
one data. So I'm going to store it inside a variable PIE,

00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:37.770
PIECE, let's suppose. So this is a piece which I'm going to

00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:41.270
store. So this will be having in a very fast iteration, in a

00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:43.950
very fast iteration, this will be having a data I is equal

00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:47.390
to zero till 800. This is the maximum character which I have

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:51.150
given. So till 800. Okay. So this is line number one, which

00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:55.090
I'm going to maintain, right? Line number one, which I'm

00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:59.190
going to maintain. And then what I'm going to do, so I'm

00:47:59.190 --> 00:48:04.870
going to append. So chunk, C H U N K, chunk dot append,

00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:08.150
append what? Append piece. So this is a list which I had

00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:11.730
created, right? So I'm going to append this particular piece

00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:15.210
inside this particular list. Simple, as simple as that.

00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:21.850
Okay. So once this is done. Right? So once this is like a

00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:25.430
done, then what we are going to do, so we are going to

00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:29.170
increment a value of I. So we have to like a shift a value

00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:38.230
of I now. So here I is equals to I plus maximum character

00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:44.290
minus overlap. So now I'm going to reset a value of I and

00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:48.190
where my I will be by the way, so I has started. I started

00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:53.590
from zero, it went till 800, right? It went till 800. Now my

00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:59.890
I is here at 800th location, but I have to set this value of

00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:04.770
I at 700th location. Let's suppose why? So that I will be

00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:09.130
able to maintain a overlap of hundred in between, between

00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:12.650
our first sentence and between the second sentence. That's

00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:15.730
the reasons I have written. I is equals to I plus max square

00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:21.130
means 800 minus 100. Which is 700 overlap. So now my I is

00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:25.470
here, I is here. So next time when I is going to start, so I

00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:27.990
is going to start from where? So I is going to start from

00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:32.370
700 by the way, and then 700 plus 800. So technically it is

00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:36.010
going to be 1500. So it will go till 1500 and again I'm

00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:40.530
going to reset the value of I at 1400 simple, right? And

00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:42.770
then again from here I'm going to start so that I will be

00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:45.470
able to maintain the overlap of hundred, hundred, hundred in

00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:49.410
between. Making sense guys. To all of us, how we are

00:49:49.410 --> 00:49:52.430
maintaining the overlap, I'm not doing much over here. So

00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:55.270
I'm just trying to play with the value of I and with the

00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:58.570
help of I, those indexes, I'm able to maintain the overlap.

00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:03.050
That's it. Anyone who is not able to understand by the way,

00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:06.350
this part, yeah,

00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:15.710
why do we need to maintain the overlap? So we do, we need to

00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:18.950
maintain the overlap so that we will be able to maintain a

00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:22.530
context, a little bit of context. We can try to like

00:50:22.530 --> 00:50:27.440
maintain in both the sentences. How to decide the overlap?

00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:30.100
So these are just a hyper parameter. So we do hit and try a

00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:32.600
lot of hit and trial based on the data set and then we try

00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:39.140
to maintain the overlaps. Yeah. Fine, everyone. Okay. So

00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:41.540
here, and what is the total length of the data by the way?

00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:44.600
So here length of the total string if we have to find out,

00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:48.340
so maybe we can try to call just a alien function and you

00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:51.260
will get to know that what is the length. So total we have

00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:56.120
1498 data, right? 1498. Like a, like a. So this is the

00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:59.940
total, like a space which my data set has occupied so far.

00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:02.940
So forth. So max to max, I will end up creating two chunks.

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:06.680
So inside one, inside a chunks, if I'm going to check, I

00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:09.520
will be having max to max like a two sentences, I believe.

00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:14.500
Yeah. Or three. Yeah. So all three. So here, if I'm going to

00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:19.160
check what is the length of chunks, so length of chunks. So

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:21.920
it's three basically. So max to max three sentences I'm able

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:25.820
to form not more than that. Yeah. I can, I can try to like

00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:29.540
play with this one. So I can try to maintain maximum

00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:33.300
character is equals to let's suppose 300. Let's suppose I'm

00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:40.580
going to maintain this as a 300 over here and here. So let's

00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:44.500
suppose I'm going to maintain a hundred. Now there are eight

00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:48.300
data set which I'm able to create. So there is a eight lines

00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:52.120
which I'm able to create out of my data set and all of these

00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:56.280
lines are available inside a particular. Simple. So now this

00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:58.820
is the data set which I'm able to create. You must be able

00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:02.080
to see that we have some sort of a slash in slash in in

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:05.660
between a data. So obviously as a part of your data cleaning

00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:09.400
operation, you have to clean all of these things because

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:13.260
this is not going to give me any kind of a value with

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:16.880
respect to a data. Right. So you may go ahead and perform

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:20.000
maybe some sort of a cleaning operation. Maybe there will be

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.620
some sort of a numerical values which is not of your use.

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:25.760
Yeah. So you can try to clean those data. Maybe data set is

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:28.420
available in some different languages. So maybe you can go

00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:31.180
ahead again with the cleaning operation. So there are a lot

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:35.040
of like a data preprocessing operation we try to perform and

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:38.140
which is true across all the applications, not just with

00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:40.280
this application. So whether you are trying to build a

00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:43.220
simple machine learning model or deep learning model or

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:46.120
maybe you are like dealing with some sort of a data

00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:48.560
analytics everywhere, you will have to go through these kind

00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:54.580
of processes. Fine guys. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So let me ping

00:52:54.580 --> 00:53:00.160
you this code. Um, again this code is a very simple one, but

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:02.840
yeah, those who are not able to do it, I have pinged you

00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:05.080
this code inside your chat so you can try to use this

00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:10.220
particular code. Fine. Before that, so I have like a created

00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:13.380
this clean data variable in

00:53:16.450 --> 00:53:19.110
this data set. There are overlap also. Yes, obviously there

00:53:19.110 --> 00:53:22.150
is a overlap. You can cross check manually if you want. So

00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:25.690
maybe you can try to go at the end of this data. So a skill

00:53:25.690 --> 00:53:31.030
they need to succeed into a today. So TODA, this is the only

00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:34.630
thing that it is able to capture. So here you will be able

00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:37.970
to find out. So the skill they need to succeed in today. So

00:53:37.970 --> 00:53:40.590
there is a hundreds of hundreds of overlap, right? 1.5

00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:43.190
million students from 34 countries. You will be able to find

00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:46.310
out the same. So yeah, 1.5 million students from 34

00:53:46.310 --> 00:53:48.610
countries in a line number one as well. So there is overlap,

00:53:48.890 --> 00:53:52.350
right? There is overlap. I'm like trying to maintain between

00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:56.770
two sentences. So yeah. So that it will be able to maintain

00:53:56.770 --> 00:54:00.270
a contextual information. It will be able to understand

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:03.910
something like these two lines are connected to each other.

00:54:05.230 --> 00:54:11.450
Fine. Okay. So now, now once we are able to create our

00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:14.710
chunks and we all understand that how we can try to create

00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:19.290
this chunks, a simple python function, right? There are some

00:54:19.290 --> 00:54:22.710
inbuilt libraries which is available to all of us. So you

00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:26.930
can even try to use that one. But more or less, this is

00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:29.330
something that people are doing even inside those libraries.

00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:34.810
So okay, we are able to create this one. Now what is our

00:54:34.810 --> 00:54:39.510
next step? So our next step is to convert this entire data

00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:43.930
set into a embeddings, fine, into a numerical format. So

00:54:43.930 --> 00:54:46.950
we'll have to convert this data, which we have already done

00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:50.170
this today, right? So we can try to use a URI API. We can

00:54:50.170 --> 00:54:53.830
try to use some models from a hugging phase or maybe any

00:54:53.830 --> 00:54:56.870
other open source. model, which is going to support our

00:54:56.870 --> 00:55:00.970
embedding and I will be able to convert my data set into a

00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:06.390
vector, right? So into a vector, okay, that's cool. So let's

00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:12.370
go ahead guys and let's try to convert this entire data set

00:55:12.370 --> 00:55:17.530
into a embedding, into a vector space, which is again very,

00:55:17.590 --> 00:55:21.750
very simple. So what I will do? I'll just go to a neuron.

00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:28.810
Okay. And I'll go to URI API here. I'll go to a code example

00:55:28.810 --> 00:55:33.230
and I'll try to copy this code, simple. So copy this code

00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:35.790
for a embedding and similarity, right? So this is the code

00:55:35.790 --> 00:55:38.810
which has been given to me. Technically, we all understand

00:55:38.810 --> 00:55:41.470
this code. So in API classes itself, we were able to

00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:43.970
understand that what is the meaning of a URL endpoint and

00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:46.510
all the things which has been written over here and

00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:49.450
yesterday we have already used it. So just try to copy this

00:55:49.450 --> 00:55:54.490
one, right? Copy this one. And maybe keep it here. Yeah. Now

00:55:54.490 --> 00:55:58.390
it requires a API key without API key, we can't use this

00:55:58.390 --> 00:56:01.650
piece of the code. So here, what we can do is that, that we

00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:06.310
can try to click on API keys, fine, create a API key and

00:56:06.310 --> 00:56:10.310
then let's try to create the API key. So this is my API key,

00:56:10.410 --> 00:56:15.070
which I'm able to create and just paste it over here, paste

00:56:15.070 --> 00:56:15.710
it over here.

00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:29.670
Yeah. So my API key is done. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So now what I

00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:30.610
can do is that I can create a data, which is eventually

00:56:30.610 --> 00:56:34.490
going to take a text and it is going to give you the

00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:37.730
embedding, fine. It is going to take a data and it is going

00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:40.430
to give you the embedding. This is a very, very simple

00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:44.210
function that is already available and no need to do

00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:47.230
anything. Literally no need to do anything. So we can try to

00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:50.190
hit this particular, like a function. So here execute this

00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:54.370
function and we have this data chunks we have now from this

00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:57.650
chunk, I have to convert this entire data into an

00:56:57.650 --> 00:57:02.050
embeddings. By using this URI API, yeah, by using this URI

00:57:02.050 --> 00:57:06.990
API. So how we can do it? Let's understand. I think it's,

00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:12.090
it's a very easy kind of a job, right? So without any, like

00:57:12.090 --> 00:57:15.230
a second thought, I believe we all will be able to do it,

00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:15.810
right guys?

00:57:21.150 --> 00:57:21.590
Yeah.

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:27.200
Can you copy and paste above code? Yeah, above code I have

00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:30.180
copy and pasted and this code is already available here. So

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:34.820
go to a Euron, go to a URI API and code example. Yeah. You

00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:37.520
will be able to find out embedding. So that copy button we

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:40.000
have given to you so you can copy and paste directly as

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:45.780
simple as that. Okay, fine. So once we are able to call this

00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:48.520
generate embedding and we have already used this function

00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:51.360
even yesterday, right? So even yesterday. So now we all know

00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:55.400
that how it does now here inside this one. So we are using a

00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:58.960
open AI based model. So again, this is a multilingual model

00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:01.960
that we are using. It supports hundreds of languages by

00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:04.800
default, right? It already supports hundreds of languages.

00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:08.480
Because when, while people was training this particular

00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:11.740
model, so obviously they have used a multilingual data set,

00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:16.360
but, and again, one of the light weighted, one of the

00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:20.040
fastest embedding model and one of the low cost embedding

00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:23.360
model, you will be able to find out in a market. There are

00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:26.440
hundreds of other embedding model which is available, right?

00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:29.220
Yesterday I have used some model from a hugging face, a quen

00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:32.240
model I have used from hugging face. So you can even go

00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:35.800
ahead with that. That's completely fine. Now, this model is

00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:39.620
going to give you a vector size return of one, five, three,

00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:42.500
six, right? One thousand five hundred thirty-six is a

00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:45.580
dimension of the one single vector it is going to return.

00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:49.720
And I believe we are aware about even that, yes, everyone,

00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:55.050
we are aware about it, right? I think we have done that

00:58:55.050 --> 00:59:01.250
yesterday, right? Okay. Let's move forward. So we have a

00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:04.310
chunk, we have a data, so I don't think that we have to do

00:59:04.310 --> 00:59:07.730
much over here. So I will just run. My like a, you know,

00:59:07.730 --> 00:59:11.030
generate embedding through this chunks one by one, one by

00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:14.690
one, one by one. And eventually I will be able to get my

00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:18.110
final embedding. Yes. Yeah.

00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:31.570
Okay. So let's do it. So here I'm going to write a code that

00:59:31.570 --> 00:59:39.230
for I in C H U N K S. So one by one, let's do the checking

00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:43.150
and call this generate embedding function, pass the value of

00:59:43.150 --> 00:59:46.510
I one by one, one by one, and then try to print the

00:59:46.510 --> 00:59:49.990
embedding or if I would like to like keep all of those

00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:53.970
embedding. So I'll try to keep those embedding somewhere. So

00:59:53.970 --> 00:59:57.250
as you can see, it is like creating embedding for sentence

00:59:57.250 --> 00:59:59.830
number one, sentence number two, sentence number three,

00:59:59.870 --> 01:00:02.990
sentence number four, five, six, seven, eight. So I have in

01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:06.510
total eight sentences and for all of those sentences, it is

01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:10.010
able to create the embedding. So it is able to create the

01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:14.030
numerics, right? Done. Everyone.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:28.440
Okay. Most of you have done. Okay. That's cool. It's

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:30.260
nothing. I'm just running through the chunks and then

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:34.260
eventually I'm trying to like, you know, do the embeddings.

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:53.740
Now those who are not able to follow along so far, let me

01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:58.200
give you a copy and paste of this code one by one, once

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:04.600
again. So first install this, then install this.

01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:11.960
Then you have to take this data. So you can, you can take a

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:14.380
bigger data because I'm not able to copy and paste my whole

01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:19.120
data inside your zoom because zoom is having some limitation

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:20.800
with respect to sending a data.

01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:27.900
Then you have to do this, then

01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:37.760
this, then

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:47.780
you have to do this one. I'm removing my API key so you can

01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:56.570
replace it with your own API key, this one, and

01:01:59.870 --> 01:02:01.630
then finally this one.

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:11.960
Okay. So till this point, is it done guys? Yeah. So we move

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:12.160
ahead.

01:02:36.850 --> 01:02:39.470
Embedding means that data, they will give us a binary form.

01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:42.310
Is that correct? No, it's not correct. I think you should

01:02:42.310 --> 01:02:45.830
attend today's lecture. So please try to revisit yesterday's

01:02:45.830 --> 01:02:46.050
lecture.

01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:52.590
Okay.

01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:46.170
Now. So once we are able to generate this chunk, so we can

01:03:46.170 --> 01:03:49.910
now happily store this data into any of these databases. So

01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:52.190
whether it's a quadrant, whether it's a pine cone, whether

01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:55.410
it's a chroma DB, whether it's a Facebook AI similarity

01:03:55.410 --> 01:04:00.010
search. Or any other databases which exist in my local or

01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:03.830
maybe which is available in some other platform. Right.

01:04:04.270 --> 01:04:07.430
Depends. So I will be able to like a store all of this data

01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:15.370
set in anywhere, anywhere that I want. So fine guys, let's

01:04:15.370 --> 01:04:17.290
start doing it. Yeah. One by one.

01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:25.510
So here I'm just trying to generate the embeddings and I'm

01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:29.290
just trying to like show you the print. So in an ideal way.

01:04:29.290 --> 01:04:34.310
So I have to basically create a complete embedding list and

01:04:34.310 --> 01:04:38.010
I have to create a meta information and then I have to go

01:04:38.010 --> 01:04:42.610
ahead and I have to store those data. So let's re modify

01:04:42.610 --> 01:04:45.890
this, this modify this particular piece of the code. So here

01:04:45.890 --> 01:04:53.310
let's write this code in this way. So for IDX and CHUNK

01:04:53.310 --> 01:05:00.820
chunks in enumerated chunks. Okay. So this is just the

01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:03.900
extension of the previous code I'm writing. So here I have

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:06.840
written just chunks and then I was like going through one by

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:10.240
one, one by one, all of this data. So here what I'm trying

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:13.040
to do, so I'm trying to like do the enumeration. So what

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:16.180
enumeration does by the way. So if we are trying to pass a

01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:20.660
list, so enumeration will try to give a ID. I believe we all

01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:25.120
understands a meaning of enumeration inside a Python. Anyone

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:27.580
guys who don't understand the meaning of enumeration inside

01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:28.060
the Python.

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:34.820
Yeah. So let's suppose we have a list inside this list. We

01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:39.260
have S U D H S U D H or like something like this, like this

01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:43.880
kind of a data we have. Now if I'm trying to write for I in

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:51.400
enumeration, enumeration and okay, unnecessary it is trying

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:57.100
to produce. So enumerate and then print I, print

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:01.020
I.

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:07.360
So what it does? So whatever data that we have inside the

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:10.100
list. Right. We have this, this and this. So basically it

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:13.100
will try to take this data and it is going to return indexes

01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:16.720
as well. So this is what enumerate does. So let's suppose we

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:20.640
have a list of the data inside a chunks. So for every list

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:23.440
it is going to return the IDs as well as it is going to

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:26.060
return the chunks. I'm just trying to build my meta

01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:28.860
information of the data. So that's the reason. So in that

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:32.220
way I'm trying to write. So here it is going to return ID

01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:34.760
and it is going to return chunks. This is the property of

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:37.420
enumerate, which I have already shown you. Right. In this

01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:39.900
fashion it is going to return the dataset, a basic python

01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:45.560
command. Okay. So here unnecessary it has generated a code

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:51.230
once again. Fine. So here what I will do is that, that I am

01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:54.790
going to call a generate embedding function and here I am

01:06:54.790 --> 01:06:58.210
going to pass my chunk means I am going to pass my original

01:06:58.210 --> 01:07:01.690
data, this one, one by one and let's suppose this is going

01:07:01.690 --> 01:07:04.670
to return me the vector. Vector means a numerical value.

01:07:04.830 --> 01:07:10.470
This one. It is going to return. And the second one. So here

01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:16.950
let's try to create one list EM embedding underscore LIST

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:22.190
embedding list. So a blank list I have created and then

01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:26.430
let's try to create another list called as meta. Again keep

01:07:26.430 --> 01:07:29.230
it blank. So there are two blank lists I have created. One

01:07:29.230 --> 01:07:31.990
is an embedding list. So where I'm going to keep all of

01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:35.130
these embeddings, which I'm trying to produce and then one

01:07:35.130 --> 01:07:39.770
is a meta list. So where I'm going to keep maybe IDs, maybe

01:07:39.770 --> 01:07:44.350
textual data itself, start indexes, end indexes, all of such

01:07:44.350 --> 01:07:47.890
like information. Maybe I can try to store it over there. So

01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:52.410
here we have a vector, right? We have a vector. So here I'm

01:07:52.410 --> 01:07:57.470
going to call embedding list, embedding list dot append and

01:07:57.470 --> 01:08:02.470
append what? So append basically a vector. So simple,

01:08:02.610 --> 01:08:05.310
whatever it is trying to generate. So just try to append it.

01:08:05.310 --> 01:08:09.090
But before appending it, so let's try to convert it into a

01:08:09.090 --> 01:08:13.930
proper type. So as type and then I'm going to write that.

01:08:14.010 --> 01:08:17.150
Okay. So whenever you are trying to append it, keep it

01:08:17.150 --> 01:08:21.790
inside a float 32 bit format, NumPy compatible and along

01:08:21.790 --> 01:08:25.910
with Facebook AI, similarity search compatible. So whenever

01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:28.670
you're trying to store it, just try to store it as a vector

01:08:28.670 --> 01:08:33.450
32 bits. Okay that's cool. So this is going to basically

01:08:33.450 --> 01:08:35.690
keep on appending a data. It is going to append into this

01:08:35.690 --> 01:08:37.870
particular list, each and every data it is going to append.

01:08:38.330 --> 01:08:41.730
Now we have to create a meta information. So I'm going to

01:08:41.730 --> 01:08:47.450
call meta dot append, meta dot append and here. So I can try

01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:55.890
to append a ID and I can try to append a text, original data

01:08:55.890 --> 01:09:00.390
that we have. So this I'm trying to treat as a text data. So

01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:03.770
this is going to be the meta information. Now execute it.

01:09:04.230 --> 01:09:06.630
Once you are going to execute it, it is going to. It is

01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:10.270
going to create a vector and it is going to create a meta

01:09:10.270 --> 01:09:13.050
information and all of this information will be available

01:09:13.050 --> 01:09:16.290
inside the embedding list and it will be available inside

01:09:16.290 --> 01:09:20.990
the meta. So now if I'll go and check my embedding list, I

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:27.080
have all the data right available in float 32 bit format and

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:32.120
now if I'm going to check my meta. So for all of these data,

01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:36.120
right for all of these data, so we have ID zero data zero

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:39.700
and this was the text, right? So ID one, this was the text

01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:43.020
ID two, this was a text. So I'm just trying to maintain a

01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:46.480
proper meta data information about my data set. So this was

01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:49.640
our actual data and this is basically our respective

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:53.940
conversion of those data. So let me ping you this particular

01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:57.640
code guys to all of you. So this is going to my final data

01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:58.520
set by the way,

01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:05.770
making sense guys, this is nothing new. So we have already

01:10:05.770 --> 01:10:07.970
like created that even before.

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:20.800
Yeah. So I've already pinged you the code, try to implement

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:24.740
the same. So now we have a meta information and now we have

01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:28.980
a data which is available into a vector format fine, which

01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:34.360
is available into a vector format. Now what we have to

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:43.480
perform. So here we have this data set and if I'm going to

01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:46.740
check what is a type of type

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:52.980
of this data. So this data set is available into a list

01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:55.460
format because I have created up simple plain list and

01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:59.000
inside that list I was trying to keep all of these data. So

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.960
let's try to convert this data set into a numpy vector

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:11.160
format. So to do that, I can try to call numpy.vstsck vstack

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:17.100
and here, so I'm going to pass it this entire list. So as

01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:20.640
you can see now that this entire list is being converted. It

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:24.200
has been converted into a 2D vector, right 2D vector. So

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:27.260
just data inside the data. So even before that, so we had a

01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:30.860
list inside, we had an array. So I'm just trying to convert

01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:34.740
that data into a numpy compatible format. So we have now

01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:41.380
data of shape 8 into 8 row 1536 columns. The length of the

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:45.580
data is 1536 so that it is just trying to show you. So let's

01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:50.440
try to store it into a variable called as xb for now. Let me

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:54.620
ping it. Let me ping you this code. So now we are able to

01:11:54.620 --> 01:12:01.820
convert it. Now we can try to send this data into a Facebook

01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:08.040
AI similarity search. To do that, we have to even call a

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:14.680
normalization. So let's call the normalization. So FAI, I

01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:19.460
think I have not done the import of Facebook AI similarity

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:24.660
search. So let's try to do a import of Facebook AI

01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:28.260
similarity search. Just import it guys, everyone. And once

01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:29.420
we are going to import it,

01:12:36.530 --> 01:12:42.150
Facebook AI similarity search dot, I can try to call

01:12:43.050 --> 01:12:48.990
normalize L2 and I can try to pass my data set. So it will

01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:54.030
be able to normalize it. Name xb. xb I have defined, right?

01:12:54.610 --> 01:12:55.170
Yeah.

01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:05.750
Hmm. So name xb. Now here, so we are, we are just trying to

01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:16.410
perform the normalization operation and xb dot shape of one

01:13:16.410 --> 01:13:20.170
is 1536. Now that is going to be the dimension of my vector

01:13:20.170 --> 01:13:23.490
database. So I'm keeping it as d. I can, I can even hard

01:13:23.490 --> 01:13:28.130
code it. That's completely fine. But here I'm

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:33.500
just trying to find out the dimension from the data set.

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:37.780
Yeah. So for one data set dimension is basically 1536 and I

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:43.920
need this dimension to define my total index dimension

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:48.540
inside of Facebook AI similarity search. So here what we can

01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:54.060
do is that, that we can try to call FAI ss dot, uh, there is

01:13:54.060 --> 01:14:00.580
something called as index index. Index. And then there is

01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:06.340
something called as index flat IP. So index FLAT flat IP,

01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:15.280
yeah. So index flat IP and inside that you are going to pass

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:19.820
a dimension. So basically this one is going to set a

01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:22.860
dimension for a particular indexes, a particular data

01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:26.440
because inside this Facebook AI similarity search, I can try

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:31.120
to store a data with any of my dimension. So maybe 2000 plus

01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:34.860
3000 plus 5,000 plus. Yeah. But yeah, so initially you have

01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:36.680
to define the dimension that, okay, fine. So what is the

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:40.320
dimension of your data set? Because your data set could, can

01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:43.360
be using maybe a different, different models and every

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:45.600
models gives you a different, different dimension. So here

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:48.720
I'm going to set a dimension and I'm going to call it as a

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:53.740
index. I N D X index over here. So just set a dimension,

01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:57.180
right? You can try to even hard code it. There is no issue

01:14:57.180 --> 01:15:00.240
at all. So I can directly come over here and I can write

01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:03.540
one, five, three, six, because I know that, uh, one, five,

01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:06.220
three, six is a dimension, which my model is going to

01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:09.020
return. So I can even do this one. There is no like harm in

01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:12.440
that one. That that's completely fine. Yeah. And once you

01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:17.820
are able to create the indexes, next step is index dot add

01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:22.420
and add all the data at a time. Yeah. Index dot add. Now,

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:25.600
once you are going to call index dot add, and I'm just

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:28.380
trying to call my entire data set, this one, which is a

01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:32.000
numpy array or numpy format or numpy compatible data. Yeah.

01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:34.880
It will be able to store all of these data automatically. So

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:40.490
let me ping you this code. So what is D? D is nothing but a

01:15:40.490 --> 01:15:42.990
dimension of the data. So the dimension which your model is

01:15:42.990 --> 01:15:45.870
going to return. So I have just hard coded it over here or

01:15:45.870 --> 01:15:48.790
else you can try to take a D from a data set itself. So I'm

01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:51.130
trying to find out the shape of the very first data. And

01:15:51.130 --> 01:15:53.770
then out of that, I'm trying to check what is the dimension

01:15:53.770 --> 01:15:57.130
otherwise hard coded. It's fine. I know that my model is

01:15:57.130 --> 01:16:01.170
going to return one, five, three, six. So this is something

01:16:01.170 --> 01:16:05.530
that you have to do. Now this is a process. This is just one

01:16:05.530 --> 01:16:09.230
single line where we are trying to add all the data. So

01:16:09.230 --> 01:16:13.490
after this step, my data set has been added. Now my data set

01:16:13.490 --> 01:16:16.810
has been stored inside of Facebook AI similarity search. So

01:16:16.810 --> 01:16:20.610
a step wise, if you are going to ask me, only these two line

01:16:20.610 --> 01:16:24.550
of a code is required to store our data. Only this two line

01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:29.470
above and before we were trying to do just a data

01:16:29.470 --> 01:16:29.770
processing.

01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:36.980
What is the line to store the data? Create the indexes, call

01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:42.800
add. That's it. And work done. Data is stored inside

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:47.780
Facebook AI similarity search. It's done making sense. Yeah.

01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:51.620
So basically it's in memory as of now it's, it's available

01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:54.980
into a memory. It's available into a Ram as of now, by the

01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:58.620
way. Yeah. I can try to even create a physical file and I

01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:02.280
can try to even a store this indexes and I can try to store

01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:04.560
a meta information, which I, which I'll do. It now itself.

01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:08.000
Don't worry, which I'm going to do it. So when I'm trying to

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:13.340
call index dot add as of now, everything is in memory. It is

01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:17.080
not persisting my data into a hard disk into any kind of

01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:20.160
physical file. By the way, everything is available into a in

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:24.240
memory now. So only this line of code guys, just imagine

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:28.540
they store any kind of a data. Only this line of a code is

01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:30.980
required to create the indexes or whatever dimension that

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:33.880
you have that, that you are able to get from the model. And

01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:42.520
then call add end of the story simple, right? So we have, we

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:46.340
have done a lot, uh, before this step, but yeah, all of

01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:51.560
those was just a pre-processing of the data. This is the

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:55.140
actual storage. Okay. Now let's go ahead. And like I, like I

01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:57.880
told you that it's a in memory, right? Uh, let's suppose I

01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:01.340
would like to persist this entire indexes in a file system,

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:05.060
right? In a file system. And apart from that, so I would

01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:08.200
like to persist by meta information because even this meta

01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:10.740
information is available in a variable. So technically it's

01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:13.660
available into a memory as of now, right? So once I'm going

01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:16.680
to restart my computer or once I'm going to, you know, uh,

01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:20.740
uh, close this, uh, entire VS code after that, I have to re

01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:24.600
execute, reload this entire things. So let's go ahead and

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:27.580
let's try to store this entire information into some file.

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:32.080
Yeah. Into some file. So here for index, let's suppose I'm

01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:34.680
going to create a variable index. So index underscore P A T

01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:38.540
H index underscore path variable. And uh, I'm just trying to

01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:41.960
give a name, uh, so, uh,

01:18:45.390 --> 01:18:51.970
so just try to store the index offer. So the answer data, if

01:18:51.970 --> 01:18:54.530
AI SS. So this is going to be the file which I'm going to

01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:57.790
create, right? So this is the name of the file and this is

01:18:57.790 --> 01:19:01.010
the file extension. So Facebook has similarity search and

01:19:01.010 --> 01:19:04.950
over here, I'm going to store all of these indexes, right?

01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:10.030
All these vectors. And uh, meta information. So meta

01:19:10.030 --> 01:19:12.890
information, let's suppose I'm going to create a meta

01:19:12.890 --> 01:19:17.330
Sudhanshu dot JSON or maybe JSON L I can try to create and

01:19:17.330 --> 01:19:20.450
I'm going to keep all those metadata metadata means this

01:19:20.450 --> 01:19:23.690
one, right? This one I can try to attach even date and time

01:19:23.690 --> 01:19:27.310
if I want, I can try to attach even a geographical location

01:19:27.310 --> 01:19:31.170
because with some data we do that, right? We can try to

01:19:31.170 --> 01:19:34.770
attach a latitude longitude and we does the, does this kind

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:36.650
of a things as well, right? While creating a meta

01:19:36.650 --> 01:19:40.670
information, but case by case basis, it depends. Yeah. So

01:19:40.670 --> 01:19:42.710
what kind of a problem that we are going to solve? So let's

01:19:42.710 --> 01:19:47.210
suppose I'm going to create two files as of now file path in

01:19:47.210 --> 01:19:50.670
one file. So I'm going to store the indexes and in one file,

01:19:50.790 --> 01:19:54.370
so I'm going to store my meta information. Okay, let's do it

01:19:54.370 --> 01:20:03.410
then. So here if we have to a store, uh, indexes, right? So

01:20:03.410 --> 01:20:08.650
I can try to simply call Facebook. I similarity search dot,

01:20:08.770 --> 01:20:16.710
uh, write indexes and then this is my index variable and

01:20:16.710 --> 01:20:19.570
this is the index path. This is the index path, simple

01:20:19.570 --> 01:20:23.150
execute it. And if you will come here, you will be able to

01:20:23.150 --> 01:20:27.210
find out index underscores on shoe. It has already created a

01:20:27.210 --> 01:20:30.150
physical file, but you will not be able to read it out. So

01:20:30.150 --> 01:20:32.690
if you will try to read it out, it will show you your

01:20:32.690 --> 01:20:36.170
information in like a, this, this way, right? It's a

01:20:36.170 --> 01:20:37.770
serialized

01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:42.280
file. You will be able to find out. So technically all of

01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:45.000
this data is available over here into a bytecode is a

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.200
serialized one. And when you try to read the file, so it

01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:52.440
tried to perform the deserialization. So here we are able to

01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:55.940
create a physical file down inside this physical file. I

01:20:55.940 --> 01:21:00.800
have all of these indexes, this one. So now I'm able to

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:03.680
persist my data into a hard disk. Now if even if I'm going

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:07.140
to close my computer, that's completely fine. Once I'm going

01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:09.520
to open it up, I don't have to go through all of those

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:12.580
lengthy processes, which I have already done. So I can

01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:15.360
directly start from this particular file and I can start

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:18.820
like, you know, uh, searching for the data. Yeah. So in a

01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:21.660
physical file, we are able to store this data, uh, as an

01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:24.500
indexes, or let's suppose if I have to store our meta

01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:27.620
information as well. So you can try to write the code and,

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:32.040
uh, you can try to, you know, uh, uh, store all of these

01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:35.940
information and that's, that's completely fine. Is it making

01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:38.880
sense? Guys to all of us. So let me ping you this one.

01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:44.560
It's very simple. Facebook, AI, similarity search, call it

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:51.360
and then call it like a write indexes. Yeah. Okay. So here,

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:57.900
uh, let's try to import JSON, import I M P U R T JSON

01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:07.120
and maybe operating system. I'm going to import, let's

01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:10.440
suppose I'm trying to store our meta information, right? Uh,

01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:13.780
so meta information into a physical file. So I can try to

01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:17.820
write with open and, uh,

01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:28.760
meta path, right? Right. And then one by one, one by one,

01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:36.440
right to all of these information. So we have this meta and

01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:41.140
I'm going to write it down inside this file. So execute it.

01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:45.880
Let me ping you this code. Now. Now here, if I'll come, so I

01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:49.400
have this meta information, right? The beautiful manner, uh,

01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:53.140
whatever meta information that I had. So ID and a textual

01:22:53.140 --> 01:22:55.740
information. So yeah, all of these informations are

01:22:55.740 --> 01:22:59.240
available to me. So meta information I'm able to store by

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:03.900
the way. And uh, even my vector, even my embeddings, I'm

01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:07.660
able to store it. Fine guys. All of us are able to do it.

01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:13.760
Meta plus vector both. Yeah. So now it's available inside my

01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:17.960
hard disk. Okay. I'm able to create a physical file. So now

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:21.940
even if I am going to close my entire system, if I'll come

01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:26.040
back, I will be able to get the exact same thing, right? I

01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:30.100
will be able to get the exact same thing. So storing is

01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:34.700
done. So we are able to store our data set. That's cool. Uh,

01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:38.520
now we have to perform a searching, right? Now we have to

01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:41.660
perform the search operation. So let's suppose if I'm going

01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:44.680
to, uh, like, uh, write something like who is the, how many,

01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:47.740
10,000, so obviously from that information from that

01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:51.560
embedding, it must give me some answer or it must give me

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:55.720
some return, right? So storage is done. Now it's time for

01:23:55.720 --> 01:24:01.620
basically a search operation. Yes, is, if I assess is a

01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:04.100
standard command. I like there is nothing called a standard

01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:08.120
non-standard command. It's just a library right? I think

01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:10.180
your python is weak. You should revise your python.

01:24:17.490 --> 01:24:21.250
Okay. Okay. Yeah. So once we are able to do this, once we

01:24:21.250 --> 01:24:24.210
are able to store the information, now we have to basically

01:24:24.210 --> 01:24:28.230
perform a search operation. This is the next one, next thing

01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:30.550
that we have to do. So we have to perform the search

01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:36.290
operation so that I can write a query and it will be able to

01:24:36.290 --> 01:24:39.410
give me some result. For example, if I am going to write a

01:24:39.410 --> 01:24:44.950
query that what was a mission of eye neuron or what has

01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:50.090
happened in 2022 or maybe who is the Hanchu Kumar. So I

01:24:50.090 --> 01:24:53.090
believe those informations are already available in that

01:24:53.090 --> 01:24:56.130
particular data set, right. Those informations are already

01:24:56.130 --> 01:24:59.270
available. So let's suppose if someone is going to write a

01:24:59.270 --> 01:25:02.910
query. So let's suppose query is this one, right? So first

01:25:02.910 --> 01:25:05.970
of all, I'll try to convert this query, convert this query

01:25:05.970 --> 01:25:09.550
into what? So I'm going to convert this particular query

01:25:09.550 --> 01:25:13.810
into embeddings. So I'm going to follow the exact same thing

01:25:13.810 --> 01:25:18.030
that I have. I'm like done even before, right? So even

01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:22.310
before, so here I'm going to like generate the embeddings

01:25:22.310 --> 01:25:26.250
for this particular query. Simple. Yeah. So generate

01:25:26.250 --> 01:25:29.950
embedding and once I'm going to generate the embedding, so

01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:34.070
I'm going to convert this one into a float 32 because I have

01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:38.730
done that for even like the previous one. And then I can try

01:25:38.730 --> 01:25:42.970
to call a reshape so that my data set will be flat. So now

01:25:42.970 --> 01:25:46.210
this is going to my actual query. Let's suppose I'm going to

01:25:46.210 --> 01:25:50.530
name it as a queue. Okay. So once this is done, so this is

01:25:50.530 --> 01:25:53.690
my query, I'm able to convert it into like a some normalized

01:25:53.690 --> 01:25:58.330
format. Yeah. The normalized format. Then just try to call a

01:25:58.330 --> 01:26:02.070
Farsi, normalize L2 and then try to pass a query over here

01:26:02.070 --> 01:26:05.370
so that it will be able to calculate the norm. In a

01:26:05.370 --> 01:26:08.730
denominator, we had a normalization, right? So maybe you can

01:26:08.730 --> 01:26:10.850
say that as a equivalent distance, it will be able to

01:26:10.850 --> 01:26:14.710
calculate the norms over here. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, once

01:26:14.710 --> 01:26:19.430
this is done, so I can try to call index.search search wise,

01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:22.650
so I'm trying to pass my query. Yeah. I'm trying to pass my

01:26:22.650 --> 01:26:27.990
query and then I'm trying to pass a top K value means try to

01:26:27.990 --> 01:26:31.550
give me top five result or maybe I can try to say that gave

01:26:31.550 --> 01:26:34.010
me top three results. That's completely fine. So this is

01:26:34.010 --> 01:26:37.430
basically a top K. So whichever will be having a top three

01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:42.830
most like a, you know, closest or like a, the maximum

01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:45.230
similarity. So it is going to give me that result. So index

01:26:45.230 --> 01:26:51.230
.search and it is going to give me the entire result. So

01:26:51.230 --> 01:26:56.430
let's see. Yeah. So it is right. So it is able to give me

01:26:56.430 --> 01:27:03.170
some sort of a result by the way and index.search wise. So

01:27:03.170 --> 01:27:07.670
I'm able to see some result. I'm able to see some result. So

01:27:07.670 --> 01:27:14.270
it is giving me array number two, array number one and array

01:27:14.270 --> 01:27:18.370
number zero in general. So this is the result which it is

01:27:18.370 --> 01:27:21.750
trying to give it to me. Maybe I can try to write like give

01:27:21.750 --> 01:27:24.930
me top five. So it is giving me array number two, then one,

01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:30.650
then zero, then three and then five. And here is a score

01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:37.900
basically. Here is a score. And in a descending order.

01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:41.040
Right. In a descending order. So it is trying to give me the

01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:45.060
score. And for a particular score, it is trying to give me

01:27:45.060 --> 01:27:48.420
the array indexes. Now anyone who can explain me this

01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:51.080
result, I believe we all can understand like it's a very

01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:54.680
easy one to understand it. But anyone who can, who can give

01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:55.180
me the explanation?

01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:08.480
Yeah. This shows second index is the best. Exactly. This is

01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:13.160
what it means because similarity score is basically 0.56.

01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:16.780
Yeah. So array two is best. Then what is the second best?

01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:19.880
Second best is one. What is the third best? Third best is

01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:22.580
basically zero. What is the fourth best? Fourth best is

01:28:22.580 --> 01:28:25.560
three. And what is the fifth best? So fifth best is

01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:28.740
basically five. This is what it is trying to like give it to

01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:28.920
me.

01:28:52.010 --> 01:28:52.450
Yes.

01:28:57.810 --> 01:29:04.110
Okay. Fine. So here we are able to get this result. Now

01:29:04.110 --> 01:29:08.070
maybe we can try to do a little bit more of coding and we

01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:11.210
can try to see a result which will be human readable. Right.

01:29:11.410 --> 01:29:13.850
As of now, it is trying to give me like a cosine similarity

01:29:13.850 --> 01:29:17.230
score and then after that, so it is trying to give me a

01:29:17.230 --> 01:29:20.310
respective indexes, right? That okay, fine. So for this

01:29:20.310 --> 01:29:22.790
particular array index, this is the similarity score that we

01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:26.550
are able to find out and this is the arrangement. Now let's

01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:30.090
suppose we have to arrange this entire data and we have to

01:29:30.090 --> 01:29:34.010
basically showcase that. Okay. What is available at array

01:29:34.010 --> 01:29:37.610
index two? I think even with the respect to meta

01:29:37.610 --> 01:29:40.550
information, I can, I can try to like go and check, right?

01:29:40.810 --> 01:29:43.470
And even I can try to write a Python code. So which will be

01:29:43.470 --> 01:29:48.230
able to print because I have IDs even over here, right? So

01:29:48.230 --> 01:29:52.570
array two means ID two, array zero means this one, array

01:29:52.570 --> 01:29:56.570
five means this one, right? So I can, I can just try to do

01:29:56.570 --> 01:29:59.910
a, like a little bit of Python coding and I will be able to

01:29:59.910 --> 01:30:02.550
understand that. Okay. So which line is matching with my

01:30:02.550 --> 01:30:06.730
line? So my input was, what is the mission of iron iron? I

01:30:06.730 --> 01:30:11.070
believe. And this was better on there. They saw iron as a

01:30:11.070 --> 01:30:14.410
lifeline, a positive rise above their circumstances while

01:30:14.410 --> 01:30:19.530
this question. Yeah. So I think it is giving me like a

01:30:19.530 --> 01:30:24.370
accurate result, although match score is 0.56, so which is

01:30:24.370 --> 01:30:27.130
not closer to one, but yeah, this

01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:33.660
is the most similar sentence which I'm able to get. Now if

01:30:33.660 --> 01:30:40.360
I'm going to ask who is Sudhanshu, let's see. So for who is

01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:47.560
Sudhanshu? The top score is a fourth index by the way. Yeah.

01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:50.900
So I believe it's a correct answer that I'm able to get. In

01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:54.440
my fourth sentence, this is something which was mentioned by

01:30:54.440 --> 01:31:00.180
the way, right everyone? Yeah. So we are able to get a

01:31:00.180 --> 01:31:02.480
desired result, I believe.

01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:11.140
So now if I have to ping you this code, yeah, so here is a

01:31:11.140 --> 01:31:16.500
code guys. Simple. So now I'm able to store the information

01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:20.340
and after storing the information, I'm able to even query

01:31:20.340 --> 01:31:23.880
the information and it looks like that I'm able to get the

01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:25.060
correct result.

01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:52.360
My output value are different since we have a same data,

01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:54.880
same model and pretty much the same code, should not our

01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:59.680
result be same. I think just try to check your chunk size by

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:03.480
the way and your overlap size. So if your chunk size is

01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:07.400
different, if your overlap size is different. And if it is

01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:10.400
like exactly same data, then obviously results should be

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:14.080
closer. Results should be closer, always be closer. If it is

01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:15.680
not, then obviously it will not.

01:32:33.870 --> 01:32:36.310
Okay. So someone is asking me a question that Farsi

01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:39.490
normalize L2 query embedding, please explain why we applied

01:32:39.490 --> 01:32:42.850
this one. Okay. So see when we are trying to call this

01:32:42.850 --> 01:32:48.770
normalized vector L2, right? So what it does, let me use a

01:32:48.770 --> 01:32:53.250
pen. So basically. Basically what it is trying to perform.

01:32:53.450 --> 01:32:57.750
So whatever vector that we have taken or whatever, yeah.

01:33:00.860 --> 01:33:04.180
So whatever vector that we have taken over here, so what it

01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:06.580
will try to do is that, that it will try to find out

01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:12.260
basically, let's suppose this is my vector X. So for this

01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:17.880
vector X, it will try to find out normalization of a vector

01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:22.000
X by the way, which is nothing but a summation of a X square

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:25.880
I. Okay. So this is going to return technically a one. So

01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:30.680
here it will try to normalize all the vector so that L2 or

01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:34.540
L2 norms so that the length of the vector is always going to

01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:39.480
be one. Means from a origin length is always going to be

01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:43.120
one. So this is the simple normalization technique that we

01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:46.920
try to apply so that all of this will come into a same

01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:51.580
length and then our similarity score calculation will be

01:33:51.580 --> 01:33:57.420
easy. Okay. Yeah. So this is what this index flat IP always

01:33:57.420 --> 01:34:01.960
try to do. So here when I have called, if you have observed,

01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:07.240
I have called basically index flat IP. Now what is the

01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:10.580
meaning of this IP by the way? So meaning of IP is nothing

01:34:10.580 --> 01:34:14.380
but a inner product search. So by default it is going to

01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:18.680
apply a dot product similarity search, which is nothing but

01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:22.280
a cos, cosine similarity search. It will be able to apply.

01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:30.400
If I'm going to call index flat IP, fine everyone, yeah. So

01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:32.960
by default it is going to find out the similarity search

01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:35.800
means dot product it is going to find out by the way.

01:34:47.790 --> 01:34:51.030
What was the VSTACK? It's a vertical stack. So it's simple

01:34:51.030 --> 01:34:53.650
NumPy formula. So where we are trying to flatten the data

01:34:53.650 --> 01:34:54.770
vertically.

01:35:05.860 --> 01:35:09.200
So let's suppose some of you have a query with respect to

01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:12.240
normalization. So let me show you with respect to a NumPy

01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:15.120
array. So let's suppose I'm going to consider a NumPy array.

01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:21.160
Over here and inside this array. So let me take one small

01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:26.400
data. Let's suppose we have a 4 comma 5 comma 6 comma 7

01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:29.540
comma 8. Something like this we have over here inside this

01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:35.520
NumPy array. Okay now so let's suppose I'm going to store it

01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:43.480
as a test data. Okay so as a test data over here. Now when

01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:48.780
I'm going to call. Basically a normalization on top of this

01:35:48.780 --> 01:35:52.060
data. First of all let me convert this data into a flat 32.

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:56.180
Yeah so flat 32. Now if I'm going to show you my test data.

01:35:56.340 --> 01:35:58.760
So this is how my test data set looks like. Yeah the test

01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:00.920
data set looks like. So after data there will be a floating

01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:05.520
point number. Now here if I'm going to call a normalization.

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:08.140
Right here if I'm going to call the normalization. So let's

01:36:08.140 --> 01:36:15.220
suppose NumPy dot lineage dot norm test. So it is given. It

01:36:15.220 --> 01:36:18.500
is giving basically 13.78. Something like this it is trying

01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:27.040
to give it to me. Now if I'm going to call fai ss ss dot

01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:32.680
normalize l2. And then if I'm going to pass my test data.

01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:42.940
What this will try to return. So here let me pass NumPy dot

01:36:42.940 --> 01:36:44.660
lineage

01:36:46.170 --> 01:36:52.950
dot norm test. Now it will come closer to 1. So this is the

01:36:52.950 --> 01:36:57.290
differences. So see I have taken one array. I had a random

01:36:57.290 --> 01:37:01.330
array even with respect to a vector. I have taken that. Now

01:37:01.330 --> 01:37:05.570
so if you are going to find out the norm. Means if you are

01:37:05.570 --> 01:37:11.990
going to find out this one of this test. So what does this

01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:15.590
means. It simply means that that 4 square plus 5 square plus

01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:20.030
6 square plus 7 square. Plus 8 square. This is what it is

01:37:20.030 --> 01:37:22.750
going to return. Now this is something that it is trying to

01:37:22.750 --> 01:37:28.390
return. This is a norm. This is a norm. Now so when I am

01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:33.650
trying to apply a normalization with l2. l2 is nothing but a

01:37:33.650 --> 01:37:35.910
regularization technique. So when I am trying to call

01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:39.570
normalization with respect to a l2. So with regularization.

01:37:39.750 --> 01:37:43.490
So what it does is that it will. So here length is equal to

01:37:43.490 --> 01:37:48.170
13 for the same data. And here. So when I have called l2 on

01:37:48.170 --> 01:37:51.570
top of this one. So it has normalized each and every data

01:37:51.570 --> 01:37:57.770
set to a unit value. Only one. Right. Only one. So that

01:37:57.770 --> 01:38:00.730
whenever I am going to find out a cosine similarity. So as

01:38:00.730 --> 01:38:04.210
we know the formula right. Cosine similarity let's suppose.

01:38:04.390 --> 01:38:07.870
So cosine similarity is what. So vector a dot vector b

01:38:07.870 --> 01:38:14.670
divided by norm of vector a into norm of vector b. So what

01:38:14.670 --> 01:38:17.430
we are trying to say is that. That by normalizing let's make

01:38:17.430 --> 01:38:20.550
it one. Let's make it one. So technically we are nullifying

01:38:20.550 --> 01:38:25.470
the entire denominator. So your cosine similarity score you

01:38:25.470 --> 01:38:28.210
will be able to find out just by finding out the dot

01:38:28.210 --> 01:38:32.570
product. And this is what this IP is doing index. So Farsi

01:38:32.570 --> 01:38:35.070
index flat IP that we have called right from a Farsi

01:38:35.070 --> 01:38:39.490
database. If you remember. So we have called what. So we

01:38:39.490 --> 01:38:43.370
have technically called a library called as index flat IP.

01:38:43.630 --> 01:38:46.370
So. So technically what it is trying to do. So it is trying

01:38:46.370 --> 01:38:50.810
to calculate index flat IP inner product IP means inner

01:38:50.810 --> 01:38:54.090
product. So it is just trying to calculate a cross a dot b.

01:38:54.290 --> 01:38:57.370
It is not supposed to calculate the denominator one reason

01:38:57.370 --> 01:39:00.230
is very simple. So we have already normalized it normalized

01:39:00.230 --> 01:39:04.050
it means your denominator is always one right. Your

01:39:04.050 --> 01:39:07.350
denominator is always one for any vector right for any

01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:10.110
vector you are going to pass after normalization if you are

01:39:10.110 --> 01:39:13.710
going to calculate the norm. So. So after this L2 right if

01:39:13.710 --> 01:39:16.350
you are going to calculate the norms it will be one. This is

01:39:16.350 --> 01:39:20.070
one by the way. So it will be basically one. So one into one

01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:23.370
is going to be one. Something divided by one is not going to

01:39:23.370 --> 01:39:26.470
affect anything right. So this is the reason we are trying

01:39:26.470 --> 01:39:30.310
to call the normalization over here. And this is the this is

01:39:30.310 --> 01:39:33.430
how basically this flat IP is going to work. So technically

01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:39.330
it calculates just a inner product IP a dot b it is going to

01:39:39.330 --> 01:39:43.050
calculate. So. So this part is fine guys inner inner flat IP

01:39:43.050 --> 01:39:47.070
is fine and why we are trying to call this L2 by the way

01:39:47.070 --> 01:39:49.270
that is also fine yeah

01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:55.900
why we are doing it because we are we are just converting

01:39:55.900 --> 01:39:58.780
this denominator into one so that it is not going to affect

01:39:58.780 --> 01:40:02.160
it and index flat IP by default it is going to calculate the

01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:06.980
dot of it. That was the whole idea. This is how this library

01:40:06.980 --> 01:40:08.140
has been built by the way.

01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:15.820
Okay. So now we are able to do a query. And we are able to

01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:19.300
even store the information. Plus we are able to find out a

01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:22.840
best one with respect to my query. So which is going to be

01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:25.060
the best one. So now you can do a python mapping python

01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:27.560
mapping of this result with respect to the meta information

01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:30.940
and then you will be able to get the final result. That's

01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:34.720
cool. Now this is one of the data set by the way yeah this

01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:38.940
is one of the data set by the way. Now we have a lot of

01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:43.600
different different data set database. So quadrant is

01:40:49.300 --> 01:40:53.440
one of the database right. So quadrant vector database. We

01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:59.880
have and we have basically yes so quadrant tech you have to

01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:05.760
go to a quadrant tech. We have a pinecone by the way. So we

01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:14.430
have a pinecone. We have a quadrant. We have chroma DB this

01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:17.700
one and

01:41:38.140 --> 01:41:44.200
we have waviate yeah. So we have so many different different

01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:46.640
different different kind of her databases which is available

01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:51.540
in the same segment. Now some of this database is going to

01:41:51.540 --> 01:41:54.800
provide you even a managed hosting managed hosting means

01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:58.060
they have already hosted it over a cloud platform. You don't

01:41:58.060 --> 01:42:01.260
have to do anything. Just go ahead and then like do the

01:42:01.260 --> 01:42:04.840
installation and start storing your data set. So let's

01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:07.940
suppose I'm going ahead with the quadrant right. So except

01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:12.260
all cookies and let me ping you this link and this link will

01:42:12.260 --> 01:42:17.150
be available even inside your dashboard. So one by one. I'm

01:42:17.150 --> 01:42:20.470
pinging you. I'm going to give you a link of all of these

01:42:20.470 --> 01:42:20.850
databases.

01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:27.220
Yeah. So let's go ahead with the quadrant first. Now I can

01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:31.540
try to click on login and it should provide me a Google

01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:34.740
login by the way plus my free credit again.

01:42:37.390 --> 01:42:41.070
So I'll just try to do a Google login by the way with

01:42:41.070 --> 01:42:43.110
respect to a quadrant allow

01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:46.620
and

01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:52.250
this is a quadrant dashboard. You will be able to find out

01:42:52.250 --> 01:42:54.810
very easy to log in. Don't have to create the account or

01:42:54.810 --> 01:42:57.930
anything. So it's simple. Click on login and go ahead with

01:42:57.930 --> 01:43:00.770
the Google login and you all will be able to log in inside

01:43:00.770 --> 01:43:03.790
the quadrant. It's a very very simple like you know system

01:43:03.790 --> 01:43:07.390
that people have given to you. So where you can come and you

01:43:07.390 --> 01:43:11.790
can try to you know spin a machine. Basically it will be a

01:43:11.790 --> 01:43:14.250
shared machine. You can go ahead with a dedicated machine as

01:43:14.250 --> 01:43:17.230
well if you are going to pay a bills for that. But if you

01:43:17.230 --> 01:43:19.170
don't want to pay a bills if you are just coming here for

01:43:19.170 --> 01:43:21.810
the experimentation for learning purposes then they are

01:43:21.810 --> 01:43:24.890
providing you enough. So let's suppose. Here I'll go and try

01:43:24.890 --> 01:43:31.230
to create a cluster right. So you're on a vector a DB right

01:43:31.230 --> 01:43:34.830
vector DB. So by default they're giving you one node and

01:43:34.830 --> 01:43:38.190
four GB of a disk space one gigabyte of the RAM and then

01:43:38.190 --> 01:43:41.770
half of the virtual core CPU they're giving it to you plus

01:43:41.770 --> 01:43:44.290
they're giving you AWS and Google Cloud Platform integration

01:43:44.290 --> 01:43:47.290
and into a multiple location. So if you are into a free

01:43:47.290 --> 01:43:50.410
cluster if you will go with a willing then obviously feature

01:43:50.410 --> 01:43:52.870
will be more and they have already listed on a feature over

01:43:52.870 --> 01:43:55.790
here. So first of all whenever you will come inside a

01:43:55.790 --> 01:43:58.790
quadrant you have to create a cluster. So just give a name

01:43:58.790 --> 01:44:01.570
over here any name x y g you can try to give and then click

01:44:01.570 --> 01:44:05.010
on create a free cluster. It will take maybe like a two

01:44:05.010 --> 01:44:10.190
three minute of time not more than that. And here so it is

01:44:10.190 --> 01:44:13.650
giving you a API key. So please make sure that you are

01:44:13.650 --> 01:44:17.850
saving this API key somewhere fine. And it is going to give

01:44:17.850 --> 01:44:21.330
you even a sample Python code by the way. Right. Sample

01:44:21.330 --> 01:44:24.730
Python code. So. So in Python code there is nothing just a

01:44:24.730 --> 01:44:27.990
URL just an end point they have given to you and they have

01:44:27.990 --> 01:44:32.190
attached your API key so that you will be able to hit their

01:44:32.190 --> 01:44:36.330
instance. You will be able to hit their services as simple

01:44:36.330 --> 01:44:39.930
as that. And that's the reason we have discussed about API

01:44:39.930 --> 01:44:42.690
key in a very beginning because again and again you will see

01:44:42.690 --> 01:44:46.190
that we are using some of the services and over there people

01:44:46.190 --> 01:44:49.750
have exposed their entire services as an API key with API

01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:53.790
key by the way. Yeah. So maybe I can try to like a copy. Let

01:44:53.790 --> 01:44:55.750
me copy this one and I can try to keep it somewhere inside

01:44:55.750 --> 01:45:00.590
my system. So let me create a new file and let me name it as

01:45:00.590 --> 01:45:08.510
a qdrant quadrant dot i p y n b and create a code. I am

01:45:08.510 --> 01:45:11.190
keeping each and everything over here. I have copied this

01:45:11.190 --> 01:45:14.850
quadrant client by which I will be able to establish the

01:45:14.850 --> 01:45:18.950
connection between my system and a quadrant system. So let

01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:22.430
me select the kernel same kernel I am going to select store

01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:28.650
it. Yeah. So keep it and then close it as simple as that and

01:45:28.650 --> 01:45:33.010
here now I can see that my instance is ready. My cluster is

01:45:33.010 --> 01:45:36.590
ready. Right. My cluster is ready. So this is my end point

01:45:36.590 --> 01:45:39.610
that they have given to me. This is just a cluster ID which

01:45:39.610 --> 01:45:42.630
has been given to me. These are the cluster like resources

01:45:42.630 --> 01:45:48.350
which they have given me my free instance by the way and

01:45:48.350 --> 01:45:52.170
yeah rest of the things are completely fine access the

01:45:52.170 --> 01:45:55.790
cluster. So I can try to click and again they are going to

01:45:55.790 --> 01:45:57.970
give me the sample code by which I will be able to access

01:45:57.970 --> 01:46:05.670
the cluster and this is something which is a UI right which

01:46:05.670 --> 01:46:08.830
is a UI click start like you can you can try to like you

01:46:08.830 --> 01:46:12.270
know do each and everything from here itself kind of a

01:46:12.270 --> 01:46:15.090
things right. So from their UI itself you will be able to

01:46:15.090 --> 01:46:19.690
perform all of these operations. So here let's suppose this

01:46:19.690 --> 01:46:25.170
is my cluster. This is my database right and I have to send

01:46:25.170 --> 01:46:30.450
a data I have to store a data here. So how I will be able to

01:46:30.450 --> 01:46:35.990
store a data over here. Let's try to understand. So are you

01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:37.970
are you able to log in guys are you able to create your API

01:46:37.970 --> 01:46:41.870
keys and are you able to get your end point everything yes

01:46:44.590 --> 01:46:45.830
yeah

01:46:51.780 --> 01:46:56.740
cluster means machine yeah set of machine by the way cluster

01:46:56.740 --> 01:46:58.740
means multiple machines coming together.

01:47:12.090 --> 01:47:16.830
Fine. So a very simple configuration as we can see right a

01:47:16.830 --> 01:47:19.910
very very simple configuration and now what we can do is

01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:24.570
that that we can try to store the information one by one

01:47:24.570 --> 01:47:25.730
okay.

01:47:40.610 --> 01:47:45.250
So let's start with guys. So first of all go to your vs code

01:47:45.250 --> 01:47:49.730
and try to create a new tab and here so you have to install

01:47:49.730 --> 01:47:52.490
a quadrant client. So unless and until you are not going to

01:47:52.490 --> 01:47:55.830
install a quadrant client it will not be able to understand.

01:47:55.970 --> 01:47:58.990
So this one by the way. So this one we have to install so

01:47:58.990 --> 01:48:03.910
pip install quadrant client execute it and I am pinging you

01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:07.150
the same inside your chat. So pip install quadrant client so

01:48:07.150 --> 01:48:13.310
I need a compatible library right and once this is done the

01:48:13.310 --> 01:48:16.250
code which I have copy and pasted technically which was a

01:48:16.250 --> 01:48:21.810
URL and API key just executed just executed and it will try

01:48:21.810 --> 01:48:25.530
to check the connection. So here collection is equals to

01:48:25.530 --> 01:48:29.070
blank. Which means I am able to establish the communication.

01:48:29.570 --> 01:48:32.490
Maybe I can try to even print just a quadrant client

01:48:32.490 --> 01:48:37.010
variable and here so it is giving me some hexadecimal code

01:48:37.010 --> 01:48:39.710
it simply means that I am able to establish the

01:48:39.710 --> 01:48:42.770
communication yeah I am able to establish the communication

01:48:42.770 --> 01:48:47.290
now. So once this is done once you are able to establish the

01:48:47.290 --> 01:48:51.530
communication now we can try to store the information a

01:48:51.530 --> 01:48:54.870
similar information that we have like a prepared before

01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:58.970
right. So that we have prepared before into this quadrant

01:48:58.970 --> 01:49:03.330
one which is available in some of the cloud platform fine

01:49:06.780 --> 01:49:09.200
shall we do it guys everyone yes

01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:20.660
okay very easy. So now we are not doing it in a local system

01:49:20.660 --> 01:49:23.800
so now we are going to do it everything on a global system

01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:26.840
yeah. So in a cloud system basically so our data will

01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:30.260
directly go inside the cloud system. So here whenever you

01:49:30.260 --> 01:49:32.300
are going to store some sort of information inside the

01:49:32.300 --> 01:49:34.760
quadrant so first of all let's try to create the collection

01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:39.640
name. C-O-L-L-E-C-T-I-O-N collection underscore name and I

01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:42.180
am going to give a collection name is equal to sthanshu

01:49:42.180 --> 01:49:45.020
underscore s-t-o-r-y story. So this is the collection name

01:49:45.020 --> 01:49:48.260
which I am going to give so means a table right you give a

01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:50.700
table name so similarly I am just trying to give a

01:49:50.700 --> 01:49:56.140
collection name over here nothing much yeah nothing much at

01:49:56.140 --> 01:49:59.880
all. Now here so I am going to call my quadrant client

01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:05.340
quadrant client this one that we have created. Right this

01:50:05.340 --> 01:50:08.720
quadrant client because this is my starting point right this

01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:13.100
is the point where I will be able to communicate from my

01:50:13.100 --> 01:50:16.300
local system to the quadrant system. So quadrant client I am

01:50:16.300 --> 01:50:21.840
going to call and quadrant client dot I can try to say

01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:26.920
recreate collection. So recreate collection is a method

01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:31.180
which is already available and then here so we can try to

01:50:31.180 --> 01:50:33.540
give a collection name. So collection name is equal to

01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:36.440
sthanshu s-t-o-r-y. So fine we are trying to give that's

01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:40.100
cool. Now once we are able to give a collection name over

01:50:40.100 --> 01:50:43.720
here we can try to set a vector configuration. So vector

01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:46.180
configuration is nothing but the data that we are going to

01:50:46.180 --> 01:50:50.180
store by the way right the data that we are going to store

01:50:50.180 --> 01:50:52.240
so that is something we have to give as a vector

01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:57.900
configuration. So here vector configuration wise we have to

01:50:57.900 --> 01:51:02.960
let me check its latest syntax.

01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:14.740
Okay. So latest syntax is basically mode models

01:51:18.510 --> 01:51:24.790
dot vector parameter okay. So vector configuration wise

01:51:24.790 --> 01:51:26.910
model dot vector parameter is something that we have to call

01:51:27.530 --> 01:51:36.770
and then we have to okay let me import a model as it is not

01:51:36.770 --> 01:51:39.810
able to resolve the dependencies. So there is something

01:51:39.810 --> 01:51:43.610
called as models from quadrant

01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:50.240
client. Okay. So import models okay. So models dot vector

01:51:50.240 --> 01:51:53.440
parameter we have to give. So these syntaxes are already

01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:56.460
mentioned even inside the documentation. So again no need to

01:51:56.460 --> 01:51:58.980
remember the syntaxes even I don't remember it because there

01:51:58.980 --> 01:52:04.000
are like hundreds of such databases which is available. So

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:07.080
here it is just asking me quadrant client fine and I am

01:52:07.080 --> 01:52:09.520
giving collection name and then I am giving a vector

01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:12.680
parameter. So my vector size is basically 1536. So I have

01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:21.580
given that. And. Then I can try to give basically so after

01:52:21.580 --> 01:52:28.580
giving a size distance d i s t n c distance so model

01:52:28.580 --> 01:52:32.220
distance cosine. So whenever it is going to perform this

01:52:32.220 --> 01:52:37.000
operation so just go ahead with the cosine similarity. So

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:41.940
this is the collection I am going to create. Fine. So. So

01:52:41.940 --> 01:52:45.040
this is going to create a database kind of a things where

01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:47.880
collection name is going to be my story right and these are

01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:51.960
the parameter that okay. So inside this like table or you

01:52:51.960 --> 01:52:55.300
can say collections whatever data you are going to store

01:52:55.300 --> 01:52:59.220
size of the vector is going to be 1536 and whenever you are

01:52:59.220 --> 01:53:02.340
trying to perform the similarity search just try to use a

01:53:02.340 --> 01:53:05.220
cosine similarity search. Simple. This is what it means.

01:53:05.380 --> 01:53:10.420
Right. This is what it means. So. So once we are able to

01:53:10.420 --> 01:53:14.100
create this collection. So maybe we can go back and we can

01:53:14.100 --> 01:53:16.840
try to refresh and we can try to check.

01:53:28.740 --> 01:53:32.120
Yeah. So now you will be able to see your collection name.

01:53:32.260 --> 01:53:35.140
So once you will click on this cluster UI. So this is going

01:53:35.140 --> 01:53:38.120
to show you a UI for your own cluster right for your cluster

01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:41.260
that you have created and here so you will be able to see a

01:53:41.260 --> 01:53:44.580
collection name. Yeah. Collection name status is equal to

01:53:44.580 --> 01:53:49.280
green segment sharding is completely fine. And then size is

01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:54.720
name is default size is basically 1536 and distance is

01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:58.760
cosine means whatever data which I am going to insert into

01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:01.700
this collection it is going to follow this property. This is

01:54:01.700 --> 01:54:05.060
what it means by the way. Yeah. This is what it means. So

01:54:05.060 --> 01:54:11.260
making sense guys. Yeah. So as of now there is no graph

01:54:11.260 --> 01:54:15.360
which is available. That's fine. No need to data set

01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:18.300
collection. Yeah.

01:54:24.180 --> 01:54:27.660
A simple collection I have created fine. Now so once I am

01:54:27.660 --> 01:54:30.780
able to create the collection right once I am able to create

01:54:30.780 --> 01:54:34.560
the collection so I can try to store our data inside this

01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:37.700
one. Yeah I can try to store our data inside this particular

01:54:37.700 --> 01:54:41.300
collection. So let's go ahead. Let's try to store our data

01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:43.800
inside this collection because that is the next step for all

01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:50.240
of us by the way. Yeah. So let's try to upload our chunks

01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:55.260
with the embeddings. Yeah. Let's try to like upload a chunks

01:54:55.260 --> 01:55:00.120
with the embeddings. So here what I will do is that that

01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:01.940
let's

01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:06.580
try to prepare a data inside

01:55:09.910 --> 01:55:14.570
a something called as points list.

01:55:18.620 --> 01:55:24.760
Okay. So above code fine. So take it. This is actually a

01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:26.840
single line of a code. I have written it into multiple

01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:29.880
lines. So those who are getting confused. It's not

01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:31.600
confusing. It's not confusing at all. And this code is

01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:36.000
coming from a quadrant itself. So quadrant documentation

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.640
itself. So whenever you will try to create the collection so

01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:40.880
you have to give a collection name plus you have to give the

01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:44.200
configuration of that particular collection which is clearly

01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:49.500
visible right which is clearly visible over here inside the

01:55:49.500 --> 01:55:53.140
collection itself inside the collection. Yeah. So everything

01:55:53.140 --> 01:55:55.920
is clearly visible over here that whatever I have set. So

01:55:55.920 --> 01:55:59.560
all of these parameters are available in this place now. So.

01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:01.900
So let's try to prepare the data so that I can dump this

01:56:01.900 --> 01:56:04.380
data. So I'm going to prepare all of this data and I'm going

01:56:04.380 --> 01:56:08.320
to keep it inside a points list. Yeah. So that's the reason

01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:12.240
I've created a point as a blank list now here. So in terms

01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:17.880
of preparing a data set so for I in let's suppose I'm going

01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:23.380
to write enumerate and here so I'm going to provide a chip

01:56:23.380 --> 01:56:29.180
of basically CHU chunks. And I'm going to provide them. The

01:56:29.180 --> 01:56:34.020
embedding let's suppose and this I'm going to change it is

01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:40.220
going to return me IDX. Let's suppose means the ID and then

01:56:40.220 --> 01:56:42.500
it should return me chunk

01:56:46.780 --> 01:56:52.340
and embedding. Okay fine.

01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:04.320
So this is this is something which I'm going to take. So I'm

01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:07.460
going to take basically a chunks as you can see. And what is

01:57:07.460 --> 01:57:12.600
my chunks by the way. Hmm. My chunks is gone.

01:57:17.340 --> 01:57:22.360
Let me see chunks is my meta by the way sorry I was

01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:24.540
wondering that I'm doing the same thing in the same file.

01:57:24.940 --> 01:57:28.340
Okay. Leave it. I have to create it once again. This is a

01:57:28.340 --> 01:57:32.260
separate file I have created right. So let me create my

01:57:32.260 --> 01:57:32.780
chunks guys.

01:57:36.710 --> 01:57:41.370
I have to do it once again. Copy my data.

01:57:48.260 --> 01:57:52.420
Same code I have to write.

01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:04.840
So here.

01:58:08.260 --> 01:58:13.040
Data. Data. Fine.

01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:36.280
Let me keep it like 300 and 100 of overlap.

01:58:39.510 --> 01:58:41.290
Same as before by the way.

01:58:44.840 --> 01:58:47.880
So fine guys do it once again in this file. So whatever we

01:58:47.880 --> 01:58:51.080
have done in terms of preparing the data right. So I'm just

01:58:51.080 --> 01:58:53.300
doing it once again in this particular file because I have

01:58:53.300 --> 01:58:55.500
changed the file. So previous file was different. This file

01:58:55.500 --> 01:59:00.180
is different. So it's not available. I'm able to create a

01:59:00.180 --> 01:59:02.820
chunks. Now once I'm able to create the chunks. I have to

01:59:02.820 --> 01:59:07.980
convert this entire data into a embeddings. So after doing

01:59:07.980 --> 01:59:11.880
this I can try to copy the exact embedding code from here.

01:59:12.300 --> 01:59:17.880
So fine and then I'm going to call the embedding.

01:59:21.880 --> 01:59:28.700
Okay so it should be able to do a embedding and store it

01:59:28.700 --> 01:59:32.320
inside the maybe EMB list.

01:59:36.780 --> 01:59:39.100
Remove the embedding. Remove everything not required.

01:59:40.820 --> 01:59:42.780
Generate embedding of

01:59:45.250 --> 01:59:47.310
IEMB

01:59:50.570 --> 01:59:52.750
.append okay.

01:59:57.840 --> 02:00:06.060
What happened to key error data. I have not even written a

02:00:06.060 --> 02:00:07.940
data enumeration

02:00:17.020 --> 02:00:18.020
we have to remove.

02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:27.460
Yeah. So I'm just trying to convert chunk is available to

02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:30.200
me. Now I'm converting my entire data set into a embeddings.

02:00:30.580 --> 02:00:36.040
So simple like the previous step. So now embedding is

02:00:36.040 --> 02:00:39.340
available to me. Yeah embedding is available to me as you

02:00:39.340 --> 02:00:43.760
can see. Now I have to like you know convert this entire

02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:48.340
list because this is the list. So this operation we have

02:00:48.340 --> 02:00:50.680
done right this

02:00:56.630 --> 02:00:59.530
operation we have done. So same kind of operation we can try

02:00:59.530 --> 02:01:02.610
to perform even over here so that I will be able to convert

02:01:02.610 --> 02:01:11.430
my entire data into a compatible one. So here. For item

02:01:12.900 --> 02:01:18.060
in I can write embedding data or

02:01:26.380 --> 02:01:32.520
just try to call numpy dot array embedding list.

02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:41.910
Yeah. So now it's converted.

02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:52.840
So this is the data guys we have prepared even last time

02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:55.280
right exact same data we have to prepare even this

02:01:55.280 --> 02:01:59.940
particular time. So our embedding is ready and our chunk is

02:01:59.940 --> 02:02:02.800
ready. These two things are ready and for embedding. So I'm

02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:05.700
using here you can try to use any of the other API that's

02:02:05.700 --> 02:02:08.780
completely fine. So let me ping you this code. This code is

02:02:08.780 --> 02:02:11.500
nothing different. This code is same that I have used even

02:02:11.500 --> 02:02:16.420
in my previous example. So once my embedding is available

02:02:16.420 --> 02:02:20.780
now what I will do. So now I'm good to like a go ahead with

02:02:20.780 --> 02:02:25.720
my data dump inside a quadrant. So let's go ahead and let's

02:02:25.720 --> 02:02:29.260
try to do the data dump inside the quadrant not to do a data

02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:32.520
dump inside a quadrant. So let's suppose I'm going to

02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:34.700
prepare the data. So let's suppose there is a variable

02:02:34.700 --> 02:02:38.540
called as points variable a list where I'm going to keep all

02:02:38.540 --> 02:02:43.460
the prepared data and here. So inside this particular list

02:02:43.460 --> 02:02:50.540
I'm going to keep enumerate chunks. Let me remove this one

02:02:50.540 --> 02:02:57.980
zip of chunks and embeddings. Again remove autocompletion ID

02:02:57.980 --> 02:03:00.340
chunks and embed.

02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:12.790
Okay now so this is something that we are trying to do

02:03:12.790 --> 02:03:16.310
points.append means inside this list try to append append

02:03:16.310 --> 02:03:21.090
what so model.point structure. So try to append the ID. So

02:03:21.090 --> 02:03:23.590
we know that that for every record it is going to give me

02:03:23.590 --> 02:03:28.450
the ID. So just try to generate the ID then try to call

02:03:28.450 --> 02:03:33.010
embedding.as type flow 32 to a list. So this is going to be

02:03:33.010 --> 02:03:36.770
the vector and then here I'm trying to store even the meta

02:03:36.770 --> 02:03:41.270
information. Next time we have stored a meta information and

02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:44.130
we have stored the vector separately in the separate file.

02:03:44.270 --> 02:03:47.150
So here I'm trying to send a payload all together. So

02:03:47.150 --> 02:03:50.590
execute this one and now just try to check a points your

02:03:50.590 --> 02:03:53.930
points just try to check that one. So this is the data which

02:03:53.930 --> 02:03:57.330
I have ended up creating out of this point structure. So

02:03:57.330 --> 02:04:02.730
this is one data ID 0. This is the vector of this data and

02:04:02.730 --> 02:04:06.610
then if you will come this side you will be able to find out

02:04:06.610 --> 02:04:10.110
even a textual information. Okay. Let me copy this entire

02:04:10.110 --> 02:04:14.170
data set it's a two hues. So I will be able to show you that

02:04:14.170 --> 02:04:18.510
what is the data that we have prepared. So see this is the

02:04:18.510 --> 02:04:22.990
kind of a data set that we have technically prepared right.

02:04:23.050 --> 02:04:24.810
This is the kind of a data set that we have technically

02:04:24.810 --> 02:04:27.710
prepared over here and this is the data set that we are

02:04:27.710 --> 02:04:32.670
going to store it inside my vector databases along with the

02:04:32.670 --> 02:04:35.870
textual information along with this meta information as a

02:04:35.870 --> 02:04:40.310
payload as you can see right. My English data. So along with

02:04:40.310 --> 02:04:43.550
this payload along with this meta information. So here the

02:04:43.550 --> 02:04:47.810
code that we have written is nothing much by the way. So we

02:04:47.810 --> 02:04:50.910
are just preparing our data set which is completely visible

02:04:50.910 --> 02:04:53.870
to you. So once my data set has been prepared let me ping

02:04:53.870 --> 02:04:58.090
you this code right. Once my data set has been prepared now

02:04:58.090 --> 02:05:01.430
I am good to like a send this data to my quadrant to my

02:05:01.430 --> 02:05:06.290
cloud database. So here I can try to call simply quadrant

02:05:06.290 --> 02:05:11.790
client. Okay. So qdrant quadrant client and I can try to

02:05:11.790 --> 02:05:14.470
call absurd basically there is a function called as absurd

02:05:14.470 --> 02:05:18.750
inside a quadrant databases that these people have written

02:05:18.750 --> 02:05:22.170
and you have to mention a collection name. So in which

02:05:22.170 --> 02:05:24.610
collection you would like to absurd this data because there

02:05:24.610 --> 02:05:27.310
is a millions of collection you can try to create right

02:05:27.310 --> 02:05:29.670
millions of collection for the different purposes. So in

02:05:29.670 --> 02:05:33.890
which collection you have to absurd the data and then give

02:05:33.890 --> 02:05:39.090
me the data. So here the point. It is equals to points the

02:05:39.090 --> 02:05:42.350
data that we have prepared and now executed. So now it is

02:05:42.350 --> 02:05:45.670
sending all of my data right now it is sending all of my

02:05:45.670 --> 02:05:49.710
data to the quadrant. Now if I will go and check my cloud

02:05:49.710 --> 02:05:55.610
right. So here I am able to find out all the points. So

02:05:55.610 --> 02:06:00.770
point number 0 right. So this was my text by the way. This

02:06:00.770 --> 02:06:05.450
is basically like a vector length and here in between. So it

02:06:05.450 --> 02:06:09.830
is able to store the vector. Yeah. So this is the data again

02:06:09.830 --> 02:06:13.150
this is the data all of this data is been stored over here.

02:06:13.890 --> 02:06:15.870
Are you able to get it guys are you able to see it.

02:06:22.640 --> 02:06:23.000
Yeah

02:06:39.800 --> 02:06:40.160
fine.

02:06:43.540 --> 02:06:45.720
Is there any option to check the logs. Yeah everything you

02:06:45.720 --> 02:06:47.760
will be able to see it. So this is the standard like a

02:06:47.760 --> 02:06:50.640
portal that they have created. So where they are trying to

02:06:50.640 --> 02:06:53.420
like you know build more and more feature but even now so

02:06:53.420 --> 02:06:56.320
you will be able to see each and everything and again so you

02:06:56.320 --> 02:06:59.160
will be able to like see an option called as find similar.

02:06:59.280 --> 02:07:01.680
So if I am going to click over here. Find similar. Find

02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:04.940
similar with respect to ID 0. So with respect to ID like a 0

02:07:04.940 --> 02:07:08.600
there is some like similarity we have over here here here.

02:07:08.860 --> 02:07:12.100
So it is so you will be able to find the similarity even

02:07:12.100 --> 02:07:15.840
here itself and many more things right. So even with the

02:07:15.840 --> 02:07:18.240
help of code you will be able to do it even without the code

02:07:18.240 --> 02:07:22.640
you all will be able to do it. So this is the data that we

02:07:22.640 --> 02:07:26.900
are able to insert very simple right. So now my data set is

02:07:26.900 --> 02:07:30.460
available into a quadrant. Once data set is available into a

02:07:30.460 --> 02:07:34.820
quadrant. I can even try to do a query right. So one is to

02:07:34.820 --> 02:07:39.140
like send a data or store a data. Second is to query a data.

02:07:39.240 --> 02:07:42.480
So I can try to query even from here right. Even from here

02:07:42.480 --> 02:07:45.340
as you can see. So if I am going to ask like who is

02:07:45.340 --> 02:07:49.900
Sudhanshu. So what is a. Let me.

02:07:54.250 --> 02:07:57.470
Okay. So they are not giving you a direct options. They're

02:07:57.470 --> 02:08:02.990
giving you just ID or something but no. Who is Sudhanshu.

02:08:03.450 --> 02:08:05.690
Sudhanshu. Sudhanshu. No they are not giving you this query

02:08:05.690 --> 02:08:08.710
kind of option directly because they don't have embeddings

02:08:08.710 --> 02:08:10.790
right. So they will not be able to generate the embeddings.

02:08:11.030 --> 02:08:14.270
Let's do a query from a coding side itself. So let's suppose

02:08:14.270 --> 02:08:23.410
I have a query right query that who is fine. So this is the

02:08:23.410 --> 02:08:27.650
query that I have and I have to find out a similar kind of a

02:08:27.650 --> 02:08:30.310
record which is available into my quadrant the record which

02:08:30.310 --> 02:08:33.930
I have already sent. So again same process same procedure.

02:08:33.930 --> 02:08:38.090
We are going to follow. So first of all we'll try to embed

02:08:38.090 --> 02:08:44.050
this query by calling a generate embedding. So here I'm

02:08:44.050 --> 02:08:47.550
going to pass my query which is going to give me the

02:08:47.550 --> 02:08:49.070
embedding query.

02:08:52.310 --> 02:08:55.310
So this is going to generate embeddings for me. So once my

02:08:55.310 --> 02:09:00.630
embedding has been generated let me store it somewhere. So

02:09:00.630 --> 02:09:04.990
here query underscore response.

02:09:08.590 --> 02:09:14.890
Yeah. Now so once my response is available like once this

02:09:14.890 --> 02:09:18.650
particular response is available to me what I can do is that

02:09:18.650 --> 02:09:28.690
numpy dot numpy dot array and here so query response and dot

02:09:29.790 --> 02:09:38.110
as type float 32. OK. So I can try to call it as a query

02:09:40.100 --> 02:09:46.200
vector. OK. Anyhow it was available into a similar format.

02:09:46.740 --> 02:09:51.640
OK. So this is the data set which is available to me. Now I

02:09:51.640 --> 02:09:58.500
can try to call quadrant qd qd rant quadrant client dot

02:09:58.500 --> 02:10:00.540
search. So there is a search function they have already

02:10:00.540 --> 02:10:04.540
given to you. So you can try to like do a search operation

02:10:04.540 --> 02:10:07.800
over here. Now to do a search operation you have to give a

02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:10.100
collection name. So in which collection you are trying to

02:10:10.100 --> 02:10:12.620
search. So basically you are trying to search. Let's suppose

02:10:12.620 --> 02:10:16.760
into a story right. So that is a collection name. Maybe you

02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:20.900
can try to hard code it if you want. S U D H N S H U

02:10:20.900 --> 02:10:23.680
underscore H T O R Y. So the answer is story. So in this one

02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:29.060
you are trying to do the search and then you are trying to

02:10:29.060 --> 02:10:31.740
send this query vector. So this vector you are trying to

02:10:31.740 --> 02:10:35.820
send it with the search limit is equals to five with payload

02:10:35.820 --> 02:10:38.660
is equals to true means whenever it is like giving me a

02:10:38.660 --> 02:10:41.140
response give me a payload as well. Nice. So I am going to

02:10:41.140 --> 02:10:46.080
execute it and let's see. So top five I am looking for

02:10:46.080 --> 02:10:49.980
right. So who is Sudhanshu? That was my query. Who is

02:10:49.980 --> 02:10:53.540
Sudhanshu is my query. Okay that's cool. I am trying to

02:10:53.540 --> 02:10:56.740
search inside this collection Sudhanshu story and top five

02:10:56.740 --> 02:10:59.220
result. If I am looking for top three I can make it top

02:10:59.220 --> 02:11:02.080
three otherwise top five. This is the data which I am

02:11:02.080 --> 02:11:05.120
sending right and I am saying that that okay so just give me

02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:07.900
a return with a payload with payload means your textual

02:11:07.900 --> 02:11:10.620
information so that I can I can read it as a human being.

02:11:10.620 --> 02:11:15.320
Right. So here it is returning you the very first one as a

02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:18.920
ID six then ID four then ID five then ID three then ID one

02:11:18.920 --> 02:11:22.900
yeah ID one and here so you will be able to see a cosine

02:11:22.900 --> 02:11:26.380
similarity score as well. So with respect to my query who is

02:11:26.380 --> 02:11:30.200
Sudhanshu. So basically this ID six data set is more

02:11:30.200 --> 02:11:34.260
relevant. So here is a similarity score 54% of the

02:11:34.260 --> 02:11:39.340
similarity score and here is a line so you can you can just

02:11:39.340 --> 02:11:41.660
go ahead. You can try to even cross check this particular

02:11:41.660 --> 02:11:46.020
one. So we are able to store our data and we are able to

02:11:46.020 --> 02:11:49.780
even do a top K search on top of the data. Is it making

02:11:49.780 --> 02:11:53.020
sense guys to all of us. Yeah the quadrant.

02:11:58.490 --> 02:12:04.590
Yes. So similar to of FAISS I don't think that there is some

02:12:04.590 --> 02:12:06.550
differences much of differences right guys.

02:12:10.260 --> 02:12:14.640
Yeah right. So the only matter of fact is that that I am

02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:16.600
trying to use our data. So this is just a database which is

02:12:16.600 --> 02:12:19.400
available over a cloud. I am not doing any kind of a setup

02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:22.560
by the way in my local system and not going to do any kind

02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:25.540
of a setup. This database is already available over a cloud.

02:12:25.680 --> 02:12:29.040
So I have just like taken a URL and started sending a data

02:12:29.040 --> 02:12:32.460
as simple as that. And if I have to do some sort of a query

02:12:32.460 --> 02:12:35.780
I will be able to do a query and someone else is managing my

02:12:35.780 --> 02:12:40.080
entire database for me. We missed a normalization here. No.

02:12:40.160 --> 02:12:42.340
So here you don't have to go out with the normalization

02:12:42.340 --> 02:12:45.680
here. It is handling it by default. So when I have created

02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:48.100
my coordinate instances, I have already written cosine

02:12:48.100 --> 02:12:52.260
right, so it will be able to do a math automatically. So

02:12:52.260 --> 02:12:56.160
here we have written a cosine right, distance is cosine, so

02:12:56.160 --> 02:12:58.520
model distance is cosine, so by default it will be able to

02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:03.060
do this vector a dot vector b divided by norm of vector a

02:13:03.060 --> 02:13:06.280
vector b, which is ideally a formula of cosine, so it will

02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:07.240
be able to do it automatically.

02:13:10.450 --> 02:13:14.830
In case of FAISS, so there is a function which is like a

02:13:14.830 --> 02:13:18.910
flat, index flat IP, so it means inner product right, so

02:13:18.910 --> 02:13:20.750
that function has been designed in that way, that okay fine,

02:13:20.810 --> 02:13:23.170
so give me an inner product and if you would like to

02:13:23.170 --> 02:13:24.150
normalize it, normalize it.

02:13:31.930 --> 02:13:34.250
And now I am saying my question also but there was no

02:13:34.250 --> 02:13:37.850
response till now, so your database is not giving you a

02:13:37.850 --> 02:13:39.150
response, this is what you are trying to say,

02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:54.340
can we use something else in distances, yeah many thing

02:13:54.340 --> 02:13:57.520
actually, many thing we can use it in a distances, we can

02:13:57.520 --> 02:13:59.020
use it in a distances, which I will try to reveal in

02:13:59.020 --> 02:14:02.220
upcoming classes. Again there are multiple way to store the

02:14:02.220 --> 02:14:05.640
data, let's suppose my data record is in millions, so there

02:14:05.640 --> 02:14:09.720
is a concept called as cluster right, so we try to create a

02:14:09.720 --> 02:14:13.320
cluster and we try to you know give a centroid of the

02:14:13.320 --> 02:14:15.360
cluster and then with the help of centroid of the cluster,

02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:18.940
it will try to optimize the entire search operation. So

02:14:18.940 --> 02:14:21.520
there are so many things that you will be able to find out

02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:24.200
in terms of storing a data, in terms of performing a search

02:14:24.200 --> 02:14:27.500
with respect to the data. Which we will like, we will try to

02:14:27.500 --> 02:14:29.600
do. Let's keep on learning in our upcoming classes, there

02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:31.440
are so many things to learn, we have just started right,

02:14:49.390 --> 02:14:52.890
please paste the last line of code, don't worry I am going

02:14:52.890 --> 02:14:56.330
to send you anyhow the entire code, right, so this is the

02:14:56.330 --> 02:15:00.370
code guys, the last line of the code, yeah, which is like

02:15:00.370 --> 02:15:03.610
used for search. Now even if you will go and check this

02:15:03.610 --> 02:15:08.070
quadrant official documentation

02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:12.160
right, you will be able to find out the exact same thing,

02:15:24.490 --> 02:15:29.970
yeah and it's very easy by the way, right. So they have

02:15:29.970 --> 02:15:32.510
prepared the documentation and quite a information they have

02:15:32.510 --> 02:15:35.770
given inside this documentation that how they are doing it,

02:15:35.810 --> 02:15:38.970
what they are doing it, right. So step by step, step by step

02:15:38.970 --> 02:15:41.610
you will be able to find out but it's not different. So now

02:15:41.610 --> 02:15:44.670
if you will go ahead with the documentation, you will be

02:15:44.670 --> 02:15:47.890
able to find out that it's like very simple and I am able to

02:15:47.890 --> 02:15:50.830
do it because now you are in a position where you are able

02:15:50.830 --> 02:15:54.150
to understand each and everything, yeah and the core logic,

02:15:54.190 --> 02:15:58.790
core concept if you are able to understand. Yeah. So this is

02:15:58.790 --> 02:16:01.230
not going to be difficult at all, not just this one, I would

02:16:01.230 --> 02:16:03.890
say it doesn't matter which one you are going to pick and

02:16:03.890 --> 02:16:08.130
choose, everyone will look like the same. So in my upcoming

02:16:08.130 --> 02:16:10.650
classes obviously I will be talking about a pine cone, I

02:16:10.650 --> 02:16:13.570
will be talking about a chroma DB, I will be talking about a

02:16:13.570 --> 02:16:17.070
waviate by the way and all of these operations around these

02:16:17.070 --> 02:16:21.490
databases plus we will try to attach this databases with a

02:16:21.490 --> 02:16:25.890
complete data cleaning and data pre-processing pipeline.

02:16:26.290 --> 02:16:30.370
Because I believe somewhere. So somewhere like when we try

02:16:30.370 --> 02:16:35.010
to learn these things right, so somewhere we missed out this

02:16:35.010 --> 02:16:38.530
entire data pipeline which is a core thing, which is a core

02:16:38.530 --> 02:16:41.770
thing for any kind of a project that you are going to build

02:16:41.770 --> 02:16:44.770
across the industry. So going forward in my upcoming

02:16:44.770 --> 02:16:47.950
classes, we will try to establish the complete pipeline end

02:16:47.950 --> 02:16:51.130
to end right with respect to a different variety of the

02:16:51.130 --> 02:16:53.510
data. So maybe we will try to ingest some of the data from

02:16:53.510 --> 02:16:57.190
S3 bucket, some data we will try to consider it from. Maybe

02:16:57.190 --> 02:17:02.310
like a PDF basically PDF file or maybe a Word document,

02:17:02.610 --> 02:17:05.250
maybe from an Excel sheet. So means variety of the data

02:17:05.250 --> 02:17:08.010
sources we are going to consider, not just one right. So

02:17:08.010 --> 02:17:10.670
variety of the data sources we are going to consider, we

02:17:10.670 --> 02:17:12.730
will try to pull those data, build the entire pipeline,

02:17:12.890 --> 02:17:16.170
clean those data, then convert those data into embeddings

02:17:16.170 --> 02:17:20.970
and we will try maybe at least a 10,000 plus records right.

02:17:21.490 --> 02:17:24.770
Then you will be able to see the real game with four or five

02:17:24.770 --> 02:17:27.190
data sets you will not be able to see the real game. It's

02:17:27.190 --> 02:17:28.150
just for the learning purposes.

02:17:35.740 --> 02:17:38.800
So does all of this that we studied also comes in data

02:17:38.800 --> 02:17:42.140
analysis, data science, everything actually everything. See

02:17:42.140 --> 02:17:47.840
there is no like a line in between our concepts, right. This

02:17:47.840 --> 02:17:50.980
doesn't come inside this one or that one when we are the

02:17:50.980 --> 02:17:54.980
part of industry, right. So it doesn't matter what we know,

02:17:55.040 --> 02:17:58.660
what we don't know now always like a matters only one thing

02:17:58.660 --> 02:18:01.420
that that whether we are able to solve our current problem

02:18:01.420 --> 02:18:06.910
in a best possible manner or not. So fine guys with this,

02:18:06.950 --> 02:18:10.490
I'm done with today's class by the way. Yeah. So next class

02:18:10.490 --> 02:18:14.930
we are going to have not next weekend, but next to next

02:18:14.930 --> 02:18:17.110
weekend because I have already made announcement multiple

02:18:17.110 --> 02:18:22.730
times since last week that next week on 23rd and 24th,

02:18:22.730 --> 02:18:27.370
right. So next week, 23rd and 24th, I will be on leave. I

02:18:27.370 --> 02:18:31.870
have already made an announcement, uh, yesterday, even a

02:18:31.870 --> 02:18:34.710
last week, Sunday, I have made an announcement. Okay. And

02:18:34.710 --> 02:18:37.290
again, I'm going to make an announcement inside your group.

02:18:37.370 --> 02:18:39.290
I have already made an announcement. I believe one time in a

02:18:39.290 --> 02:18:42.130
group, but yeah, I'll make an announcement once again. So

02:18:42.130 --> 02:18:45.230
next week I'm not available, uh, next weekend, Saturday and

02:18:45.230 --> 02:18:47.470
Sunday, I'm not available. So there is no class next

02:18:47.470 --> 02:18:52.070
weekend. You can plan accordingly and, uh, thanks to next

02:18:52.070 --> 02:18:55.690
week. So once we are going to be back, we will start from

02:18:55.690 --> 02:18:59.250
the same place where we are leaving. And by the time I'm

02:18:59.250 --> 02:19:02.550
going to upload a recording, I am going to send even an

02:19:02.550 --> 02:19:05.070
assignment. Okay. So I'm going to upload our assignment so

02:19:05.070 --> 02:19:08.450
that you can try to solve a couple of quotients from those

02:19:08.450 --> 02:19:11.150
assignments. Some of the use cases you can try to explore.

02:19:11.410 --> 02:19:15.670
Plus I'll try to attach some of the research driven things

02:19:15.670 --> 02:19:18.330
as well so that you can, you can go ahead and you can try to

02:19:18.330 --> 02:19:21.250
do some sort of research around a learning that we are

02:19:21.250 --> 02:19:27.030
trying to do. Yeah. Fine guys. And yes. Uh, so we are going

02:19:27.030 --> 02:19:30.090
to start our interview series. So once I will be back from a

02:19:30.090 --> 02:19:33.830
vacation. So we are going to start with that. Uh, interview

02:19:33.830 --> 02:19:36.630
series. So anyone who will be interested in an interview

02:19:36.630 --> 02:19:39.010
series, so please come and join that interview series. It is

02:19:39.010 --> 02:19:41.690
going to be very much interesting. I'm not going to discuss

02:19:41.690 --> 02:19:44.570
any topic in depth at all. It will be a question answering

02:19:44.570 --> 02:19:47.130
kind of around and a lot of storytelling with respect to a

02:19:47.130 --> 02:19:50.050
project, a lot of storytelling with respect to resume and

02:19:50.050 --> 02:19:54.150
interview and white boarding by the way. Yeah. But no core

02:19:54.150 --> 02:19:56.830
concept. The way I used to discuss a core concept into my

02:19:56.830 --> 02:20:00.510
lectures, regular lectures. So interview series is not going

02:20:00.510 --> 02:20:03.190
to happen in that way. Interview means only interview

02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:06.110
pattern. We are going to follow. Yeah. From every aspect.

02:20:06.290 --> 02:20:09.250
But it is, it will be amazing one. It will be amazing one

02:20:09.250 --> 02:20:11.710
and all of you are going to like it. So that is going to

02:20:11.710 --> 02:20:15.170
start from like a 25th of August. Yesterday we have made an

02:20:15.170 --> 02:20:18.670
announcement for full stack bed development as well. And

02:20:18.670 --> 02:20:22.110
there is a data structure algorithm which we are starting.

02:20:22.290 --> 02:20:25.830
So this batch will be taken care by Ram Indra. Ram Indra is,

02:20:25.970 --> 02:20:28.290
I think I have already discussed in my today's class I

02:20:28.290 --> 02:20:31.570
believe, but yeah, let me repeat it once again. So he's a

02:20:31.570 --> 02:20:34.850
very nice guy, an IT grad and then he's going to join Google

02:20:34.850 --> 02:20:38.290
next month itself. He has already cracked a Google and he's

02:20:38.290 --> 02:20:41.930
having like a lot of experiences in data science, ML, AI,

02:20:42.030 --> 02:20:46.890
NLP and again programming languages and data structure

02:20:46.890 --> 02:20:50.410
algorithm by default and system design by default. So he's

02:20:50.410 --> 02:20:53.750
one of the great person and he's going to start his class

02:20:53.750 --> 02:20:57.650
from 14th of September. So we have a month of time. Those

02:20:57.650 --> 02:20:59.690
who would like to learn data structure algorithm, Python,

02:20:59.790 --> 02:21:03.350
Python, Python, Python, you can go ahead with this and a

02:21:03.350 --> 02:21:06.110
full stack bed development. So this we are starting in

02:21:06.110 --> 02:21:09.290
Hindi. So lectures we are going to deliver in Hindi as of

02:21:09.290 --> 02:21:12.410
now again. So lecture will be delivered by a mentor called

02:21:12.410 --> 02:21:16.770
as Ajay. Amazing guy. He's having a complete hands on. He is

02:21:16.770 --> 02:21:20.570
still working in a project with a different company and as a

02:21:20.570 --> 02:21:23.490
full time and then as a part time. So he's going to dedicate

02:21:23.490 --> 02:21:27.730
his Saturday and Sunday with Euron and he's going to deliver

02:21:27.730 --> 02:21:31.750
a lecture for entire full stack. Okay. And development and

02:21:31.750 --> 02:21:34.450
that too in a modern way with AI and by coding and

02:21:34.450 --> 02:21:37.590
everything. So this is something that he is going to

02:21:37.590 --> 02:21:41.550
deliver. So if anyone is interested and that too in Hindi,

02:21:41.670 --> 02:21:43.870
right? So this lecture is going to happen in Hindi. So you

02:21:43.870 --> 02:21:46.570
can come and join this particular lecture. That's the

02:21:46.570 --> 02:21:49.750
reason. So we recommend everyone as a Euron plus. So if you

02:21:49.750 --> 02:21:52.310
have a Euron plus, we'll keep on launching a multiple things

02:21:52.310 --> 02:21:57.290
and you can join any of those live batches. So just a

02:21:57.290 --> 02:22:02.430
announcement for all of you. Okay. So what he will teach who

02:22:02.430 --> 02:22:04.890
Ajay or Ramendra can

02:22:09.560 --> 02:22:11.800
we pull the data from the conference page and create the

02:22:11.800 --> 02:22:13.500
search tool? Yes. Obviously we can do it.

02:22:16.860 --> 02:22:19.540
So L2 that you have mentioned today is similar to the L2

02:22:19.540 --> 02:22:25.700
that we had in ML algorithm or formula wise it's not same

02:22:25.700 --> 02:22:26.160
actually.

02:22:29.420 --> 02:22:32.960
Why not English? I mean like there are demand from the

02:22:32.960 --> 02:22:35.440
people. So we have decided to go ahead with one batch in

02:22:35.440 --> 02:22:37.840
Hindi. We have like a English in three different different

02:22:37.840 --> 02:22:41.860
batches. Right? In future we'll try to bring it in English

02:22:41.860 --> 02:22:48.920
as well. Do we have any content or bootcamp on PySpark? Not

02:22:48.920 --> 02:22:51.840
now. So there is a batch. I'm trying to prepare the content

02:22:51.840 --> 02:22:54.460
for that one. Once it will be done, then it will be

02:22:54.460 --> 02:22:56.340
available. But as of now, no.

02:22:58.860 --> 02:23:02.740
Can we send me the whole code for the quadrant? Yeah. So I'm

02:23:02.740 --> 02:23:06.220
going to upload this code. Once I'm going to upload this

02:23:06.220 --> 02:23:09.800
recording, right, that will be available in next like a

02:23:09.800 --> 02:23:12.700
three to four hour itself. Inside your dashboard. So you

02:23:12.700 --> 02:23:15.160
will be able to download this code and you will be able to,

02:23:15.220 --> 02:23:17.720
you know, do the experimentation. I'll upload it. I'll

02:23:17.720 --> 02:23:19.700
upload everything. I'll upload even the assignment for you

02:23:19.700 --> 02:23:20.220
today.

02:23:26.230 --> 02:23:29.570
Data science is in Hindi. Let's see. If we get time, it will

02:23:29.570 --> 02:23:35.510
come. Okay. Fine guys. So let's take a break for three to

02:23:35.510 --> 02:23:38.970
four minutes and after a break, so we are going to start a

02:23:38.970 --> 02:23:41.170
doubt clearing. So those who is having any kind of a doubt,

02:23:41.230 --> 02:23:44.150
those who would like to share their screen, they can share

02:23:44.150 --> 02:23:47.370
their screen. And then one more thing guys. So I was. I'm

02:23:47.370 --> 02:23:51.650
just, just a suggestion. I mean like just a regular, not a

02:23:51.650 --> 02:23:54.630
regular discussion, I would say just some sort of a out of

02:23:54.630 --> 02:23:58.410
the box discussion. So how about starting a young neuron,

02:23:58.590 --> 02:24:01.890
young neuron means where we can teach AI and data science

02:24:01.890 --> 02:24:05.190
and better development and all those technological stuff to

02:24:05.190 --> 02:24:09.350
our kids. What about that? What is your perspective? I'm

02:24:09.350 --> 02:24:12.970
just trying to understand the perspective, by the way, from

02:24:12.970 --> 02:24:17.350
the larger audience. Yeah. Yeah. So what do you feel? I

02:24:17.350 --> 02:24:20.230
think it's required because see, uh, three, four year

02:24:20.230 --> 02:24:24.250
situation was different, right? Uh, since a very, very young

02:24:24.250 --> 02:24:27.170
age, uh, if you are not very much inclined towards the

02:24:27.170 --> 02:24:30.210
technology or programming and all those things, but I

02:24:30.210 --> 02:24:34.350
believe in an age of AI. So when AI is becoming a mainstream

02:24:34.350 --> 02:24:37.570
game, even in the schools and colleges, mostly let's talk

02:24:37.570 --> 02:24:40.010
about schools, right? So I have seen that people have

02:24:40.010 --> 02:24:42.930
started using AI to do a multiple things, right? They're

02:24:42.930 --> 02:24:45.930
starting from teachers to our students. And, uh, again, AI,

02:24:46.170 --> 02:24:49.470
uh, for example, let's take an example of property. So they

02:24:49.470 --> 02:24:52.510
have like a made AI available to everyone who is having a

02:24:52.510 --> 02:24:55.570
AIDA subscription, right? And a day for a study, even for

02:24:55.570 --> 02:24:58.030
India. So they have released a dashboard. So where you can

02:24:58.030 --> 02:25:01.190
do all the financial analysis, right. Of the data. So I

02:25:01.190 --> 02:25:06.190
think AI, uh, even for our kids, it's becoming a mainstream.

02:25:06.490 --> 02:25:10.750
So keeping that in a mind, I'm thinking of, you know, uh, AI

02:25:10.750 --> 02:25:14.050
included in the syllabus. Yeah. So, uh, UAE it's included

02:25:14.050 --> 02:25:17.370
China. They have made it mandatory, right. Even for our kids

02:25:17.370 --> 02:25:19.910
of sixth grade. So they are supposed to learn AI and they

02:25:19.910 --> 02:25:23.750
have to do the implementation USA. So I think couple of

02:25:23.750 --> 02:25:27.830
like, uh, weeks or months back, uh, there was, uh, uh, rule,

02:25:27.970 --> 02:25:30.190
which has been passed and a presidential order, which has

02:25:30.190 --> 02:25:34.150
been passed where they have made it mandatory, but yeah, in

02:25:34.150 --> 02:25:36.590
India. So they have not made it mandatory. So this is where

02:25:36.590 --> 02:25:39.530
this Edutech segment comes into a picture. I think we have

02:25:39.530 --> 02:25:43.730
to do something. Hardly teachers of the primary education

02:25:43.730 --> 02:25:47.350
was about AI. Believe me, go to a college. You will see a

02:25:47.350 --> 02:25:50.470
different reality. Hardly teachers in a college knows about

02:25:50.470 --> 02:25:54.530
AI. I mean like they know about AI, right. But I'm like,

02:25:54.650 --> 02:26:01.230
it's like, uh, on a very different level, the situation is

02:26:01.230 --> 02:26:06.750
not that great, um, in terms of education. Well, I think

02:26:06.750 --> 02:26:08.990
it's a good idea, right guys. Yeah. We should start a

02:26:08.990 --> 02:26:13.130
cohort. Basically. Cohort means live classes for our kids.

02:26:13.490 --> 02:26:16.590
Maybe like one hour, one hour, one hour, three hours a week

02:26:16.590 --> 02:26:20.610
kind of thing. Okay. So that was something because I was,

02:26:20.650 --> 02:26:24.230
uh, day before yesterday, so I was talking to my team. I was

02:26:24.230 --> 02:26:26.950
discussing with my team about the same thing that, okay, I

02:26:26.950 --> 02:26:28.950
think we have a capability. We have a platform, we have

02:26:28.950 --> 02:26:31.630
everything. So I think it's a, it's the right time for us

02:26:31.630 --> 02:26:35.890
to, you know, uh, touch that segment as well, because I

02:26:35.890 --> 02:26:39.490
think it's a need of an hour for most of us, even for our

02:26:39.490 --> 02:26:43.390
kids. Okay. And other countries are doing it. Even in India,

02:26:43.470 --> 02:26:46.090
there are some edutech platform who are trying to do the

02:26:46.090 --> 02:26:48.350
same thing, right. But there are very less, there are very

02:26:48.350 --> 02:26:51.290
less, maybe in next one year we'll be able to see more and

02:26:51.290 --> 02:26:54.870
more edutech platform. But I think we have a capability, so

02:26:54.870 --> 02:27:00.760
we should do in this big data, I can teach everything live.

02:27:00.900 --> 02:27:05.000
I don't have any kind of a issue. And believe me, I like,

02:27:05.140 --> 02:27:09.380
you know, I like live classes more than my recorded one, uh,

02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:12.140
because recorded one is little bit boring. And again,

02:27:12.220 --> 02:27:14.760
retention, see, even there is a platform called as Udemy,

02:27:14.900 --> 02:27:18.020
right. You will be able to find out every kind of a course,

02:27:18.040 --> 02:27:20.580
literally every kind of a courses you will be able to find

02:27:20.580 --> 02:27:23.500
out. And believe me, we all have taken some Udemy courses.

02:27:23.620 --> 02:27:28.200
Yes, guys. Yeah. We all have a spend maybe like a 400, 400,

02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:31.920
400 rupees on five, 10 courses, at least on Udemy. Yeah.

02:27:32.780 --> 02:27:38.040
Right. We all have purchased those courses. Yeah. Right. So

02:27:38.040 --> 02:27:41.120
let's just try to recall that how much percentage of those

02:27:41.120 --> 02:27:45.140
courses you have completed Udemy itself claims that, uh, my

02:27:45.140 --> 02:27:49.100
retention rate is like not more than 2%, 3, 2.5% or maybe

02:27:49.100 --> 02:27:53.040
sometime 1.5% right in some of the quarter. It simply means

02:27:53.040 --> 02:27:57.380
that, that, uh, you know, uh, uh, see courses are available,

02:27:57.640 --> 02:28:00.620
contents are available. Even whatever I'm trying to teach in

02:28:00.620 --> 02:28:03.240
a class or not me, just me, maybe some other mentor are

02:28:03.240 --> 02:28:06.880
trying to teach in the class, right? So they are not trying

02:28:06.880 --> 02:28:09.500
to innovate something. I'm not trying to innovate something

02:28:09.500 --> 02:28:12.160
over here. Right? So for example, today I discussed about a

02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:14.700
Facebook as a minority search and then quadrant. So it's not

02:28:14.700 --> 02:28:17.440
like it's been like a developed by me or discovered by me.

02:28:17.960 --> 02:28:21.060
It was already there, right? Content was already there. I

02:28:21.060 --> 02:28:23.300
have a structured it. I have just built a story around it

02:28:23.300 --> 02:28:25.720
and I'm trying to deliver it. And then you guys are enjoying

02:28:25.720 --> 02:28:29.600
it and you guys are able to learn it now. Contents wise,

02:28:29.640 --> 02:28:32.040
contents are available. Enough contents are available on

02:28:32.040 --> 02:28:36.000
YouTube and everywhere, every platform, but somewhere those

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:39.460
contents. People are not coming for the content somewhere. I

02:28:39.460 --> 02:28:42.080
believe that education is all about a discipline and

02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:45.540
determination, right? And this is where I believe this live

02:28:45.540 --> 02:28:49.460
class comes into a picture. It brings a discipline, right?

02:28:49.540 --> 02:28:52.460
That okay, at this point of time I have to sit inside the

02:28:52.460 --> 02:28:55.000
class and then there will be a mentor. I will go, I will try

02:28:55.000 --> 02:29:00.060
to do a two and four kind of a communication, right? So and

02:29:00.060 --> 02:29:03.120
that will, that will make your learning more productive

02:29:03.120 --> 02:29:06.640
because we all have a courses, multiple platform, right? And

02:29:06.640 --> 02:29:10.260
we all know the reality. Even in my childhood, childhood

02:29:10.260 --> 02:29:13.700
means seven, eight year back, right? When I was in a very

02:29:13.700 --> 02:29:16.760
initial stage of my career, I used to purchase a lot of

02:29:16.760 --> 02:29:20.760
courses on Udemy and believe me, maybe I have purchased 50,

02:29:20.860 --> 02:29:21.860
60 courses, I don't know.

02:29:24.800 --> 02:29:28.380
And I don't remember that I have even, I was able to

02:29:28.380 --> 02:29:32.280
complete one course by 10%. I was not able to complete it.

02:29:32.340 --> 02:29:35.620
Right? Because the only thing which was lagging is a

02:29:35.620 --> 02:29:38.780
discipline and we are, we are not that disciplined enough.

02:29:38.940 --> 02:29:40.960
And again, it's not very interesting, right? You're watching

02:29:40.960 --> 02:29:44.120
just a recording. Obviously like we can go and watch movie

02:29:44.120 --> 02:29:48.960
because a movie gives us a dopamine hit. It entertain us. So

02:29:48.960 --> 02:29:51.660
obviously we can sit for two hour, three hour, we can finish

02:29:51.660 --> 02:29:55.700
an entire movie, but same you can't apply with the courses

02:29:55.700 --> 02:30:00.240
by the way. So I'll keep on launching most, most of the

02:30:00.240 --> 02:30:03.980
courses in live mode going forward. So now I'm planning even

02:30:03.980 --> 02:30:08.140
for kids, uh, we are trying to onboard more and more number

02:30:08.140 --> 02:30:11.540
of mentors. If you would like to like, uh, you know, uh,

02:30:11.680 --> 02:30:15.380
contribute as a mentor, if you are good in terms of a

02:30:15.380 --> 02:30:18.240
storytelling, doesn't matter which language, it's fine. Uh,

02:30:18.380 --> 02:30:21.000
if you're, even if you're coming from a regional language

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:24.160
background, that's okay. But you are supposed to be a good,

02:30:24.200 --> 02:30:28.800
very good a storyteller, right in depth, right in depth. So,

02:30:28.880 --> 02:30:31.900
uh, you can, you can just send me your recording. Maybe of

02:30:31.900 --> 02:30:34.420
one hour, one and a half hour topic of your choice. That's

02:30:34.420 --> 02:30:37.780
completely fine. And uh, yeah, so you can join your own.

02:30:37.860 --> 02:30:41.280
That's completely fine as a mentor, part time only. So we

02:30:41.280 --> 02:30:44.060
are onboarding as of now, just a part time, uh, in every

02:30:44.060 --> 02:30:48.420
segment, right? So maybe that is going to open up a new

02:30:48.420 --> 02:30:49.240
opportunity for you.

02:30:53.290 --> 02:30:55.850
So language ki bahut problem hoti hai, koi baat nahi, hath

02:30:55.850 --> 02:31:00.930
jayega. Okay. Okay. Fine guys. Let's not take a break. Let's

02:31:00.930 --> 02:31:03.730
start the route clearing. It's already late. So I'll not

02:31:03.730 --> 02:31:04.170
take a break.

02:31:07.910 --> 02:31:11.050
Okay. So I'm just going to lower your hand. And once again,

02:31:11.130 --> 02:31:13.390
guys, those who is having a doubt, please raise your hand

02:31:13.390 --> 02:31:15.530
one by one. Those who would like to share the screen. So

02:31:15.530 --> 02:31:19.770
ping me in a chat, I'll add you as a panelist, I'll call out

02:31:19.770 --> 02:31:23.530
your name and uh, you can start asking the questions. Yeah.

02:31:24.370 --> 02:31:28.850
So Ramesh, yeah, go ahead first. Hi sir. Thanks for taking

02:31:28.850 --> 02:31:32.650
session today. Uh, so I have the couple of the notes from

02:31:32.650 --> 02:31:35.750
the vector DB. Uh, so when you offset the data into

02:31:35.750 --> 02:31:39.410
quadrant, right. And, uh, do we receive the data, consume

02:31:39.410 --> 02:31:42.210
the data, incremental patient, how are we going to manage

02:31:42.210 --> 02:31:45.730
the data? So for example, today we are, uh, funding the

02:31:45.730 --> 02:31:48.850
data, right. Tomorrow we can pursue some other file. So how

02:31:48.850 --> 02:31:52.210
are we going to maintain, uh, uh, in periodically in

02:31:52.210 --> 02:31:55.770
quadrant database? Okay. So basically you can try to attach

02:31:55.770 --> 02:31:58.270
a tags with that one. So the payload that you are trying to

02:31:58.270 --> 02:32:00.310
create, right. So along with the payload, so you can try to

02:32:00.310 --> 02:32:04.270
send a timestamps over there and just a flag flag.

02:32:04.410 --> 02:32:06.610
Basically. You can try to send one single flag over there

02:32:06.610 --> 02:32:08.670
and with the help of flag, you will be able to maintain it.

02:32:10.050 --> 02:32:13.590
Okay. So is there any possibility to overwrite it, uh, to

02:32:13.590 --> 02:32:17.390
overwrite means, uh, uh, if we get the same kind of, uh, uh,

02:32:17.390 --> 02:32:20.730
there is something called as concept of deduplication. So

02:32:20.730 --> 02:32:23.230
basically in case of deduplication, if you're going to

02:32:23.230 --> 02:32:25.510
enable it, uh, what it will do is, so if there is a

02:32:25.510 --> 02:32:28.370
duplicate data, which is already available automatically, it

02:32:28.370 --> 02:32:30.890
will try to match it and then it will try to discard it. It

02:32:30.890 --> 02:32:33.350
will not try to store it once again. So you can try to go

02:32:33.350 --> 02:32:36.550
over the deduplication. Even in Facebook AI, there is a

02:32:36.550 --> 02:32:38.590
concept called a deduplication, which is already available.

02:32:39.150 --> 02:32:43.050
Yes. Okay. Okay. Fine. My second note is, uh, you have sold

02:32:43.050 --> 02:32:46.190
on function. I plat something, right. Can you please explain

02:32:46.190 --> 02:32:51.730
one second, uh, I mean the specific, uh, bias CPU, right by

02:32:51.730 --> 02:32:56.950
notebook. So let me share my screen. Which one? Which one?

02:32:57.030 --> 02:33:04.370
Tell me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Platt IP. So this

02:33:04.370 --> 02:33:07.970
function is coming from, this function is technically coming

02:33:07.970 --> 02:33:11.790
from, uh, Faze, this one, uh, this library itself, Facebook

02:33:11.790 --> 02:33:14.170
has some letters library. Someone has created, right. And we

02:33:14.170 --> 02:33:16.650
have done the installation of that. So this function is

02:33:16.650 --> 02:33:19.710
coming from that now what it does. So basically it is going

02:33:19.710 --> 02:33:22.350
to do it in our product. IP means in our product, by the

02:33:22.350 --> 02:33:25.730
way, in our product of what index index means what index

02:33:25.730 --> 02:33:28.530
means. Your embeddings, right? So you are trying to flat

02:33:28.530 --> 02:33:31.070
turn the embedding flatten means you are trying to convert

02:33:31.070 --> 02:33:34.330
that into a one dimension and then you are trying to find

02:33:34.330 --> 02:33:37.590
out the inner product so they have just named it in that way

02:33:37.590 --> 02:33:41.310
technically this is what we are doing right see uh let's

02:33:41.310 --> 02:33:45.390
suppose i am going to take some data so this is my embedding

02:33:45.390 --> 02:33:51.810
list this is my embedding list now how it will try to store

02:33:51.810 --> 02:33:55.130
it this is my embedding list right i'll try to extract only

02:33:55.130 --> 02:33:58.910
one data out of this one so zero three indexes right this

02:33:58.910 --> 02:34:02.890
one yes yes so i'll try to extract this one okay so here

02:34:02.890 --> 02:34:10.590
index flat ip so and uh yeah so it's flat ip and now so

02:34:10.590 --> 02:34:13.470
whenever we are we will be having index number two so let's

02:34:13.470 --> 02:34:17.530
suppose we have a uh this one and we have basically this one

02:34:17.530 --> 02:34:22.190
this one now what i will do i'll try to do a dot right so

02:34:22.190 --> 02:34:26.270
numpy dot dot and dot product of basically this one and this

02:34:26.270 --> 02:34:32.290
one and basically our inner product of this and this we will

02:34:32.290 --> 02:34:37.330
be we will try to perform right yes this is what it means

02:34:37.330 --> 02:34:43.090
index flat ip so they have just created as a function simple

02:34:43.090 --> 02:34:45.710
right and they are saying that okay fine so whenever you are

02:34:45.710 --> 02:34:48.990
trying to create that uh indexes so your index size should

02:34:48.990 --> 02:34:51.950
be one five three six because i know that that my index size

02:34:51.950 --> 02:34:56.490
is going to be one five three right yeah yeah if i'm going

02:34:56.490 --> 02:34:58.250
to use some different model then my index size will be

02:34:58.250 --> 02:35:02.630
different yeah as of now i'm trying to use this uh open a

02:35:02.630 --> 02:35:05.670
model right a small case model i'm trying to use and what is

02:35:05.670 --> 02:35:08.450
our vector size it is going to return me one five three six

02:35:08.450 --> 02:35:10.570
so that's the reason so i have given that okay fine so

02:35:10.570 --> 02:35:13.110
length of any vector is going to be one five three six for

02:35:13.110 --> 02:35:15.530
example yesterday i have shown you a quen model if you

02:35:15.530 --> 02:35:20.230
remember now uh hugging phase so yesterday i have shown you

02:35:20.230 --> 02:35:23.890
basically this quen model and for quen model a different

02:35:23.890 --> 02:35:28.550
different like parameters q u or i can search by em binning

02:35:28.550 --> 02:35:33.110
so yesterday we talked about this one now so here our

02:35:33.110 --> 02:35:36.370
dimension was what one zero two four right if i'm going to

02:35:36.370 --> 02:35:39.850
use this model dimension was what two five three six zero if

02:35:39.850 --> 02:35:41.750
i'm going to use this model four billion parameter dimension

02:35:41.750 --> 02:35:44.470
is this one so if i'm going to use let's suppose this model

02:35:44.470 --> 02:35:47.430
right so whatever vector it is going to produce what will be

02:35:47.430 --> 02:35:49.570
the size of that vector so size of that vector is going to

02:35:49.570 --> 02:35:54.410
be one five two four one zero two four yeah correct yeah so

02:35:54.410 --> 02:35:57.670
same you can you can try to so i have hard coded this value

02:35:57.670 --> 02:36:01.550
you can try to even call this vector right you can even try

02:36:01.550 --> 02:36:04.230
to call this vector one of this vector and then you can try

02:36:04.230 --> 02:36:08.650
to check so i can try to even check in this way right so

02:36:08.650 --> 02:36:12.390
this dot sh ap safe safe is what one five three six i can

02:36:12.390 --> 02:36:17.490
try to pass this data over there okay okay sure yeah yeah

02:36:17.490 --> 02:36:23.370
okay sir and uh uh yeah actually my next note is that right

02:36:23.370 --> 02:36:28.870
when we use the secure security base is the drawback

02:36:28.870 --> 02:36:34.230
potential impact so i think i have seen some video but when

02:36:34.230 --> 02:36:37.930
we use the rack technique it might have secured but how do

02:36:37.930 --> 02:36:41.870
we say is it is a really secure if you are going to use a

02:36:41.870 --> 02:36:47.510
rack technique see security layer will not be guaranteed by

02:36:47.510 --> 02:36:50.570
your uh like you know execution layer or wherever you are

02:36:50.570 --> 02:36:54.350
trying to create the like a rack right so it it depends upon

02:36:54.350 --> 02:36:57.290
first of all authorization it depends upon how you are

02:36:57.290 --> 02:37:00.150
trying to secure your private data set means encryption by

02:37:00.150 --> 02:37:03.990
the way plus on a hardware layer on an application layer how

02:37:03.990 --> 02:37:07.070
you are trying to like you know keep the security so

02:37:07.070 --> 02:37:11.430
security is not just a matter of rag yeah so why people are

02:37:11.430 --> 02:37:14.950
talking about it inside the industry because uh let's

02:37:14.950 --> 02:37:17.910
suppose uh you are trying to build a rag application now

02:37:17.910 --> 02:37:20.730
what you do by the way so you try to take your private data

02:37:20.730 --> 02:37:23.490
you try to convert that into embeddings and then you try to

02:37:23.550 --> 02:37:26.830
store it into some of the databases for example we are we

02:37:26.830 --> 02:37:29.490
have a story into this databases right quadrant databases

02:37:29.490 --> 02:37:32.770
today itself right in this one or maybe into a facebook as a

02:37:32.770 --> 02:37:36.190
databases now let's suppose if quadrant database is not

02:37:36.190 --> 02:37:39.190
providing your security if somewhere there is a leak in

02:37:39.190 --> 02:37:42.910
their login or in their data encryption itself right the

02:37:42.910 --> 02:37:45.210
entire set of the data that you have uploaded over here will

02:37:45.210 --> 02:37:50.130
be compromised so security is not like you will try to build

02:37:50.130 --> 02:37:54.910
it with rag on top of that you will have to build the layer

02:37:54.910 --> 02:37:57.390
of the security and this is what we do with all the

02:37:57.390 --> 02:38:02.250
applications but anyhow the data is going to diverse right

02:38:02.250 --> 02:38:07.350
the traversal from no no for example let's suppose i'm using

02:38:07.350 --> 02:38:09.570
a facebook as similarity search right let's suppose i'm not

02:38:09.570 --> 02:38:12.770
using any cloud based this one i'm using this one right and

02:38:12.770 --> 02:38:15.830
let's suppose i have basically hosted my facebook as

02:38:15.830 --> 02:38:19.970
similarity search on my ec2 instances on my my own ec2

02:38:19.970 --> 02:38:27.470
instances yeah okay in this case the data is going to be

02:38:35.930 --> 02:38:39.590
yeah but but anyhow right anyhow this is the numerical thing

02:38:39.590 --> 02:38:43.330
but if we want to refine the statement uh can we go to get

02:38:43.330 --> 02:38:46.670
the help from llm right by the time the whatever data decide

02:38:46.670 --> 02:38:51.150
data is going to traversal from uh vector db to uh llm model

02:38:51.150 --> 02:38:53.710
sir there is some significant drawback right for the

02:38:53.710 --> 02:38:56.550
security ways no again again so there are many open source

02:38:56.550 --> 02:38:58.870
model which is available open source llms which is available

02:38:58.870 --> 02:39:03.250
right a good one i would say right so no one is no one is

02:39:03.250 --> 02:39:06.610
stopping you by the way no one is stopping you to host your

02:39:06.610 --> 02:39:11.930
llm right host your system plus host your own data which is

02:39:11.930 --> 02:39:14.170
available into an embedding format right which is available

02:39:14.170 --> 02:39:18.570
into a vector format on your own machine so maybe ec2 or

02:39:18.570 --> 02:39:22.670
maybe in a bare metal or in any other machine so let's

02:39:22.670 --> 02:39:28.030
suppose i have a data breach in my server so i'm not sending

02:39:28.030 --> 02:39:30.630
any of my data to the llm so how there will be a data breach

02:39:30.630 --> 02:39:34.250
at all and this is also i have shown it to you so see uh i i

02:39:34.250 --> 02:39:36.810
don't know like whether you have seen this video or not uh

02:39:36.810 --> 02:39:42.550
let me open it up so i think one two days back so even so

02:39:42.550 --> 02:39:46.010
even though if we install the llm model in our local but

02:39:46.010 --> 02:39:49.310
does it need some internet search or something right not not

02:39:49.310 --> 02:39:53.070
no not at all so not local maybe you can try to install it

02:39:53.070 --> 02:39:56.690
into your own server so your own gpt api yeah so if you'll

02:39:56.690 --> 02:39:59.030
go through this video right so i have already provided even

02:39:59.030 --> 02:40:02.010
a documentation and in this entire video i have shown that

02:40:02.010 --> 02:40:05.310
that how you can try to take a big llm big elements a 20

02:40:05.310 --> 02:40:07.930
billion parameter model chat gpt model i'm talking about

02:40:07.930 --> 02:40:12.430
right and how you will be able to host this model and expose

02:40:12.430 --> 02:40:15.650
it as an api see and with the help of curl right with the

02:40:15.650 --> 02:40:18.170
help of curl how you will be able to hit it so and that too

02:40:18.170 --> 02:40:21.910
i'm doing it this inferencing on a gpu by the way and i've

02:40:21.910 --> 02:40:24.770
already provided a documentation for that yeah so how are

02:40:24.770 --> 02:40:27.710
you able to how you will be able to you know do the setup

02:40:27.710 --> 02:40:30.950
and this is how hosting happens basically for any models for

02:40:30.950 --> 02:40:34.130
any model model inferencing so let's suppose i'm used to i'm

02:40:34.130 --> 02:40:37.210
hosting this model on my instances now there is no breach

02:40:37.210 --> 02:40:41.750
yeah but yeah i understood totally agree it is a 20 billion

02:40:41.750 --> 02:40:45.310
parameter whatever the knowledge does it have it can uh do

02:40:45.310 --> 02:40:48.630
it but if suppose if i'm going to ask question uh for

02:40:48.630 --> 02:40:50.810
example so what is the two-day information is there any two

02:40:50.810 --> 02:40:54.090
-day information anyhow there is some network uh or a topic

02:40:54.090 --> 02:40:57.010
over there right for example study what news is going on

02:40:57.010 --> 02:41:00.770
today can you get it from anyhow anyhow those real-time

02:41:00.770 --> 02:41:04.170
search operation that you are talking about right so those

02:41:04.170 --> 02:41:08.370
will not be handled by your learned model this these models

02:41:08.370 --> 02:41:11.290
are basically something which has learned till some duration

02:41:11.290 --> 02:41:14.970
or till some date right so anyhow that will be not answered

02:41:14.970 --> 02:41:18.450
so what you do is that that you try to append a real-time

02:41:18.450 --> 02:41:21.610
search api for example a surfer api right i'm going to

02:41:21.610 --> 02:41:24.650
append it and whatever surfer api is going to return i just

02:41:24.650 --> 02:41:27.250
used to give to this model this model try to rephrase it and

02:41:27.250 --> 02:41:30.330
then give it to me as a you know polished answer so you have

02:41:30.330 --> 02:41:32.850
to integrate a server api and there will not be data breach

02:41:32.850 --> 02:41:38.470
in any cases right yeah yeah you are sending some different

02:41:38.470 --> 02:41:41.290
you know uh question to the server api server api is trying

02:41:41.290 --> 02:41:44.530
to bring those answers from the internet and then you are

02:41:44.530 --> 02:41:46.610
trying to do some sort of a rephrasing with the help of

02:41:46.610 --> 02:41:51.970
model which you have hosted on your platform okay yeah so in

02:41:51.970 --> 02:41:55.890
the case it's my own platform if i ask any uh web related

02:41:55.890 --> 02:42:00.290
question it does not return right it won't be having a real

02:42:00.290 --> 02:42:04.010
-time search kind of for functionalities all right but in

02:42:04.010 --> 02:42:06.990
the especially the department the jet gpd at all it is going

02:42:06.990 --> 02:42:09.570
to interfere with this sir paper and wikipedia or some other

02:42:09.570 --> 02:42:14.130
thing exactly so they have they have even even in a uri if

02:42:14.130 --> 02:42:18.150
you will go and check right so if you will go to a urine uh

02:42:18.150 --> 02:42:22.170
and here we have done the same thing so here if you'll go to

02:42:22.170 --> 02:42:25.530
yuri and And let's suppose if you are going to switch on

02:42:25.530 --> 02:42:28.310
your web search. So we have given you this option, web

02:42:28.310 --> 02:42:31.130
search, right? This one. So if you're going to switch on

02:42:31.130 --> 02:42:33.710
this web search option by default, it will be disabled. And

02:42:33.710 --> 02:42:38.370
it is, if I'm going to ask me, tell me the weather or news

02:42:38.370 --> 02:42:43.590
from Bangalore, right? As I stay in Bangalore now it will

02:42:43.590 --> 02:42:47.150
hit. So I'm using GPT nano five or any model I'm going to

02:42:47.150 --> 02:42:49.570
use. It doesn't matter at all. Right? So what it will do, it

02:42:49.570 --> 02:42:52.130
is trying to call a server API. It is trying to see search

02:42:52.130 --> 02:42:55.810
websites, right? It is trying to search all of these

02:42:55.810 --> 02:42:58.950
websites and now it will try to like bring a data for me

02:42:58.950 --> 02:43:06.010
sometime. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Got it. So now our latest news,

02:43:06.150 --> 02:43:09.290
today's news itself, it is able to, uh, like a search. And

02:43:09.290 --> 02:43:12.230
if I'm going to like a click, I will be able to even verify

02:43:12.230 --> 02:43:15.350
the date, time and everything. Right? So these are the

02:43:15.350 --> 02:43:18.770
content to which I'm able to get it. So here, this is not

02:43:18.770 --> 02:43:21.670
the model which is responding back. Right? The model which

02:43:21.670 --> 02:43:25.170
is responding back to me is basically my real time API. What

02:43:25.170 --> 02:43:27.910
this model is trying to do. This model is trying to format

02:43:27.910 --> 02:43:33.450
the data for me and then show it to me in a human readable

02:43:33.450 --> 02:43:37.450
format. Basically. Yes. It's repending completely. That is.

02:43:37.610 --> 02:43:41.110
Yeah. And yeah, sir. And one more final question. Right. So

02:43:41.110 --> 02:43:44.970
generally real question. Uh, so, uh, we, I have already

02:43:44.970 --> 02:43:47.310
talked about the page nation, right? We have the 10 K rows

02:43:47.310 --> 02:43:51.010
over there. What happened in my scenario? Uh, when we

02:43:51.010 --> 02:43:54.810
iterate one by one, uh, for each iterations, we are getting

02:43:54.810 --> 02:43:58.370
one API call and extracting the thousand rows, one K rows

02:43:58.370 --> 02:44:02.750
based on the query parameter values. So in this case, what

02:44:02.750 --> 02:44:05.550
happened over there at the fifth call assist call, we got

02:44:05.550 --> 02:44:09.910
the timeout issue. API timeout issue. We, we, we are, we are

02:44:09.910 --> 02:44:15.510
placing an error like 503. Uh, so what might be the reason?

02:44:15.590 --> 02:44:18.230
Because let us check with our server team as well. So our

02:44:18.230 --> 02:44:21.590
server team as well. But they told that there is a, the lock

02:44:21.590 --> 02:44:25.050
is not captured over there, the point or three, but in our

02:44:25.050 --> 02:44:28.990
instance, so we are getting that kind of error. So is there

02:44:28.990 --> 02:44:33.970
any, uh, any reasons why a server doesn't have the, any, uh,

02:44:34.150 --> 02:44:38.450
lock capture on the point or three cases? Oh, lock capture.

02:44:38.670 --> 02:44:41.990
Maybe you can try to do one thing. You can try to, maybe you

02:44:41.990 --> 02:44:44.470
are, you're like when you're doing a pagination. So you are

02:44:44.470 --> 02:44:48.490
trying to set thousand as a neck in one goal. Uh, thousand.

02:44:49.110 --> 02:44:49.210
And then you're trying to process those thousand records and

02:44:49.210 --> 02:44:50.690
get the response. Right? So many thousand recorders should

02:44:50.690 --> 02:44:54.170
be able to fetch it. No, but you know, pagination cause the

02:44:54.170 --> 02:44:57.510
like, uh, began the Facebook data, Facebook, right? But I'm

02:44:57.510 --> 02:45:00.410
not sure how they are controlling the pagination at all. Uh,

02:45:00.510 --> 02:45:04.390
we are calling that a URL and extracting the data. Maybe a

02:45:04.390 --> 02:45:08.370
overly it can return, it can return the 10 K rows or

02:45:08.370 --> 02:45:11.650
something for one, one business. For example, let us go to

02:45:11.650 --> 02:45:15.530
search with one LOB LOB means is the line of business. If

02:45:15.530 --> 02:45:18.490
you're going to get the particular web data, it can extract

02:45:18.490 --> 02:45:21.550
the 10 K rows and then row or 20k rows but in our instance

02:45:21.550 --> 02:45:26.570
we are also iterating uh uh one by one for each iteration we

02:45:26.570 --> 02:45:29.990
are going to uh extract the thousand rows sir no just just

02:45:29.990 --> 02:45:33.370
keep it minimum maybe keep it like a hundred so that it will

02:45:33.370 --> 02:45:36.990
not be tried we tried 500 as well we tried with that what

02:45:36.990 --> 02:45:40.090
happened i mean on the fifth or sixth iteration continuously

02:45:40.090 --> 02:45:43.670
when we it is going to keep the api called multiple time uh

02:45:43.670 --> 02:45:46.110
fifth or sixth time sometime is failure it's not for

02:45:46.110 --> 02:45:50.290
regularly sometime we got a failure maybe the morning time

02:45:50.290 --> 02:45:52.350
and the rush time is getting failures

02:45:55.510 --> 02:45:59.290
maybe like because if you are reducing the number of the

02:45:59.290 --> 02:46:02.290
record it should not timeout simply means that system is

02:46:02.290 --> 02:46:05.330
your client is trying to like send a request to the server

02:46:05.330 --> 02:46:07.630
and server is not able to respond back that is the correct

02:46:07.630 --> 02:46:10.770
very simple meaning of a timeout that we all understand

02:46:11.260 --> 02:46:14.330
right and it happens if there will be a bottleneck in terms

02:46:14.330 --> 02:46:17.730
of a network io means in the stipulated time period if it is

02:46:17.730 --> 02:46:20.510
not able to respond back so maybe you can ask your like a

02:46:20.510 --> 02:46:23.910
back-end team to increase your timeout limit by the way

02:46:23.910 --> 02:46:27.390
because that is something which we try to set custom right

02:46:27.390 --> 02:46:31.530
so maybe they can try to like reset their maximum tries so

02:46:31.530 --> 02:46:33.690
that is again another parameter that we try to set yeah yeah

02:46:33.690 --> 02:46:36.610
we yeah we made the customized code the retry option right

02:46:36.610 --> 02:46:40.990
for every 10 seconds uh we try with the three times you know

02:46:40.990 --> 02:46:44.370
we put some while loop or something and we retry the three

02:46:44.370 --> 02:46:47.530
times even though but sometimes succeeded sometimes failure

02:46:47.530 --> 02:46:51.070
again but it's not getting the permanent solution that so

02:46:51.070 --> 02:46:54.350
i'm not sure yeah so maybe then i'll have to look into the

02:46:54.350 --> 02:46:57.010
code because that these are the possible solution right so

02:46:57.010 --> 02:47:00.670
we try to this and from the back end not from your side so

02:47:00.670 --> 02:47:03.290
from the back end so if they have implemented maximum tries

02:47:03.290 --> 02:47:06.470
and then like per time out what should be the timeline or

02:47:06.470 --> 02:47:09.950
for total time out so what should be the timeline and then a

02:47:09.950 --> 02:47:12.770
data control means number of data that we are trying to read

02:47:12.770 --> 02:47:12.770
if they are capable of addressing all these things right so

02:47:12.770 --> 02:47:16.330
these are the way by which we can solve it otherwise we'll

02:47:16.330 --> 02:47:19.310
have to look into the code really and plus your server your

02:47:19.310 --> 02:47:22.370
server capacity the server that you are trying to hit right

02:47:22.370 --> 02:47:24.550
so whether this server is capable enough to handle these

02:47:24.550 --> 02:47:27.350
things or not that that's also matters right because if

02:47:27.350 --> 02:47:30.270
server is creating your hardware itself is creating a

02:47:30.270 --> 02:47:32.610
bottleneck then there will be a because timeout simply means

02:47:32.610 --> 02:47:35.290
that i'm not able to respond back and i'm why i'm not able

02:47:35.290 --> 02:47:36.970
to respond back maybe i'm not able to compute

02:47:42.770 --> 02:47:45.730
right there can be a n number of things so again it's not

02:47:45.730 --> 02:47:47.910
just about the code i would say maybe we'll have to look

02:47:47.910 --> 02:47:51.190
into the hardware configuration as well and the load on that

02:47:51.190 --> 02:47:56.270
hardware configuration okay okay yeah sounds good sir but it

02:47:56.270 --> 02:48:00.850
sounds interesting but we made a call with the facebook team

02:48:00.850 --> 02:48:04.670
as well server team support support team as well but they

02:48:04.670 --> 02:48:09.270
convinced us we didn't get any uh lock at our end so maybe

02:48:09.270 --> 02:48:12.470
we are going to tell some further justification on monday

02:48:12.470 --> 02:48:15.590
that's yeah let us convey the different ways and we are

02:48:15.590 --> 02:48:18.570
dealing with the problems thank you sir yeah thanks thanks

02:48:18.570 --> 02:48:24.710
okay yeah you can share your screen and uh in between ravi

02:48:24.710 --> 02:48:27.710
please go ahead with the question second one is the screen

02:48:27.710 --> 02:48:31.910
yeah allow so yeah first uh ravi can go over the question

02:48:31.910 --> 02:48:34.370
then navneet you can go over the question yeah

02:48:36.830 --> 02:48:41.970
yeah ravi what is your question so regarding creation of an

02:48:41.970 --> 02:48:46.470
environment i have it out okay i want to share a screen so

02:48:46.530 --> 02:48:50.210
here i'm not getting an option so sure i'm i'm promoting you

02:48:50.210 --> 02:48:52.650
ravi you will not get an option yeah what is your question

02:48:52.650 --> 02:48:56.390
would you like to share the screen uh yes yes okay fine so

02:48:56.390 --> 02:48:59.130
i'm allowing you to share the screen and what is your

02:48:59.130 --> 02:49:01.030
question would you like to share the screen anyone guys who

02:49:01.030 --> 02:49:06.630
would like to share the screen list yeah i want to yeah okay

02:49:06.630 --> 02:49:11.130
i have fixed my problem okay but just one uh doubt i had

02:49:11.130 --> 02:49:16.610
just why i was not an issue share your screen please yeah i

02:49:16.610 --> 02:49:29.330
wouldn't like to share screen thank you

02:49:29.330 --> 02:49:33.490
thank you sir mcp

02:49:46.530 --> 02:49:46.810
um

02:49:56.490 --> 02:49:58.390
uh We have integrated all the internal labs of different

02:49:58.390 --> 02:50:03.170
companies in this way.

02:50:05.510 --> 02:50:11.070
And through RAC, we are running results in it. Elastic

02:50:11.070 --> 02:50:17.470
database is being used. In this, because it was being

02:50:17.470 --> 02:50:24.370
studied in MCP, like in Cloud AI and Open AI, our agent

02:50:24.370 --> 02:50:28.930
starts to appear below. So, in our case, how will it be

02:50:28.930 --> 02:50:33.390
integrated in the app? And in this case, where we go to

02:50:33.390 --> 02:50:38.070
query first, then it identifies. And then after going to

02:50:38.070 --> 02:50:41.070
cosine similarity in RAC, we show it by re-ranking. This is

02:50:41.070 --> 02:50:45.890
the workflow. So, is MCP useful in it? Or how can it be

02:50:45.890 --> 02:50:49.830
implemented? MCP, a bubble was created in the middle of MCP.

02:50:50.050 --> 02:50:56.470
I will tell you the reality about MCP. So, Nowadays, you

02:50:56.470 --> 02:50:59.250
will not hear that people are talking about MCPs. There is

02:50:59.250 --> 02:51:03.490
not much hype right now. What happened 3-4 months ago was

02:51:03.490 --> 02:51:06.470
that people created a lot of hype. MCP, MCP, MCP. Then after

02:51:06.470 --> 02:51:07.910
that, people created a lot of hype. People created A2A

02:51:07.910 --> 02:51:11.250
protocol, A2A protocol, A2A protocol. What was MCP? If you

02:51:11.250 --> 02:51:13.630
look at MCP carefully, then you will understand very easily.

02:51:14.330 --> 02:51:16.930
There was nothing like that. They opened a simple protocol.

02:51:17.210 --> 02:51:20.690
They opened a particular port. They said, okay, you can give

02:51:20.690 --> 02:51:25.510
an access to any application to this MCP. And as soon as you

02:51:25.510 --> 02:51:27.470
write the code, as soon as you write the logic, according to

02:51:27.470 --> 02:51:30.390
that, it will process it and bring it. Whether we have given

02:51:30.390 --> 02:51:32.410
it, let's suppose, the access to the excel sheet. We have

02:51:32.410 --> 02:51:35.110
given it the access to our mail, let's suppose. Or we have

02:51:35.110 --> 02:51:37.730
given it the real-time Google search access. Or any of the

02:51:37.730 --> 02:51:40.050
tools. We have given the access to our mobile phone. So,

02:51:40.070 --> 02:51:41.130
what will it do? It will take decisions on its own.

02:51:41.230 --> 02:51:44.730
Technically, the agent does the same. See, we also confide

02:51:44.730 --> 02:51:46.610
the agent in that way. But what did they do? No, let's go as

02:51:46.610 --> 02:51:52.170
a MCP protocol. And this bubble rose for 3-4 months. And

02:51:52.170 --> 02:51:56.190
more bubbles. These days, the bubble rises because there are

02:51:56.190 --> 02:52:01.610
a lot of influencers. Right. And the influencer is basically

02:52:01.610 --> 02:52:06.230
that category. Basically, it doesn't matter how useful it is

02:52:06.230 --> 02:52:08.910
and how useless it is. It just matters whether my likes and

02:52:08.910 --> 02:52:11.530
views are coming or not. And the likes and views come on the

02:52:11.530 --> 02:52:15.770
new thing. Right. The new buzzwords. Just to mislead the

02:52:15.770 --> 02:52:19.170
public a little. New buzzwords should be read. MCP had the

02:52:19.170 --> 02:52:22.390
same story. And after that, MCP is over. Now, literally, no

02:52:22.390 --> 02:52:25.610
one is using MCP. I don't know how many people have built

02:52:25.610 --> 02:52:28.470
it. How many people haven't. Back to back, everyone has

02:52:28.470 --> 02:52:31.130
opened the port of MCP. So, overnight, you will get to see

02:52:31.130 --> 02:52:34.270
that every tool, whether it is Cloud, whether it is GPT,

02:52:34.510 --> 02:52:39.890
whether it is even Cursor, everyone has that MCP

02:52:39.890 --> 02:52:42.570
functionality. Because everyone knew that there is no

02:52:42.570 --> 02:52:45.310
implementation in it. We have been doing that since before.

02:52:45.970 --> 02:52:49.350
Yes. What is agent to agent? What is agent? When we will

02:52:49.350 --> 02:52:51.810
teach you agent, you will understand that it is nothing but

02:52:51.810 --> 02:52:54.510
just a function. Okay. A function with an LLM code. That's

02:52:54.510 --> 02:52:56.610
it. That's it. That's what agents say. More than that, there

02:52:56.610 --> 02:52:59.570
is no agent fund. Right. We have made a lot of noise about

02:52:59.570 --> 02:53:04.230
it. Actually, there is nothing like that. So, MCP also came

02:53:04.230 --> 02:53:07.150
overnight. It went overnight. Now, those influencers are not

02:53:07.150 --> 02:53:09.890
even talking about MCPs. And if you go and ask them,

02:53:09.930 --> 02:53:11.910
brother, tell us about MCP. They will say, we have

02:53:11.910 --> 02:53:14.870
forgotten. It has gone. Night has gone. Night has gone. So,

02:53:14.870 --> 02:53:17.970
that is the reality. And what happened is that now we have

02:53:17.970 --> 02:53:23.130
heard. Some people like us. No. We are behind it. MCP's fund

02:53:23.130 --> 02:53:24.130
is not getting cleared. So, that is the reality. The concept

02:53:24.130 --> 02:53:27.270
is not getting cleared. And this is happening a lot these

02:53:27.270 --> 02:53:31.890
days. Okay. A lot. Now, what is AI? I mean, some new terms

02:53:31.890 --> 02:53:35.390
are coming every day. And all the brothers, all of them have

02:53:35.390 --> 02:53:41.190
to make that video on them. Okay. But it is not relevant.

02:53:41.830 --> 02:53:44.170
And what are the things that are still relevant? Which are

02:53:44.170 --> 02:53:46.710
the core fundamentals. Okay. Because all those things are

02:53:46.710 --> 02:53:49.310
coming from there. Okay. Some new guy came and gave the name

02:53:49.310 --> 02:53:53.470
of Y coding. Some new guy came and made an A2A protocol. MCP

02:53:53.470 --> 02:53:56.070
is made. Right. But actually, the fundamentals have not

02:53:56.070 --> 02:54:00.750
changed yet. If you see. But yes. Because of the so much of

02:54:00.750 --> 02:54:03.950
accessibility of social media. Right. So much of social

02:54:03.950 --> 02:54:07.010
awareness. It is also working as a poison for us somewhere.

02:54:07.930 --> 02:54:10.550
Right. Actually, there was a requirement from the client

02:54:10.550 --> 02:54:16.370
that he should give the presentation. I gave it to you. The

02:54:16.370 --> 02:54:17.670
client is also from the world. He must be watching YouTube

02:54:17.670 --> 02:54:19.990
right now. Yes. So, he said that I don't want to be behind

02:54:19.990 --> 02:54:23.970
it. So, now if he. And the maximum client is coming. Sir, he

02:54:23.970 --> 02:54:25.750
doesn't know. You also know. Right. Maximum client doesn't

02:54:25.750 --> 02:54:28.090
know. He doesn't know what he wants. Yes. He doesn't know.

02:54:28.890 --> 02:54:33.050
Even then, if he wants to embed it. Sir, if we. Yes. So, how

02:54:33.050 --> 02:54:37.950
in our use case. Can you show them once. Later. Yes. Okay.

02:54:38.030 --> 02:54:40.270
So, pick up an application. From the project you have made.

02:54:41.110 --> 02:54:43.530
Pick up an application from that. Yes. And there we have

02:54:43.530 --> 02:54:47.530
already shown that the MCP inspector. How will you expose a

02:54:47.530 --> 02:54:50.130
tool there. And then how will you expose the tool inside the

02:54:50.130 --> 02:54:54.310
cloud. So that. See what is cloud. Cloud accesses LLM. Now

02:54:54.310 --> 02:54:57.890
if we are putting some tool by making MCP. Any calculation.

02:54:58.770 --> 02:55:01.350
To do any logic. So, what will he do. First he will not hit

02:55:01.350 --> 02:55:03.990
the cloud. First he will search for my MCP. That basically

02:55:03.990 --> 02:55:09.010
we have made our own custom tool. Okay. And from there he

02:55:09.010 --> 02:55:12.010
will bring the data. And then he will send it to LLM. Got

02:55:12.010 --> 02:55:14.670
it. Okay. MCP is doing this. So, we have already made ten

02:55:14.670 --> 02:55:18.550
examples and shown you. Inside that MCP tutorial. Yes. There

02:55:18.550 --> 02:55:21.110
is MCP inspector in it. There is also cloud in it. Both have

02:55:21.110 --> 02:55:24.090
been given integration. Right. Majority approach. In this

02:55:24.090 --> 02:55:26.870
project. Sir. The whole code base has also been given. I

02:55:26.870 --> 02:55:29.790
wanted to ask one more thing. Like our app. Which is our

02:55:29.790 --> 02:55:35.430
application. Hmm. Now it is in such a way that. We select

02:55:35.430 --> 02:55:39.510
it. We go to the cloud and then write something. Hmm. So,

02:55:39.510 --> 02:55:42.050
how will this be integrated in our app. That we send only

02:55:42.050 --> 02:55:46.870
query. That like how to. What are the HR policies for XYZ

02:55:46.870 --> 02:55:53.330
company. Yes. Yes. And that direct. Our. What will you do.

02:55:53.390 --> 02:55:55.670
In our MCP. You will make a function. Which we call tool.

02:55:56.090 --> 02:55:58.110
MCP tool. Which you call. Right. You will write a function.

02:55:58.350 --> 02:56:01.830
Where your HR policies will be. You will give it access.

02:56:02.450 --> 02:56:06.070
Okay. Okay. Now let's suppose. That your chatbot is made by

02:56:06.070 --> 02:56:08.130
itself. Okay. Right. The chatbot is made by itself. So, what

02:56:08.130 --> 02:56:11.150
did you do. You exposed that tool as MCP. Like you write

02:56:11.150 --> 02:56:13.690
API. Yes. So, what does API mean. Yes. You expose it under

02:56:13.690 --> 02:56:18.510
one protocol. Right. Right. So that what happens. Now that

02:56:18.510 --> 02:56:20.830
URL is specific. Means it has become neutral. Any

02:56:20.830 --> 02:56:24.330
programming language can consume it. Okay. Right. MCP is

02:56:24.330 --> 02:56:27.450
also a protocol. Simple. Yes. Okay. So, if you convert one

02:56:27.450 --> 02:56:33.230
thing into MCP tool. So, any software. Any tool. MCP

02:56:33.230 --> 02:56:39.330
endpoint is given. You can call it there. Okay. Okay. This

02:56:39.330 --> 02:56:44.530
is what it means. Okay. Okay. Okay. Sir, I will try it once.

02:56:44.550 --> 02:56:48.830
Sir, one more question. Yes. Yes. Sir, as we are using this

02:56:48.830 --> 02:56:53.290
rag. We have used elastic database there. Yes. Yes. Now.

02:56:53.390 --> 02:56:54.750
Yes. But, there is that, we are using that same thing that

02:56:54.750 --> 02:56:59.130
cosine similarity KNN. Then we will do re-ranking and

02:56:59.130 --> 02:57:06.050
display it. Because there are many similar use cases there.

02:57:06.570 --> 02:57:12.370
Means there are many categories which are similar. So, our

02:57:12.370 --> 02:57:16.750
relevancy that is, I think that it is keyword based, sir.

02:57:17.270 --> 02:57:21.590
For example, I say, if I understand that our room booking is

02:57:21.590 --> 02:57:23.730
a class, our work is related Yes. I understand. Yes. Yes.

02:57:23.730 --> 02:57:31.850
Yes. How to book a seat, I am searching for a, till I don't

02:57:31.850 --> 02:57:35.950
write room booking but how to book a seat for myself is also

02:57:35.950 --> 02:57:40.430
sentimentally in room booking itself. So here the embedding

02:57:40.430 --> 02:57:43.190
is different. See what you are doing, you are using simple

02:57:43.190 --> 02:57:45.970
elasticsearch. Elasticsearch by default does keyword to

02:57:45.970 --> 02:57:49.190
keyword. That the percentage of keyword matches and it is

02:57:49.190 --> 02:57:51.710
quick. Its indexing is so good that basically it is quick

02:57:51.710 --> 02:57:56.010
elastic. Now embedding gives you an advantage that embedding

02:57:56.010 --> 02:58:00.990
does not wait for a complete match. When you put a small

02:58:00.990 --> 02:58:06.290
data in a very high dimension. So basically what happens is

02:58:06.290 --> 02:58:10.710
that it will never wait for a complete identification. That

02:58:10.710 --> 02:58:13.370
is why when we are removing cosine from here, we are getting

02:58:13.370 --> 02:58:19.010
an output of 50% or 56%. So it always tries to embedding.

02:58:19.610 --> 02:58:24.550
Because now its scale has increased. Let's suppose that in

02:58:24.550 --> 02:58:27.450
your data it was 10 words only. But when we used embedding,

02:58:27.710 --> 02:58:32.050
it was 1536. Means its dimension has increased a lot. It was

02:58:32.050 --> 02:58:35.070
just 10 keywords, right? In one data, it was 10 keywords.

02:58:35.250 --> 02:58:38.710
But in 1536, its length has increased to 4000. So you are

02:58:38.710 --> 02:58:41.070
representing it in that dimension. So obviously when my

02:58:41.070 --> 02:58:43.170
dimension will increase, it will be easier for me to match

02:58:43.170 --> 02:58:49.190
with accuracy. That's the fundamental. Right? Right. So your

02:58:49.190 --> 02:58:53.210
embedding concept. And all the people who are making

02:58:53.210 --> 02:58:56.130
recommendation systems these days. So mostly or the people

02:58:56.130 --> 02:58:59.790
who are making search indexing. So obviously they are

02:58:59.790 --> 02:59:08.190
shifting towards this embedding. Sir, I was saying that how

02:59:08.190 --> 02:59:15.190
to book a room. And our document is in the database, in RAG.

02:59:15.430 --> 02:59:18.890
That meeting, room meeting, booking, something like that.

02:59:18.890 --> 02:59:24.770
But how to book a seat is also sentiment. So we should go to

02:59:24.770 --> 02:59:29.130
the same class. We should get the same document. So how do

02:59:29.130 --> 02:59:31.210
we increase the semantic contextual understanding?

02:59:33.850 --> 02:59:36.750
Means this is very missing. Like if I have to search DevOps

02:59:36.750 --> 02:59:41.530
training. So that keyword has to be added. Like room

02:59:41.530 --> 02:59:44.810
meeting. So there should be room or meeting in it. That's

02:59:44.810 --> 02:59:48.010
what I am seeing. When these two words are there. And in the

02:59:48.010 --> 02:59:52.510
backend, it is KNN used in it. So now every user will not

02:59:52.510 --> 02:59:57.870
put room meeting. Like someone is searching for a seat. He

02:59:57.870 --> 03:00:01.670
picks up some other document and gives it. So here this

03:00:01.670 --> 03:00:04.950
contextual. The sentiments of both are contextual or

03:00:04.950 --> 03:00:08.610
semantic. Maybe that's what they call it. Means by

03:00:08.610 --> 03:00:13.450
understanding the word's semantics. Means in both these

03:00:13.450 --> 03:00:17.670
questions, the room meeting booking should have come. The

03:00:17.670 --> 03:00:19.830
relevant document. So in this, our relevancy becomes very

03:00:19.830 --> 03:00:23.550
less. This happens in many cases. That if the same keyword

03:00:23.550 --> 03:00:26.530
is not added. Which is in the rag document. So that

03:00:26.530 --> 03:00:31.470
semantics or its context is not understood. There the

03:00:31.470 --> 03:00:35.390
relevancy becomes very less. So how do we increase this?

03:00:35.750 --> 03:00:40.190
Even if the keywords are different. Or if the sentiment is

03:00:40.190 --> 03:00:46.230
the same. Even if the keyword is not in our rag. But if the

03:00:46.230 --> 03:00:49.890
sentiment is there. Then the document relevant comes at the

03:00:49.890 --> 03:00:52.490
top. So how do we increase its context or semantic

03:00:52.490 --> 03:00:58.210
understanding? This is a little bit of a problem. Yes, let's

03:00:58.210 --> 03:00:59.910
tell you one minute. This is the same problem. We were

03:00:59.910 --> 03:01:04.130
solving it a few days ago. Just give me two minutes. We have

03:01:04.130 --> 03:01:10.860
already done it. This is a major problem. Yes, this is a

03:01:10.860 --> 03:01:13.940
major problem. This is a major problem in all. There

03:02:32.110 --> 03:02:34.950
was a solution. I have made it. We are looking for it.

03:03:27.770 --> 03:03:30.970
First of all, we were doing this thing. That means when we

03:03:30.970 --> 03:03:34.990
were sending this request. Basically. So one solution that

03:03:34.990 --> 03:03:39.650
we tried initially. With some of our use cases. Which we

03:03:39.650 --> 03:03:44.810
were trying to build. Whenever we were sending data for a

03:03:44.810 --> 03:03:47.450
retrieval. Right. So before that we were sending the data.

03:03:47.570 --> 03:03:52.810
To a small LLM model. I mean to a lightweight model. And we

03:03:52.810 --> 03:03:56.630
were putting this problem to it. Like give me all the

03:03:56.630 --> 03:03:59.570
possible permutation and combination. Kind of means its

03:03:59.570 --> 03:04:02.730
intent was basically. Give me all the possible permutation

03:04:02.730 --> 03:04:06.210
and combination of this sentence. Means all the phrases that

03:04:06.210 --> 03:04:08.730
can be made out of it. Or all the meanings that can be

03:04:08.730 --> 03:04:12.550
there. So basically try to give me that. And then through

03:04:12.550 --> 03:04:15.250
that we were searching. But again that search becomes heavy.

03:04:15.570 --> 03:04:18.450
Because let's suppose that you put one simple sentence. And

03:04:18.450 --> 03:04:22.830
then its five multiple permutation combinations. So it

03:04:22.830 --> 03:04:26.550
becomes into 5x. So if you will do that search. Then your 5x

03:04:26.550 --> 03:04:29.950
search query increases there. So in terms of like a compute.

03:04:30.090 --> 03:04:33.410
And in terms of your latency. It increases there. So this is

03:04:33.410 --> 03:04:37.670
one of the approach. Which I remember we have applied. Apart

03:04:37.670 --> 03:04:42.110
from. I mean some of the rule base was also written in it.

03:04:42.790 --> 03:04:45.990
But yes this was the major implementation that we have done.

03:04:46.250 --> 03:04:48.910
That before sending for the retrieval. Let's send to the

03:04:48.910 --> 03:04:52.910
LLM. And generate all the possible. Output. Means possible

03:04:52.910 --> 03:04:55.910
phrases. Out of this sentence. For example if we are saying.

03:04:56.670 --> 03:05:00.830
Can you book a room. Right. If he is in office contest. Then

03:05:00.830 --> 03:05:02.730
can you book a meeting room. He will understand by himself.

03:05:03.170 --> 03:05:05.110
Okay. He will understand by himself basically. That okay.

03:05:05.230 --> 03:05:07.710
Can you book a meeting room. So we were doing this kind of

03:05:07.710 --> 03:05:10.130
permutation combination. But it was work around only. Means.

03:05:10.330 --> 03:05:13.790
And it was not a linear solution. Linear solution means. Its

03:05:13.790 --> 03:05:17.630
time complexity was very high. If you will get that sir.

03:05:17.710 --> 03:05:20.890
Then you tell. We have already built that solution. We had

03:05:20.890 --> 03:05:24.970
done this phase. We were building a use case in it. So we

03:05:24.970 --> 03:05:27.490
were trying to solve it. And this is the work around. We had

03:05:27.490 --> 03:05:29.670
taken out in it. Code wise we had done a lot of

03:05:29.670 --> 03:05:32.910
implementation. Based on the observation. But yes. This is

03:05:32.910 --> 03:05:34.690
one of the work around. That you can think of. That send

03:05:34.690 --> 03:05:37.830
your data. Means. Send your query. Before sending. To an

03:05:37.830 --> 03:05:41.010
embedding vector. Send to the LLM. Ask it to create a

03:05:41.010 --> 03:05:44.550
multiple query. Around it. And then you send some context of

03:05:44.550 --> 03:05:48.930
your document. Right. Right. Because till now LLM will not

03:05:48.930 --> 03:05:50.250
understand. That basically. I don't know. We have to take

03:05:50.250 --> 03:05:52.830
out multiple phrases. But in which context. In which

03:05:52.830 --> 03:05:56.090
direction. Yes. Right. Means. Basically. We have to book the

03:05:56.090 --> 03:05:58.350
room of the hotel. Or the room of the office. How will we

03:05:58.350 --> 03:06:01.250
know. Right. Right. So what we were doing. So we were trying

03:06:01.250 --> 03:06:03.570
to append a context. We were trying to append a memory.

03:06:04.050 --> 03:06:06.770
Sending to the LLMs. It will try to. Because LLM is the

03:06:06.770 --> 03:06:11.170
best. In terms of handling. A multi languages. Plus. In

03:06:11.170 --> 03:06:13.790
terms of generating. A multiple like. You know. Queries out

03:06:13.790 --> 03:06:17.650
of it. Right. Right. So we were sending to the LLMs. With a

03:06:17.650 --> 03:06:22.690
context. And with the memory. But again. There is not

03:06:22.690 --> 03:06:24.810
sufficient memory. Let's suppose. That you are talking.

03:06:25.010 --> 03:06:27.710
About the meeting room. Right. And the context. Has changed

03:06:27.710 --> 03:06:31.290
completely. So I don't have much memory. So in that case.

03:06:31.410 --> 03:06:33.450
Right. We were trying to even send. Append memory. Plus

03:06:33.450 --> 03:06:35.990
context. And sending it to LLM. And then. The return that

03:06:35.990 --> 03:06:37.770
was coming from that. So we were converting that. Into an

03:06:37.770 --> 03:06:41.390
embedding. And then going for the search. Right. Sir. I will

03:06:41.390 --> 03:06:46.190
try. Sir. I think. There was one more question. Like sir.

03:06:46.350 --> 03:06:53.170
This. The web searches. Hmm. Uh. I was making a POC. Uh. In

03:06:53.170 --> 03:06:58.530
Mtech. I was making it. In my. This. Hmm. So. These web

03:06:58.530 --> 03:07:02.690
searches. Which. Like what you have done. In Euron. Hmm.

03:07:02.930 --> 03:07:06.350
Whatever we are questioning. It is coming from the web. Hmm.

03:07:06.630 --> 03:07:10.550
So. Uh. If it has to be restricted. For a particular region.

03:07:10.910 --> 03:07:13.770
And. And it happens. I mean. For this. You will tell. A

03:07:13.770 --> 03:07:16.530
little. How. How. It happens.

03:07:20.250 --> 03:07:23.350
Like anywhere. Just like EC2. Generally. You are aware. Of

03:07:23.350 --> 03:07:27.270
the solutions. Right. Right. So. There. All. Always. You

03:07:27.270 --> 03:07:30.390
have. The option. Of. Inbound. and outbound. So. If you set

03:07:30.390 --> 03:07:32.650
inbound. That. This data is from this country. Or. This IP.

03:07:32.810 --> 03:07:37.150
Or. If I fail to hit it. And if I hit this port. No one will

03:07:37.150 --> 03:07:41.910
be able to. To do it. It is very simple and normal. All the

03:07:41.910 --> 03:07:45.270
developers do it by the way. Sir, how is the web search

03:07:45.270 --> 03:07:52.370
done? Web search is altogether a very different fundamental.

03:07:53.070 --> 03:07:56.030
Basically, you search in different pages and different

03:07:56.030 --> 03:08:00.390
indexes. It is like a very different kind of a system that

03:08:00.390 --> 03:08:04.390
Google has created. Google has published a research paper

03:08:04.390 --> 03:08:06.930
about it. You can go and see it. It is from Larry Page.

03:08:07.790 --> 03:08:13.110
Okay, Larry Page. Let me see the research paper. Yes, you

03:08:13.110 --> 03:08:15.490
can do regional blocking on the cloud front as well. If you

03:08:15.490 --> 03:08:20.450
are using CDN, then you can block it there as well. Or you

03:08:20.450 --> 03:08:23.430
can block inbound and outbound directly. There are multiple

03:08:23.430 --> 03:08:28.730
ways on the server side. Okay, sir. Sir, actually, I have

03:08:28.730 --> 03:08:31.750
just done this architect related. I have just started the

03:08:31.750 --> 03:08:35.570
system design that you have taught and DSA.

03:08:37.690 --> 03:08:44.030
So, if the goal is to go towards architect, AI, full stack

03:08:44.030 --> 03:08:51.870
architect. So, system design, DSA, and I think DevOps. DSA

03:08:51.870 --> 03:08:53.310
will work even if it is not correct. There is no problem.

03:08:53.730 --> 03:08:55.210
DSA is managed somewhere. But if you want to go to the

03:08:55.210 --> 03:08:59.310
architect side, then system design, some components, plus

03:08:59.310 --> 03:09:01.490
real-time system design. That means we have solved this

03:09:01.490 --> 03:09:06.010
problem and that too at a scale. And then I know that it can

03:09:06.010 --> 03:09:09.450
crash anytime. So, you will have to go in that direction.

03:09:10.190 --> 03:09:15.830
Rest, ops etc. are just enablers. System design is a core

03:09:15.830 --> 03:09:21.550
concept. Okay. I have started yours, sir. We have not

03:09:21.550 --> 03:09:23.830
started uploading lectures much. We took a class a few days

03:09:23.830 --> 03:09:27.430
ago. I think data science architecture and system design.

03:09:27.550 --> 03:09:30.290
Sorry, data science architecture. After that, we launched

03:09:30.290 --> 03:09:32.890
this batch. So, I will start putting up some recordings

03:09:32.890 --> 03:09:35.710
there. Yes, sir. I was watching the system design yesterday.

03:09:36.190 --> 03:09:39.090
It is very interesting, sir. It was a little bit of data

03:09:39.090 --> 03:09:44.310
science. So, now we are doing a pure system design. It

03:09:44.310 --> 03:09:46.590
happens that we are starting from scratch for them. So, we

03:09:46.590 --> 03:09:49.710
are bringing it for them too. So, it will be live. It will

03:09:49.710 --> 03:09:52.430
be a live batch. It will be recorded. Hybrid one. We have

03:09:52.430 --> 03:09:54.430
already launched it. There is no recording in it. We could

03:09:54.430 --> 03:09:57.830
not get time to record it. So, it will already come in that.

03:09:59.070 --> 03:10:02.270
No, no, no. It is separate. Separate. Separate. Okay.

03:10:02.410 --> 03:10:06.030
Because I was watching it. So, a lot of things were getting

03:10:06.030 --> 03:10:08.690
clear from it. It is full of data science. It is pure data

03:10:08.690 --> 03:10:11.910
science system design, basically. Okay. But it is not

03:10:11.910 --> 03:10:17.250
complete yet, right? No, it is not complete yet. I think you

03:10:17.250 --> 03:10:18.990
are talking about something else. Maybe you send me a link.

03:10:19.350 --> 03:10:22.550
We will give you a gladiator. You have taught HLD and low

03:10:22.550 --> 03:10:27.810
-level design. You have started with URI in it. Sir, sir,

03:10:27.810 --> 03:10:30.670
sir. I think it is completed. I think it is completed. Okay.

03:10:30.910 --> 03:10:36.930
Okay. Okay. We will see. Okay. Okay. So, thank you. And

03:10:36.930 --> 03:10:40.890
Mukesh, I think who is sharing the screen? Navneet, right?

03:10:41.090 --> 03:10:45.050
Ravi Teja. Okay. Ravi Teja is sharing a screen. Navneet is

03:10:45.050 --> 03:10:47.610
sharing a screen. Ranjeet, I think you have even asked for

03:10:47.610 --> 03:10:49.970
me to like share the screen. So, please share the screen.

03:10:50.350 --> 03:10:52.930
Okay. So, one by one by one. So, let's start closing your

03:10:52.930 --> 03:10:56.610
like doubts. I think it will be quick. So, While creating an

03:10:56.610 --> 03:11:01.390
environment, I am facing an issue. So, here I am unable to

03:11:01.390 --> 03:11:07.800
see this kind of environment when I create it. Okay. Fine.

03:11:07.900 --> 03:11:10.120
Ravi. So, give me a remote control.

03:11:14.680 --> 03:11:19.720
Let me do it. Conda create hyphen n test.

03:11:22.000 --> 03:11:22.560
Python

03:11:25.600 --> 03:11:28.380
is equals to 3.10. I

03:11:34.270 --> 03:11:38.170
think you have already created the environment. Like I can

03:11:38.170 --> 03:11:40.130
see some data, but fine. Okay.

03:11:43.570 --> 03:11:44.050
Okay.

03:12:18.920 --> 03:12:22.900
So, in between. Okay. So, installation is going on in the

03:12:22.900 --> 03:12:26.340
screen. Okay. Navneet, what is your issue? Oh, actually,

03:12:26.560 --> 03:12:33.940
this one I'm trying to install this deploy this API. So,

03:12:34.020 --> 03:12:38.940
that is coming. So, What is the error? Excited with the

03:12:38.940 --> 03:12:43.300
status 127 something is coming. Unicorn command not found.

03:12:43.380 --> 03:12:45.980
UVCon command not found. So, you have I think mentioned

03:12:45.980 --> 03:12:51.900
UVCon in a capital U I believe. Yeah. So, it's a capital U.

03:12:52.020 --> 03:12:57.060
So, just go ahead and check your UVCon command. Okay. Let me

03:12:57.060 --> 03:13:00.140
close our Ravi's. I got you got your issue Navneet by the

03:13:00.140 --> 03:13:04.680
way. So, here Ravi I think environment has been created. So,

03:13:04.680 --> 03:13:08.280
now if I have to use it. So, Conda activate. A C T I V A T.

03:13:08.660 --> 03:13:11.220
Activate. And the environment name which is test. So, now

03:13:11.220 --> 03:13:14.740
you will be able to see a test environment. So, see it has

03:13:14.740 --> 03:13:17.820
started using it. Now, let's suppose if I have to change a

03:13:17.820 --> 03:13:23.570
kernel. So, select another kernel. And Python environment.

03:13:31.160 --> 03:13:35.900
Virtual and must have created the test environment by the

03:13:35.900 --> 03:13:39.200
way. Select another kernel.

03:14:16.420 --> 03:14:20.720
So, why it is not showing me the environment which I have

03:14:20.720 --> 03:14:21.100
created.

03:14:23.930 --> 03:14:25.330
Okay. D

03:14:34.200 --> 03:14:37.940
drive Conda environment. Test. I

03:14:52.880 --> 03:14:54.520
just think Jupyter server.

03:15:38.660 --> 03:15:43.980
Navneet in render platform go to settings.

03:15:48.580 --> 03:15:57.760
This is. Settings down left side. Events down. This one.

03:15:57.840 --> 03:16:02.300
Okay. So, there start start command you have to search.

03:16:07.020 --> 03:16:07.660
Down.

03:16:11.510 --> 03:16:14.930
Yeah. Here caps you is there. Edit and change it.

03:16:21.530 --> 03:16:23.030
Down edit is there.

03:16:26.260 --> 03:16:29.800
Okay. Now, edit option is not there. No. No. Start command

03:16:29.800 --> 03:16:37.190
input box down. There is a edit. Right. This one. Just

03:16:37.190 --> 03:16:44.920
below. Oh, but. Edit option not coming. No. Box. That input

03:16:44.920 --> 03:16:48.800
box down side. Right. Right side. Right corner. Down side.

03:16:48.880 --> 03:16:51.540
Edit is there. This one. This one. Yes. Up one. Up one.

03:16:52.900 --> 03:16:53.340
Okay.

03:17:00.490 --> 03:17:02.290
Yeah. You

03:17:07.220 --> 03:17:11.960
need to deploy again. I think. It is building.

03:17:17.080 --> 03:17:17.520
Now.

03:18:20.890 --> 03:18:26.010
Okay. So, normally this is fixed. Yeah. Yes. Okay. Okay. So,

03:18:26.170 --> 03:18:28.470
anyone else. I think multiple people can share the screen.

03:18:28.630 --> 03:18:30.730
So, while I am resolving the doubt from others. Right. So,

03:18:30.830 --> 03:18:33.950
other people can also share the screen. And anyone can

03:18:33.950 --> 03:18:38.690
select to like select and see any other screens. That is

03:18:38.690 --> 03:18:40.850
possible in this webinar setting.

03:18:48.200 --> 03:18:54.620
Sorry. What is the question Anjit? Sorry. Armaan. Right. So,

03:18:54.720 --> 03:18:57.680
this those steps that you have shown that's reprocessing

03:18:57.680 --> 03:19:01.120
step that those 100 degree or when you can get some of the.

03:19:01.380 --> 03:19:05.400
Not able to understand your question by the way. So, am I

03:19:05.400 --> 03:19:08.740
audible now? Yeah. You are audible. So, I was asking about

03:19:08.740 --> 03:19:11.540
the pre-processing step that you have just done in this

03:19:11.540 --> 03:19:15.060
lecture about the after the generating the embedding part.

03:19:15.220 --> 03:19:19.400
So, that is necessary or we can skip some of them. Pre

03:19:19.400 --> 03:19:22.180
-processing you are saying. Right. Yes. Yes. So, actually in

03:19:22.180 --> 03:19:25.340
a real life you will add more. So, you can't escape it. You

03:19:25.340 --> 03:19:28.260
will keep on adding more and more because it's not like you

03:19:28.260 --> 03:19:31.180
will be able to get a polished and a structured data. So, it

03:19:31.180 --> 03:19:36.600
will be like keep on increasing it. Okay. And so, one follow

03:19:36.600 --> 03:19:40.300
-up question in what in recently that you have told about

03:19:40.300 --> 03:19:45.260
the different scenario that we can give an input for example

03:19:45.260 --> 03:19:48.640
booking a seat or something. So, in that case how to handle

03:19:48.640 --> 03:19:52.360
that situation. You can either deep explanation. Not now

03:19:52.360 --> 03:19:57.900
maybe in later stage. Okay. That maybe. In later stage you

03:19:57.900 --> 03:20:00.440
can add a deep explanation to that like how can we handle

03:20:00.440 --> 03:20:04.040
that situation. Exactly. Exactly. We will try to bring some

03:20:04.040 --> 03:20:07.580
of the cases for that. But yeah like I think I have already

03:20:07.580 --> 03:20:10.340
talked about the solution that we were trying to build right

03:20:10.340 --> 03:20:14.580
and the approach that we have applied for that one. Not the

03:20:14.580 --> 03:20:18.780
best one but yeah. So, it was giving us some sort of a

03:20:18.780 --> 03:20:23.720
better result. Okay. And so, one more thing about that RAG

03:20:23.720 --> 03:20:27.840
masters have you completed that or some parts are still in

03:20:27.840 --> 03:20:30.020
the learning. No. RAG master I have already completed it.

03:20:30.160 --> 03:20:36.100
So, RAG master is closed. Okay. So. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah.

03:20:37.460 --> 03:20:40.940
Ravi I think. Should I show? Yeah. So, I think there is some

03:20:40.940 --> 03:20:44.140
issue with your path because it is not able to recognize

03:20:44.140 --> 03:20:49.360
maybe while installing a conda you have set some path for a

03:20:49.360 --> 03:20:52.340
conda in a different directory. So, in some D drive I think

03:20:52.340 --> 03:20:57.860
I can see you have done. So, it is not able to recognize in

03:20:57.860 --> 03:20:59.140
a proper

03:21:00.960 --> 03:21:05.800
directory and because of that it is giving you an issue. Sir

03:21:05.800 --> 03:21:10.700
can you see my screen. Just a minute. Yeah. I can see. I am

03:21:10.700 --> 03:21:12.780
solving Ravi's problem then I will come back to you.

03:21:15.780 --> 03:21:19.640
Okay. Let's do one thing. So,

03:21:35.230 --> 03:21:38.210
you have just messed up in your system with the file path.

03:21:38.210 --> 03:21:40.250
That is an issue.

03:22:07.240 --> 03:22:10.260
Python 3.1 is not available. Okay. Not an issue. We will

03:22:10.260 --> 03:22:10.840
download it.

03:23:18.820 --> 03:23:23.200
Yeah. Navneet what is your problem? So, that again error is

03:23:23.200 --> 03:23:31.420
coming. Navneet right? Yes. No. No. I am talking about

03:23:31.420 --> 03:23:34.560
Navneet basically. So, again error is coming. What is the

03:23:34.560 --> 03:23:38.640
error this time? Excited with the status 1 this. That is not

03:23:38.640 --> 03:23:41.820
an error by the way. So, that is just a message. Now error

03:23:41.820 --> 03:23:43.380
has changed. Previous error was gone. It was different.

03:23:43.620 --> 03:23:45.600
Previous error was uecon error. Now error has changed. Again

03:23:45.600 --> 03:23:49.440
the fail. It will come. Fine. But error has changed. The

03:23:49.440 --> 03:23:52.020
mistake that you have been doing before it is not the same.

03:23:52.880 --> 03:23:55.380
Yeah. Before it was different. Now it is different.

03:24:04.760 --> 03:24:07.080
Just a minute. I am solving Ravi's problem.

03:24:26.810 --> 03:24:28.710
Okay. So. You

03:25:11.560 --> 03:25:15.420
have to make the full path for Python 3.1 and it will be

03:25:15.420 --> 03:25:18.920
three words. He has not set his system path. So, because of

03:25:18.920 --> 03:25:22.520
that it is giving a lot of issue not just one. Yeah. His

03:25:22.520 --> 03:25:25.660
conda path is not correct. It is somewhere in a D drive or

03:25:25.660 --> 03:25:30.660
something. He has just like messed up with the entire system

03:25:30.660 --> 03:25:34.700
itself. Yeah. You have to pull like full path like the

03:25:34.700 --> 03:25:40.920
absolute path for it for this one. The program file may be

03:25:40.920 --> 03:25:42.380
somewhere in a user or something.

03:25:48.780 --> 03:25:54.520
Can you search for conda like because sometimes it is in the

03:25:54.520 --> 03:26:02.280
roaming or sometimes it gets into the user. Yeah. So, C

03:26:03.750 --> 03:26:08.670
drive then maybe users what

03:26:10.620 --> 03:26:17.100
is his name basically maybe this one I am assuming and then

03:26:17.100 --> 03:26:27.220
conda 3. Okay. And then somewhere in a envs.

03:26:30.740 --> 03:26:31.700
There

03:26:37.680 --> 03:26:40.920
is a vector db. I think that is the way that you are looking

03:26:40.920 --> 03:26:47.400
for the third one from the from the lower side. Yep. Yeah.

03:26:47.560 --> 03:26:54.040
These are the envs he has created and python executable but

03:26:54.040 --> 03:26:58.620
still I am looking for a python executable mini conda fine

03:26:58.620 --> 03:27:04.620
local not here users and

03:27:06.730 --> 03:27:07.990
then user

03:27:10.480 --> 03:27:15.940
name and then app data. Okay.

03:27:20.670 --> 03:27:26.030
So, here is the app data then local and

03:27:39.120 --> 03:27:39.740
programs.

03:28:31.510 --> 03:28:36.750
There is a space. Okay. Do one thing Ravi a lot of like

03:28:36.750 --> 03:28:40.750
issues you have already created in your system just close

03:28:40.750 --> 03:28:44.390
everything and use this environment current one that is

03:28:44.390 --> 03:28:48.950
better. Yeah. Because in your system. So, again I have to

03:28:48.950 --> 03:28:51.530
handle your space issue which you have already created in

03:28:51.530 --> 03:28:54.550
your system. Yeah. A lot of lot of things. So, it is better

03:28:54.550 --> 03:28:57.330
to use this environment and then let us do one thing

03:28:57.330 --> 03:29:01.990
uninstall your vs code uninstall the complete conda

03:29:01.990 --> 03:29:06.090
uninstall the complete python because even python wise I can

03:29:06.090 --> 03:29:09.870
see that there are multiple python version which has been

03:29:09.870 --> 03:29:16.470
created. So, 3.11 3.13 3.9 3.10 so all of this version has

03:29:16.470 --> 03:29:20.290
been created just wipe out everything and then do a proper

03:29:20.290 --> 03:29:23.530
setup. Your system is literally like a mess. It is not able

03:29:23.530 --> 03:29:26.690
to recognize even a conda. Yeah. So, just wipe out

03:29:26.690 --> 03:29:28.770
everything and for now you can try to use the same

03:29:28.770 --> 03:29:33.850
environment. That is fine. It will work. Anyhow. Okay. Yeah.

03:29:34.170 --> 03:29:40.450
Just uninstall everything. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. There is a walk

03:29:40.450 --> 03:29:42.970
around I can fix the issue because I was able to see the

03:29:42.970 --> 03:29:46.030
location but again unnecessarily it will give you a problem

03:29:46.030 --> 03:29:48.490
again and again and again. So, not just today. Today I will

03:29:48.490 --> 03:29:50.630
fix it but again tomorrow you will come with the same thing.

03:29:50.630 --> 03:29:53.150
Though it is better. Just wipe out the system and do the

03:29:53.150 --> 03:29:57.690
installation once again. Yeah. Okay. Sure. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

03:29:57.770 --> 03:30:01.090
No need. Next one. So, what is the issue that you are

03:30:01.090 --> 03:30:04.210
facing? Common troubleshooting you delay this is running

03:30:04.210 --> 03:30:09.750
file. Show me the file. Line number 8. Ubicon. Okay. And

03:30:09.750 --> 03:30:12.030
what is the deployment that you are trying to do by the way?

03:30:12.430 --> 03:30:17.270
This is API that first second class you taught. Give me the

03:30:17.270 --> 03:30:18.130
control. Give me control.

03:30:21.020 --> 03:30:26.200
Where is your like repository? Yeah. This is. This is the

03:30:26.200 --> 03:30:28.740
repository. Right. Read me requirement test. Wifi testing.

03:30:29.020 --> 03:30:32.240
Dot. Wifi. So, which file you are deploying test. Dot.

03:30:32.240 --> 03:30:38.160
Testing. Both testing. Dot. Fi. Using this one. Sorry.

03:30:38.720 --> 03:30:39.660
Testing. Dot. Fi.

03:33:51.720 --> 03:33:53.800
Okay. So, in between after what is your issue?

03:33:57.200 --> 03:33:58.380
Yes. Actually.

03:34:01.060 --> 03:34:03.960
Actually, I have fixed that issue. The one I was getting

03:34:03.960 --> 03:34:07.840
here. Okay. Maybe I wanted to understand that what is what

03:34:07.840 --> 03:34:13.600
was the issue here. I ran this command. And then. I think

03:34:13.600 --> 03:34:19.120
command looks fine to me. Yeah. Yeah. So, command looks

03:34:19.120 --> 03:34:22.740
fine. So, I think it should work. I'm just.

03:34:27.100 --> 03:34:36.480
Yeah. Yeah. Yes. No. So. Yes. No. Yeah. Except. Yeah. Yeah.

03:34:36.900 --> 03:34:42.380
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So, in computer. So. So,

03:34:42.380 --> 03:34:44.700
in a terminal only. It will be able to accept it. So, man.

03:34:46.500 --> 03:34:52.560
Exactly. That's a correct way. Yeah, you're having a good

03:34:52.560 --> 03:34:57.840
appointment. Yeah. Answers. Want me to has your, like, I had

03:34:57.840 --> 03:35:03.760
a ish on that. No, I don't want to do it. None of my down.

03:35:04.900 --> 03:35:09.640
Again. I zero. Didn't charge it, but lagi. and it told me

03:35:09.640 --> 03:35:13.600
that don't create the environment is that is OTP, OTP, OPD

03:35:13.600 --> 03:35:17.400
folder, but I was not able to change because here folded a

03:35:17.400 --> 03:35:21.120
structure I'm not able to understand in Mac. No, no, it's

03:35:21.120 --> 03:35:24.320
fine. So it is taking by default the path it has selected at

03:35:24.320 --> 03:35:27.320
the time of installation of software, right? Using a conda.

03:35:27.360 --> 03:35:29.960
So whenever it has tall conda, so that was a path, uh,

03:35:30.120 --> 03:35:32.340
because this is what it is trying to show you OPD and a

03:35:32.340 --> 03:35:34.720
conda three environment, right? So that is the default path

03:35:34.720 --> 03:35:38.300
that you have selected or it has taken. Maybe this is the

03:35:38.300 --> 03:35:41.240
default city by default, by default, it was taken and then

03:35:41.240 --> 03:35:43.800
it's fine. It's fine. It was not allowing me to install. So

03:35:43.800 --> 03:35:48.420
again, uh, I asked to chat GPT and just, uh, uh, so they

03:35:48.420 --> 03:35:51.340
showed me one command to change this path itself. So somehow

03:35:51.340 --> 03:35:54.980
it was somewhere I had fired that one, this one, I believe

03:35:54.980 --> 03:36:02.200
someone saying no such file directory. Yeah. Uh, so now

03:36:02.200 --> 03:36:04.920
you're able to get the environment, right? That is, I have,

03:36:04.940 --> 03:36:08.120
I have a fixed now. No, but I just wanted to understand that

03:36:08.120 --> 03:36:11.040
how I can change the environment itself. Like for example,

03:36:11.080 --> 03:36:13.280
if you have to, if you have to change the environment,

03:36:13.440 --> 03:36:15.900
right? So let's suppose, uh, you are in which environment is

03:36:15.900 --> 03:36:19.840
a from base environment. Not sure that how can I, how can I

03:36:19.840 --> 03:36:24.400
see this? Okay. Let's come down. Okay, fine. So you are

03:36:24.400 --> 03:36:26.820
basically into a V environment, virtual environment, which

03:36:26.820 --> 03:36:29.900
name is basically a base environment. And again, in your,

03:36:29.960 --> 03:36:33.080
like a editor left-hand side, uh, V environment, and then

03:36:33.080 --> 03:36:36.360
there, uh, what your environment is. It is trying. Okay.

03:36:36.740 --> 03:36:40.260
Yeah. So just right. Conda deactivate. That's right. Conda

03:36:40.260 --> 03:36:43.300
deactivate. It will deactivate all the environments and that

03:36:43.300 --> 03:36:48.200
is your actual base environment deactivate. So every time I

03:36:48.200 --> 03:36:51.460
have to, uh, activate the environment. Yeah. So now you are

03:36:51.460 --> 03:36:54.020
into no environment. Now, if you have to go into a base

03:36:54.020 --> 03:36:55.920
environment, so maybe you can try to give an environment

03:36:55.920 --> 03:36:58.520
name and then it will eventually get into that environment.

03:36:59.480 --> 03:37:03.160
How can I, how can I, um, so conduct and then entire

03:37:03.160 --> 03:37:05.700
environment path, the above one that you are able to see.

03:37:05.700 --> 03:37:15.560
Right. Yeah. This one. No, no, not this. Not this one. No,

03:37:15.900 --> 03:37:18.320
no, no. That is what a creation, right? It is trying to

03:37:18.320 --> 03:37:23.500
create once again. So the command

03:37:23.500 --> 03:37:25.460
that you are able to see above the command that you are able

03:37:25.460 --> 03:37:27.780
to see about all this one. This one. Okay. Conductive at

03:37:27.780 --> 03:37:30.680
this one. Yeah. Come on. You should copy paste. Right. Yeah.

03:37:30.740 --> 03:37:34.540
Only come on. Only come on. Not dollar sign. Okay. Okay.

03:37:37.190 --> 03:37:40.690
Okay. Okay. Okay. So the command is to deactivate. So every

03:37:40.690 --> 03:37:43.710
time once I will work, I'll be working on using the conda,

03:37:43.730 --> 03:37:47.310
then I have to activate and if it is not in use, then I have

03:37:47.310 --> 03:37:51.490
to deactivate it. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Simple. Okay. That is one

03:37:51.490 --> 03:37:56.810
thing. And since it is Mac now yesterday, while I was

03:37:56.810 --> 03:38:03.530
checking this, uh, this one. Okay. So because of this use

03:38:03.530 --> 03:38:08.170
because of huge or an integration of this data, it was

03:38:08.170 --> 03:38:12.210
started giving me data. issues so some like gpu issues were

03:38:12.210 --> 03:38:15.530
started coming i asked to chat gpt and it suggested me to

03:38:15.530 --> 03:38:20.530
yeah keep it keep it cpu yeah so i use this command so my

03:38:20.530 --> 03:38:25.730
doubt is that uh for the next like upcoming classes like uh

03:38:25.730 --> 03:38:30.090
whatever the uh things that we are going to perform so my

03:38:30.090 --> 03:38:33.750
system will handle it or i need to your system will not be

03:38:33.750 --> 03:38:36.550
able to handle or anyone's uh system is not be able to

03:38:36.550 --> 03:38:40.030
handle uh the heavy load wherever we need a gpu inferencing

03:38:40.510 --> 03:38:42.630
at that point of time anyhow we are going ahead with the

03:38:42.630 --> 03:38:47.330
cloud okay so no one is having a system which will be able

03:38:47.330 --> 03:38:50.350
to handle like uh uh inferencing with the heavy load like a

03:38:50.350 --> 03:38:54.210
20 billion 120 billion kind of things so forget about it

03:38:54.210 --> 03:38:57.470
like whether it's a cpu gpu is fine uh even though if you

03:38:57.470 --> 03:39:00.490
have a small gpus it is not going to be very much useful it

03:39:00.490 --> 03:39:03.850
was giving me exception like the mps mps kind of exception

03:39:03.850 --> 03:39:06.050
so like yeah by the way by default it was running into it

03:39:06.050 --> 03:39:08.730
we're looking for i checked this command and it was saying

03:39:08.730 --> 03:39:12.630
that mps like that so i now i tested it and it worked fine

03:39:12.630 --> 03:39:16.110
there is no issue for now but today i was facing this issue

03:39:16.110 --> 03:39:19.110
so it was it was looking for actually a kuda but your like a

03:39:19.110 --> 03:39:21.450
hardware is not compatible with that so that's the reason

03:39:21.450 --> 03:39:25.910
now you have set it up as a cpu so it will work yeah so uh

03:39:25.910 --> 03:39:29.110
uh if you are using cpu then it means that my processing

03:39:29.110 --> 03:39:34.490
will be slow obviously so like yesterday i saw your command

03:39:34.990 --> 03:39:39.270
it took you only 5 seconds to execute it it took me 15

03:39:39.270 --> 03:39:43.750
seconds for this my cpu is also much heavier than your

03:39:43.750 --> 03:39:48.750
system yes it took me 5 seconds for this and then when i uh

03:39:48.750 --> 03:39:54.630
here when i am taking python as the base environment here

03:39:54.630 --> 03:40:00.590
this one 3.13 so it is being executed in 15 seconds but

03:40:00.590 --> 03:40:04.450
yesterday on anaconda i mean i didn't see it on anaconda it

03:40:04.450 --> 03:40:08.430
was executed in 15 seconds and the same moment i was using

03:40:08.430 --> 03:40:10.170
python 10 and it didn't show any issue but it also doesn't

03:40:10.170 --> 03:40:11.270
happen in any case it didn't work in any way it is very

03:40:11.270 --> 03:40:15.230
different from the environment it is just a folder and apart

03:40:15.230 --> 03:40:17.770
from that nothing is happening in the environment it depends

03:40:17.770 --> 03:40:22.430
on what you are executing so but it took a lot of time but

03:40:22.430 --> 03:40:25.550
it did't execute then i later i checked hrgpt and that's

03:40:25.550 --> 03:40:28.810
when i came to this environment and then it worked there

03:40:28.810 --> 03:40:30.510
will be no environment issue maybe you are executing it

03:40:30.510 --> 03:40:35.910
heavily or maybe not maybe same thing no it is possible It

03:40:35.910 --> 03:40:37.850
should not be like that because the environment does not

03:40:37.850 --> 03:40:41.990
happen, it is like a folder, when you call the library and

03:40:41.990 --> 03:40:45.970
import it, then it goes to that folder and brings its

03:40:45.970 --> 03:40:48.250
supporting file, this is the meaning of the environment,

03:40:48.650 --> 03:40:53.430
nothing else happens. One minute, see here it will be

03:40:53.430 --> 03:40:57.730
executed in about 5-6 seconds. Okay, I understand, that

03:40:57.730 --> 03:41:00.550
means sometimes the system does bad things. That's why it

03:41:00.550 --> 03:41:06.010
does bad things. It's too much now, 11-12, it should be done

03:41:06.010 --> 03:41:08.750
in about 15-16 seconds, it's

03:41:12.940 --> 03:41:15.980
not happening, it took 20 seconds now. Now I will change the

03:41:15.980 --> 03:41:20.620
environment here, okay, this was the base now, I had this

03:41:20.620 --> 03:41:23.620
one, the one with anaconda, I will do python, now it will be

03:41:23.620 --> 03:41:28.680
executed quickly. What you have done is good, reverse the

03:41:28.680 --> 03:41:33.160
process again, it will be the same, it will be the same. It

03:41:33.160 --> 03:41:34.720
is taking the same time. So tomorrow, I mean, it will be the

03:41:34.720 --> 03:41:36.380
same. I was having a lot of problems, so this is what I

03:41:36.380 --> 03:41:42.960
wanted. Does the environment have any impact in this? No,

03:41:43.260 --> 03:41:45.760
absolutely not. See here, I think it has been more than 20

03:41:45.760 --> 03:41:50.520
seconds. Yes, it does not matter, it happens, you may have

03:41:50.520 --> 03:41:53.500
some other process that you have opened, your CPU

03:41:53.500 --> 03:41:55.780
consumption will be going there, many things will happen.

03:41:55.920 --> 03:41:59.480
There is not much process, this is all. Back-end process,

03:41:59.640 --> 03:42:01.400
background process, it happens many times that you will not

03:42:01.400 --> 03:42:06.200
know. That is not an issue, there was never an issue with

03:42:06.200 --> 03:42:09.960
the environment, by the way. One more thing was that, as we

03:42:09.960 --> 03:42:13.980
are making the environment, so how do I find the directory

03:42:13.980 --> 03:42:17.760
of it here? Here, by default, if you are making the

03:42:17.760 --> 03:42:19.320
environment with python, then it makes the directory there,

03:42:19.440 --> 03:42:20.580
if you are doing it with conda, then it makes it in the

03:42:20.580 --> 03:42:26.320
anaconda folder. So if I go to this, this. If you do it with

03:42:26.320 --> 03:42:30.280
python, then it makes it there. The environment is visible

03:42:30.280 --> 03:42:32.400
there. If it happens with anaconda, then you have to go to

03:42:32.400 --> 03:42:36.260
the anaconda folder and see. So where I installed it, it

03:42:36.260 --> 03:42:39.120
should come there. Exactly. So the anaconda folder will be

03:42:39.120 --> 03:42:41.320
pointing there, right? In your system, somewhere inside the

03:42:41.320 --> 03:42:46.320
user. It will remain inside the folder. Exactly. Yes, it

03:42:46.320 --> 03:42:49.240
will be in the anaconda. I have loaded a lot of environments

03:42:49.240 --> 03:42:53.120
here. So the name of the folder is visible above. Yes.

03:42:53.180 --> 03:42:57.860
Anaconda distribution, anaconda 3, bin python. Anaconda

03:42:57.860 --> 03:42:58.680
distribution, anaconda 3, bin python. Ok.

03:43:01.570 --> 03:43:05.110
Ok. So, we have come to this. And I had one more doubt.

03:43:05.350 --> 03:43:10.390
Maths being used in this. How much, uh. If you see in the

03:43:10.390 --> 03:43:14.370
data science, you will see. It is used in the same math. Now

03:43:14.370 --> 03:43:17.610
see 1 plus 2 you will say, he calls it math, then we do not

03:43:17.610 --> 03:43:21.910
call it math. Yes, it means it is around. Plus 2. Yes,

03:43:22.030 --> 03:43:24.750
yesterday we did cosine similarity. So if we introduced a

03:43:24.750 --> 03:43:29.450
term in it, then from where will we speak it, the math? No.

03:43:29.450 --> 03:43:32.730
No, it was not too much math, but anyway. No, math is used.

03:43:34.650 --> 03:43:37.690
What concepts are going to be used here? Nothing, whatever

03:43:37.690 --> 03:43:40.070
will be used will be taught. If you want to find the cost,

03:43:40.130 --> 03:43:43.350
then the cost is very easy. Everyone knows it. Even if you

03:43:43.350 --> 03:43:46.210
don't know it, it takes hardly 30 seconds to recall it. You

03:43:46.210 --> 03:43:48.830
will recall it and we will teach it that way. So, don't

03:43:48.830 --> 03:43:51.110
worry about it. Whatever math is going to be used, we will

03:43:51.110 --> 03:43:55.350
come out explaining it together. But ideally, I don't say

03:43:55.350 --> 03:43:59.990
those terms as a math. This is a common sense thing. That

03:43:59.990 --> 03:44:03.110
even if you don't know it, there is no problem. I know it. I

03:44:03.110 --> 03:44:05.990
will just recall it. I will just re-explore it. It happens

03:44:05.990 --> 03:44:07.950
that we don't remember many things. Cos theta, sin theta,

03:44:08.150 --> 03:44:11.230
tan theta, cosec theta. We don't remember all these. That's

03:44:11.230 --> 03:44:17.070
pretty much obvious. No, it's not about remembering. It's a

03:44:17.070 --> 03:44:19.770
common term. We will recall it. It's been a few days. I

03:44:19.770 --> 03:44:26.710
recall college once. Exactly. As the class goes on, you

03:44:26.710 --> 03:44:30.010
should recall it. Okay? That's the math. You don't need math

03:44:30.010 --> 03:44:36.250
for that. Okay. And there is no doubt about it. Okay. I will

03:44:36.250 --> 03:44:39.430
do that in today's class. After that, I will practice. Tell

03:44:39.430 --> 03:44:45.770
me your doubt. Oh, absolutely. Okay. One minute. One minute.

03:44:45.870 --> 03:44:50.370
One minute. So, Nadeem is done. One minute. One minute. Just

03:44:50.370 --> 03:44:57.070
give me a second. I will solve one by one. Ranjit. Ranjit,

03:44:57.130 --> 03:45:02.650
right? Yeah, Ranjit. Yeah. Can you see my machine? Yeah, you

03:45:02.650 --> 03:45:07.350
are also sharing this one, right? Render. Yeah. It's a small

03:45:07.350 --> 03:45:09.550
issue, but I don't know why it's not recognizing

03:45:09.550 --> 03:45:15.290
requirements. TXT. Okay. I mean, I just, I didn't change

03:45:15.290 --> 03:45:20.550
anything in your code. I mean, T-S dot TXT. Can you please

03:45:20.550 --> 03:45:26.750
show me your repository? Oh, this is exactly the same as I

03:45:26.750 --> 03:45:30.830
haven't done any change. Okay. No. So, basically, your

03:45:30.830 --> 03:45:34.390
directory is different. I can see that. It's Gen AI and in

03:45:34.390 --> 03:45:37.010
that. Gen AI inside that you have an API testing and inside

03:45:37.010 --> 03:45:39.950
that there is a testing.py file. And there's a directory

03:45:39.950 --> 03:45:42.830
change and it is not able to organize it. Go to render. I'll

03:45:42.830 --> 03:45:47.330
show you. I'll tell you how to do it. Okay. So. Go to new.

03:45:47.510 --> 03:45:50.970
Go to new. Go to new. Leave it. Leave everything. Let's do a

03:45:50.970 --> 03:45:55.250
new. Yeah. Go to new. Web service. You have folder inside

03:45:55.250 --> 03:45:58.610
folder. Select the first one. Yeah. Yeah. Select the first

03:45:58.610 --> 03:46:00.850
one. First one. No, no, no. Repository. Repository. Yeah.

03:46:00.930 --> 03:46:04.150
So, the first one. Okay. Now. So, Gen AI. Come down. Come

03:46:04.150 --> 03:46:08.530
down. Fine. So, Gen AI and then main and then root

03:46:08.530 --> 03:46:13.370
directory. Okay. So, basically, inside your root directory,

03:46:13.650 --> 03:46:17.550
you have to set that one. API underscore that directory. Can

03:46:17.550 --> 03:46:24.090
you please go back to your repo? So, you have a Gen AI and

03:46:24.090 --> 03:46:27.810
then AI main and then API underscore testing. So, just copy

03:46:27.810 --> 03:46:28.490
this directory name.

03:46:36.760 --> 03:46:40.000
Now, delete testing.py file. Just keep API dot testing.

03:46:40.220 --> 03:46:41.140
Yeah. Delete testing.py.

03:46:44.060 --> 03:46:48.800
Delete. Delete. Yes. No, no, no, no, no, no. Just keep API

03:46:48.800 --> 03:46:51.380
testing. API underscore testing. Just keep that. Control Z.

03:46:51.440 --> 03:46:56.020
Control Z. Undo. Undo it. Yeah. Just delete testing. Slash

03:46:56.020 --> 03:46:57.600
testing.py. Just delete that much.

03:47:00.420 --> 03:47:04.940
Now, yeah. Delete slash. Delete slash as well. Forward

03:47:04.940 --> 03:47:09.180
slash. Okay. So, now see. Build command is. Requirements dot

03:47:09.180 --> 03:47:13.120
TXT. And it is available at which location? API testing. So,

03:47:13.200 --> 03:47:15.600
this is the actual location. Now, give your UConn command.

03:47:19.510 --> 03:47:21.570
Give your UConn command. Start command. Give a start

03:47:21.570 --> 03:47:24.270
command. No, no, no, no, no, no. Go back. Go up, up, up, up,

03:47:24.310 --> 03:47:29.190
up. Yeah. Give a start command. Down, down, down. After

03:47:29.190 --> 03:47:31.570
requirement of TXT, there is another tab, right? Start

03:47:31.570 --> 03:47:35.190
command tab. Start command. Yeah. Start command. Start

03:47:35.190 --> 03:47:39.830
command. No, no. Go down. Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Start

03:47:39.830 --> 03:47:42.050
command. Yes. So, what was the start command? Unicorn.

03:47:42.310 --> 03:47:46.250
Sorry. Unicorn is the start command. UvCon. UvCon. And what

03:47:46.250 --> 03:47:48.530
is your file name? So, your file name is testing file name.

03:47:48.810 --> 03:47:54.250
Testing. UvCon. So, UvCon. Space. Testing. Colon. App.

03:47:56.940 --> 03:47:57.940
Hyphen. Hyphen. Host.

03:48:01.120 --> 03:48:08.130
Yeah. So, host is 0.0.0.0. Yeah. Space. Hyphen. Hyphen.

03:48:08.150 --> 03:48:08.350
Port.

03:48:12.430 --> 03:48:21.420
Give a port number. Okay. Select free. Yeah. Free, free,

03:48:21.440 --> 03:48:23.940
free one. Free one. No, no, no. Free, free. Oh, yeah. Sorry.

03:48:24.020 --> 03:48:26.920
Yeah. Free project. Yes. Yeah. Click that. Then click on

03:48:26.920 --> 03:48:34.720
deploy. It should work. Okay. Where is deploy? The last

03:48:34.720 --> 03:48:38.600
button. The last button. Oh, yeah. Down. Yeah. Okay. Deploy

03:48:38.600 --> 03:48:39.880
your service. Yeah.

03:48:43.370 --> 03:48:45.390
So, this time at least it will not give you like a

03:48:45.390 --> 03:48:48.210
requirement or TXT issue. Maybe like another issue it may

03:48:48.210 --> 03:48:51.090
give you. I don't know. But let's check. We'll wait for

03:48:51.090 --> 03:48:56.870
that. Okay. So, Navneet. Yes. What is your system? Are you

03:48:56.870 --> 03:49:00.350
still facing the issue or is it done? No. It is going on

03:49:00.350 --> 03:49:03.510
same. Same issue. Okay. What is the issue? Common may

03:49:03.510 --> 03:49:08.250
troubles with this got unexpected extra argument. Okay. It

03:49:08.250 --> 03:49:11.130
should not give you that got, I

03:49:33.310 --> 03:49:39.670
mean, like we had given a correct one. Here not given the

03:49:39.670 --> 03:49:44.430
variable dash dash hostname. Dash dash hostname. Right. So,

03:49:44.430 --> 03:49:48.490
yeah, we can't test app. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Yeah. I

03:49:48.490 --> 03:49:53.010
forgot to give a host name. Yeah. That was a mistake. Yeah.

03:49:53.750 --> 03:49:57.470
Hyphen, hyphen, H-O-S-T. Sorry. Yeah. I was assuming that I

03:49:57.470 --> 03:50:01.450
have done that, but I made a mistake. Okay. Now, fine. Not

03:50:01.450 --> 03:50:05.470
an issue. Uh, go with the again deployment. So here, um,

03:50:05.610 --> 03:50:09.290
yeah, it has started deploying. Okay. That was the only

03:50:09.290 --> 03:50:12.750
mistake. Nothing else. Anjeet, I think, yeah, it's working.

03:50:12.850 --> 03:50:15.770
It's working now, I think. So do slash docs, D-O-C-S docs

03:50:15.770 --> 03:50:19.570
slash docs. So your API is live. Now you can just use, uh,

03:50:19.710 --> 03:50:24.890
uh, like this one. So other UI, yeah, it's, it's running.

03:50:25.050 --> 03:50:27.450
See, you are able to see your end point, right? So your user

03:50:27.450 --> 03:50:31.630
ID and your delete and update, you are able to see it. Yeah.

03:50:31.690 --> 03:50:36.430
Delete and put update. Yeah. So delete. Yeah. So with the

03:50:36.430 --> 03:50:42.250
API endpoint. Uh, so, so how do I know it's working? It's

03:50:42.250 --> 03:50:44.450
working the way you have tested it in local, do it in the

03:50:44.450 --> 03:50:47.110
same way. Now it's live. So anyone can test it and even you

03:50:47.110 --> 03:50:50.110
can test it. So the way you have tested it in local, right.

03:50:50.230 --> 03:50:53.190
By sending a report, maybe you can click on port and then

03:50:53.190 --> 03:50:57.670
send a request from here itself. If I just put, yeah, put,

03:50:57.810 --> 03:51:02.970
and then try it out, click on, try it out. Yeah. Then send

03:51:02.970 --> 03:51:06.470
our user ID, user ID. So the user ID is something which is

03:51:06.470 --> 03:51:10.030
required, right? Send user ID. So maybe one send one,

03:51:10.110 --> 03:51:12.490
because I think one user ID was there. Yeah. Send one,

03:51:12.630 --> 03:51:16.770
right. Then send it, send the request. We'll give you 200

03:51:16.770 --> 03:51:17.170
response.

03:51:20.190 --> 03:51:24.830
Execute now. See, so what is the response? So user 200 user

03:51:24.830 --> 03:51:30.530
updated successfully, right? Uh, yes. So fine. So it's, it's

03:51:30.530 --> 03:51:35.550
working. So if somebody else needs to check it, so what's

03:51:35.550 --> 03:51:38.630
the URL? The, the above one, the URL that you are able to

03:51:38.630 --> 03:51:41.330
see in render, right? So you can give the same. No, not this

03:51:41.330 --> 03:51:46.570
one, the base URL, not this one, not this one. So the, uh,

03:51:46.590 --> 03:51:48.950
render URL, go to it. The render, uh,

03:51:53.350 --> 03:51:57.050
the place where you have deployed it, the place. Yeah. Here,

03:51:57.110 --> 03:52:01.790
this one, this URL, or maybe you can go up, go up a little

03:52:01.790 --> 03:52:07.410
bit up, up, up, up in the page. No, not in this one, not in

03:52:07.410 --> 03:52:13.310
console up in the render page. Yeah. Now you can see that,

03:52:13.350 --> 03:52:16.150
right. URL. So this one, yeah. Yeah. Give it, share with

03:52:16.150 --> 03:52:21.830
anyone. Yeah. Oh, I see. Yeah. So now, but it's okay. They

03:52:21.830 --> 03:52:25.970
need to, so this is basically a API URL. So basically this

03:52:25.970 --> 03:52:29.310
is the end point now at docs. So there is a swagger UI. If

03:52:29.310 --> 03:52:31.170
someone would like to test it through a postman or

03:52:31.170 --> 03:52:34.550
something, then that only URL is required. This docs is not

03:52:34.550 --> 03:52:39.010
required. Okay. Okay. And thank you very much. I appreciate

03:52:39.010 --> 03:52:42.450
your help. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. I think even your problem

03:52:42.450 --> 03:52:45.890
is solved, right? Yes. Yeah. I mean, like there was no

03:52:45.890 --> 03:52:48.650
problem. I have just missed. I have an, I have an host. So

03:52:48.650 --> 03:52:51.350
your engine's problem is solved. I think nobody's problem.

03:52:51.450 --> 03:52:55.550
Yeah. Yes. Yes. All right. Okay. Can I go? Yeah, please go

03:52:55.550 --> 03:52:59.330
ahead. Yeah. Can I ask the next guy? Um, that's one question

03:52:59.330 --> 03:53:04.950
sharing, sir. Uh, not sure. Can I ask the question? I have

03:53:04.950 --> 03:53:09.150
just one, please go ahead. So this one, um, yeah, having

03:53:09.150 --> 03:53:13.250
Konda, uh, like whenever I'm trying to create it, giving

03:53:13.250 --> 03:53:18.870
issues or that I just followed your lecture, not, I followed

03:53:18.870 --> 03:53:23.550
like, no, same way. Like. Okay. So you are, you're not able

03:53:23.550 --> 03:53:26.870
to do it, right? Yeah. Don't do an environment creation

03:53:26.870 --> 03:53:29.710
inside Jupyter notebook, open up your terminal inside the

03:53:29.710 --> 03:53:34.810
terminal. You have to do it. Okay. Yeah. Inside terminal,

03:53:34.950 --> 03:53:38.690
you have to do that. So give me a remote control, give me

03:53:38.690 --> 03:53:42.990
control and remove these patches. Uh, I, I can see like

03:53:42.990 --> 03:53:48.510
some, I think these are, yeah, so just, just, uh, remove

03:53:48.510 --> 03:53:51.870
this patches. I. Give me, give me control and leave it,

03:53:51.890 --> 03:53:55.450
leave it. Yeah. Just, just, just remove the patches. So here

03:53:55.450 --> 03:53:59.290
you have to do it basically, uh, remove this chat bar and

03:53:59.290 --> 03:54:03.070
everything. Yeah. Give me one second. One second. Yeah. Um,

03:54:03.490 --> 03:54:07.010
uh, meanwhile, so that you can ask the question. Mm. Yes. Go

03:54:07.010 --> 03:54:11.610
ahead, please. Okay. So then we did this, uh, you know, FIS

03:54:11.610 --> 03:54:16.970
dot index flat hip IP. Right. So what exactly we did was

03:54:16.970 --> 03:54:23.110
like, we, uh. Okay. So we calculated the dot product of the

03:54:23.110 --> 03:54:28.890
vectors among themselves. No. So basically it simply means

03:54:28.890 --> 03:54:33.290
that, that whenever you will do the search, okay. It will

03:54:33.290 --> 03:54:35.990
call this function. That is what it means with this data.

03:54:36.990 --> 03:54:42.370
Okay. So whatever I'm going to search, uh, that is going to

03:54:42.370 --> 03:54:46.130
make a dot product of the vectors with this one, because.

03:54:46.230 --> 03:54:48.750
Exactly. With, with this one. Yes. In terms of doing a

03:54:48.750 --> 03:54:51.710
searching operation. Yeah. Okay. So basically it's a

03:54:51.710 --> 03:54:54.010
nomenclature that we are trying to set that. Okay, fine. So

03:54:54.010 --> 03:54:57.450
I'm trying to store a data into you and, uh, whenever I'll

03:54:57.450 --> 03:54:59.910
come for the search operation. So please make sure that, you

03:54:59.910 --> 03:55:05.330
know, uh, do a search by using the dot, uh, dot product. Got

03:55:05.330 --> 03:55:08.810
it. Got it. So it's nothing but just an object for this, uh.

03:55:08.990 --> 03:55:12.890
Object reference for this one. Yes. Got it. Got it. Okay.

03:55:12.990 --> 03:55:15.310
Actually I just got a bit confused because in search we have

03:55:15.310 --> 03:55:18.190
not used it. But here you will use it. Yeah. Because at the

03:55:18.190 --> 03:55:20.430
time of the story itself, we have given that one. Right. So

03:55:20.430 --> 03:55:24.150
it will be able to understand it automatically. Got it. Got

03:55:24.150 --> 03:55:27.390
it. Thank you. Uh, and, uh, so that's one quick suggestion

03:55:27.390 --> 03:55:31.130
regarding the doubt clearing. Um, can we do a segregation?

03:55:31.250 --> 03:55:34.710
Like, uh, you know, if people have just questions, they can

03:55:34.710 --> 03:55:38.250
ask first and then we can move to the technical or more

03:55:38.250 --> 03:55:41.090
configuration. We can, we can do it because, yeah, so we can

03:55:41.090 --> 03:55:44.210
close the questions, uh, for, uh, like, uh, you know, fast

03:55:44.210 --> 03:55:47.890
to Boston manner. Yeah, we can do it. Although it was very

03:55:47.890 --> 03:55:50.650
interesting for me. I was, I was trying to troubleshoot with

03:55:50.650 --> 03:55:53.350
you. You will learn a lot. Believe me, you will learn a lot

03:55:53.350 --> 03:55:56.370
because everyone is having a different system. They have

03:55:56.370 --> 03:55:58.850
done something very different in their system, some

03:55:58.850 --> 03:56:02.070
different folder. So even if you just look at it, right.

03:56:02.150 --> 03:56:05.470
Believe me, it's a learning. Yeah, I agree. But actually the

03:56:05.470 --> 03:56:08.430
problem is, uh, I'm logging in from us, uh, for these

03:56:08.430 --> 03:56:12.790
classes. Okay. Yeah. It's getting around like 3 AM already

03:56:12.790 --> 03:56:15.930
in the morning. Oh, then, then fine. I can understand. Yeah.

03:56:15.950 --> 03:56:17.290
I can understand that. Fine. I'll, I'll do one thing. So

03:56:17.290 --> 03:56:19.930
from next class onwards, uh, when I'll start it out,

03:56:19.970 --> 03:56:21.630
clearing. So first of all, I closed the question, only

03:56:21.630 --> 03:56:25.030
questions, and then I'll close the screen sharing board. Got

03:56:25.030 --> 03:56:27.550
it. Yep. Thank you so much for that. Yeah. Yeah. Take care.

03:56:27.610 --> 03:56:31.870
Yeah. Have a good one. Bye. Yeah. Yeah. So conda, uh,

03:56:32.010 --> 03:56:34.090
Mukesh, it is not able to organize. So please install the

03:56:34.090 --> 03:56:37.830
conda. First of all. I installed this one. Already done

03:56:37.830 --> 03:56:41.810
that. Yeah. Yeah. I, I was stating, uh, that like where I

03:56:41.810 --> 03:56:47.470
have installed that one. Okay. Yeah. If we see and created

03:56:47.470 --> 03:56:54.570
also like my name or a vector DV under ENV. Hmm. Conda,

03:56:54.570 --> 03:56:58.710
Python, conda, Python. This is not a default directory.

03:57:00.350 --> 03:57:05.910
Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. So that is the issue. You

03:57:05.910 --> 03:57:07.730
have changed the directory name while doing the

03:57:07.730 --> 03:57:09.890
installation. And that is the reason your VS code is not

03:57:09.890 --> 03:57:13.790
able to organize. Just do one thing. Uh, go on, remove file

03:57:13.790 --> 03:57:15.250
or delete.

03:57:18.180 --> 03:57:20.640
Uh, let me do conda.

03:57:51.700 --> 03:57:55.940
Yeah. So what is your query? Other people can also share the

03:57:55.940 --> 03:57:58.060
screen guys. So people can share a multiple screen

03:57:58.060 --> 03:58:01.480
altogether. I can check everyone's screen. Yeah. So if you

03:58:01.480 --> 03:58:03.700
can start sharing your screen, I think you have positive

03:58:03.700 --> 03:58:04.280
screen sharing.

03:58:07.090 --> 03:58:09.670
So everyone can share their screen together. Guys I can, I

03:58:09.670 --> 03:58:14.510
can see your screens multiple at a time. Yeah. Hi. I hope

03:58:14.510 --> 03:58:18.250
I'm audible. Uh, yeah. So basically it's a very, uh, very,

03:58:18.250 --> 03:58:18.510
uh, very, uh, very, uh, very, uh, very, uh, very, uh, you

03:58:18.510 --> 03:58:21.710
know basic level question i think i already know what the

03:58:21.710 --> 03:58:26.770
reason is this part of the query is getting instituted so

03:58:26.770 --> 03:58:32.130
here embedding and the class has been imported and there is

03:58:32.130 --> 03:58:35.570
no issue in that but when i'm trying to do some tech search

03:58:35.570 --> 03:58:39.310
okay regardless of what i'm searching this is probably

03:58:39.310 --> 03:58:43.870
throwing an error so i am using a office laptop i think it's

03:58:43.870 --> 03:58:47.010
an office laptop issue regarding to no no no just show me

03:58:47.010 --> 03:58:50.630
show me show me that uh ssl certificate verification error

03:58:50.630 --> 03:58:53.370
verification failed i think there is a key issue just show

03:58:53.370 --> 03:58:55.910
me the above one okay one second

03:59:05.360 --> 03:59:15.280
yeah show me the above one give me remote control i'll check

03:59:15.280 --> 03:59:20.780
it by myself yeah give me control fine

03:59:24.560 --> 03:59:28.180
so yuri api key everything is fine and then generate

03:59:28.180 --> 03:59:31.000
embeddings output

03:59:49.910 --> 03:59:54.630
exceeded the size limit open the full output in a text

03:59:54.630 --> 03:59:58.610
editor output exceeded the size limit so it is trying to

03:59:58.610 --> 03:59:59.610
return the output but

03:59:59.610 --> 04:00:05.190
it is exceeded the size because i'm getting a similar error

04:00:05.190 --> 04:00:07.870
in when i'm trying to in if you see the bottom part i'll

04:00:07.870 --> 04:00:11.310
just take the screen once again so this condo is already

04:00:11.310 --> 04:00:15.710
installed in my system in the different folder but at least

04:00:15.710 --> 04:00:20.010
it's it's allowed in that particular version i have seen

04:00:20.010 --> 04:00:23.310
certain environments also that i have created but when i'm

04:00:23.310 --> 04:00:27.110
trying to you know install i think this code is correct uh

04:00:27.110 --> 04:00:31.090
the syntax so when i'm trying to do this uh a similar type

04:00:31.090 --> 04:00:35.270
of error with a particular port id of 443 so maybe it's an

04:00:35.270 --> 04:00:37.550
office laptop that is why it is getting so that is why i

04:00:37.550 --> 04:00:40.590
wanted to ask so for next class i will probably switch to my

04:00:40.590 --> 04:00:45.210
personal laptop which which has a limited uh abilities but i

04:00:45.210 --> 04:00:48.170
will try to do that so i just wanted your confirmation on

04:00:48.170 --> 04:00:54.110
this certificate verification http self method uh you are

04:00:54.110 --> 04:00:57.210
able to open up your own website right yes yes yes

04:00:57.210 --> 04:01:00.130
everything you're on website i'm able to hit the uh create

04:01:00.130 --> 04:01:05.390
the aps as well i'm uh i'm able to do the swagger interface

04:01:05.390 --> 04:01:08.790
those are all done but this particular when i'm trying to

04:01:08.790 --> 04:01:12.850
access the api so uh then certain things are uh getting

04:01:12.850 --> 04:01:14.170
messed up so

04:01:20.090 --> 04:01:23.950
this error and as well as uh this part so both of them are

04:01:23.950 --> 04:01:26.830
of the same type probably

04:01:31.250 --> 04:01:35.530
that maybe perhaps support is disabled from my office laptop

04:01:35.530 --> 04:01:39.310
i don't know there is a possibility so external certificate

04:01:39.310 --> 04:01:45.890
verification right uh yes we are concerned with the activity

04:01:45.890 --> 04:01:48.250
and they're saying that probably when the return is coming

04:01:48.250 --> 04:01:52.490
my firewall is adding some headers which exactly yeah to

04:01:52.490 --> 04:01:56.750
understand so it is not allowing like uh our responses

04:01:56.750 --> 04:02:02.110
basically in your system okay so if i switch to a personal

04:02:02.110 --> 04:02:05.110
laptop this won't be an issue right not at all not at all it

04:02:05.110 --> 04:02:05.770
will be like an error so i'm not sure if i can do that as it

04:02:05.770 --> 04:02:10.690
is like as it is running for every once of us okay unable to

04:02:10.690 --> 04:02:14.270
get a local issuer certificate that is the only issue so

04:02:14.270 --> 04:02:19.170
when you receive a packets right so inside your system if

04:02:19.170 --> 04:02:21.870
there is a security so it will try to match that whether

04:02:21.870 --> 04:02:25.410
this packet inside my system is allowed or not this is what

04:02:25.410 --> 04:02:28.090
you are getting in a last line unable to get a local issuer

04:02:28.090 --> 04:02:30.790
certificate so it is not able to your local is not able to

04:02:30.790 --> 04:02:36.710
verify that one okay okay uh and one more uh perhaps request

04:02:36.710 --> 04:02:41.410
of feedback that i have is that uh i know from prior

04:02:41.410 --> 04:02:45.610
experience that you do not enter in all these uh chats that

04:02:45.610 --> 04:02:49.170
you see in the chat window because of sheer lack of time or

04:02:49.170 --> 04:02:54.310
a repetitive question uh but in case uh like for myself i'm

04:02:54.310 --> 04:02:57.050
asking some valid questions related to this particular class

04:02:57.050 --> 04:03:01.170
so is there any way that the zoom tries to you know

04:03:01.170 --> 04:03:05.570
undermine those or boost up certain requests because i have

04:03:05.570 --> 04:03:08.110
been asking you zoom gives you just a simple window

04:03:08.110 --> 04:03:11.370
interface do whatever you want kind of a thing so generally

04:03:11.370 --> 04:03:14.310
what happens is like when people are like you know sending a

04:03:14.310 --> 04:03:18.090
message frequently so again zoom is zoom which will show you

04:03:18.090 --> 04:03:21.950
the message but uh i'm a person right i'm a human being i

04:03:21.950 --> 04:03:25.490
can focus only on certain questions if questions is you know

04:03:25.490 --> 04:03:30.310
uh coming frequently uh that might be the issue but yeah so

04:03:30.310 --> 04:03:33.050
zoom is what you are you are receiving those things right

04:03:33.050 --> 04:03:36.170
that is why obviously obviously yeah yeah obviously i

04:03:36.170 --> 04:03:41.430
receive all all of your messages okay so uh so is there any

04:03:41.430 --> 04:03:44.790
reason why you will uh you know are not entering a

04:03:44.790 --> 04:03:46.810
particular particular question or particular set of

04:03:46.810 --> 04:03:49.230
questions whatever i see i just entertain it at that point

04:03:49.230 --> 04:03:54.010
of a time okay yeah it's not like that it is something of a

04:03:54.010 --> 04:03:56.790
stupid question even though i don't i didn't ask stupid

04:03:56.790 --> 04:03:59.910
questions today i asked you for relevant questions it's all

04:03:59.910 --> 04:04:02.530
matter of fact is like uh when i'm looking at that chat

04:04:02.530 --> 04:04:06.850
screen right so it's a running uh exactly it's a running

04:04:06.850 --> 04:04:10.130
flow of the messages so which message uh is there at that

04:04:10.130 --> 04:04:12.830
point of a time because i know anyhow we have a doubt in

04:04:12.830 --> 04:04:16.330
session so over there people can discuss anything yeah but

04:04:16.330 --> 04:04:19.870
the one problem that i have is that uh now we are at the

04:04:19.870 --> 04:04:22.810
rudimentary stage right so if i miss something i probably

04:04:22.810 --> 04:04:25.570
after class i will i'll have to do this entire class again

04:04:25.570 --> 04:04:29.850
that's okay with me but uh moving i had uh as as the classes

04:04:29.850 --> 04:04:33.110
get more complex if we miss one step or if we do not

04:04:33.110 --> 04:04:36.570
understand the clarity behind it then uh uh the later the

04:04:36.570 --> 04:04:39.850
rest of the class is just futile a simple thing is even if

04:04:39.850 --> 04:04:42.750
i'm going to skip one topic and if people even if i'm like

04:04:42.750 --> 04:04:46.090
not able to explain one topic in a clear manner for sure

04:04:46.090 --> 04:04:48.690
people will ask those questions in the doubt clearing i know

04:04:49.190 --> 04:04:52.970
and then i have to clarify it right so anyhow like if you

04:04:52.970 --> 04:04:55.330
are not able to understand it will be not just your problem

04:04:55.330 --> 04:04:58.230
it will be many people's problem and obviously many people

04:04:58.230 --> 04:05:02.930
will ask it so in Anyhow, also raising that the same

04:05:02.930 --> 04:05:07.030
questions, but which is much later on, probably it hit your

04:05:07.030 --> 04:05:09.930
eye at that point of time. Immediately. I don't need it. And

04:05:09.930 --> 04:05:13.170
if I will keep on entertaining all the question, then my

04:05:13.170 --> 04:05:16.650
first two hours will go just in a question. Yeah. Fine. I

04:05:16.650 --> 04:05:18.990
understand your headache. So don't worry about it. Anyhow,

04:05:19.010 --> 04:05:22.270
it will be handled. Yeah. Okay. And one more point that I

04:05:22.270 --> 04:05:26.110
wanted to, you know, add or rather ask is that I found in

04:05:26.110 --> 04:05:31.370
the WhatsApp group, many of them are quite pro into, you

04:05:31.370 --> 04:05:33.670
know, programming and all that. They were able to do the

04:05:33.670 --> 04:05:36.590
assignment that you have assigned, that you have given

04:05:36.590 --> 04:05:42.470
related to the API second class. Right. So whatever you have

04:05:42.470 --> 04:05:45.290
taught in class, I was able to replicate it and I was able

04:05:45.290 --> 04:05:48.770
to understand, not a problem, but going through a PDF, that

04:05:48.770 --> 04:05:51.170
seven point PDF that you have given seven or eight point.

04:05:52.370 --> 04:05:56.230
It's kind of complex. Now I can, I can surely, you know,

04:05:56.230 --> 04:06:00.070
upload it onto chat, GPT, or any Gemini or whatever, and I

04:06:00.070 --> 04:06:02.610
can get an output, but I don't want to go to through that,

04:06:02.730 --> 04:06:07.910
you know, dumb process, you know, but you have not learned

04:06:07.910 --> 04:06:11.010
anything in the long run. Learning. Learning doesn't mean

04:06:11.010 --> 04:06:13.090
that you will write a line by line code, even in a current

04:06:13.090 --> 04:06:16.210
situation, right? No one of none of us are doing it. So

04:06:16.210 --> 04:06:18.410
learning simply means that first of all, try to find out the

04:06:18.410 --> 04:06:20.670
solution and then out of curiosity, you have to understand

04:06:20.670 --> 04:06:22.970
the solution. So let's suppose, even if you're going to

04:06:22.970 --> 04:06:25.810
generate those solutions from a chat, GPT or anywhere, and

04:06:25.810 --> 04:06:28.530
if you are trying to focus over there, for maybe it will

04:06:28.530 --> 04:06:30.510
just take 10 minute of time to generate the code, but maybe

04:06:30.510 --> 04:06:33.010
if you're standing half an hour, 45 minute time, you will be

04:06:33.010 --> 04:06:38.470
able to understand it, right? That is, that is actually a

04:06:38.470 --> 04:06:40.590
best process to learn in a current situation, because the

04:06:40.590 --> 04:06:43.170
code means what there can be a millions of combination,

04:06:43.630 --> 04:06:46.250
right? There can be a hundreds of way to solve this exact

04:06:46.250 --> 04:06:49.270
same problem. And if I'm going to give this problem to a

04:06:49.270 --> 04:06:51.110
hundred people, obviously if you'll check their code,

04:06:51.190 --> 04:06:53.150
everyone's code will be different, right? Everyone's code

04:06:53.150 --> 04:06:55.510
will be totally different. But again, the core fundamentals

04:06:55.510 --> 04:06:57.330
is going to be exact same. There is no change. There's no

04:06:57.330 --> 04:07:00.710
changes at all. So this is how actual development happens.

04:07:00.810 --> 04:07:04.030
So again, we write a 10,000 line of a code even five years

04:07:04.030 --> 04:07:06.950
back when there was no AI, right? So we were writing a 5,000

04:07:06.950 --> 04:07:09.370
line of a code, 10,000 line of a code. Now none of the code

04:07:09.370 --> 04:07:11.490
or none of the line we remember, right? We just remember the

04:07:11.490 --> 04:07:15.770
concept. Yeah. I actually, I have taken a lot of help from

04:07:15.770 --> 04:07:17.590
that, but I just wanted to, whether that's the right

04:07:17.590 --> 04:07:20.870
approach or not. That's the right approach. Solving a

04:07:20.870 --> 04:07:24.370
problem and then understanding the solution is the right

04:07:24.370 --> 04:07:29.230
approach in a current situation. Because I've created all of

04:07:29.230 --> 04:07:34.350
these workforces

04:07:34.350 --> 04:07:38.330
for my company and they have reduced my workload from three

04:07:38.330 --> 04:07:44.730
to four hours to around 15, 20 minutes. I just going to

04:07:44.730 --> 04:07:46.650
join some organization, right? You will be doing the exact

04:07:46.650 --> 04:07:50.870
same thing. So it's more like finding the solution, knowing

04:07:50.870 --> 04:07:53.930
a lot of things together. So as of now, if someone is going

04:07:53.930 --> 04:07:57.690
to come and claim that I'm master of one, now that was true

04:07:57.690 --> 04:08:00.710
and that was working since the last couple of decades or so

04:08:00.710 --> 04:08:03.410
many decades, but now it's not true. You should be knowing

04:08:03.410 --> 04:08:05.250
everything and you should be able to find out the solution

04:08:05.250 --> 04:08:08.930
immediately with the help of AI. And if you're not doing it

04:08:08.930 --> 04:08:13.050
again, so someone else will do it. What I understand is that

04:08:13.050 --> 04:08:17.410
it's become a necessity because I am actually, I'm from

04:08:17.410 --> 04:08:20.050
telecom, so it is completely not related to me, but

04:08:20.050 --> 04:08:24.650
automation, what I understand will be affecting every money,

04:08:24.730 --> 04:08:29.610
all of, all of the field. It is even even agriculture. Yeah.

04:08:29.690 --> 04:08:32.750
Even agriculture. Right. And on top of that, everything

04:08:32.750 --> 04:08:36.410
right now, today, light lies on data, you know, kind of data

04:08:36.410 --> 04:08:40.890
that has been pulled at the back end. Yeah. So, uh, it's

04:08:40.890 --> 04:08:43.530
huge. I mean, I've, I've, I've seen what, what my current

04:08:43.530 --> 04:08:46.430
company has done with data and what they're going to do in

04:08:46.430 --> 04:08:50.610
the future. You know, I mentioned the OEM, uh, but, uh,

04:08:51.010 --> 04:08:53.730
it's, it's huge. So that is why I jumped, uh, shipped onto

04:08:53.730 --> 04:08:56.690
this. And probably, uh, if we, if a data center comes up

04:08:56.690 --> 04:08:59.190
with my vicinity, I probably have a chance to re shift onto

04:08:59.190 --> 04:09:02.310
that. So that's why I'm learning. So learning, the kind of,

04:09:02.310 --> 04:09:07.110
but I guess I will be lucky. Hot. My option. Yeah. We do. I

04:09:07.110 --> 04:09:08.810
mean, I mean, I said, the option. Yeah. Yeah. I'll try to do

04:09:08.810 --> 04:09:13.410
that. I'll set those. Go. No, no, no, no need of the hour. I

04:09:13.410 --> 04:09:16.650
actually, in the last two years, I got a position also, you

04:09:16.650 --> 04:09:20.370
know, for the kind of work that I'm doing. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

04:09:20.570 --> 04:09:21.190
Hmm. Hmm.

04:09:33.890 --> 04:09:40.930
And again, I'm a little bit of a skill up. I think we should

04:09:40.930 --> 04:09:47.230
change that too. I mean, it's a fast approach. That is the

04:09:47.230 --> 04:09:50.110
approach that we all should follow. Yeah. Basically the

04:09:50.110 --> 04:09:53.290
backtracking learning that Chinese used for the last 10, 15

04:09:53.290 --> 04:09:55.730
years, and now they've overtaken the world. Exactly.

04:09:55.990 --> 04:09:58.710
Exactly. I mean, any chip-based technology, they haven't

04:09:58.710 --> 04:10:03.430
innovated anything. But by copy-pasting and like, uh, uh,

04:10:03.430 --> 04:10:07.250
reverse engineering, they've made everything. And now their

04:10:07.250 --> 04:10:09.610
base is so good that now they can, uh, you know, it's like,

04:10:09.670 --> 04:10:14.510
exactly, exactly. Okay. So move fast. See, you don't need to

04:10:14.510 --> 04:10:16.590
be perfect. There's no such thing as perfection in the

04:10:16.590 --> 04:10:20.890
world. Perfection is just a state of mind. What's perfect?

04:10:21.150 --> 04:10:23.510
Something new will come tomorrow. You'll say that's good. So

04:10:23.510 --> 04:10:27.430
where was the perfect tomorrow? I mean, right. Perfect. It's

04:10:27.430 --> 04:10:30.070
just a state of mind for that particular point of a time.

04:10:30.650 --> 04:10:33.750
The simple philosophy in a life. Even I have used it in my

04:10:33.750 --> 04:10:37.350
entire intrapreneurship journey is move as fast as possible.

04:10:39.320 --> 04:10:46.280
Okay. Thanks. Uh, yes. Uh, yeah. So I think you are sharing

04:10:46.280 --> 04:10:51.180
your screen. So let me know how I can help ma

04:10:53.480 --> 04:10:55.860
'am. I think you are on mute. So if you can unmute yourself.

04:11:00.800 --> 04:11:01.820
Hello. Hello.

04:11:04.390 --> 04:11:06.890
Hello. I think ma'am, you are not audible to me.

04:11:13.850 --> 04:11:14.270
Hello.

04:11:32.910 --> 04:11:33.730
Hello. Hello.

04:11:37.630 --> 04:11:43.030
Ma'am. You're not audible to me. Anyone guys who is able to

04:11:43.030 --> 04:11:49.210
hear Sajja? No, right. Yeah. Hello. Hello.

04:11:53.050 --> 04:11:55.850
Ma'am. You're not audible. Maybe you can like, uh, ping

04:11:55.850 --> 04:11:59.830
your, uh, question or maybe concern or whatever you are

04:11:59.830 --> 04:12:05.890
facing inside our chat group. Yeah. So inside our WhatsApp

04:12:05.890 --> 04:12:07.930
chat group, and then let's, let's have a discussion over

04:12:07.930 --> 04:12:13.190
there. We'll try to fix your issue because I'm not able to

04:12:13.190 --> 04:12:13.610
hear you ma'am.

04:12:16.860 --> 04:12:19.480
Okay. So fine guys. Thank you so much, everyone. And take

04:12:19.480 --> 04:12:22.780
care. See you again. Not next week. So next week I'm on

04:12:22.780 --> 04:12:24.480
leave. I've already made an announcement. I'll make an

04:12:24.480 --> 04:12:27.340
announcement again inside the group. Uh, again, those who

04:12:27.340 --> 04:12:31.480
will be joining, uh, uh, a new group member. So help them

04:12:31.480 --> 04:12:34.720
out to understand that there is no class next week. Right.

04:12:35.160 --> 04:12:37.440
And, uh, yeah. So next to next week, again, we'll try to

04:12:37.440 --> 04:12:40.300
continue from the same state, a vector database. So we are

04:12:40.300 --> 04:12:44.280
not done with the vector DB. Uh, there are so many things

04:12:44.280 --> 04:12:46.960
that we have to discuss even from a vector DB. So with that,

04:12:46.980 --> 04:12:48.820
thank you so much, everyone. Take care. Hope all of you are

04:12:48.820 --> 04:12:52.160
liking it with that. Thank you so much, everyone. Happy

04:12:52.160 --> 04:12:53.020
Sunday to all of you.
