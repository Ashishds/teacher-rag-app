WEBVTT

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:15.350
Okay, so good morning everyone. I think I'm audible and

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.350
visible to all of you. So please confirm guys in a chat if

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:23.010
I'm audible and visible to all of you. Yeah. Okay, so I'm

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:25.750
audible and visible. So good morning everyone.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:33.360
So shall we start with the class guys? Yeah. Are we all

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:41.480
awake? Okay, good morning. Okay, so anyone who can tell me

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.560
what is the agenda for this particular week? So we can set

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.520
an agenda and then we can start with the class. Yeah, so

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:47.780
anyone?

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:59.070
Okay, so Dhruv is saying A2A agent. So yes, we are going to

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.070
talk about A2A agents. I believe I have given you a task

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:06.950
last week on Sunday maybe. And I've just asked you to like

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:11.070
do something with those tasks. So try to create a separate

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:14.530
agent so that you know agent will be able to transfer data

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:17.290
from one to another. And then it will be able to

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.650
communicate. So that was a task which I have given to you.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:24.650
Agent modification kind of a task. And that is something

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:27.070
which we are going to discuss today. And then from tomorrow

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:31.010
onwards class is going to be more exciting because we will

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:36.030
try to explore a cloud part now. As cloud part is pretty

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.550
much important in terms of deploying any kind of application

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:43.910
on a scale and doing all sort of things which is required on

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.690
a production grade system. So that we are going to start

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:50.350
from tomorrow, obviously, and that will be a final stage of

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:56.050
your entire batch. So with cloud, obviously, we are going to

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:58.790
discuss all the project which has been listed inside your

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:02.290
syllabus. Right. So starting with the URI, basically, so

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.710
where we are going to build a URI kind of a system, we are

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:09.250
going to deploy it. We are going to attach a lot of custom

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:12.590
model and all those model which is already available out

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:15.310
there so that, you know, you all will be able to build an

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:18.610
exact similar kind of a system that you are able to see as

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:26.490
of now on your own platform. So that will be done. So that

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:33.350
is something that we are going to discuss now. So, guys,

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:37.330
last class, I was talking about a to agent and we were able

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.510
to understand a fundamental of a to a agent that what is

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:42.970
this a to a protocol, how it is going to work, basically.

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:48.790
But so our agent was not an independent agent, basically. So

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.450
when we were like, you know, trying to talk about this a to

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:59.610
a agent. So, how we can try to make our agent independent?

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:03.850
So basically, one agent, I can try to host on one server and

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:06.710
another agent will be running on some different server on

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:10.010
some different port number and then how I will be able to

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:13.590
transfer our data. So from one agent to another agent and

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.450
eventually my agent is going to work in that particular

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:20.870
manner. So let me share my screen and let me show you a demo

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.630
in a very. So I believe my screen is visible to all of you,

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:25.910
right guys, yeah, so can you please confirm once.

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:33.420
Okay, fine, cool. So let me show you a demo first of all,

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.240
what we are going to do in my today's class.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.120
So this was an application that we have been talking about,

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.940
right, so where we have three kind of agents. So one agent

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:52.160
we have built inside a lang gen framework, one agent we have

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.460
built inside a crew AI framework and another agent we have

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.960
built inside an auto gen framework and we have defined a

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.300
respective task to a respective agent that one is going to

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:05.780
read a data, second one is going to do some sort of

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.920
analytics on top of that and then third agent is going to do

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:13.260
eventually a visualization and our requirement was simple.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:18.300
So our requirement was like we have taken a requirement in

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.420
such a way that all of these agents should run

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:24.340
independently, right, independently and with the help of

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.760
this A2A SDK or A2A library, so it is supposed to

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.520
coordinate. So obviously when we talk about an agent, so

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.860
it's nothing but a piece of a function or piece of a

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:37.000
program. So let's suppose if I'll talk about a lang gen

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.680
agent over here. So obviously lang gen agent is supposed to,

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.100
you know, like a responsible for reading all kind of data

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:48.040
and then it should pass all of those data to a next agent so

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.660
that my crew agent will be able to do some sort of analytics

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:55.340
operation on top of that. And then once my crew, I will be

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:58.400
able to perform this kind of analytics on top of that. So

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:02.140
this should pass a data to my auto gen agent so that my auto

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.260
gen agent should be able to visualize those kind of data.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.280
And this is a UI interface that we have created. So we are

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:12.480
keeping our data inside our local system and we can try to,

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.700
you know, point this particular data set with respect to any

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.980
kind of a databases as well. So if I'm able to load a data

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:21.820
from a local system, so obviously I will be able to point

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:26.120
out this data to any respective databases and then I will be

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.040
able to read a data from there. But that is not an

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.860
interesting part. The interesting part was that, that my

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:35.760
agent should run on a different, different server. So as you

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.880
can see, so I'm running this agent on port number 8001, I'm

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.420
running this agent on port number 8002, I'm running this

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:47.500
agent on port number 8003. And that was technically a

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:53.040
requirement. Maybe I can try to change the local host. As of

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.200
now, everything is running on local host and I have just

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.420
changed different, different, like you know, a port over

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.880
there. But yeah, so if I'm able to change a port, it simply

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.380
means that, that I will be able to change the complete

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:07.960
system, right? And eventually it is supposed to run on a

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.540
different, different system so that it will be able to

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.680
coordinate because you know, even in a real life, so all of

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.220
your agent will not be available in a single place. So maybe

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.120
there are multiple teams who is working on a different,

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:22.660
different agent and they are going to say that, that, okay,

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:26.620
so this is my agent, which I have exposed now, try to use

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:27.440
this port. Okay. So I will be able to create a demo of this

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.920
particular agent in a way that you are looking for. That

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.340
will be a real life scenario. So we are trying to replicate,

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.780
we are trying to create a demo of such kind of a situation.

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:41.100
Now if I'll talk about a langchain agent, so in that case it

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.140
should use some sort of a LLMs, a crew AI, it should use

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:47.320
some sort of a LLM and then again, my auto gen model should

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.720
be able to use some sort of a, a different, different kind

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:53.740
of a models. Depends what my agent is going to perform. So

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.600
maybe some agent you are going to build, which is just going

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.440
to do it. tool calling maybe it is going to access my

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.580
calendar or maybe it is going to access my gmail or any any

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.560
system out there basically right but yeah so that was a

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.540
system that we were trying to mock up so i'll try to start

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:13.640
with this demo so just give a couple of second of time and

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.700
my agent will be ready and then i'm going to show you that

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.080
how this agent is actually working so now i have already

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:24.380
executed and here so as per my expected task so lanchan

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:28.440
reader has completed its job then crew and list has

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.860
completed its job and then autogen visualizer has completed

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.260
its job so all three agent in a sequence they are able to

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.380
complete this job the amazing part is this particular end

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:41.700
point so all of these agents are running on a different

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.960
different end points basically and they are able to

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:49.460
communicate in between so inside a2a as we all are aware

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:53.000
about a fast api right so fast api is basically a pythonic

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.800
library by which i will be able to create basically uh

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:59.880
anything i will be able to expose on any port number or any

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:04.820
server so even inside a2a you will be able to find out a

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:09.340
fast api compatible library so which is basically a a2a

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.540
specific fast api i'll try to show you even that part inside

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:17.800
a code and yes so with the help of that you will be able to

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.880
host and the only thing that you will be able to do is that

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:20.140
you will be able to create a data transfer which is

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:20.140
essentially a data transfer which is a data transfer that we

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:23.200
have to coordinate over here or we have to orchestrate over

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:28.440
here that a data transfer because every agent needs some

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.020
input and every agent is going to give me some sort of

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:34.880
output for example so if i'll talk about a reader agent so

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.980
obviously it requires a location so from where i'm trying to

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:41.580
read the data and then whatever instruction which i have

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:44.780
given to this particular agent so it is supposed to just

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:48.400
follow that instruction read a data process a data and then

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.760
return it to me in my data my required file or in my

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.780
required template or maybe in my required data type as

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:59.220
simple as that. Now once it is able to give me a response I

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:03.180
will as per my flow basically as per a flow of this one

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.500
because this flow is going to change if your application is

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:10.000
going to change. So as per my flow so this should be able to

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.320
get an output from this one and then it should consider that

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:17.880
as an input and then it will give me some sort of output

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.980
once again after performing some sort of analysis because

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:24.160
this is my analyst agent and then once it will be able to

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.200
give an output so same output should go inside this

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.920
particular visualizer agent which is running on some

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.900
different server right and then it should be able to do some

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:36.840
sort of a visualization and finally I will be able to see my

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:40.260
total visualization. So that was a whole idea. Yes everyone

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:47.900
yeah I think this is how agent should behave agree yeah so I

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.280
believe this is how this any kind of agent right. Are

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.900
supposed to communicate in between at the end of the day

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:56.660
yeah. So this is what we were trying to basically like

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.580
achieve and yes in a code so we are able to achieve it you

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.180
can just try to use that code template try to replace with

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.780
any of your own agent run it and it is going to work for

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:08.420
you. The code part so we will try to come on that side in a

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:14.000
later stage but yeah so here as you can see so it is it is

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.980
trying to like a read all of my data set over here and then

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:21.340
one by one one by one one by one. So as per my instruction

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:25.440
which is given to me so it is able to perform a task. Now

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.480
here so I will go to a second tab so where specifically I

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.040
will be talking about a lan chain reader so what this reader

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.420
is technically trying to do. So here it is just a summary

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:38.500
now here so it is trying to give you like a basically total

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.680
number of sales as per my like a snapshot or as per my

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.860
instruction which I have given to agent that okay fine. So

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:47.160
just try to give me some sort of a summary over here and as

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.260
we all know that that inside A2A. There is a concept called

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.540
as agent card right. This is where agent will be created or

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:57.060
agent will be technically invoked. So here is a agent card

00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:01.140
which is running on one of the port right one of the port

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:05.540
8001 over here. Now there is a crew AI analyst agent so

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:08.820
again which is running on another port and if you will go

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:12.100
and check so yes this is running on 8002 port number and

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.120
then it is like trying to perform a kind of analysis which I

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.260
have given to this particular agents right. So produce a

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.600
markdown briefing and a structure. So this is the structure

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:23.560
analysis of the leadership decision and then there is a

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.620
another agent called as autogen visualizer. So which is

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:29.640
eventually trying to generate a visualization for me. So all

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.980
this output has not changed what we have changed. So we have

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:36.660
technically changed a entire process. That is the only thing

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:40.040
that we have changed over here. Apart from that you will not

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:43.860
be able to see any kind of changes in between all of these

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:48.040
and here. So I am trying to even showcase. So that you know

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.660
you all will be able to understand in a easiest possible

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:54.560
manner although it was not required. But here so I am trying

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.980
to showcase a conversation that how I already told you

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:02.300
right. So we have three kind of agent one is a reader one is

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.880
analyst and one is a visualizer. So and I told you that okay

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.060
so this agents are going to take some sort of a data input

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:12.160
and it is going to give me some sort of a data output. So

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.760
what kind of a data input it is going to take. What kind of

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.120
a data output. What kind of output it is going to give it to

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.540
you. So this is what I am trying to showcase inside my

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:25.640
conversation. So here this is my raw data right. This is my

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.820
raw data. So which was available. So now it is trying to

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:31.740
read a data from this particular location in whatever

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.820
location I am keeping a data. So from here it will try to

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:38.160
pick a data and this is technically my data set right. This

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.460
is my raw data set by the way in a CSV format which is

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:45.580
available to me. So here langchain reader will try to read a

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.560
data. And then what I am going to do. So once it will be

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:51.660
able to read a data it is going to give me this kind of a

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.840
payload that okay fine. So this is a data which I am able to

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:58.120
read one by one, one by one, one by one. So here I am trying

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:01.320
to return a data into a JSON format so that I will be able

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:05.340
to pass those data to the next one right to the next one.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:10.360
Now this data will go as a input input inside my crew AI

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:13.420
basically right. It will go as an input inside my crew AI.

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:18.560
And whatever instruction which I have given. Okay. So it is

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:22.000
going to execute those instruction and then it is going to

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.220
produce some sort of output and here so again you will be

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:27.380
able to see a structural payload. So which will go to the

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:30.660
next one and here I am trying to say that that use the

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.180
provided sales intelligence context to draft the decision

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:36.960
ready analysis. So this is going to like a you know like a

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.520
user LLM by the way right. It is going to use a LLM and then

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.840
it is going to provide me all sort of a matrixes which I was

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.140
looking for. And which is a responsibility of this middle

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:50.960
agent. Which is a crew AI right crew AI. Now once it will be

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.400
able to give me an output and if you will come down. So now

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:59.540
this data will go as an input inside my next one and where I

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:02.620
am trying to say that that okay. So now you have you are

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:06.160
responsible for doing a visualization. So try to invoke a

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.740
visual analyst agent and then try to perform a visualization

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:13.400
for me. So one by one one by one one by one. So it is trying

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.560
to create a different different kind of a chart. So. So it

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.800
is trying to create a bar chart over here. Again it is

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.020
trying to create a bar chart over here. So in this manner

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:26.000
all of these three agents are trying to coordinate and then

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.060
eventually I will be able to get my final output. So is it

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:34.120
making sense to all of us guys communication wise. So we

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:37.060
have just separated all the agent. That's it. This is what

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:40.040
we have done. So we have just separated all the agent and

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:43.700
one is trying to take a input and giving me an output that

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:46.760
output. I am trying to pass to them. next one that's the

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:49.880
only operation which I'm trying to perform over here making

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.880
sense yeah

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:58.900
in terms of a do a communication okay so now let's go to a

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:02.800
code part and let me give you a walkthrough of a code that

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.680
how inside a code it is working so I have created a couple

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:09.700
of new files over there so that you know I can show you a

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:13.400
communication between these agents so this is my multi-agent

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.980
folder okay

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:22.870
so let me this is just a environment this is just a data

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:27.790
okay now here so if I have to show you that how these agents

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:30.630
are actually communicating and how these agents are trying

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:33.670
to perform all such operations which we are able to see even

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:37.310
now so one by one let's try to take a walkthrough of this

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:40.530
entire code base so that it will give you a beautiful

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:43.290
understanding about each and everything that we are able to

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:45.250
perform over here okay

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:24.650
okay so as

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.460
per my code base so we have a orchestrator file so that we

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:33.540
have already seen so you can think of this orchestrator file

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:36.960
as a coordinator so there is a coordinator

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:43.260
and what this coordinator will do so what technically this

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:46.160
orchestrator will do so this will try to connect with the

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:51.400
reader agent as per my flow now once a reader agent will be

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:54.520
able to like a you know like a receiver instruction from a

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.800
coordinator that I have to read some sort of a data so what

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:02.740
it will do so it will try to like a read a message and based

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:06.780
on the message so it is going to basically read something

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:09.980
called as text part as per my code which I am going to show

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:13.100
you so this text part wise I have already given an

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:18.940
instruction that ingest a data yeah ingest a data so this is

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:22.140
the instruction which I have given to this reader agent now

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:25.700
what it will do so it will try to call something called as

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:28.760
data part so technically Basically data part is nothing but

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:36.880
it is going to take my data set path, it is going to take or

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:41.140
read a CSV text which is available to me and then it is

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:44.900
going to take a help of a model that in terms of

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:48.300
understanding a entire data set. So this is what my reader

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:53.100
is going to do. Now once reader will be able to read a data,

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:59.560
what it does, so reader return back the output again to a

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.860
coordinator. This is how this entire flow is going to work,

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:08.550
means orchestrator basically. So let us suppose my reader is

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:13.590
running on maybe 8001 port number, so it is going to perform

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:16.690
a data reading operation and once it is able to perform a

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:19.510
data reading operation, so it will give back to a

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:23.890
coordinator. So technically it is working in a request

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:27.970
response manner, the way any kind of APIs are going to

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:31.050
behave in the exact similar manner and again I am going to

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:33.950
show you that there is a fast API integration which is

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:37.330
already available inside A2A inbuilt SDK which I am using

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:41.390
over here. So here reader is going to send back to a

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:45.270
coordinator saying that okay I am able to read a data as per

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:47.810
the instruction that you have given and as per the location

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:50.050
that you have given. So whatever path that you have given,

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:52.590
so I am able to read the data and then as per your

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:54.770
instruction, so I am able to process each and everything and

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:57.370
that is the output that I have shown it to you, step by step

00:26:57.370 --> 00:26:59.610
that okay fine, this will go as an input and this will come

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:03.730
as an output. So it will send back to a coordinator. So

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:05.810
obviously whenever it is trying to send back to a

00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:08.170
coordinator, so it will always try to send back to a

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:11.410
coordinator in a particular format, the format that we are

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:15.330
going to define. So again it is going to invoke a message

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:18.190
part because as a message it is trying to do a communication

00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:22.130
between the agent and then inside a message part, you will

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:25.450
be able to see basically a text part. So text part means

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:27.730
basically an instruction. So let's suppose if I have given

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:31.570
an instruction that okay, so try to give me a summary. Let's

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:34.890
suppose right, try to give me a summary. So it will try to

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:37.890
give you a summary and then it is going to give you a data

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:40.330
part. Data part means actual data set which I am going to

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:44.690
show or which I am going to use it for the next process. So

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:48.470
here it is going to return me a record. Okay. And maybe a

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:51.850
matrixes which I am looking for, right, which I am looking

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:54.390
for. So this is something that it is going to return. Now

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:58.350
once this will be able to do it, so port number 8001 will be

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:01.430
done, right. Once it is able to return back to the

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:04.550
coordinator, the responsibility of this port number 8001 is

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:08.830
done. Now once this part is done, then what will happen, so

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:14.090
our system already knows that we have configured it for a

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:16.710
multiple agent means technically my coordinators are aware

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:19.970
about that. Okay. I am looking for something like a next

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:23.830
agent. So which is going to take this as a payload basically

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:27.110
and it should be able to process this particular part. So

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:33.410
automatically my coordinator will try to invoke basically a

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:37.930
analyst agent, analyst agent. And again it is going to

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:41.710
follow the exact same process. So it is going to take a

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:45.390
message again inside a message I will be having basically a

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:48.810
text part. And I will be having basically a data part,

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:52.570
right, two part I will be having. So text part wise, so I am

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:55.990
going to give instruction that okay, fine. So convert maybe

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:58.550
this particular summary which I have already received from

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:01.970
here, right into maybe some sort of a analytical operation

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:04.850
or like whatever analysis which I am looking for in terms of

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:07.390
my data set. So for example, I have a sales data set. So

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:11.110
maybe I am looking for a sales matrixes over there. So here

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:15.110
instruction will go and here. So it is going to take the

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:19.950
actual record. Actual record it is going to take. Now once

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:22.650
analyst will be able to process and it will be able to give

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:27.130
me analysis. Again analyst and this is running on 8000 two

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:30.390
port number. So this is running technically on 8000 two port

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:34.770
number my analyst agent. So once analyst will be able to

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:37.950
give the output or it is able to generate the output. So

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:42.610
again it will send back to a coordinator, coordinator and

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:45.210
again so coordinator is going to receive a message in the

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:49.170
exact same format. So basically a text part which is nothing

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:52.810
but my instruction and then a data part which is nothing but

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:56.110
my actual payload, right. So it is going to return back to

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:59.550
me whatever analyst is going to do. So now again control

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:02.510
came back to a coordinator, right. Again this request

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:07.470
response just like an API that we already know and then this

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:14.960
coordinator basically coordinator basically invoke a

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:15.960
visualizer agent.

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:23.170
Visualizer. Visualizer agent and then it is going to again

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:26.810
follow the same process. So there will be basically a text

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:32.050
part and there will be a data part, data part. So text part

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:34.730
means so we are giving an instruction that okay fine so you

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:37.370
are the visualizer agent and you are supposed to do XYZ kind

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:40.050
of a job and then data part means so this is the data on

00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:42.610
which you have to perform this kind of a operation or

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:45.410
whatever instruction that we have pointed out. And once my

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:48.050
visualizer is going to give an output so that is going to be

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:50.490
mine. So visualizer is going to send back the output. That

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:53.050
is going to be my final output because after that so I am

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:56.150
not going to invoke any kind of an agent. If required I can

00:30:56.150 --> 00:31:00.170
try to invoke any kind of an agent. So this agent is working

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:04.210
in a sequence, right. So one after another, one after

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:07.150
another, one after another. If I would like to create maybe

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:10.110
some different kind of a structure, right, that okay so

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:13.110
there is this particular agent and it should send a data to

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:15.990
this as well as to this one then this should perform maybe

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:18.970
some different kind of operation, this should perform some

00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:21.630
different kind of operation. Then this should perform some

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:24.150
different kind of operation, maybe kind of a tree or graph

00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:27.790
kind of a structure or any kind of a flow that I would like

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:32.370
to design. So if I am following this structure, I will be

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:36.770
able to do it easily because I know that every node over

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:41.390
here is an independent node and every node I can try to like

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:44.710
configure it in my way that who is going to take a data who

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:47.430
is going to take like what is what is the output that it is

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:51.370
going to give. And everywhere, whatever agent that we are

00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:54.930
trying to invoke so as per A2A protocol as we all know that

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:58.190
A2A is technically a protocol. So protocol means it is going

00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:01.090
to take a data in a certain format and it is going to give

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:03.730
you a data output in a certain format. So we are already

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:06.990
aware about it and that is particularly fixed as per A2A

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:09.770
protocol. This is where this technically this protocol comes

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:13.890
into a picture. So even if I have to create a very very

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:17.390
complex structure, so where my agent is supposed to do a

00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:21.230
communication and all of those agents are available in a

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:24.030
different different library, different different framework

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:28.790
but still just because of A2A I am using over here. So it is

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:32.010
going to create some sort of a standardization in terms of

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:35.550
input and output and that is the only thing that we are

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:38.250
looking for as a part of the protocol. I believe this is

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:41.770
what we were able to understand even with respect to an API,

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:44.930
right. So when we say API, so obviously it will be having

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:47.530
some sort of a standard protocol that it is running on this

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:50.310
particular URL, this particular path. This is going to take

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:52.750
this kind of a data and this is going to give this kind of a

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:56.410
output. This is where my entire A2A flow comes into a

00:32:56.410 --> 00:33:00.470
picture. So can I make a claim over here that in future if

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:04.390
we are going to get this kind of a requirement, so where I

00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:07.910
have maybe a tens of agents or maybe a thousands of agent

00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:11.550
designed in a different different framework but if I am

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:16.610
going to fix an input and output, right. And then if I am

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:17.350
going to fix an input and output. If I am going to like

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:19.810
maybe host it on a different different server, that is

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:21.950
subjective, that depends, right. Depends upon the project

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:24.810
structure but still I will be able to establish a

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:27.510
communication and I will be able to achieve this kind of a

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:31.350
structure, yes, yeah.

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:36.410
Coordinator means here orchestrator basically, one which is

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:40.770
trying to call the agent, as simple as that. That is the

00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:44.210
meaning of a coordinator in this particular place, nothing

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:48.230
more than that, okay. This is technically a structure and at

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:51.710
the end of the day my goal was to finalize or my goal was to

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:54.950
freeze a input and output. If I am able to freeze input

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:57.870
output, simply means that I am trying to follow some sort of

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:01.170
a protocol. Technically over here that protocol name is A2A

00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:05.710
that we are using in this particular manner. Okay, now just

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:08.310
close everything, right, just close everything and let us go

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:11.050
inside a code and let us try to understand that how it is

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:15.730
actually working. So here we have already seen orchestrator

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:19.750
.py file, so where orchestrator was helping me out in terms

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:22.770
of, you know, orchestrating the entire things. Apart from

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:25.870
that, so there is one file which I have added. So I have

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:28.750
just added this particular file, A2A server.py file because

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:32.450
I have to separate the entire like agents which was

00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:35.350
technically running. So I have created just this additional

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:37.990
file. Apart from that, you will not be able to find out any

00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:42.070
other files by the way over here. And here. So. So in this

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:46.310
A2A library, you will be able to see A2A fast API

00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:51.190
application, yeah. So a fast API application implementing a

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:56.310
A2A protocol server endpoint. This is going to do a magic

00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:59.130
and this has actually done the magic. So how I am able to

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:01.850
create a different different agent and for a different

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:04.870
different agent, a different different URL or servers just

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:09.030
because of this A2A fast API application. This has already,

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:11.670
this has helped me out. And technically it's, it's nothing

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:16.290
but just a, like a wrapper of A2A on top of a fast API that

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:19.610
we already know. And it's already available inside my A2A as

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:24.350
simple as that. And then the rest is exactly same. So I have

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:28.210
not changed anything over there, right? Except this A2A fast

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:31.310
API application, which is just helping me out in terms of

00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:35.650
converting each and everything, uh, as, as of like, uh, you

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:38.130
know, uh, with the help of A2A, it is helping me out. It is

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:40.790
helping me out in terms of converting things into a, uh, API

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:44.890
path, API endpoint. Now coming to my orchestrator.py file.

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:48.130
So here, if you will come to line number, I'll just try to

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:50.710
show you the message format, which I was like talking about,

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:55.090
right? So here you will be able to see that I have a very

00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:57.730
first agent and this agent is something that we have already

00:35:57.730 --> 00:35:59.950
seen, right? This agent is something which I have already

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:04.030
seen. So when I was talking about this structure, so I told

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:07.270
you there are two things. One is a message part for any

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:09.330
agent, right? Any agent that we are going to create. So one

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:12.970
is a message part and second one is a data part as simple as

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:18.150
that. So here create a text message with the data. So for

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:20.890
the very first agent, which is my Langchain agent, which is

00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:24.370
helping me out in terms of reading out a data. So here I'm

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:27.530
trying to provide two things. One is this and one is this

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:31.350
one, that's it, right? So one is an instruction. So ingest

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:34.450
the provided, uh, ingest the provided sales data and produce

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:37.050
the structured summary. So this is a message. This is the

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:40.890
instruction. I'm giving for a LM and then here I'm trying to

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:44.110
provide up data that, okay, so you should read a data from

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:47.890
this particular path. So path I have already given. So here

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:51.570
is a path PD Pandas dot read CSV. So I'm reading from a

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:54.610
local system and then I'm trying to say that, that, okay,

00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:58.730
fine. So this is a data dot CSV. So basically this is like a

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:01.550
data set that you will be able to get it into a CSV format

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:04.590
and then model wise. So model, which I have already provided

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:07.190
a default model, a chat GPT model, which I have already

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:11.610
provided over here. So this is how it is going to consider

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:14.950
an instruction. It is going to read a data and then finally

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:20.670
it will be able to give me an output in this particular one.

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:24.370
So once it will be able to like, uh, you know, uh, like, uh,

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:27.990
get this kind of a request basically. So then it is going to

00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:29.510
perform this

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:36.010
entire operation. So it is going to send a message and then

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:40.130
it is going to basically read by entire data. Yeah. With the

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:43.070
help of agent card. So agent card is something that we have

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:45.170
already discussed in my previous lecture that, okay, fine.

00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:47.390
So we are creating an agent card, which is like going to

00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:50.070
build one of my agent because technically agent card is

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:54.410
something called as agents inside my A2A protocol. Now once

00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:57.370
this will be done, right, once it will be, once this will be

00:37:57.370 --> 00:38:00.010
done. So once it will be able to give me the final output,

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:04.490
then what we will do. So here we have something called as

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:07.930
A2A server dot PI file. So which is coordinating, right?

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:10.650
Which is technically like, you know. Helping me out in terms

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:14.250
of doing a coordination. So here inside my line number,

00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:19.070
this, so I have created a technically one class, like I told

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:21.670
you. So this is a new file which I have created. Uh, it was

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:23.970
not available in your previous code base if you'll go and

00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:27.250
check. So here there is a class which I have created. So

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:30.850
reader request handler. So whenever reader will try to

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:33.510
perform some sort of operation. So how it is going to

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:36.990
technically handle entire request and how it is going to

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:41.670
process the entire data set. Over here. So here on message

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:44.830
sent. So once it will be like a invoke, so it is going to

00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:47.830
get a data part. It is going to get a data part with the

00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:51.430
help of all of these that we have given on message sent.

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:54.230
Basically on message sent, it is going to perform this

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:56.470
operation and this is nothing but that we are doing it

00:38:56.470 --> 00:39:00.650
inside my orchestrator already. Okay. Now let me close this

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:04.170
part. Okay. So it is, it is going to like a handle the

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:07.650
request for a reader and then technically it is going to run

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:10.790
the reader. Okay. And to run a reader. So basically it's a

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:14.650
Lantern based model that we have created or Lantern based

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:16.850
agent that we have created. So it is going to call this

00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:22.090
reader similarly. So for my analyst, I have a message part

00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:25.750
that will be sent and then I have created a class which is

00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:29.330
going to handle a request for this one. Similarly for my

00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:32.950
visualizer. So this is a class which I created so for all of

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:37.110
these three agent just to handle request and response. That

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:40.470
this is a input that you are supposed to take and this is

00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:43.370
the output that you are supposed to give. So I have created

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:46.810
three different, different, different, different class. But

00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:50.310
technically all of these three agent which I have created.

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:54.270
So if you will come to the, this particular part, it is

00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:57.350
taking only two things. One is a message and one is a data

00:39:57.350 --> 00:40:00.970
part. So message as an instruction and data means input and

00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:04.350
then eventually it is going to give the output out of that

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:08.810
one. Now. So this, anyone who is having any question guys

00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:12.690
with respect to this, yeah, so this is just a code addition

00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:15.230
on the previous one. So we are not doing much over here. So

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:18.370
we are just trying to like add a piece of the code which is

00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:21.830
helping me out in terms of segregating the entire agents

00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:23.890
model over here. That's it.

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:30.710
Then there is a line number one zero two. You will be able

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:35.890
to find out inside this orchestrator.py file and here, so it

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:39.830
is trying to call extract text from the messages. So here

00:40:39.830 --> 00:40:42.610
extract text for the messages, whatever messages it is going

00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:45.570
to give me as a return. So we are trying to extract all of

00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:49.310
this data out of this one. This is our old file. So same A2A

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:52.130
utils file that we have created already in my last class. So

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:54.270
we are trying to use it and then it is helping me out in

00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:57.930
terms of doing a data extraction. So once we are able to

00:40:57.930 --> 00:41:02.350
like read a text and then we are able to get a payload, then

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:06.010
we are trying to create a text message with the data, which

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:09.070
is nothing but a data extraction. data used for a analyst.

00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:12.690
So it is going to send data to the analyst and then again

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:15.970
analyst is trying to follow the exact same thing. Message

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:19.530
and then data that is it. Message and data and analyst is

00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:23.450
going to give me the final output. Now once it will be done

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:25.790
again we are calling extract text message from the analyst

00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:29.830
basically and then we are trying to create a data for my

00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:33.650
visualizer. So again message and the data we are trying to

00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:36.650
send to the visualizer and then visualizer is going to like

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:39.310
do a final visualization and I will be able to eventually

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:43.230
get the final output. Now here configuration wise if you

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:47.050
will go and check. So we have created basically an agent

00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:49.390
endpoint. So we are saying that that okay so whenever you

00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:52.990
are trying to perform this operation do one thing. So for

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:57.030
reader try to use this particular endpoint for analyst try

00:41:57.030 --> 00:42:00.230
to use this particular endpoint and for visualizer so try to

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:03.550
use basically this particular endpoint. So this is a place

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:07.750
where I have defined. Now here you can try to give a server

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:10.490
location any server location of your choice or maybe any

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:14.610
port location of your choice and it will be able to host all

00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:17.930
of those agent in the respective server or in a respective

00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:20.770
port number. So in my case my server is same its local host

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:24.050
I have just like a differentiated it with the help of port

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:28.270
number 1, 2 and 3. Even my endpoint is same like or my path

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:32.230
is same after this entire endpoint. So slash a to a. So

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:34.430
where I am trying to host each and everything. So here I am

00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:35.230
trying to host each and everything. So this is how my model

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:38.110
is going to collaborate and my model is going to give me the

00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:44.790
final output. Yes everyone so once I am going to send you

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:47.750
the file so maybe you all will be able to understand it and

00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:50.610
if you will try to digest this entire thing then it will

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:53.870
give you more and more clarity but yeah so maybe just by

00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:57.310
looking into this it is going to give you some sort of a

00:42:57.310 --> 00:43:03.560
goose bumps that what is going on over here. But I have just

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:07.360
added only one file a to a server.py file. And in

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:10.180
orchestrator I have just given an endpoint that is the only

00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:13.520
changes which I have made if you will go and do a comparison

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:17.440
with respect to the previous one. So that one can handle a

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:21.920
request and response from a different one that is it.

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:31.160
We need API key yes even last class right so we were using

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.360
an API key. So my API key is already available in .env file.

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:38.340
So I am already keeping my API key and yeah so all of you

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:41.900
can use the same API key to run this entire server. Now

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:45.720
coming to a running part by the way so to run this entire

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:49.500
application what you can do so you can try to run a

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:54.020
individual like you know server one by one one by one so you

00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:58.220
can try to run the individual server. So here to run this

00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:01.620
one so there is a start file which I have already created

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:04.880
for all of you so that you know you all will be able to run

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:08.640
it. There is a script folder and then there is something

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.700
called as start agent dot py file which I have already

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:16.160
created. So here basically what it is trying to do so it is

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:20.340
trying to call a enlist app a reader app and a visualizer

00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:24.980
app. So enlist app is available inside my this location

00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:28.500
right path is slash A to A. So where we are creating

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:31.040
technically everything is going to start from the agent card

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:35.240
right. So here at this location my enlist app is been

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:39.120
hosted. Similarly on this location my visualizer app is

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:42.620
hosted. And similarly at this location. My reader app is

00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:46.500
hosted. So all three app inside my A to A server dot py file

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:49.500
which is a old file which is a previous like the file that

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:52.980
we have already discussed and yeah so everyone is trying to

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:55.240
give me like a finally a fast API. This is just a notation

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:57.420
which I have kept over here nothing more than that

00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:02.240
basically. So here there is a start agent dot py file. So

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:06.800
which is going to import all of these three and then there

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:10.760
is a agent builder. So create a reader app. Create an enlist

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:13.720
app. Create a visualizer app card basically. So we are

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:16.460
trying to use this agent builder in this particular place

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:20.520
and then one by one one by one. So we have parameterized it

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:23.900
in such a way that you will be able to run an agent. So how

00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:26.800
you will be able to run the agent. So for example if I have

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:32.600
to run maybe this reader agent so to run a reader agent so

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:36.880
you can try to use basically this python code which I am

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:39.000
going to show you if

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:44.960
I have to run only one agent. So python m you have to go

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:47.920
into a script folder the folder that we have inside that we

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:51.000
have a python file called as start underscore py and then

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.780
you can try to give a parameter hyphen hyphen agent is equal

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:59.240
to reader and port number is equal to 8001. So it is going

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:02.380
to run it. It is going to run just a reader agent similarly

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:05.680
so you can try to change port number is equal to 8002 and

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:08.760
then here so you can try to change agent is equal to analyst

00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:11.600
and it is going to run enlist agent. Similarly. So agent

00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:14.560
name is going to visualizer and then port number is equal to

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:19.340
8003 and you will be able to run all of these agent one by

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:22.560
one one by one. So technically your three server will be up

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:25.580
and running. Ideally three server will be up and running.

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:32.040
Now so let's suppose if I have to run all of these agent in

00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:35.360
one single go and again your UI will be running separately.

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:39.280
So your UI file is available. Let me terminate this one.

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:42.880
Yeah. So CLS okay.

00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:50.630
So your UI file is available inside your UI directory. So

00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:54.850
here inside source inside UI. So app.py file. So UI is same

00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:58.190
UI we have not done much of changes in terms of like a

00:46:58.190 --> 00:47:03.090
showing the entire like a process basically. So UI is up and

00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:07.190
running at app.py file. So UI is a streamlined one. So run

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:10.630
all three server one by one one by one one by one. And then

00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:15.230
try to run a UI. So that you know UI will be able to fetch

00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:20.030
each and everything in a like a sequential manner. Apart

00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:24.030
from that so I have also created one like a file over here.

00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:27.790
So so that you know you will be able to run everything in

00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:31.910
one single go and this file is basically a start all agent.

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:34.750
So if you would like to start agent individually then go

00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:37.670
through a start agent file and then just try to change the

00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:39.890
port number. Just try to change the agent name and then it

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:43.770
is going to work. Okay. So you have to call start all the

00:47:43.770 --> 00:47:47.490
agents. So it's a single file. So which is going where

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:50.390
everything I have configured where I have configured. So

00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:52.890
reader and list and visualizer as well as its port number.

00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:56.550
So just have to call your start agent and then it is going

00:47:56.550 --> 00:48:00.710
to start one by one one by one automatically each and

00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:04.110
everything. That's it. Right. So let me show you the run

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:07.490
part guys how we will be able to execute how I will be able

00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:11.010
to run it. So let me close my previous session. Okay. So

00:48:11.010 --> 00:48:17.370
that my port will be free and it should be available and

00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:25.770
API key is must if API key is not available then you won't

00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:26.470
be able to do it.

00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:39.920
Okay. So to run this entire things first of all you have to

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:43.320
activate your virtual environment. So to activate a virtual

00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:48.200
environment command is going to be virtual environment and

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:52.340
then inside that there is something called as SCRI PTS

00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:57.480
scripts. And then inside this script. So I have basically

00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:02.980
activate PS one power cell one. So activate PS one. So in

00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:06.420
this way my virtual environment will be activated. Now once

00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:09.020
this is activated then what we can do. So if I have to start

00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:14.840
all the agent all together so I can just try to call start

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.120
all the agent.

00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:28.240
Yeah. So here Python and then hyphen M. And then. And then I

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:33.400
have to go inside my script folder. This one. So a script

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:44.100
folder SCRI PTS scripts and then dot start SCRI PTS SCRI

00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:50.620
PTS. Okay so script dot start start underscore all

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:57.400
underscore AG and T agent S basically. So in this way you

00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:02.420
will be able to see. So launching reader agent at 8001 and

00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:07.520
list at 8002 and then visualizer at 8003. So you can keep

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:11.200
all of these agent three agents up and running. You can like

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:16.420
you know try to copy this all three agents individually and

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:20.280
maybe let

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:41.320
me check. Yeah so all three agents are up and running.

00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:16.470
8001 slash. Yeah. 8002 a to a. Okay

00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:11.940
so 404 not found. Let me check and

00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:23.320
here. So again power cell virtual environment is activated.

00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:28.700
So I can try to run. My Streamlit application,

00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:34.800
Streamlit run.

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:43.260
And I can go into SRC folder. Inside SRC. I can go into UI

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:51.280
folder. folder, now inside UI I can try to run my app.py

00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:59.460
file, yeah, ok, fine. So like I have shown you basically, so

00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:03.180
you have to run two things, so one is basically this start

00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:05.980
all the agent, so to start all the agent, so this is a file

00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:09.500
that you can try to use, if you want to start all the agent

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:13.740
in one single go. If I would like to start agent in one by

00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:17.000
one, I have already configured that inside my start agent.py

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.520
file and you have to follow the command that I have given

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:23.620
over here. So simple, host number then port number and then

00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:27.980
like agent name and then it will try to fire itself. Now so

00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:31.120
once you are going to run this entire thing, maybe you can

00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:33.880
go and you can try to test it in the exact similar manner,

00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:38.320
so everything must be up and running, right. So this is how

00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:41.780
guys I can try to create agents and then I will be able to

00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:45.020
do the coordination. So this is the only changes which I

00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:48.000
have asked you to do. In my previous session, so that you

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:53.280
know, I will be able to like create a A to A protocol

00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:53.700
driven.

00:53:58.650 --> 00:54:02.650
Let me share this entire code file, so I have just like a

00:54:02.650 --> 00:54:09.130
made small changes, so that you all will be able to access

00:54:09.130 --> 00:54:12.470
it and you all will be able to execute it. So copy path,

00:54:16.310 --> 00:54:20.610
multi agent, let me delete this previous file.

00:54:44.770 --> 00:54:47.490
So like I told you in my previous lecture, so even I have

00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:49.910
faced a lot of issues. With respect to, you know, creating

00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:54.330
this demo for A to A specifically. So it has given me a lot

00:54:54.330 --> 00:54:58.570
of, you know, issues, problems and pains and couple of

00:54:58.570 --> 00:55:02.510
sleepless night. Then I was able to create this like, you

00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:08.390
know, entire demo for all of you because the demo which is

00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:11.270
available over the internet, so they are not trying to

00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:14.150
showcase you know, actual coordination between the agent,

00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:17.350
they are not in most of the cases, so they have just created

00:55:17.350 --> 00:55:19.870
a very simple like an agent which anyone can create,

00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:23.890
technically an agent card, which A2A gives you by default.

00:55:24.130 --> 00:55:27.330
But agent card anyone can come and anyone can try to create,

00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:31.430
the major part is the communication, so how agent is able to

00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:34.390
communicate in between and that too by using a heterogeneous

00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:37.450
library. So for example in this one, so we have used three

00:55:37.450 --> 00:55:39.870
libraries, a different one or three framework you can say,

00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:43.030
Lanchen, Krew AI and Autogen. So that was a major problem.

00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:45.730
Apart from that if you will go and check over the internet,

00:55:45.850 --> 00:55:48.790
you will be able to find out all the simple example where

00:55:48.790 --> 00:55:51.050
people have used just one single framework and they are

00:55:51.050 --> 00:55:54.610
showing you okay fine this is the A2A. But again it will not

00:55:54.610 --> 00:56:01.770
give you a real sense of basically A2A. So A2A final demo

00:56:01.770 --> 00:56:07.030
and this is where it has created a lot of pain for me. So

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:10.090
let me upload this file guys inside your dashboard so that

00:56:10.090 --> 00:56:11.690
you can download the latest one.

00:56:20.850 --> 00:56:25.150
And in such kind of a situation even vive coding does not

00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:30.290
work. So vive coding also comes with a limitation okay.

00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:37.600
So let me go to D drive multi agent and then upload.

00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:54.320
Okay so fine everyone just go to your dashboard and inside

00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:57.360
your dashboard I have already uploaded this file in your

00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:59.600
previous lecture. So 9th November lecture if you will go to

00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:02.040
a resource section, the second one. The first one is from

00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:05.420
the previous session and this is from my this session A2A

00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:08.260
final demo. So just try to download this one, it is like a

00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:11.880
250 MB of a file. So download it. And then when you are

00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:16.020
trying to execute it like me, so try to activate first of

00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:19.280
all your environment file and once that environment file

00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:25.080
will be activated then try to just run it. Yeah and let me

00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:26.260
know if you are facing any kind of issues.

00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:33.120
Can you give me a practical implementation of how this can

00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:35.380
be used? I think I have given you a practical implementation

00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:37.840
itself right. So there are 3 different different kind of

00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:40.000
agent created in a 3 different different kind of a

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.740
framework. I have already given you analogy in my previous

00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:46.060
session. That let's suppose there are multiple team inside

00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:49.140
your company and every team is trying to build their own

00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:51.840
agent. Let's suppose there is a HR team, there is a finance

00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:56.560
team, there is a legal team. And all of these 3 teams are

00:57:56.560 --> 00:58:00.260
building a massive number of an agent but the problem is

00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:02.140
that that they are trying to use a different different

00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:04.640
framework, they are not using a same framework. So maybe

00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:06.920
your legal team has adopted an autogen framework, your

00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:09.420
finance team has adopted maybe a lanchan kind of a framework

00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:13.080
and then your HR team has adopted maybe a crew AI kind of a

00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:19.040
framework. And again you are trying to build an agent on a

00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:22.340
company level. So there are like a separate separate team,

00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:26.600
independent team, HR and finance and then your basically a

00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:29.960
legal team right. So there are 3 different different kind of

00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:35.320
a team. So HR, legal and then finance team. So they have

00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:38.040
let's suppose 100 agent, they have 50 agent and they have

00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:41.900
maybe a 20 agent. And then you come into a picture. Yeah.

00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:44.480
And then you come into a picture or maybe like someone told

00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:48.080
you that okay so we have to build a complete application

00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:52.580
where it is supposed to use HR agent as well as it is

00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:55.700
supposed to use agent which legal team has already built it

00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:58.840
because they are the subject expert and they are they have

00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:01.700
built an agent which works for a legal at least. And then

00:59:01.700 --> 00:59:04.120
there is a finance team so who have already built an agent,

00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:08.760
I have to build a complete platform so where I will be using

00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:12.560
a legal finance and a HR and then finally, I will be able to

00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:15.680
build application. So that anyone sitting on top of it

00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:19.280
right. So maybe your manager, your director, they will be

00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:23.060
able to access all of these HR, legal and finance agent and

00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:25.820
they will be able to maybe see some sort of a repose. They

00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:28.680
will be able to do some sort of a job. They will be able to

00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:31.380
access a respective department that what is going inside

00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:34.960
this HR team and what their agent is doing or like if their

00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:38.500
agent is like a maybe for a hiring process right. So maybe

00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:41.760
HR team has created a agent for a hiring and again inside

00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:44.400
that. So let's suppose. So there is an agent. So we try to

00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:48.400
perform a validation with respect to ATS resume. There are

00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:51.640
like an agent which try to basically fire a background

00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:54.980
verification for an employee. There is an agent inside the

00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:58.100
HR team so which try to do a payroll processing. There is an

00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:00.820
agent inside the HR team so which maybe try to do some sort

01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:05.700
of a you know basically like a new requirements or maybe a

01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:09.240
new type of like a department if we have to establish so

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:12.760
maybe they try to figure it out in that way. So the HR team

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:15.260
is already having a multiple agent. Similarly legal team is

01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:17.360
already having a multiple agent. Finance team is already

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:20.580
having a multiple agent and their process is pretty much

01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:23.840
robust. But the problem is that that they are using a land

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:26.180
chain framework. Maybe they are using a crew AI framework

01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:28.840
and maybe they are using some sort of auto gen framework or

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:31.420
maybe some other framework. So again framework wise it is

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:34.600
different. System is completely scattered and as a

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:39.300
management of a company so if I have to access all of these

01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:44.320
three. So I need a protocol so which is going to help me out

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:47.200
in terms of establishing a communication. Communication

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:51.760
between all of these three team member. This is where my A

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:55.060
to A protocol comes into a picture. So this is what I have

01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:58.960
shown you. So here agents are independent and then still we

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:02.120
are able to communicate. Now to communicate I just have to

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.520
follow a protocol and as per a protocol so I have to take

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:07.940
care of two things. One is a message part and one is a data

01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:11.060
part. Which is nothing. But an integrated part of your A to

01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:14.320
A. So A to A simply says that okay give me a message. So

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:18.300
whenever you are giving me a data so do always one thing

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:21.160
always try to give me a message as well as always try to

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:23.880
give me a data in a respective format maybe into a JSON

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:27.040
format let us suppose in our situation. If I am going to

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:30.420
like build all of these agent in such a way that it will

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:35.240
take input as a message and data both and then if it is

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:37.980
going to give me output as a message or maybe a data. So

01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:41.960
again I will try to pass same thing to the next one. And

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:45.960
here my coordinator is going to be A to A. So A to A is

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:47.960
going to help me out in terms of coordination. So basically

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:51.040
all of these things are going to work technically on top of

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:54.540
the A to A. So this is where the real time application comes

01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:57.200
into a picture and this is what we have seen with respect to

01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:00.160
my three agents that we have built in a different different

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:04.440
frameworks. So anyone guys who is able to execute the code.

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:07.200
Yeah.

01:02:21.590 --> 01:02:23.230
I mean in production basis. So this is the A to A system.

01:02:23.450 --> 01:02:25.990
This can be used for integration with a third party services

01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:29.650
which exposes their agent to communicate. Yes. But you have

01:02:29.650 --> 01:02:31.930
to give instruction in a very first place that this is the

01:02:31.930 --> 01:02:35.030
specific output which I am looking for means a data format.

01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:37.950
A format of the output should be this one. So which is

01:02:37.950 --> 01:02:41.530
compatible with the A to A. If it is not then you have to

01:02:41.530 --> 01:02:44.370
take their raw input whatever input that they are giving to

01:02:44.370 --> 01:02:47.650
you and then you have to convert those input into a A to A

01:02:47.650 --> 01:02:49.550
compatible format. Simple.

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:57.740
Please highlight. So that. First time installing and

01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:00.260
starting. I think this is a code base which I have already

01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:03.700
shared in my previous class. So I have just done a little

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:06.360
bit of modification on top of my previous code. Nothing

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:10.220
much. I have just added one single file over here and then

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:13.520
inside orchestrator the port number. That's it. The end

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:16.420
point basically. This one. This is the only addition that

01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:19.820
has been done apart from that entire code base is same.

01:03:22.770 --> 01:03:26.370
This is what we call restful agent. Right. Yes. Technically

01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:30.370
it is using a fast API. So technically it's a restful that

01:03:30.370 --> 01:03:35.650
we are talking about. Yeah. Because here so inside A to A

01:03:35.650 --> 01:03:38.410
what they have done. So they have used A to A fast API

01:03:38.410 --> 01:03:41.310
wrapper. I mean like they have created their own fast API

01:03:41.310 --> 01:03:43.490
wrapper and they are calling it as a A to A fast API

01:03:43.490 --> 01:03:43.790
wrapper.

01:03:56.410 --> 01:03:59.670
I hope we can also perform a parallel processing through A

01:03:59.670 --> 01:04:03.530
to A. So I believe I have already shown you a kind of a

01:04:03.530 --> 01:04:08.990
structure. See. If my agents consider as a node, right.

01:04:09.030 --> 01:04:13.270
Consider as a separate separate node. Now I can try to

01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:19.010
connect those node in any way I want as simple as that. In

01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:22.610
any way I want these agents are technically an independent

01:04:22.610 --> 01:04:26.690
one. Just like think about, okay. So if someone is like

01:04:26.690 --> 01:04:29.790
finding it difficult in terms of like thinking or like

01:04:29.790 --> 01:04:32.730
processing this entire information. Okay. So maybe you can

01:04:32.730 --> 01:04:36.630
think about a fast API as we already know and inside a fast

01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:39.310
API. So we try to do what? So we try to create a different

01:04:39.310 --> 01:04:41.550
different methods, right. We try to get a different

01:04:41.550 --> 01:04:45.050
different methods or our functions and we try to expose that

01:04:45.050 --> 01:04:48.890
function on a particular route. Yeah. On a particular route.

01:04:49.090 --> 01:04:52.190
It's just like that. So we are trying to create our agents.

01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:55.090
We are trying to create a route for that particular agent.

01:04:55.810 --> 01:04:56.210
Simple.

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:01.080
And then you can try to configure it in the way that you

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:01.340
want.

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:09.320
Sumit is saying lot of dependencies issue. Just use my V

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:11.860
environment file I have already attached. Activate that V

01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:14.240
environment. You will not face an issue. Everything is

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:15.080
available over there.

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:21.740
Yeah. So Dhruvil is saying it's running. Okay. Fine Dhruvil.

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:24.060
So Dhruvil is the first person who is able to run it.

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:29.400
Amazing. Great. Digest. Just go through. Like majorly you

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:31.940
have to go through this orchestrator and then like a server

01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:32.680
file. That's it.

01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:47.680
So just run it guys. This is what I had to discuss for my

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:50.400
today's class. I will not be starting a new topic. Like I

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:53.340
said, so tomorrow class is going to be very, very important.

01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:56.980
And after tomorrow, whatever class we are going to take, it

01:05:56.980 --> 01:06:02.340
is going to be very, very important in like a term of

01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:05.960
sending any kind of application to a cloud platform. So as I

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:08.980
have already told you even last week, so keep your AWS

01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:13.640
account, Azure account and GCP account ready. So one by one,

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:17.280
I'm going to teach you that how you will be able to

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:20.760
configure. First of all, I'll start with the AWS. So how you

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:23.940
will be able to configure a entire infrastructure over AWS,

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:28.160
how you are going to create a CI CD pipeline basically. So

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:31.940
for example, let's say this is an application that we have

01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:34.380
to host. So how we are going to do a continuous integration

01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:37.740
and continuous development. If we have to create some sort

01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:40.480
of a Docker file, so how I will be able to create a Docker

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:44.340
file and then how I will be able to host it if I have to

01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:48.640
host it maybe for one user or maybe for 1 million user. So

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:52.560
how I will be able to set up auto scaling. So that is also,

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:56.180
I'm going to teach you and then how you will be able to

01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:59.300
attach a Prometheus and Grafana. So by which you will be

01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:02.040
able to generate an application log, you will be able to

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:05.240
visualize those application log if your application will go

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:08.380
down. So how you will be able to configure a trigger, uh,

01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:12.080
which is going to notify a concerned stakeholder. If your

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:14.920
entire server will go down, means your machine will go down,

01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:17.600
which you are going to spin on a, uh, on any of such

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:21.440
platform. Okay. So how you will be able to take a log from a

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:24.580
machines. So application log will be different and your

01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:27.300
machine log will be different, right? Server log will be

01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:30.780
different. So both of these things we are going to configure

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:33.560
from application side as well as from a server side. And

01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:35.960
then we can say that, okay, fine. So our application is a

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:39.760
full proof application, which is going to work for any

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:44.380
number of a user for me. And uh, if my server is going down

01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:48.060
at any point of a time, I will be able to get a message. I

01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:51.740
will be able to get a notification saying that this is the

01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:55.440
log and my server is down on my, this part of application is

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:58.740
down. So that is something that we are going to explore. Uh,

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:02.000
so yeah, that, that's, that is going to be an interesting

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.800
one. I would say, right, a pretty much interesting one, but

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:08.300
you will not be able to do it unless and until you don't

01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:13.080
have a cloud access, right? So cloud access is required. So

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:15.740
please keep your cloud account ready so that we can start

01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:18.540
from tomorrow. Tomorrow. I want to give you a basic overview

01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:21.780
of the cloud AWS cloud generally that, uh, what is the

01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:24.460
meaning of, you know, uh, groups, what is the meaning of IEM

01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:26.940
over there? What is the meaning of a different, different

01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:29.700
kind of a user creation with a different, different kind of

01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:34.280
access, how I will be able to spin a machine over AWS, maybe

01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:38.240
a CPU, maybe a GPU. And let's suppose I'm talking about a

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:42.060
URI kind of a platform. So what is a bare minimum server

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:45.600
requirement that we have? So how many V core that we should

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:49.120
have? How many RAM? We should have, and then how many, how

01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:52.040
much of hard disk that we should have. So all of these

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:54.980
things, uh, I'll start talking about, yeah.

01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:04.320
So PGI got a similar time in it, how you can set up the

01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:07.160
whole project and make it a scalable, how you manage the

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:09.900
traffic. Yeah, that is, that is what I'm going to talk about

01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:13.300
apart from that. So I'm going to even show you that, uh,

01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:17.000
let's suppose you have to map your own end point. For

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.900
example, you have taken a website URL, right? Website you

01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:22.660
have taken from a domain. You have purchased from somewhere.

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:26.460
xyg.com or maybe.ai.com or something, right? You have

01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:30.180
purchased. So how you will be able to do a DNS mapping. So

01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:32.800
that is that part. Also I'm going, that's a very small part

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:36.840
basically. And if you are able to do it once in a life, you

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:39.220
will be able to do it again and again, because that process

01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:42.800
is pretty much like a same. So go purchase some sort of a,

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:46.380
you know, a website from godaddy.com or from him, like

01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:50.020
anyone, any, any like a, you know, domain name provider. So

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:52.220
just go and purchase. And then like, uh, with your

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:55.420
application. You can try to map it and your application will

01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:58.660
be available at that particular domain. For example, your

01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:02.260
own, right? So we have your own slash URI and add that or

01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:06.500
URIs dot your own dot one. So where we have hosted on in

01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:09.860
subdomain in basically subdomain, we have hosted a URI. So

01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:12.440
that is the kind of a mapping which I'm going to teach you

01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:15.420
so that that will be a final application. You are not going

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:18.820
to share some server generated a URL or IP address, but your

01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:24.180
own domain basically. So all those things is a part of your

01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:29.000
production from tomorrow onwards. That session is going to

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.820
start and that will be like a final stage of your entire

01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:38.060
batch. For cloud, can we use a free account service or do we

01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:40.980
need to pay? I mean like they are giving you a free credit.

01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:44.780
If you are like a shutting down your service after doing the

01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:47.800
experimentation, then they will not charge you. Otherwise be

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:50.460
ready for charge. If you will leave your AWS, you know,

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:53.720
servers up and running, then obviously you will end up

01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:56.960
getting. Lacks of bill at the end of the month. That's

01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:01.920
possible. So advice is like a to shut down the server. So

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:06.420
once you are done with your experimentation, will there be

01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:11.200
use of K8s, K8s I'm not going to use it. Docker I will be

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:11.520
using.

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:20.900
Yeah. Tomorrow is the final session. I mean like how I can

01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:23.320
complete all these things in one session practically

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:27.540
impossible. I said final stage of your class will start from

01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:31.400
tomorrow that will go for next two to three weeks at least

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:39.660
means five to six classes minimum is required. Yeah. So in

01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:42.060
one session, no one can finish that you will not be able to

01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:45.040
even understand. And basically I will not be able to even

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:49.160
like cover those, those many things. Session based on UDHDK.

01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:52.640
I mean, yeah, that is fine. But first of all, let's focus on

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:56.240
syllabus part. Fine guys. So just try to execute. I don't

01:11:56.240 --> 01:12:00.340
have much to discuss today. So this is what I already told

01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:03.060
you in my previous session. As well that today I will be

01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:06.200
talking about just an enhancement of A2A and then tomorrow.

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:12.220
So technically a cloud part. Yeah. Fine. So just be

01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:14.980
prepared, be ready with your cloud account, all three,

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:18.260
right. I'll be starting with AWS like I said, but yeah, so I

01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:21.460
need all three cloud accounts. So that one by one, one by

01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:24.140
one, we can, we can do the experimentation into all of these

01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:27.540
three cloud account. What was the command to run all the

01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:30.460
agent in one go? Okay. Let me ping you that command. So

01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:36.220
basically this is the command, uh, Python M and then there

01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:38.240
is a script folder. You don't have to even remember the

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:41.100
command. So it's fine. Python hyphen M and then go to the

01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:44.080
script folder inside the script folder. There is a file name

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:48.360
called a start all agent, right? So scripts dot this file

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:52.340
name. That's it. Not dot py. So Python hyphen M this is

01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:54.740
script dot py file and then you will be able to run this

01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:58.100
whole agent. If you have to run the UI part, which is

01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:00.040
nothing but a streamline. So UI is available. It is

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:02.720
available inside your source SRC. So streamline dot

01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:08.440
streamline run and then SRC slash UI slash app dot py file.

01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:11.980
So by which you will be able to run your final streamline

01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:16.900
application. Let me ping you that after activating your

01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:20.180
virtual environment, otherwise no. And your virtual

01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:23.440
environment is available here. So as you can see dot venv,

01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:28.040
then go inside the scripts. So dot venv slash scripts. And

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:30.320
inside that you will be able to see activation. Activate dot

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:34.480
ps1 at least for a power cell, right? So activates as a

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:39.100
script slash activate ps1 and then it will be activated. As

01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:40.680
simple as that code

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:49.380
for enable V environment, please simple. See guys, go to

01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:53.060
your virtual environment venv and no need to remember any of

01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:57.060
these things, right? It's very logical. So I'll go to my

01:13:57.060 --> 01:13:59.700
virtual environment folder. First of all, inside this

01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:02.520
folder, there is a folder called a script S capital. So I'll

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:05.860
go to my script folder. Inside that there is a file called

01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:10.260
as activate dot ps1 power cell one, right? So activate and

01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:13.560
then this is the command. That's it. So just follow the

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:14.060
folder structure.

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:23.340
What is the previous class running command? Previous class

01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:24.480
running command was also same.

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:31.220
So in previous class I believe there was only UI and through

01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:36.000
UI itself you can like a invoke. So just run app and it

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.140
should work. I am able to run. Thanks sir. Okay, great.

01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:47.580
Why aren't we using just activate? But using activate. You

01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:49.320
can use activate dot ps1. You can use activate as well.

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:50.780
That's okay. Yeah.

01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:59.670
So just run it, run it and then leave it basically.

01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:13.760
Okay fine everyone. So I'm done for today. So let's close

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:16.600
our session for today. I have already shared a code and

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:19.540
yeah, so let's join our tomorrow session. So today's session

01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:24.000
is like a kind of, you know, a very, very short session for

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:24.280
us.

01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:39.110
Yeah. So fine. When you have uploaded, sir, which one? This

01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:42.090
this particular file. So inside your full dashboard,

01:15:42.330 --> 01:15:44.970
basically a previous lecture, the previous Sunday's lecture,

01:15:45.630 --> 01:15:48.870
you will be able to find out two files to just download the

01:15:48.870 --> 01:15:50.010
recent one, the latest one.

01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:58.310
Yeah. Today code will there, yeah, it's already available

01:15:58.310 --> 01:16:01.470
guys. So if you will go to your dashboard, let me show you

01:16:01.470 --> 01:16:05.070
once again, those who are confused. So just go to your

01:16:05.070 --> 01:16:12.070
dashboard for, sorry, not this one, this account. Yeah. So

01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:14.410
just go inside your dashboard, gen AI certification

01:16:14.410 --> 01:16:18.970
bootcamp, continue learning and then a ninth number lecture,

01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:22.230
right? Which was like a last Sunday's lecture. So here, if

01:16:22.230 --> 01:16:24.730
you'll come, you will be able to find out this file, A2A

01:16:24.730 --> 01:16:27.850
final demo file. This is the previous file, download it and

01:16:27.850 --> 01:16:30.930
then simple run your agent and then run your UI.

01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:38.180
No module name A2A. So you have to activate Satish, you have

01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:40.220
not activated your virtual environment. If you have not

01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:43.140
activated, then obviously it will give you no module name

01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:45.960
A2A. So first of all, activate a virtual environment. I have

01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:47.900
already told you the command, go inside the virtual

01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:51.000
environment folder, go inside the script and then run the

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:56.520
activate. Tomorrow we'll teach some project or fresh one.

01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:59.440
No, we'll not teach project tomorrow. So we'll try to talk

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:03.200
about basically our infrastructure. I'll give you a complete

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:06.440
overview about the infrastructure that what kind of a

01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:10.180
services which is available inside our AWS, which will be

01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:13.420
required for any kind of a generative AI, agentic AI project

01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:16.840
basically. So complete like a overview of the cloud. Plus

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:20.500
our basic fundamentals of the cloud. For example, our

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:23.360
security groups that we try to create, our IAM user that we

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:26.660
try to create. We try to assign a different kind of a role

01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:29.600
to a particular IAM user because that is pretty much

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:32.500
important to access any kind of a services. And even that

01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:35.940
you will be doing from a day zero. So these are the

01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:40.460
fundamentals and then how I can create an instance on AWS.

01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:44.720
How I can try to access those instances, maybe from my local

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:47.420
system and how I will be able to, you know, transfer those

01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:51.420
data or maybe a code. So all of these things we'll be

01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:55.380
discussing. So basic building of like a building blocks of

01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:56.560
the cloud platform.

01:17:59.850 --> 01:18:02.770
Sir, please give us a use case idea for it is like a

01:18:02.770 --> 01:18:05.210
possible use case. Sorry, sir. Not a good question, but I

01:18:05.210 --> 01:18:08.390
have already given you a task last week and I have seen that

01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:14.390
that only one or two people have completed that. Yeah. And

01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:18.230
if you remember, so in the past I have given you 10, 20

01:18:18.230 --> 01:18:20.890
tasks. Yeah. And barely any one of you have completed that

01:18:20.890 --> 01:18:26.170
as well. So I mean like not my fault, by the way.

01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:33.500
But yes, as of now, so we are in a stage where if you are

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:36.320
able to execute a same thing that we are doing inside a

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:40.140
class, that will be more than enough, like keeping your

01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:43.940
interviews and your resume in mind. So please do that at

01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:47.940
least. Okay, fine everyone, take care. So I'll not spend

01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:51.640
much time. Let's just spend like a little bit more time in

01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:54.420
my tomorrow's class. Yeah. So take care, everyone. Thank

01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:56.080
you. Happy Saturday.
