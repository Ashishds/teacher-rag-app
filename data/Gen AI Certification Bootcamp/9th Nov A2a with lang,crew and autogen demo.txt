WEBVTT

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.770
so hi everyone uh good morning i think i'm audible and

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:50.270
visible to all of you uh so yes good morning everyone as i

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.690
see in youtube database course but your portal it's not

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:59.030
showing uh no that is basically not a new course uh that we

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.530
have released that is basically a youtube videos we have

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.490
released like six i believe we have released and more is

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.390
coming in a pipeline maybe uh we'll add it in a like a

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:14.270
dashboard but not now in dashboard so we have a separate one

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.010
okay so good morning everyone uh let's start with the

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.830
discussion so today we are going to discuss about uh a2a uh

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.190
like i said so yesterday i was facing some sort of issue but

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:29.270
yeah finally uh i have resolved those issues and my a2a is

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.050
working fine and that is like a discussion that we are going

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.890
to do it you know uh today's class basically so yesterday i

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.930
have given you a kind of overview so what a2a is so it is

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.210
another protocol so which is going to help you out in terms

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.710
of you know uh establishing a communication between a

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.910
different different kind of a agents right again so there

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.150
can be a heterogeneous agent means one framework and in one

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.450
framework itself we have a multiple agents we have built and

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.670
we have to you know like orchestrate all those things so

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.730
maybe a2a can come into a picture and then it will be able

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.930
to help you out these are the topics i have given you so

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.870
today i will be giving help me out or else so like a

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.270
homogeneous or heterogeneous or heterogeneous way means

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.990
let's suppose we have one agent in a line chain one agent in

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:19.630
a crew ai one agent is available into maybe in a autogen and

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.390
then we have to establish a communication so all these

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:26.070
frameworks are different in that case so we can try to use a

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.270
a2a protocol so which is going to establish a communication

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.970
so technically a2a is a protocol just like a api you can say

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:38.370
or api establishment for an agent in other word you can say

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:43.070
that and once communication is established so obviously one

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:46.710
agent will take a input and then one is going to give an

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:49.770
output so it is going to give an output and then same will

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:53.710
be consumed by the other one so a2a is going to standardize

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:57.270
that input output kind of a procedure as simple as that and

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.270
this is something that we were trying to understand in my

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.610
studies class uh today we'll try to understand it in a

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.990
better way basically so today we'll try to understand it in

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.710
a practical manner the code which i have like uh prepared

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:12.250
for all of you uh so that you all can see a actual

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:17.030
communication between all of these agents yeah everyone so

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.670
shall we start okay

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:46.200
so let me share my screen and then let me show you with the

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.960
ui screen so this is one of the demo i have prepared now

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:51.480
what i am going to do is i am going to describe what this

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.380
demo is going to do so this in this demo so we have three

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.940
agents so one is a langchain agent and purposely i have made

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:02.360
it heterogeneous uh homogeneous anyhow like i said even

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.740
study that even langchain will be able to handle a multiple

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.560
agent in itself even crew ai will be able to handle possible

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.480
agent in itself and autogen and same goes for everyone right

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.000
but i was just trying to like a build an example so where

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.580
one agent will be available in langchain one agent will be

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.260
available in crew ai one agent will be available in the

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.420
mainовали so all the agent when i agent will be available in

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:26.000
autogen means a complete heterogeneous platform and then how

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.400
one agent is going to pass an output to the next one and

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.600
then next one is going to work even though they are like

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.000
they belongs from a different different frameworks right and

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.160
this is where a beauty of A2A will come into a picture. So

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.980
A2A is going to behave like a API for an agent which is

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:47.600
going to help me out in terms of you know like taking an

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.380
input executing an agent and then giving an output and same

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.680
will be consumed by the next one right the next one. So

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:59.160
basically A2A standardize the input output format, A2A

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.140
standardize the transportation protocol or transportation

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:05.600
layer right that in which format data should go. So whether

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.240
data should go in a text format or maybe into a JSON format

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.180
or maybe in some other format right. So basically A2A is a

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:16.140
standardization or it is a protocol set of the rule it is

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:19.520
going to provide you for an agent. So here the demo which I

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.820
am going to show you and the code that we are going to

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:25.960
discuss so that story is something like this that there is a

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.900
data as you can see, so we have a data over here and you can

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.920
upload your own CSV file as well. So if you want you can try

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.260
to upload your own CSV file. Now there is a data and this

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:39.060
data is all about a sales data basically. So there are three

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:42.800
agents I have created right a separate independent agent. So

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.960
none of the agents are you know like we have binded it but

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.940
yes it is an independent agent we have created. So, one

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.980
agent is a langchain agent, now what langchain agent is

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.200
going to do, so it is helping me out in terms of reading a

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.940
data, right, langchain is going to help me out in terms of

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:03.040
reading a data, then what crew AI is trying to do, so crew

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.420
AI agent will try to help me out in terms of performing some

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:11.120
sort of a depth analytics on a data set and then there is a

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.340
autogen agent we have created and this is going to help me

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:19.480
out in terms of visualizing and getting some in-depth, in

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:23.800
-detail summary of the sales data, means analytics, finally

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.580
it is going to show me like some sort of a graph and it is

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:32.540
going to show me some sort of a deep analytics, so role of

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:36.020
each and every agent is been defined, now so things are

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:38.540
supposed to happen in a flow, so obviously this is supposed

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.960
to read the data, this is supposed to perform some sort of

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:44.100
a, you know, analytics over here and then this is supposed

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:47.180
to do some sort of a detail or in-depth analytics. And this

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:50.080
is how we have configured one by one, one by one, each and

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.340
everything and when agent runs, so agent runs in this

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:57.100
particular like a sequence, so langchain, so it try to do a

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.700
reading, crew AI, so basically try to do some sort of

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.340
analytics, a basic analytics and then autogen, so basically

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.720
it helps me out in terms of visualizing the final data, so I

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.860
am printing that part as well in a UI interface, so that you

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:13.780
know we all can understand and here a coordination between

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:17.340
all of these three independent agent is happening. Based on

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:21.040
what? Based on A2A protocol, right, this is where A2A is

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.460
been used and that is the reason, so we are going to use

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:28.620
A2A, now here, right, step one, step two and step three,

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.820
simple, so langchain reader, crew AI analyst and then

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:35.120
autogen visualizer, so in this manner it is going to move,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.680
now what will be the output of langchain reader, I am

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.480
printing that part as well, so I am printing all those like

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:45.780
data, so like in what format it is going to print, what?

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.280
What agent card looks like because in A2A there is a term

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.040
called as agent card, we will try to explain more and more

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.320
about it but yeah, so what is the agent card which is been

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:59.580
created for this like a langchain based agent and then for a

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.540
crew AI, same will go, right, so what we have done, what we

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.660
have created, what it is trying to take as an input, what is

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:10.020
the output it is trying to give and then what is the final

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.900
output which is going into the next one, so everything I am

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.620
printing, so all these logs from an agent also I am trying

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.200
to print. So that it is going to help you out in terms of

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.960
understanding plus in terms of doing a analysis. Now there

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:25.560
is a third agent like I said, so autogen visualizer, right,

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.260
so basically it is going to visualize my data, this is

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.840
something that it is going to do, if I am looking for a deep

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.500
visualization, it will be able to do that as well but yeah,

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.580
ultimately it is a agent, right, ultimately it is a agent

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:40.120
which is like a working for me and again, so I am trying to

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.360
print the internals of those agent, technically agent card,

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:47.820
right, technically agent card. So this is a project that we

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:51.480
are going to discuss, it is a basic one I can say, it is a

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.860
small one but it is a very very neat and clean project you

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.080
will be able to find out which I have built for all of you,

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.820
which is going to help you out in terms of understanding A2A

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:04.060
in a real manner, so that you will be able to use A2A

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.600
immediately, right, after this class, so you can just reuse

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:14.100
the A2A and you can try to, you know, create a nexus of any

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.520
number of agents. By using any other framework which is

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.540
available out there, so I have used 3 over here, Lang Gen,

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:23.740
CruAI, Autogen, if you have to, if you would like to like

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:27.820
accommodate maybe some other framework, you can do it, yes,

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:33.780
yeah, fine everyone, I believe that is something that we

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.000
have discussed theoretically in my yesterday's class, yeah.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:43.440
So shall we go ahead with the coding part now, yeah, so this

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.240
is, this is like A2A, by the way, yes. So we are combining

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:51.800
all the framework all together and in this place A2A is

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.640
helping me out, simple, right, okay. So now let us start

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.640
like looking into a coding part, so let me open up my VS

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:06.760
code and here, so file, open folder, D drive and multi

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:12.480
agent, okay. So now here, so couple of folder I have created

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.320
and again I have kept this project very very clean. So that

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:20.400
it can be modified for any like upcoming A2A projects even

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.800
for me and this is where I was facing an issue, so I was

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.400
like facing an issue with the pip and it was not able to

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:30.240
load the A2A SDK, so I have used UV over here and UV worked

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:34.100
for me. So UV is again a package manager just like a pip,

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:37.220
but yeah, so UV resolve lot of dependencies automatically

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:43.180
where a pip fails by the way. So here you will be able to

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:46.480
see a lot of folder. So, V environment, this is just a

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.280
virtual environment I am trying to create which I am going

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.920
to activate. Then there is something called as artifact,

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:54.500
artifact is nothing but the intermediate output I am getting

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.620
from this model. So I am just trying to like a store that

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:01.360
one, the final output, right, from autogen, configuration.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:05.120
So again, it is nothing much, so here we are trying to keep

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.380
just a OpenAI API key, but I am consuming it from

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:11.480
.environment file. So I am just trying to keep my OpenAI key

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.780
over here. You can try to use any model, any LLM. Of your

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:18.060
choice, again, you can try to use this models even from a

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:22.720
URI. There is no like a if and but about that, because I am

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.520
using ultimately LanChain, Lama indexes, sorry, LanChain,

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:29.560
autogen and crew, right. So URI is compatible with those

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:33.620
things as well. Now main things comes inside a source

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.340
directory. So inside the source directory, so I have created

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:40.160
two directory. So one is an agent and independent agent I

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.000
have created over here. So LanChain agent, crew AI agent,

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.360
autogen agent, right. Okay. The agent which I was actually

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:51.540
talking about. So LanChain, crew AI and autogen agent I am

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.720
trying to create. So these agents we already like we have

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:58.220
already created a lot of agents, right, even in a past in

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.720
LanChain, in crew AI, in autogen. So it is going to be a

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.380
revision for all of us, right. So we all know that how

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.940
LanChain actually works. We all know how crew AI actually

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:10.480
works and we all know how autogen already works in our

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.200
previous classes. And we have seen a practical example of

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.480
LanChain crew AI as well. As autogen. So these three

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:20.060
independent agents I have created, work wise I have defined

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.940
each and everything. And then there is something called as

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:27.940
A2A, right, A2A utility. So here I am trying to create all

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:31.540
the cards basically. So for any agent, let's suppose if I

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:35.160
have to like establish a communication between these three

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:38.640
agents. So I have to create an agent card and then I have to

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:41.480
define their skills. I have to give a description of a

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.980
particular agent. I have to define that. What will be the

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:48.240
input which will go in one of the agent and then what will

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:51.700
be the output. So technically all of these things we define

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:56.600
inside a agent card. And like I said, A2A is basically an

00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:01.460
API, right, API for an agent. So obviously we have seen that

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:05.180
that API works on a particular URL. It is going to follow

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:07.840
the same philosophy. It is not going to follow some

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.700
different philosophy. So here as you can see, so we are

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:13.720
trying to give an end point and the point means a URL,

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:17.160
right, obviously. So if something is running in my local, so

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.260
I will try to give this, I mean like some communication is

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.880
happening in the same server. So in that case I can try to

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:26.660
give a local. If some agent is running on some different

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.920
server, in some different machine, so I will try to give

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:33.300
like a location of that particular machine. So I can run on

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:37.400
any machine, on any port. My multiple agents can run on any

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.580
different, different kind of machines. I just need an end

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:43.060
point. So I will be talking about that as well. But yes. You

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:46.420
will be able to relate it with respect to an API. At the end

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.800
of the day, it is actually an API. It is just a protocol and

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:54.020
it is basically API or you can say API kind of a request we

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:57.520
are trying to make for an agent. That is it. So API for

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.280
agent you can say. So that is the reason we have an end

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:03.200
point over here and everything is running in my same system,

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.160
in my local. So I am just like given this part, otherwise I

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.940
will not. But yeah, we will come to that side. So here I am

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:13.600
using A2A utility. And this is the standard approach of

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.320
creating an agent card by using A2A library. So I will be

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.420
talking about that because you have to define an agent

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:22.360
capability. You have to create an agent card. You have to

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.560
define an agent skills. You have to define a data part. You

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.320
have to define what messages you would like to send. You

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.300
have to define what role it is going to play. You have to

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:34.780
define like whether you are going to get a text part or text

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:38.360
data or you are going to get maybe a JSON RPC data. You have

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.320
to define a transport protocol. So. So all of these things

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:45.800
is mandatory, for example, like not mandatory, I would say.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.960
But yes, all those things are important and it depends what

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:52.300
kind of application we are trying to build similar to API.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.480
Right. So we try to define what kind of, you know, method we

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.160
have to call, whether it should go with the get or maybe a

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.460
post or maybe a put, maybe a delete. And then we try to

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:05.040
define a route and then add a particular route. What is

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.940
going to be available? All of these things we used to define

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:11.060
even in case of APIs. Similarly. So with respect to an

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:13.600
agent, we have to define all of these things and it is

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.440
coming from A2A SDK itself. Right. So by default, whenever

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:21.760
you are going to install A2A. So from A2A SDK, this part is

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:27.000
going to come. So once I am going to define the things that

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.140
how my agent will look like or I am going to define a

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.680
protocol, then I am using something called as orchestrator

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:39.680
.py file. So where? I am trying to use all of three agents.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:44.840
And this A2A and I am trying to bind it together by using a

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.540
same agent card. I am just trying to say that, okay, fine.

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.820
So what you have to do, so which one you have to call first

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.400
and then second, what will be the skill, what will be the

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.340
name, what will be the description, everything so that my

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:59.380
LLM can call it, my LLM can understand it. So I am just

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:02.600
binding it. Right. You can say that it's more or less like

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:06.440
listing all the agents one by one, one by one, one by one.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.040
So I have three agents. One is a reader. One is an analyst

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.680
and one is a visualizer based on my data set. So it is going

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:16.180
to do the job. And finally I will be able to call it inside.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:20.280
I have just used a UI interface so that, you know, you can

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.160
visualize, you can see it because generally it's very

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:27.780
difficult to visualize the final outcome and a flow and

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:31.780
again the intermediate output of agents as well. So that is

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:35.920
something that we will be talking about. Is it okay? Are we

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:39.780
able to understand? Yeah. So overall what is happening?

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:49.300
Yes. Anuj is saying A2A model is, A2A is not a model. It's a

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:52.000
protocol. There is a difference between models and

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.220
protocols. So multi model is not equal to A2A by the way.

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:59.460
It's a protocol. Protocol means someone has defined a set of

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:03.260
rule. For example, if someone has to come in, like if me and

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:06.400
you would like to communicate, right? So we are going to

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.560
choose a common language, right? Then we are going to choose

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:12.960
a common topic. Otherwise, how me and you? You will be able

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.220
to communicate as even as a human being, right? So let's

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.900
suppose you are trying to speak in French and I'm trying to

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:21.840
like, you know, speak in English. I don't understand French.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:26.060
You don't understand English. Will I be able to communicate?

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:30.060
No, right? So to establish a communication between me and

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:33.160
you, we are going to set a rule that we both are going to

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:37.100
use one language, English maybe, right? Then second rule,

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:40.380
rule number two. So basically like we are going to talk

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:44.720
about only like data science. Okay. For example, so if you

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.720
will start talking about a French revolution and I'll start

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:51.760
talking about India independence, again, maybe you, I don't

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.660
have an idea about a French revolution and you might not

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:58.740
have an idea about like India's independence story and all.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:04.240
So again, we will not be able to talk, right? So this is

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.900
where this set of rule comes into a picture and this is

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:12.680
where this A2 comes into a picture. Yes. Flora. The flow is

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.580
same like a MCP. I mean like every library is having its own

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:18.720
flow, its own process. More or less you can say because MCP

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.660
is also what? A protocol. Right? MCP is also a protocol. It

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:25.680
just provide you a set of rules for a communication, right?

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:28.360
And A2 is also a protocol. Simple.

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:34.530
Sorry, I missed what we are doing in an orchestrator.py.

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:37.710
Orchestrating it. Orchestrating means what? Like simple

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:40.610
English meaning of orchestration is bringing everything

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:45.750
together in under one umbrella. Right? So we have A2A. We

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:49.650
have basically agents. So we are trying to, you know, plug

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:56.130
these agents with A2A protocol. That is like that we are

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:58.510
trying to do over here that we'll try to achieve over here.

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:03.570
Okay. Now move ahead. So here one by one, one by one, let's

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:06.730
try to understand all of these things. So first of all,

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:12.170
let's talk about A2A. A2A. So basically A2A, I think

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:13.870
theoretically we all are able to understand. We are able to

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:14.250
understand A2A. We are able to understand that what

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:18.350
technically A2A will do. So it will define a set of rule. So

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:21.390
that system will be able to do a communication. That is

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:24.210
something that A2A will do. Nothing more than that. A2A is

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:29.310
like going to provide me technically like what will be the

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:31.190
input, what will be the output, what will be the

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:34.690
transportation layer, all of these things. So here what we

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:38.090
are doing, so we are trying to like use A2A library and its

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:41.710
supporting library, whatever is required. Then we are trying

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:44.910
to create a function. As you can see, create an agent card.

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:48.590
Now what this agent card will do by the way, yeah. So what

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:52.670
this agent card will try to do. So here basically it is a

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:56.950
kind of you can say a business card. For example, if I am

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:58.910
representing my organization, I will be having a business

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:03.290
card, right. And over there, my designation, maybe like my

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:06.050
email ID, my phone number or some information will be

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:08.470
mentioned. Generally, this is what happens with respect to a

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:12.750
business card. So similarly inside A2A. So they have. They

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:16.350
have defined a agent card kind of a concept. Now what it

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:21.270
does, right, what it does. So basically it is going to take

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:24.950
a name. So what is your name? It is going to take a

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:27.310
description. So what will be your description? What will be

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:29.910
your skill ID? What will be your skill name? What is your

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:34.510
skill description, version and then end point means if you

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:37.910
are an agent, you must be running somewhere. For example, in

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:41.150
case of API, right, if there is an API, it must be running

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:44.250
at some URL, right. And whenever I'm going to invoke that

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:47.690
URL, it will execute some sort of a function. That is true

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:51.590
with respect to an API. Since day zero, we are like learning

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:54.830
about it and we are building it similar manner. So here are

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:59.050
URL that, okay. So if there is a agent card means if there

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:01.990
is an agent, they must be having some address. At some place

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:04.910
I can go and I can find it. I can execute it similar, a

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:08.490
similar thing. So this will be the input you can say, and

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:11.350
finally it is going to return me output as an agent card. So

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:13.910
this is a function definition, right? This is a function

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:16.110
definition. So it is trying to take these parameters, these

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:20.570
argument as an input. Okay. So it is going to take these

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:23.910
argument as an input now as a body of this function, as you

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:27.710
can see. So this is why just like a signature of the

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:31.190
function that if I'm calling this agent card, these many

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:34.650
things I will have to provide anyhow, right? Anyhow I'll

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:39.010
have to provide. So then this is the body of the, uh, entire

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:42.290
function. So URL is required. Okay. Endpoint is required. So

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:45.410
endpoint wise, I'm just trying to give over here a local,

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:49.690
right? So basically like a, it will try to create a local

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:52.610
endpoint as everything is running in one single system in

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:56.610
one single server. If I have to run it, maybe on a separate

00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:01.170
separate server. So just like a API will try to give a URL

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:03.670
over here that, okay, you are running at this place.

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:08.170
Otherwise it will try to look for local colon slash slash if

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:12.670
it is running on HTTPS or HTTP. So HTTP colon slash slash

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:18.230
URL, right? URL. Otherwise I have given this one. So it's

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:21.430
not different from an API that we have created. Right guys,

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:23.470
everyone, yeah,

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:28.730
it's not different from the API because it's, this is also

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:31.750
protocol, right? It's an API for like, uh, agents by the

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:38.030
way. That's it. Yeah. Now. So here, uh, right. So here it is

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:41.310
going to return the agent card. So agent card. I'm trying to

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:43.850
call it from here. Right. It is going to return the agent

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:48.530
card where I'm going to provide a name. So like, uh, yes,

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:51.450
whatever name will come. So name will come over here,

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:55.810
description, version, URL, endpoint, and then preferred

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:59.130
transport. So basically we are supposed to do a transport,

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:02.890
uh, like a transportation of this data or communication in

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:05.830
which particular format. So I'm saying that, okay, fine. So

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:09.350
JSON RPC format. So we'll try to do a transportation default

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:13.330
input mode. So in which mode? Uh, my agents are our agent

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:15.610
card. The business card that I have is going to take the

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:17.650
input. So I'm saying, okay, fine. So in a plain text, it is

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:20.390
going to take the input. What is the output it is going to

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:23.350
like, uh, give me, so it can give me an output into a plain

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:26.570
text or maybe into a JSON. I'm keeping both the option up

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:30.030
for this one, right? What will be the agent capability? So

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:32.490
here agent capabilities comes into a picture, which is

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:35.110
already defined. So streaming falls. If I want to streaming,

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:38.070
I can do it. Push notification falls. So these two things is

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:41.250
going to be false. I'm not going to use it. What will be the

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:44.810
skill of the agent? So again, to define a skill set of the

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:48.150
agent, this is the template. This is a procedure which has

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:51.150
been defined. So ID is a skill ID. So automatically it will

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:54.310
try to like a map whenever this function will be called. And

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:57.090
then name is a skill name. Description is a skill

00:28:57.090 --> 00:29:00.190
description and tag is sales, marketing and analytics,

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:04.050
right? And then finally support authenticated extended card

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:07.310
falls. I like, I'm not doing any kind of authentication. Now

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:12.170
this is just a template as you can see. Right? So whoever is

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:16.090
going to call my function call as create agent card, they

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:21.270
are supposed to provide these inputs, right? So I've just

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:24.270
created a function and like I returned it, right? So they

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:27.370
are supposed to provide these inputs. Once they are going to

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:31.270
provide this inputs, right? I will try to give you this as a

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:35.230
return agent card as a return and agent card is something

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:37.610
which a two way protocol has been designed for the

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:40.970
understands, right? Now. So the agent card, I have defined

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:43.990
everything named description, version, URL, end point and

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:46.810
like what will be the input mode? What will be the output

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:49.070
mode? What will be the capability? What will be the skill

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:54.510
set? Everything I'm going to define. Making sense guys? Yes.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:01.900
Yeah. So we are, we are trying to define basically this one

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:02.880
now.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.620
So that is saying that is it a bidirectional communication,

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.020
it is a bidirectional communication. In this case, API only

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:22.920
client request and server response. In case of A2A can both

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:26.360
are the both can request and communicate it. Yes. So

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.400
basically when you are doing the agent to agent

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.260
communication, technically we are doing agent to agent

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:33.640
communication. So I can say that yes, it is going to be a

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:38.100
bidirectional. So it is not like a conventional API end

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:41.500
point. So that is one of the advantage that you all will be

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:45.980
able to get over here, right? So at a time one agent is

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:48.480
going to behave as a client, one will be behaving as a

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.860
server. But you can say that yes. It is going to be the

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:56.100
bidirectional, right? So agent A, for example, if I have an

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:59.200
agent into a lang chain, so lang chain can give an output as

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.900
well as it can take a input both, right? So technically it's

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:07.020
a bidirectional we have. So this is the card that I have

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:10.780
created simple, right? And by default, so this is something

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:13.420
that it is going to take. So I'm going to use this card by

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:16.720
the way. I'm going to use this particular card whenever I

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:21.000
have to create a or connect basically with the help of A2K.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.460
Now where I'm going to use it, right in my orchestration. So

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:28.480
in my orchestration stage, I'm going to use. So where I

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:31.120
have, I have to orchestrate with respect to lang chain crew

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:36.400
and autogen, right? All this three, okay, fine. So if I have

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.460
to do that, let's go ahead with the orchestration because

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:41.460
this is the card that I've created. I will be using same

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:45.020
card. So if you will go into orchestrator.py file, you will

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:50.180
be able to find out that we are trying to import autogen,

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:53.220
crewai and autogen. I'll go back to that, that part, the

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:56.660
core implementation of the agent three independent agent,

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.460
which I have done. But first of all, let's try to understand

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:03.620
the orchestration and here from A2A create agent card,

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:06.600
create a text message, extract text from messages and get

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.680
data part. So these three functions I have not discussed

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:11.760
yet. I have discussed only agent card. Let's try to focus on

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:16.780
agent card because that is going to make your agent attached

00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:20.060
with the A2A, right? So first let's talk about agent card in

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:24.680
orchestration.py. So here, uh, what, what we are trying to

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:28.860
like, uh, uh, do so orchestration sales insight and uh, we

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:33.060
are trying to give like a CSV path output directory model

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:35.720
override progress callback, all those things. That's

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:40.740
completely fine. We are reading it, but let's focus here on

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:43.420
agent card. So we have three agents, right? We have three

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:48.340
agents. What I will do, I will try to call create agent

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:51.580
card, a same function, which I have discussed here, create

00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:55.100
agent card, right? The same function I'm going to call and

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:57.260
these are the input I have proposed to provide to this

00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:01.020
function. Okay, fine. So here as you can see, I'm providing

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:04.200
a name. So name is basically langchain reader. What is

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:07.780
description? So extract a structure inside from a sales CSV

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:11.860
file. So simple description, what will be the skill ID? So

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:15.380
sales CSV inside that is a skill ID I have given. What will

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:18.460
the skill name? So sales document ingestion is going to be

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:21.180
the skill name and a skill description. So read a sales and

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:25.500
marketing record and summarize key signals. And I'm trying

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:28.940
to return that as a reader, reader agent card. So this card

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:32.360
name is basically reader. Similarly, I'm trying to use

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:35.420
another agent card. I'm trying to define all this required

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:39.780
inputs and I'm making it as a analyst. And then third one,

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.640
so again, I'm trying to create this agent card and trying to

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:45.780
name it as a visualizer. So this is where I have used a

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:49.420
agent card. So this is going to return me three agent card.

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:52.760
One is a reader, one is an analyst and one is a visualizer

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:58.320
simple. So now my agent will be live over here, right? My

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.120
agent, just agent will be live means now agent will be

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:04.020
available. It's not like agent is going to, you know, uh,

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:08.480
execute itself. Yes. First agent is going to be live. Then

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.560
once agent is going to be live, I have to define a first

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:14.480
input, a first set of instructions. So that can be a

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:17.980
instruction from outside or maybe I have already configured

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:21.860
it. So technically I have already configured it, right? I'll

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:24.460
be talking about that one. So let's talk about our next

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:28.240
function called as create text message, this function. So

00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:31.820
this function is available inside a, again, A2A utility file

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:36.340
after this agent card. Now here, so create a text function.

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:38.880
So what it will do? So basically, as I have mentioned to

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:43.920
create a A2A text messages, basically. So you are going to

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:48.420
pass a message, right? For example, the way we try. To give

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:52.040
an input to a chat GPT, we are giving an input to a chat GPT

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.580
that do this for me similarly. So if we have to initiate the

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:58.080
entire processes, so what I'm trying to do, so I'm trying to

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:02.760
send a message that, okay, fine, start doing it now. So if

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.240
you'll see the call of this function, a very basic function,

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:07.700
right? If you'll see the call of this function. So what I'm

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:11.020
saying, I'm saying that analyze the provided sales and

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:15.400
marketing data set and prepare executive ready insights that

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.860
that's my first input, right? That's a very first input.

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:21.500
Which will go. And then I'm trying to provide a file path

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:25.260
that this is a place where my file is available. If I would

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:27.940
like to give an access of my database, I can do that. Some

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:30.760
mail ID. I can do that, right? Everything, every kind of

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:34.640
access I can try to give to this particular, uh, agents. So

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:38.180
this is going to my entry point. So this is going to return

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:41.980
me the messages, right? And return me the messages with the

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:46.780
help of this create text message. Okay. Now, once this will

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:51.880
be done. Let's go back again to a A2A utility file. There is

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:56.020
something called as create agent message, right? So create a

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:58.520
text message. So obviously it is going to create a text

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:02.220
message. Now create a agent message. So here what we are

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:05.540
trying to do. So here create and combine agent response with

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:09.980
the optional structure. So obviously you are trying to like,

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.840
you know, uh, send a data. You are trying to give an input

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:16.900
to a particular agent. Now agent will try to give you an

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:20.280
output. Right? Agent will try to give you an output. So you

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:23.580
have to define that in which format agent is supposed to

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:26.700
give me the output because it's a rule, right? It's a rule.

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:29.560
You can't come and say that, that you will speak in French

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.640
and I'll speak in English. We will not be able to

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:35.860
understand. So here you have to define that, okay, in this

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:40.720
format only you are supposed to give me a result. Now here,

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:44.740
as you can see, so we are trying to say that, that if text,

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:49.680
right, then you are supposed to give me into a text format,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.500
right? If data is not none, then append data part and then

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:58.320
like finally try to give me the output. So here, if there is

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.180
a plain text, so in a plain text format, you are supposed to

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:05.360
give me the final output. So maybe, uh, if I'm going to show

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:08.140
you the call of this function, so it will help you out to

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:10.260
understand in a better way, or

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:18.820
maybe I can try to show you in this particular manner. Okay.

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:24.440
So here, let's suppose if we are trying to call this create

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:28.560
agent message, right? Create agent message. So text wise,

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:31.080
this is something that I'm going to provide and data wise,

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:32.560
this is something that I'm going to provide means

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:36.860
instruction and a data. This is what we are trying to define

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:40.240
over here that I'll try to provide you a text, which is

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.660
nothing but an instruction along with that, I'll try to

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:45.340
provide you a data. My data is coming from where my CSV

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:47.940
read, right? So I'm reading a data. I'm trying to convert

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:49.880
that into a keyword. Key value, key value, key value, kind

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:52.200
of a pair. And then I'm trying to pass it along with that.

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:54.800
I'm trying to give an instruction that, okay, take this one.

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:59.760
So this is how it's, this function is going to work, uh,

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:02.640
agent message. So this is something which will go as an

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:07.580
input inside the agent now. So once that will be, uh, that

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:09.980
will go, then we, uh, we have another function called

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:14.580
extract text from the messages. So here it is going to

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:18.120
perform what, so it is going to perform all the text, which

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:21.120
system, which system is going to return means if it is going

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:24.200
to give me an output, it is going to capture all of these

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:28.340
things in one simple text part. So nothing, nothing much,

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:30.880
just like we have prepared this created text messages

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:34.840
similarly. So we are trying to do the extraction and then we

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:38.860
are trying to call something called as get data apart. So it

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:41.660
is going to give me like, you know, a structured JSON file.

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:46.580
So return the first data part if present. So these are just

00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:49.860
a supporting four functions. Which has been created, which

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:54.060
I'm going to use it here while doing a orchestration. So

00:38:54.060 --> 00:39:00.540
first part card is created. Um, where is my card? Yeah. So

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:03.940
the first part card is created. So now my agent will be

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:07.460
live. It will come to an existence and once my agent will

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:10.820
come to an existence, then I'm going to call a create text

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:14.800
messages. So basically I'm trying to provide instruction and

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:18.640
then I'm trying to provide the file over here. So once it is

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:22.120
done, right? Once it is done, so it is trying to basically

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:27.620
run Langchain reader. So what is this Langchain reader? Now

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:31.040
my model will come into a picture. So sorry, my agent will

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:35.240
come into picture. So run Langchain reader, run crew AI and

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:40.460
then run autogen visualizer. So here I'm calling all three,

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:45.220
but if you will see this like a call, so we are trying to

00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:49.560
basically bind it. With respect to a A to A. So if I'm going

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:54.120
to call this run Langchain reader, so here is my run

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:56.720
Langchain reader, which is available where in my Langchain

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:59.880
agent dot PI file. And here I have defined that how you are

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:03.940
supposed to run. Now if I'll go and if I'll try to check a

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:06.660
run crew analysis, so again, this is available in my crew

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:09.100
file, right? That, okay, what this agent is going to do,

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.480
what will be the role, what will be the goal, what will be

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:14.200
the backstory, what will be the LMS, everything just like a

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:16.680
normal agent. So it's a normal agent that we have created.

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:19.820
And, uh, what will be the input, what will be the output

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:22.840
each and everything is defined inside a respective agent

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:25.800
itself, which is a very, very small file. And it's nothing

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.260
new for any one of us because we have already created so

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:31.020
many agents into a different, different framework. So just a

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:35.440
agent creation file that we have. So here what we are trying

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:38.720
to do, for example, if we are trying to call a run Langchain

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:42.600
reader, so it requires a path, it requires basically file

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:45.520
path, it is required, uh, LLM models access. So we are

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:48.660
trying to provide all of these things. It is going to run

00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:52.860
and then it is going to give me some sort of a output. So

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:56.420
from Langchain reader message result, it is going to give it

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:59.560
to me. So result message, it is going to give it to me. Then

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:02.280
what I'm trying to do, so then I'm trying to call a run crew

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:06.000
analysis and then again, so it will try to take a sales

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.620
record, it will try to take a sales summary, it will try to

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:12.580
take a model summary, it is trying to take a LMS and then

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:16.340
again, so it is going to give me the final analytics result.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.500
Similarly, so we are trying to call a visual agent over here

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:25.100
and then it is trying to basically take a records and call

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:28.340
each and everything and then trying to give me the output.

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:32.820
Now once it will be able to give me an output, what we are

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:36.640
trying to do, so we are trying to return it in a card format

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:39.940
that, okay, so we have an agent card which is, which we have

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:43.740
already created. So here we are trying to just return. To a

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:48.100
card format that okay fine, we have a agent card transcript

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:52.760
and then summary result matrixes and record, return me this

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:55.900
particular card, for analyst return me this particular card

00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:59.240
or like a data in this particular format, for visualizer

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:02.180
return me in this particular card and then a conversation

00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:06.420
log in between all of these things. So basically here we are

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:08.920
just trying to do the orchestration. We are trying to call

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:12.900
all of these agents one by one, one by one, one by one and

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:17.980
then we are just trying to arrange it inside a card so that

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:21.640
one of my agents are available in one of the places. So I am

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:24.100
just trying to like bind it with respect to a card, nothing

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:29.700
much and then you will be able to see finally this

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:34.160
particular output that we have already discussed.

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:43.940
So let me open up my output page. Yeah. So then we will be

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:48.280
able to get something like this. But here, so let us try to

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:52.700
look into the final return of the card. So this is something

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:56.100
which is going to help me out in terms of establishing a

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:58.520
protocol. So this is something which is helping me out in

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:03.500
terms of you know calling a particular langchain agents or

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:06.620
may be a crew agent, may be a autogen agent. This is

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:08.940
something where I am trying to define that what it is

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:11.160
supposed to do, what it is not supposed to do. So for

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:13.440
example, for this card, I am saying that extract the

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:16.680
structure inside from the sales csv file and technically try

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:19.840
to use my langchain and technically try to like use this

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:24.060
transport mechanism, JSON RPC, it will be using it and then

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:28.960
finally I will be able to get the result. Simple. Now,

00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:33.020
similarly, so my crew AI, so it is going to use a card, it

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:35.660
will, this card is going to help me out in terms of finding

00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:39.220
out the particular like agents at which place my particular

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:42.840
agent is running. May be in the same system as per me, it is

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:46.660
running in a local system or may be on some URL. Now here,

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:52.380
so again we have like same thing, description and then like

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:57.100
ID, name, all those things and URL, so it is running at this

00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:01.120
URL, local slash slash crew AI analyst. This is my URL where

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:04.180
my agents are running. So yes, it looks like it is a

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:07.460
protocol, right, because this is what we get even in case of

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:11.500
API, right. So API will be running at some URL, this is

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:14.900
running also at some URL. Similarly if you will go to

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:17.240
autogen visualizer, you will be able to find out the exact

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:20.600
same thing. So autogen is running at particular URL, right,

00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:23.260
that card is running at particular URL, we are just trying

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:26.600
to access it, we are just trying to bind it because if you

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:29.080
will look into my code base, you will be able to see that

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:32.320
all three agents are independent, right, all three agents

00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:36.080
are independent and we are just trying to like bind it with

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:40.120
the help of this particular return. Is it making sense guys,

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:43.100
a little bit, I mean like I know it is bit confusing but

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:43.380
still,

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:55.920
yeah. Okay, so this is, I believe this part is not tough,

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:59.620
right, creation of A2A is not tough, I believe, this was

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:02.300
very very simple, right, this is just one single function,

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:06.480
so create a agent card and that is it, right, it is not at

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:10.120
all going to be tough over here, right, right everyone,

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:17.480
got a high level understanding. You will get low level

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:19.800
understanding once you will execute that. So I will share

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:22.520
the code, don't worry about that, yeah, don't worry about

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:24.140
that particular part and

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:36.060
this is a place I was facing a lot of issues like, you know,

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:41.060
like almost it took one whole night for me to fix the issues

00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:47.700
and make it up and running in an A2A manner, so yeah, even

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:51.340
it took time for me to, you know, digest and then build this

00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:55.380
entire example, okay. Okay, interactive

00:45:58.390 --> 00:46:02.770
chart part please explain, okay, so basically I will come to

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:05.390
the agent part now, okay, let us look into agent part now,

00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:09.330
one by one. So see, what langchain will do, so as we have

00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:15.410
already defined here, orchestrator part, that this langchain

00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:18.910
is going to extract a structure inside from sales and csv

00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:20.970
file, this is what it is going to do, this is going to be

00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:24.250
the skill set, right, so read the data, simple, read the

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:29.130
data, then summarize it. Then what crew will do for me, so

00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:32.830
crew will basically produce a narrative and quantitative

00:46:32.830 --> 00:46:35.890
insights, simple, transform a raw matrix into a strategic

00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:39.410
sales guidance, this is what my crew will do. Autogen, so I

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:41.690
have already given an instruction that autogen will behave

00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:43.970
as a visualizer, so it will help me out in terms of

00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:47.810
visualizing the data, now it is a part of independent

00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:50.670
agents, because all of these three agents are running,

00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:55.310
right, all of these three agents are running at some URL. So

00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:56.210
for autogen, it is a part of independent agents, because all

00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:58.030
of these three agents are running at a local host or local

00:46:58.030 --> 00:47:01.330
slash slash autogen visualizer, right, similarly for my

00:47:01.330 --> 00:47:05.670
lang, for my lang, so basically local langchain reader,

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:10.370
fine, so everyone is running at an independent URL and as a

00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:13.630
A to A, I am just doing a coordination in between, so okay,

00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:16.050
so there is a lang which is running, there is a autogen,

00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:19.530
there is a crew which is running, so lang will try to do the

00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:22.110
reading and then it will try to give me some output, I am

00:47:22.110 --> 00:47:24.650
going to show you that output and then I will go to a crew.

00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:28.930
Okay. A crew will help me out in terms of doing some sort of

00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:32.610
a quantitative kind of analytics as per the mentioned like

00:47:32.610 --> 00:47:35.430
description and then autogen is going to do the

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:39.630
visualization, as simple as that, so and my A to A knows

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:42.970
that okay, one is running at this place, one is running at

00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:45.150
this place, one is running at this place, because it is an A

00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:47.810
to A card, this is a card, right, this is a card which is

00:47:47.810 --> 00:47:50.390
running at this particular URL, so we have three independent

00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:54.830
agents which is running at one and another places, okay, now

00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:58.770
here, if you will look into the code part, so let's talk

00:47:58.770 --> 00:48:02.370
about a lang chain, so responsibility of lang chain, the way

00:48:02.370 --> 00:48:07.310
I want to behave my lang chain is to read a data, right,

00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:12.290
read a data, so here I have given a prompt and again we all

00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:14.870
know that that agent always works on a prompt, what is the

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:17.110
prompt which I have given, I have given that you are a

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:20.850
revenue operation insights agent, review the provided sales

00:48:20.850 --> 00:48:25.510
and marketing record and craft a concise overview. Highlight

00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:29.210
demand trend, channel efficiency and any anomalies worth

00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:33.270
deeper analytics, so data set preview, just try to give me a

00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:36.690
data set preview and provide three bullet insights on a

00:48:36.690 --> 00:48:40.290
revenue and pipeline momentum, two risk or anomalies worth

00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:44.130
escalation, a JSON block name matrix summarizing total,

00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:48.690
totals for sales, marketing spend lead to a customer rate

00:48:48.690 --> 00:48:53.270
and a reasons ranked, so this is a template which I have

00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:56.370
built, so this is going to give me a template, build a

00:48:56.370 --> 00:48:58.950
template only, right, this is a protected method, so this is

00:48:58.950 --> 00:49:03.090
going to give me the template, then we are trying to like

00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:06.110
write a function, so which is going to help me out in terms

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:09.910
of doing a matrix computation with respect to my data, so I

00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:12.290
am reading a data, so what was the total sales, total spend,

00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:15.510
total lead customer, lead to the customer rate, average

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:18.570
order, spend efficiency, so this depends upon my data

00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:21.690
obviously, what kind of output or what kind of a task I want

00:49:21.690 --> 00:49:25.370
my agent to do and I am saying that. Okay, return all of

00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:28.810
these data in this format, simple, right, in this JSON

00:49:28.810 --> 00:49:32.470
format and you will be able to see that yes, it is returning

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:37.610
me a data in this respective format, so this is a data, the

00:49:37.610 --> 00:49:41.210
above one, matrix snapshot, so it is trying to return that,

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:42.910
okay, this is the number of sales, this is the marketing

00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:45.170
spend, this is the qualified lead, this is the new customer,

00:49:45.350 --> 00:49:49.490
efficacy, efficiency and then reason ranked, product ranked,

00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:52.570
everything, so as per like my instructions, it is returning

00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:54.470
me everything, right, it is returning me all, right, all the

00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:58.490
matrixes which I am looking for technically, okay, reason

00:49:58.490 --> 00:50:00.590
ranked, product ranked, channel ranked, each and everything,

00:50:00.830 --> 00:50:04.990
so this is my custom function just to get the matrixes, what

00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:08.650
I want from the data and what, what langchain is supposed to

00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:12.530
do, then format preview, so in what format I would like to

00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:15.570
like a preview, so as you can see, so data frame dot head

00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:19.890
and I am previewing a head and then preview df to csv, so in

00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:23.530
this format I am trying to like show the data. Okay. Okay.

00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:26.690
So, I am going to read record, so whenever I will try to

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:30.550
read the records, I have to show the data, so here, this,

00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:33.270
this is, this is the data preview, right, this is the data

00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:35.890
preview, so for that there is a function which has been

00:50:35.890 --> 00:50:40.130
mentioned, which has been written, then run langchain

00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:42.690
reader, so this langchain reader is one of the function

00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:46.010
which has been created, a custom function which is going to

00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:49.870
take a path, so where my data is, so I have given two option

00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:53.910
by the way, so one, data is available here. Okay. In my data

00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:57.770
directory, read that data or I have given you upload option

00:50:57.770 --> 00:51:01.570
as well, so you can go with both the option, LL model, so

00:51:01.570 --> 00:51:04.350
GPT 4 ohm mini, it is going to take, temperature I am

00:51:04.350 --> 00:51:07.010
keeping at zero, so that it should not hallucinate, you can,

00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:11.050
you can try with like some numbers between zero to one. Now

00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:14.350
once this function will be called, right, what it will do,

00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:18.810
it will read a data first, yeah, read a data first, then

00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:22.270
what it will do, it will compute the matrices, then what it

00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:27.010
will do, it will try to format the preview, yeah, so this is

00:51:27.010 --> 00:51:30.890
something it is going to perform one by one, one by one, one

00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:37.330
by one, as simple as that. Now so if I am like, so yeah,

00:51:37.450 --> 00:51:40.330
same, same thing we are trying to do and then we are trying

00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:42.930
to call what, so chat open AI, I am just trying to like

00:51:42.930 --> 00:51:46.850
invoke my agents by the way, so obviously to invoke my

00:51:46.850 --> 00:51:50.450
agents, I need a LLM, I need a prompt, I need a like a kind

00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:52.770
of a response, it will be looking for. For everything,

00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:55.650
right, so this is the preparation which I am trying to do,

00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:59.670
so here I am trying to create the agents by the way, so the

00:51:59.670 --> 00:52:02.850
previous one was just a static code which is helping me out

00:52:02.850 --> 00:52:05.610
in terms of reading the data or like looking into a

00:52:05.610 --> 00:52:08.910
particular path. Now here, so I am trying to say that okay

00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:13.270
fine, so create an agent message and agent message is going

00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:16.070
to be this entire message along with the data I am trying to

00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:20.830
give the entire like a message over here. So here message

00:52:20.830 --> 00:52:23.990
summary text data. Data, frame, record, matrixes and

00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:27.890
preview. Everything will go all together inside this

00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:32.050
particular agent and it will follow this instruction, the

00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:35.330
prompt that I have given over here, right, the prompt which

00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:38.550
I have given, so it will try to basically take that prompt

00:52:38.550 --> 00:52:41.670
and it is going to behave accordingly with respect to that

00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:46.690
particular prompt when LLM.invoke will be called because we

00:52:46.690 --> 00:52:49.850
all know agent means prompt, right. So obviously as per the

00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:52.110
prompt, it is going to do all calls. So it is going to do

00:52:52.110 --> 00:52:56.590
all kind of a job and whatever like supporting things is

00:52:56.590 --> 00:52:58.790
required, I have already given. For example, LLM is

00:52:58.790 --> 00:53:01.510
required, I have already given LLM to it, temperature is

00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:04.370
required, I have already given temperature to it and prompt

00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:07.510
is required, I have already given prompt to it and now it

00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:10.950
knows that okay, so from where I have to take the data. So

00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:13.910
it will start behaving on that. So this is one of the agent,

00:53:14.050 --> 00:53:16.830
right, one of the agent task and everything in a neat and

00:53:16.830 --> 00:53:20.470
clean way we have defined and we are invoking it, first one.

00:53:22.110 --> 00:53:25.510
The second agent, crew AI agent, right, so again we are

00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:28.650
trying to create, we have already created a crew, it follows

00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:32.670
a specific way to create any kind of a crew agent. So in

00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:36.970
case of a crew agent, it needs LLM, so we are defining LLMs,

00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:39.510
right. So run crew analysis, we are trying to define the

00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:44.210
LLMs. Then in case of a crew AI, this is the template for

00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:46.610
agent creation, right, this is the template for the agent

00:53:46.610 --> 00:53:49.390
creation, so where we call agent library and then we define

00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:53.870
a role, that revenue intelligence analyst, goal, we try to

00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:56.930
define a back story, we try to give an access of LLMs,

00:53:57.070 --> 00:53:59.670
right, a lot delegation false, is equal to false, I do not

00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:02.830
want any kind of output. So this agent instance will be

00:54:02.830 --> 00:54:06.090
created, right, this analyst agent will be created, as

00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:10.550
simple as that. Now once this agent will be like created,

00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:14.630
right, once this agent, in case of auto gen, by the way,

00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:18.630
then what we are going to do, so basically we are going to

00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:21.890
like say that that this is your task. This is my expected

00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:26.350
output and your agent is analyst agent and then we are going

00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:31.310
to call the crew. So we are like calling a crew, so we are

00:54:31.310 --> 00:54:34.370
giving a name, says analytics crew, agent is basically

00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:37.730
analyst, this agent, the agent we have created, task, so

00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:40.990
task we have already created, defined it and then process,

00:54:41.110 --> 00:54:43.750
process sequential, verbose is equal to false, do not give

00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:46.830
me output and then kicking off the agent, as simple as that.

00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:51.490
So this agent will be kicked off, yeah, crew AI. So with

00:54:51.490 --> 00:54:54.810
respect to lang chain, I am following a lang chain format of

00:54:54.810 --> 00:54:57.310
creating an agent with respect to a crew, I am following a

00:54:57.310 --> 00:55:00.290
crew. So nothing different I am trying to do over here as

00:55:00.290 --> 00:55:05.690
you can see, yeah. So finally I will be able to get some

00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:09.390
sort of a message return, I am just trying to give a return

00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:15.350
from a crew. Then there is something called as auto gen,

00:55:15.450 --> 00:55:19.010
especially designed for a visualization, so here I am

00:55:19.010 --> 00:55:23.430
following a auto gen. Auto gen format for a agent creation

00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:27.290
and it has to do a visualization, so I am just like create,

00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:30.210
I have created a supported like a function so that it can go

00:55:30.210 --> 00:55:33.290
and it can try to do the visualization. So if I will talk

00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:39.250
about agent creation, so agent is here, so in case of auto

00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:42.430
gen, so we try to follow this format of agent creation as we

00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:44.830
have already discussed in my previous class, so where we are

00:55:44.830 --> 00:55:49.410
giving a name, we are giving a model, we are like giving an

00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:53.450
access of my tool because I have to do a visualization, so

00:55:53.450 --> 00:55:57.630
tool wise this is a function that we have already created,

00:55:57.870 --> 00:56:01.950
render sales chart, it will take some input and then finally

00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:05.290
it is going to give you the visualization by the way because

00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:08.790
my requirement was to you know do the visualization, so here

00:56:08.790 --> 00:56:11.390
we are doing a visualization, so whatever kind of a

00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:14.090
visualization you want, maybe line chart, maybe a bar chart

00:56:14.090 --> 00:56:16.970
as you can see, so I am just trying to give an access of a

00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:20.530
tool, that okay. Take my tool. Which is going to help you

00:56:20.530 --> 00:56:24.010
out in terms of you know doing a visualization, so in a tool

00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:28.710
I have just defined a limited number of functionality, line

00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:31.350
chart and bar chart, if I want I can define extensive

00:56:31.350 --> 00:56:34.090
functionalities as well, maybe complete analytics dashboard,

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:37.350
right, maybe I can give a multiple tool access, as we all

00:56:37.350 --> 00:56:43.450
know that one agent can have a multiple tool access. And

00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:48.390
then system message, as per the you know structure

00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:56.080
of the tool. So I am just trying to like give a prompt and

00:56:56.080 --> 00:57:00.800
then agent.run and then call for the run, as simple as that

00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:03.900
and it is going to give me the output, agent is going to

00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:06.480
give me output, I am just trying to like you know showcase

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:09.680
the output, so in this manner means the core functionality

00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:13.280
or agent creation is only this much, I would say, before and

00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:16.740
after we are just like handling things you can say, right,

00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:19.800
core functionality for this one is this and again for line

00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:22.900
chain. We have already seen that, so we are like a calling

00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:25.760
element and then we are trying to invoke the agents and then

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:29.400
even in crew AI, we have seen that. Out of all three, you

00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:32.940
will be able to find out that crew AI is one of the cleanest

00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:37.400
one, that is one of the reason I love crew AI because it

00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:42.340
literally makes things easy and very simple. In other it is

00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:46.080
little bit you know clumsy but that is fine, that is just a

00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:48.660
format that we have to follow for an agent creation. So

00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:54.060
whatever format that framework has. Now, so as per our

00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:57.440
visual, so all of these agents are running at a respective

00:57:57.440 --> 00:58:00.860
place, right, all of these agents are running at the

00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:04.300
respective place and my A2A is helping me out in terms of

00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:09.440
doing a coordination. So this is it guys, right, so

00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:14.980
basically this URL is the main part. I can try to convert

00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:19.640
this URL, I can run this agent on some different server or

00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:22.140
on my own, I can run my same system on a different port. So

00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:24.920
one agent is running on one port, then second is on second

00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:28.760
port, third is on third port and then also I can try to

00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:31.180
establish a communication. That is also possible.

00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:34.740
Technically what I am trying to show you over here is that,

00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:43.480
that relationship between API and this one, it is same,

00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:47.560
right. So in case of APIs, we try to invoke some sort of

00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:51.560
APIs at a particular path, right. Similarly, you will be

00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:53.320
able to do that. You will be able to see even over here,

00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:07.540
yes. So this is what this code is going to perform for me.

00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:12.200
What about, okay, let me go with the question, modular

00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:15.900
coding use, what about the last tab, which tabs over here

00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:19.540
seems better from yesterday. I mean like yeah, once you will

00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:26.080
go into it, you will be able to like see that, that things

00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:29.900
are. Oh, working in a better manner.

00:59:33.690 --> 00:59:37.410
Okay. So there is a question, which is a important one. Uh,

00:59:37.630 --> 00:59:41.170
can you show where one agent taking input from the previous

00:59:41.170 --> 00:59:45.530
agent? Right. Okay, fine. So let's, let's try to like, uh,

00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:49.910
uh, understand it inside the orchestrator. So this is the

00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:53.210
important question, obviously that, uh, where one is taking

00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:58.490
input from others, maybe one or maybe like a two, right. So

00:59:58.490 --> 01:00:08.130
here we have basically, uh, crew analysis and then enlist,

01:00:08.130 --> 01:00:12.230
uh, enlist result we have. So focus on three results. First

01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:15.050
of all, we have a reader result. Then we have a analyst

01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:19.210
result and then we have a visual result, right? So we have

01:00:19.210 --> 01:00:22.930
basically three results over here. So what a reader will do?

01:00:23.010 --> 01:00:27.390
So reader will try to read a data, right? Reader will try to

01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:29.610
read a data. I mean, it's technically. It is calling my lang

01:00:29.610 --> 01:00:31.910
chain. So whatever I have defined inside the lang chain, it

01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:36.410
will be done by that. Yes. Now once a reader is going to

01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:39.450
take those results, right, these are going to take those

01:00:39.450 --> 01:00:42.470
results. So as you can see, we are trying to pass those

01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:48.110
reader result into my run crew analysis. Fine. So sales

01:00:48.110 --> 01:00:51.050
record, it is trying to take from where sales record it is

01:00:51.050 --> 01:00:56.390
trying to take from reader result means lang chain from the

01:00:56.390 --> 01:01:00.530
lang chain. Right. Uh, reader summary. So again, it needs

01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:03.170
required a summary text. So summary text has been provided

01:01:03.170 --> 01:01:07.650
by whom? My lang chain and it requires a matrixes. It will

01:01:07.650 --> 01:01:10.390
be provided by whom it will be provided by my lang chain.

01:01:10.510 --> 01:01:15.630
Are you able to see it? Yeah. So, and, and already we have

01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:19.610
defined that, right? So record summary text and matrixes

01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:22.970
inside a lang chain. Just now we have discussed, so it is

01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:25.230
going to give me all of these things, message, summary,

01:01:25.310 --> 01:01:27.630
text, everything, right? Everything. We have already defined

01:01:27.630 --> 01:01:30.950
that. Okay. So you are going to give me a matrixes. You are

01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:33.910
going to give me a summary text. You are going to give me

01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:41.150
basically this records. So I'm taking this one. So from lang

01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:44.990
chain, whatever output it is trying to give it to me, I'm

01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:49.570
trying to consume it here inside my crew. Now crew will try

01:01:49.570 --> 01:01:54.250
to give me a result, right? And as well as so crew will try

01:01:54.250 --> 01:01:57.530
to give me a result. Right. And as well as my, uh, like, uh,

01:01:57.730 --> 01:02:00.850
lang chain is giving me a result. Now if you will look into

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:05.050
auto gen, right, I'm taking not just one input from one, I'm

01:02:05.050 --> 01:02:11.550
taking technically input from two. One is from lang chain

01:02:11.550 --> 01:02:14.750
where I'm getting just a record. I'm just using their

01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:17.110
records, right there. Okay, fine. So you have already read

01:02:17.110 --> 01:02:21.290
the data. Now give it to me. And the second one is a result

01:02:21.290 --> 01:02:25.310
analytics results. So two things. Basically, uh, if, if I

01:02:25.310 --> 01:02:29.090
have to draw this entire like a agent, so technically what

01:02:29.090 --> 01:02:33.050
I'm trying to do, so I'm trying to, uh, have

01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:39.190
a lang chain over here. So lang will try to give me an

01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:44.650
output that will go inside my crew and I'm taking input from

01:02:44.650 --> 01:02:53.510
both into my auto gen auto gen. So this is how my agent is

01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:55.990
behaving. This is the actual structure of my. It means data

01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:58.890
by data wise, basically data wise, I'm, I'm like taking data

01:02:58.890 --> 01:03:02.110
in this particular format. So from here to here, I'm taking

01:03:02.110 --> 01:03:04.750
a data and then inside this auto gen, I'm taking both the

01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:07.830
data. This has been defined. So reader result gave me just a

01:03:07.830 --> 01:03:12.510
record and list result gave me analytics text. So that, and

01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:15.870
then artifact roots. So this is where like I'm trying to

01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:19.010
store like output, basically output of, um, I'm just

01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:21.770
restoring like output of this auto gen. So again, you can't,

01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:23.970
you can skip it if you want that. That's completely okay.

01:03:24.270 --> 01:03:26.390
Otherwise. Otherwise you can look into my JSON file. You

01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:28.810
will be able to see the output, same output that I'm

01:03:28.810 --> 01:03:32.970
showing, you know, uh, final like a result. So this is how

01:03:32.970 --> 01:03:36.970
this things has been called fine. Everyone, this is how one

01:03:36.970 --> 01:03:38.410
is taking input into another one.

01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:43.160
Okay. Fine.

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:51.640
And already format I have defined, right? So as per the

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:53.720
card, I have already defined the format that, okay, fine. So

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:56.940
you are supposed to give me output only in this format. If

01:03:56.940 --> 01:03:59.640
it is a text message, text format, if it is a data, so maybe

01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:01.940
into a data format that I have defined. So it will always

01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:04.880
try to follow that set of a rule. It will always like a, try

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:08.880
to give an input and take an input and output in that format

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:13.990
only. It is not going to deviate from there. What about

01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:16.450
memory? Should we add that? No, as of now we have not added

01:04:16.450 --> 01:04:19.750
a memory inside this one. So memory, you can try to add it

01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:22.670
inside a respective agent and then layer by layer, maybe you

01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:25.030
can transfer, but in this example I have nowhere added

01:04:25.030 --> 01:04:25.950
memory at all.

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:34.500
Okay. So any other question guys? Yeah. I'll, I'll give you

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:36.920
the score. Digest it. And if you have any kind of a

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:40.460
question, so come back and then, you know, like come to me

01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:42.580
and I'll, I'll try to show you.

01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:22.340
So basically Subit is asking me that Langchain and crew AI

01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:25.380
is bi-directional or unidirectional. See they are basically

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:28.800
a framework for creating an agent. Only that particular

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:32.920
entity bi-directional or unidirectional. So that depends

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:37.400
upon basically a communication or like a, you know, a

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:39.900
protocol that you are going to follow. So protocol is going

01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:42.800
to be bi-directional or unidirectional, not Langchain or

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:45.180
crew AI along. Hope you understand this part. They are

01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:49.620
framework just to give you a piece, a agent part means a

01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:53.740
intelligent system, right? So just this particular block, it

01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:56.580
is going to give it to you again. So you can define what

01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:58.460
should be the output, what should be the input, but

01:05:58.460 --> 01:06:01.920
protocols are supposed to be bi-directional, not like a, you

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:05.380
know, agents. So it's a question why it's a wrong question.

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:12.980
I would say. Yeah. You can try to make it bi-directional,

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:15.880
you can try to make it unidirectional, depends upon the call

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:18.800
that with, with which like a, you know, a protocol you are

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:22.760
trying to basically call it. Rag is saying, I mean, after

01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:27.060
getting output of any agent, we can use that data anywhere

01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:31.960
according to our need. Yes, but that definition you have to

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:36.580
give inside your protocol. So if I'm using A2A protocol over

01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:39.680
here, so I have to define my input and output clearly. That,

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:42.040
okay, fine. So this will be the, this will go as an input

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:45.000
that will go as a output, just like an API, right? So we try

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.860
to define that it should give me a raw output or text output

01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:53.200
or a JSON output. In every API, we define that, right? And

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:56.620
then if next one is trying to consume it, they will be able

01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:59.240
to understand if it is a text, let's parse it as a text. If

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:03.920
this is a raw, like as a raw, or if it is in a JSON, just

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:07.280
try to parse it as a JSON. Similar, like an API, right? We

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:09.700
define the output for it. So same thing goes. It goes over

01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:12.120
here because A2A is also a protocol, nothing different.

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:14.160
Yeah.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:41.340
Okay. So I just like a want, maybe I would like to give one

01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:44.960
task on top of this one. And again, this framework is new,

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:48.680
discussions is new for all of us. So here what I have done,

01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:53.380
so here I have defined this, right, a local, yeah, here I

01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:57.860
have defined this as a local. So we are like a local colon

01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:01.820
slash slash and then name. Name of the respective like agent

01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:08.140
will come over here. Like I said, so basically A2A is a

01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:13.540
protocol, just like any API, right? API call that we have

01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:18.560
been doing. Now I just wanted to convert it, right? Convert

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:22.500
this entire things in such a way that all, I don't want to

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:25.860
use this local word, right? Although it's running, it's

01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:29.780
working for me. I just wanted to convert this entire one. In

01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:34.020
such a way that one will be running at a particular path and

01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:37.320
a URL, for example, my IP address and then some port number.

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:42.060
So maybe I would like to create this kind of a end point.

01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:45.160
Yeah. So let me show you that part.

01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:51.540
So I just wanted to create this kind of an end point that my

01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:55.760
reader is running at this. Yes. Then you will feel like it's

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:59.400
a proper API. As of now, maybe some of you are not able to

01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:03.120
get a feeling of that, like a API all apart. Yeah. But here

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:05.580
also, if it is running at this particular URL, I can say,

01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:09.540
okay, fine. So and this port number, 8001, then two, then

01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:12.540
three, right? So my reader will be running one and list will

01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:15.580
be running at one like a port number and then my visualizer

01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:19.920
will be running at one of the port number, right? So and

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:23.800
then you have to like a call it means all of these three

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:27.320
like a servers are running independently because going

01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:30.740
forward, if I'm going to deploy it, so maybe one server I'll

01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:34.100
deploy in one machine. Then in a next machine, then in next

01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:37.340
machine means all three, like my end points will be

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:41.320
independent. A to A will try to manage the communication in

01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:44.440
between. So I just, I'm going to share this particular piece

01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:47.880
of the code. Do one thing after doing a setup, so which you

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:52.300
will be able to do it immediately, right? So and you will be

01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:55.240
able to run this entire piece of code immediately. So after

01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:59.540
doing a setup, just look into the code base and then try to

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:03.900
modify it just like an API. Because we all understand API,

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.700
right? We all understand this route path and all of those

01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:10.640
things. So instead of local and you just have to do a minor

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:15.180
modification over here. So instead of local, I just want you

01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:19.760
to use a particular port number and a particular URL and

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:23.040
then send it back to me. Tell me that whether it's like a

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:27.020
working for you or not. Is it fine guys? Will you be able to

01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:30.800
do it? If you will not be able to do it, then I'll give you

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:34.380
the another set of the code. So where this piece is

01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:37.400
implemented, where I have implemented this, there is another

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.320
set of a code. So where I have implemented this particular

01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:42.700
piece, right? So I'll give you that piece. But yeah, I just

01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:45.940
want you to do that and to do that, you don't have to do

01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:49.440
much by the way. We have like a URL anyhow, local we have

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:53.260
given, I mean like, I'll just try to like bind it with some

01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:56.820
different one and then run it. Yeah. So just give a try.

01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:59.580
Just give a try. Like I said, if you won't be able to do it,

01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:03.320
I'll share the fresh code. See you later. So where it will

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:06.480
be like, then you will get a feeling and the actual feeling

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:10.780
that, okay, A2A is a protocol, just like API is simple, fine

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:18.300
everyone, yes, this is just give a try. Yeah. Give a try.

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:22.580
Anyhow, if you are able to do it, it's fine. Not again, it's

01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:27.060
fine for me. I won't be having any kind of issues over here.

01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:31.300
Yeah. So, okay. Let me share this piece of a code. It will

01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:33.900
be interesting by the way. So just, just go through it. It

01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:42.280
will be very, very interesting. Now let me copy the path

01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:43.220
here.

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:28.480
So let me upload, okay,

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:53.840
so I'm uploading this one in, uh, uh, yesterday's lecture

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:59.020
guys. Yeah. So even with today's lecture, uh, same file will

01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:02.700
be uploaded, but, uh, as of now, just look into your

01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:05.920
yesterday's lecture and you will be able to find out this

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:11.070
particular file. Yeah. So 8th November A2A introduction

01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:14.250
lecture. Just go there and you will be able to find out the

01:13:14.250 --> 01:13:17.250
resources and then you can like download it.

01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:34.060
How are you able to download it guys, everyone.

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:15.280
So this is one of the modification which I want you to do.

01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:19.580
Uh, that is a part number one. Then one more thing I want

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:23.900
you to do in this one, um, apart from this, uh, like, uh,

01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:28.780
like, uh, this, uh, URL modification. So here, just, just

01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:31.560
look into one more, one more time. Yeah. Just look into the

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:34.160
code. Just go through a code. So I'm trying to return

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:36.820
something that's completely fine. And I'm trying to call

01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:39.740
even my, you know, cards and trying to like a print each and

01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:43.060
everything. But technically if you will see over here, so

01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:47.200
I'm trying to just hold a meta information. So means one is

01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:51.780
going to give me a information and here I'm just trying to

01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:58.280
manage the result and the input in between my agents. I'm

01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:00.980
sorry. Between my, like, uh, crew agents. And, uh, in

01:15:00.980 --> 01:15:03.700
between my agents. In between my, uh, like, uh, auto gen

01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:06.720
agent in between my land generation. So one is giving me

01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:10.340
output. I'm trying to take directly as a input directly as

01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:15.740
an input. And I'm trying to just log it, right? So all of

01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:18.840
this logging, I'm trying to do that. Okay, fine. So a two,

01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:22.160
one is running. One is running. I'm just trying to log its

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:27.580
information in one of the places. Let's suppose now I just

01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:31.060
want you to do one more modification in the same code base.

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:36.380
Okay. So here, for example, this result it has given to me,

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:39.120
right? This result has given to me, which I'm consuming

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:41.760
directly, right? Which I'm trying to consume directly over

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:48.080
here. I don't want to consume it, right? For example, if

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:51.500
everything is running on a separate, separate server, which

01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:54.200
you are going to do, right? So everything will be running on

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:56.080
a separate, separate server, separate, separate machines,

01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:59.520
let's suppose. So my land is running on one machine. And

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:01.860
then the, like, uh, my crew is running on one machine. My

01:16:01.860 --> 01:16:03.880
auto journey is running on another machine on different,

01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:08.420
different port number. Then you don't have to take this as

01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:12.080
an input. You have to change the input. How you have to

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:15.860
change the input. So basically you have to take this input

01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:19.720
from an agent card. As of now, as I have already discussed

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:23.500
that we have this kind of a structure. So one is going to

01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:27.420
give me output, right? So Lang is going to give me an

01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:31.740
output. I'm trying to take those output inside. Maybe. Uh,

01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:39.180
like, uh, crew and then my auto gen is trying to take a

01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:42.600
input from both, right? Input from both. Now this is a

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:45.060
structure that we are following in terms of transferring a

01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:48.560
data and whatever output this will give, whatever output

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:52.420
this will give, whatever output this will give. So in a A2A

01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:56.740
format at a particular host, at a particular URL, in a A2A

01:16:56.740 --> 01:17:00.540
format, in a A2A format at a particular URL, I'm trying to

01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:03.380
capture it. So which, which I'm showing you in a UI

01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:05.800
interface, right? That okay, fine. So this is the input as

01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:07.860
per the card that I have designed, right? As per the card.

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:11.120
So I have attached A2A with this one. I have attached A2A

01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:14.080
with this one. I have attached A2A with technically this

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:17.500
one. Now as per the modification, which I have asked you to

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:21.080
do. So as of now, this is running on local, this is running

01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:23.900
on local, this is running on local. So you have to run this

01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:28.460
in on a particular URL, same on a particular URL, same on a

01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:33.740
particular URL. Now. Now here the result that we are trying

01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:36.680
to pass directly inside a crew, directly inside a lang and

01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:39.520
directly inside the auto gen, I don't want to use this one.

01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:42.540
So remove this part as well. Yeah. Remove this part as well.

01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:46.420
Uh, so you don't have to take like a agent output directly.

01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:50.720
So what you have to do, so the log that you are trying to

01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:54.460
keep inside A2A, because inside A2A anyhow you have defined

01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:57.960
inside A2A card, you have already defined that this is the,

01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:01.720
see this is also a data, right? Coming from one agent and

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:04.620
even inside a A2A you are, you agent card, you are logging

01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:07.440
each and everything, right? You have a data, right? Just

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:10.980
change it. Yeah. So change it. Take it from A2A. Take it

01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:14.160
from A2A. So as of now we are just trying to log, we are

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:17.340
just trying to create a meta information, but yes, properly

01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:21.880
we have defined and A2A is capturing your in like a, your

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:26.360
particular agent output, which can go in a next input. So

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:31.240
instead of passing a data from agent to agent. Via A2A, try

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:34.740
to pass it, means just remove this part, remove this part

01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:38.360
and then try to call your A2A output or A2A JSON and then

01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:42.020
from there, read a record, summary a text, like a, and then

01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:44.700
like, you know, try to pass to the next one. So is it making

01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:48.120
sense guys, the modification that you have to do? So one,

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:52.580
like a, you know, send it on a different, different server,

01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:55.900
right? So local host, some port number, then local host some

01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:58.840
other port number in that way, or maybe. If you are not

01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:02.140
changing a port number, then change a path, right? So maybe

01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:06.740
slash lang slash auto, or maybe slash basically crew, maybe

01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:09.200
in this way manner also you can try to change the complete

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:12.540
route, right? So that is a first modification you have to do

01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:14.820
with respect to an agent, agent one, agent two and agent

01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:17.960
three. Now the way we are transferring a data, that's

01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:20.860
completely fine. But instead of transferring a direct data

01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:24.860
from agent to agent, right? And you are just logging those

01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:28.760
information inside A2A, right? Just do one thing. Pass a

01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:34.000
data from A2A to not this one. So at least one will be like

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.500
initializer, at least two, like a crew and auto. This is

01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:40.620
something which I want you to do as a modification. So go

01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:42.920
through a code. You will be able to understand. And once you

01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:45.000
will be able to understand, then we can go with the further

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.580
discussion. Then I can show you that how that can be a done

01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:51.820
that, that, that I'll try to discuss on next Saturday class

01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:56.280
so that this A2A will be very, very clear to all of us,

01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:58.580
right? Once we are going to separate it on a different,

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:02.300
different server. And as of now, I'm logging the

01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:04.540
information, right? I'm logging all the information. I'm

01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:08.020
returning all of this information. But yeah, so if I can

01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:11.180
return information into an agent card, it's nothing but just

01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:16.380
a packet, right? So just a JSON, I would say. So here I can

01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:21.080
pass the data, right? Same same by like, you know, this

01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:25.400
agents are doing and same I can try to capture from there.

01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:30.020
So. Are you able to get a whole requirement guys? Yeah.

01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:32.600
Whole requirement. Are you able to understand what we are

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:35.020
supposed to do? So you're not supposed to touch any of these

01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:37.480
file, by the way, your agent file, it's, it's very same

01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:40.880
simple. Leave it as it is. I just want you to, you know,

01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:44.180
walk into the orchestrator the way we are trying to bind

01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:48.160
each and everything again. Even this A2A utility won't have

01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:50.960
to touch much apart from this, like a, you know, end point

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:55.000
modification. You can, you can just like do it, configure

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.780
it, right? Parameterize it by the way, maybe with respect to

01:20:57.780 --> 01:21:02.260
a port, maybe with respect to a name. So everything will

01:21:02.260 --> 01:21:04.320
have to, you will have to do it, do it inside the

01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:06.920
orchestrator. So where we are like combining all three

01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:10.880
agents so that confidently I can say that all of my agents

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:13.240
are running on a separate, separate server, separate

01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:17.040
computers, right? Going forward. And I'm able to establish a

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:20.240
communication between all of those, like a computer and even

01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:24.220
one computer is transferring the data to others to like, you

01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:28.760
know, initiate itself. Will you be able to do it? Yeah.

01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:40.800
Yes. Give a try. Like I said, so give a try, then only you

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:43.300
will be able to understand. So once you just have to

01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:46.820
understand the communication, like in between these things,

01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:49.720
if you're able to understand that, then it's done. There is

01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:54.320
nothing much to understand again in a A2A in that situation.

01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:57.220
So just try to give it a try because as of now I'm not

01:21:57.220 --> 01:22:00.120
passing a data, I'm just like trying to give input of one.

01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:04.360
Okay. Uh, agent to another, other agent. This is the

01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:06.320
procedure which I'm following. You just have to replace it

01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:09.620
with the A2A, but I'm logging it. Yeah. I'm logging each and

01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:11.940
everything. And I'm like, uh, I'm capturing everything as a

01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:15.920
meta information and, uh, that same information I'm even

01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:20.800
like, uh, trying to show you on your UI side. Yeah. So I'm,

01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:27.420
I'm showing each and everything. Okay. So that's it for

01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:29.960
today's class, guys, if you have any kind of a question, go

01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:32.300
ahead with that. I'll try to like, uh, clarify the question.

01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:35.500
Agenda for next class is going to be a modification into an

01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:39.680
A2A. So go digest A2A. Uh, it was even like a bit tough for

01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:42.660
me to, you know, build it, not because of a concept because

01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:46.520
of, uh, basically a library dependency, which has given me a

01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:49.580
lot of pain, uh, in terms of building this example, as

01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:52.700
compared to any other example, uh, it was, it was like a

01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:57.300
library device. It was like, uh, giving me a lot of, you

01:22:57.300 --> 01:23:00.740
know, bugs, uh, when I was trying to like, uh, handle each

01:23:00.740 --> 01:23:02.880
and everything. So I have, uh, that's the reason I have

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:06.920
configured it with respect to a UV, uh, so that it will be

01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:10.420
able to resolve your dependency. So if you will go inside a

01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:13.160
code base, you will be able to find out that there is a

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:15.900
virtual environment I have already created. So don't have to

01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:18.620
do much. You don't have to do any kind of a setup. Just open

01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:21.200
up this folder, activate this virtual environment. So I

01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:24.120
think we all know the environment dot a script slash script,

01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:26.500
cell is activate. So your virtual environment will be

01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:30.460
activated once it is activated, then simply try to run this

01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:37.000
particular file. So, uh, sorry, UI app dot PI file. Yeah. So

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:44.200
a stream link run space source slash UI slash app dot PI

01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:48.180
file. So this is going to be your command to run this entire

01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:51.560
things as simple as that. No need to create any environment.

01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:57.160
Just activate my environment itself. Don't see zip file as

01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:01.120
of now. No, I think I have already like, uh, uploaded zip

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:01.540
file. I think I have already like, uh, uploaded zip file.

01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:06.340
Try, try to refresh it. You will be able to see zip file.

01:24:07.780 --> 01:24:12.140
I'm not able to download it. Uh, let me check once again,

01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:23.240
continue learning and I've uploaded here the resource. So

01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:25.060
click, Oh,

01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:34.040
is it blank? Maybe I have done some mistake. Let me check.

01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:42.320
Oh, the resource link was missing.

01:24:59.250 --> 01:25:01.910
Okay. Now I can check. Let me check. It's available. The zip

01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:04.990
file. Yeah. So I have like, I forgot to upload. I have

01:25:04.990 --> 01:25:07.310
already created directory, but yeah, I have not uploaded it.

01:25:08.450 --> 01:25:12.450
So click on this one and you will be able to, uh, download

01:25:12.450 --> 01:25:15.930
this, uh, zip file. Uh, first of all, set up wise, you don't

01:25:15.930 --> 01:25:17.810
have to do anything. Just activate your virtual environment.

01:25:18.010 --> 01:25:21.690
Everything will be done and then try to run the app dot PI

01:25:21.690 --> 01:25:27.700
file. So as simple as that, and then do this small

01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:31.140
modification. So agenda for this class is going to be a

01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:34.180
modification. I have not closed. So I'll discuss more and

01:25:34.180 --> 01:25:37.720
more into a two way and separate all the servers, uh,

01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:40.360
basically. Uh, so that just like a, you have understood

01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:42.700
APIs, you will be able to understand a two way because

01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:46.340
nowadays people are using it, right? So whenever you have to

01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:49.260
establish a communication between our multiple agents,

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:53.020
obviously you are going to use it even inside the industry.

01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:56.500
So pretty much important concept. And again, this things are

01:25:56.500 --> 01:26:01.220
evolving, uh, day by day. So, uh, maybe in your next.

01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:05.700
Project people are going to use it intensively and agents is

01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:08.820
increasing, right? Everywhere agents are increasing. Even,

01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:11.920
uh, many people have reached out to us after launching this,

01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:14.560
you're on consultancy saying that, that I'm working, uh,

01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:18.440
like on an agent, I'm creating an agent for my client. Uh, I

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:22.340
need your help. So I can, I can see, I don't know whether,

01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:25.360
uh, like, uh, they will be able to get a desired result or

01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:28.880
not, but yes, everyone is trying to do something with

01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:33.160
respect to agent in our team. Which is good, right? If

01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:35.520
everyone is like, uh, doing it, everyone is appreciating it,

01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:40.260
obviously this things will go somewhere. And uh, as agentic

01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:43.200
world is increasing, you need a two way kind of a solution.

01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:45.880
So where you will be able to establish a communication

01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:49.700
because that's a core part, right? Like I have already

01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:53.580
discussed that if I have a multiple team and every team has

01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:57.740
chosen their own framework, right. And they have to, you

01:26:57.740 --> 01:27:00.540
know, establish a communication in their own framework.

01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:03.040
Okay. So obviously a two A's way.

01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:09.720
Yeah. Yes. Available now. Okay. It's still not able to

01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:11.920
download. No, I think now it's available. I have just

01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:14.800
checked. It's, it's available. So just go refresh and then

01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:18.300
like, you know, click on your studies class, 8th November

01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:25.260
class, click on resources and there is a file. A two A MCP

01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:29.100
can match. Very good. Yeah. MCP is also protocol. A two A is

01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:32.340
also protocol. Uh, both has been designed for a different

01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:36.840
different purposes. So purpose for MCP is give your world

01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:41.400
access to a LLM. That's a definition that MCP follows. And

01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:44.720
if I'll talk about a two A protocol, so basically if you

01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:48.020
have to establish a communication between an agent, go with

01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:52.400
a two A. So kind of, uh, yeah, that that's a definition.

01:27:55.970 --> 01:28:00.290
Fine. So just, uh, do it guys. Uh, just try to do the, these

01:28:00.290 --> 01:28:04.550
two modification, which I have asked you. So one, uh, remove

01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:10.670
local. And run it on some URL like this, the example, which

01:28:10.670 --> 01:28:14.010
I have shown you, right? Like this one, uh, maybe not like

01:28:14.010 --> 01:28:17.070
this one, then also it's fine. I just want you to change the

01:28:17.070 --> 01:28:19.930
URL. So maybe you can change a port number or maybe you can

01:28:19.930 --> 01:28:23.390
change this final path itself. I don't have any kind of

01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:26.510
issues. So maybe you can try to, you know, modify this as a

01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:30.330
line. This has a crew. This has a auto for me. It's fine

01:28:30.330 --> 01:28:33.910
because if you are able to do it, it simply means that you

01:28:33.910 --> 01:28:36.530
are running at a different route, which this is what I want

01:28:36.530 --> 01:28:41.430
by the way. Right. A route. And then in a orchestrator. So

01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:44.050
as of now, I'm just trying to capture a meta information

01:28:44.050 --> 01:28:48.790
from like, uh, uh, every step from every agent in an A2

01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:51.950
format by the way. Yeah. So I'm able to capture our data.

01:28:52.050 --> 01:28:55.310
I'm able to even showcase those data into my UI interface.

01:28:55.770 --> 01:28:59.950
Uh, but data, uh, when it comes to passing a data from one

01:28:59.950 --> 01:29:03.570
to another, so I'm just trying to like, uh, take output of

01:29:03.570 --> 01:29:07.330
one agent. And then passing it into the another one, I just

01:29:07.330 --> 01:29:13.190
want to kill that layer what I want. So data will go to a

01:29:13.190 --> 01:29:17.270
API, right? So API is API will get a response. And then that

01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:21.650
response, I will try to feed it to the next layer. This is,

01:29:21.670 --> 01:29:24.850
this is like a, uh, what I want. So in that case, I can say

01:29:24.850 --> 01:29:30.310
it will be a pure, like a, you know, a rule driven, or you

01:29:30.310 --> 01:29:34.450
can say a pure protocol driven example. We will be able to

01:29:34.450 --> 01:29:39.050
build then, uh, like, uh, you know, it doesn't matter. I

01:29:39.050 --> 01:29:42.670
have like a one agent or maybe I have a 1000 agent. It will

01:29:42.670 --> 01:29:45.670
be just plug and play, plug and play, right? That okay. So

01:29:45.670 --> 01:29:49.710
there is a route. There is this kind of a route, which is

01:29:49.710 --> 01:29:52.930
giving me a particular kind of a return. Now from this

01:29:52.930 --> 01:29:56.070
route, I'm trying to send those like a return to a next one.

01:29:56.310 --> 01:30:01.470
That's it. Right. So my requirement is clear guys. With

01:30:01.470 --> 01:30:07.440
respect to this, uh, agent. Yeah. Dhruv is saying kindly

01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:10.920
repeat how to execute it, how to run it. So to run this one,

01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:13.980
first of all, you have to activate your environment. So the

01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:16.620
way I have activated to activate this environment, I believe

01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:19.720
we all know, uh, you, I have already like given you the

01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:24.060
environment file. So dot V environment slash script slash

01:30:24.060 --> 01:30:27.080
activate, and your environment will be activated this way,

01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:30.040
right? Your environment will be activated. Now once your

01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:34.440
environment will be activated, uh, next step is. So you have

01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:39.100
to type S T R E M L I T streamlint run, not in a capital, in

01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:45.180
a small S T R E M L I T streamlint run, and then how you

01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:47.880
will be able to find out the run file. So we have source

01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:53.100
folder. So dot slash, you can say SRC slash inside that we

01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:58.460
have a UI folder, right? So UI slash inside that we have app

01:30:58.460 --> 01:31:03.600
dot PI folder, simple set and run. Yeah. As you can see, I'm

01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:08.020
able to run it. So it is able to load the data. I can click

01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:11.620
on run agents and uh, all of them are going to do a

01:31:11.620 --> 01:31:16.540
respective job. I have all the attached by key open AI key.

01:31:16.660 --> 01:31:18.260
So you don't have to do anything. I'm not going to

01:31:18.260 --> 01:31:20.960
deactivate that open AI key. You can use it for a week. It's

01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:25.460
completely fine. Right? Yeah.

01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:39.760
Okay. Finally, do you want any question for me? Uh, is your

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:42.380
own. I mean, architecture uses eight way for it, or if you

01:31:42.380 --> 01:31:44.660
don't know, not at all, we are, we are not using it to

01:31:44.660 --> 01:31:48.380
actually, uh, when we are building our money. So I think it

01:31:48.380 --> 01:31:52.760
was even, uh, like, uh, it was very, very new. Even now,

01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:55.100
eight way when, when I was trying to explore, right, eight

01:31:55.100 --> 01:32:01.120
ways, not, uh, uh, that I would say, uh, old, um, it's a

01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:04.360
good, uh, technology to understand. It's a good protocol to

01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:07.620
understand, but yeah, it's still, it's like a new, uh, and

01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:11.180
everything in a agent. AI or generative AI is a new people

01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:14.000
are evolving and you will be able to see a very, very

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:17.120
different phase in a year of time or maybe in a two year of

01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:19.380
time. So you should, you have to keep on learning things.

01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:22.520
You have to keep on exploring things, right? All these

01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:25.720
technologies are very new and believe me, everyone is like,

01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:29.780
uh, most of us are doing our experimentation. Yeah. Most of

01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:32.380
us are, you know, trying to understand the protocol and then

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:34.800
by the time we'll try to understand one protocol, another

01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:37.400
day, someone will leave some new research paper and say

01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:39.840
that, okay, fine. This is the new protocol. Then we'll have

01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:42.960
to go and understand that as well. So as of now, this is how

01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:47.540
AI world is moving. But uh, I think within a year or two,

01:32:47.700 --> 01:32:52.480
uh, things will be more stabilized, but yes, as you all have

01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:55.420
started now, so believe me, you will be having an upper

01:32:55.420 --> 01:32:59.320
hand. Yeah. So you have an upper hand. Even if you know a

01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:04.660
little bit of things, people will give you opportunity. So

01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:07.120
maybe you can, you can take advantage of it because after

01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:08.800
two years situation is not going to be the same. It's going

01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:11.320
to be the same because there'll be so many people who will

01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:14.620
be knowing like everything and then, you know, there'll be a

01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:14.980
competition.

01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:23.400
Is there any hard constraint or Python version? I always

01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:28.440
advise to go ahead with a 3.10, 3.11. So not to go ahead

01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:32.400
with, you know, uh, latest 3.13, 1.4 or 1.5

01:33:35.690 --> 01:33:40.550
A2A type import module not found error. You have to like, I

01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:45.450
think, uh, you have to run this UV run and then only you can

01:33:45.450 --> 01:33:50.910
do it. Okay. Environment. Where is my TOML?

01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:06.300
Okay. So you have to install these dependencies. So here is

01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:09.280
a A2 SDK. So this is the version of A2 SDK, which is

01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:12.700
mentioned inside that TOML file. You can go and check. I'm

01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:16.500
using a UV like install. So that is a reason. So it is like

01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:21.420
creating this file and then it is trying to like, you know,

01:34:21.420 --> 01:34:22.940
uh, show me in this manner.

01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:31.620
So simple. Do one thing. Uh, what? Uh, these, these

01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:33.420
dependencies will not be available. They were in your

01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:36.200
system. So as you have already activated the environment,

01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:38.600
right? So for example, if you have activated this

01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:41.780
environment for the very first time, uh, just try to run one

01:34:41.780 --> 01:34:47.140
command. Hmm. So, uh, CLS, right? If you are getting this

01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:49.760
issue. So basically inside a TOML file, I have already

01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:54.120
defined all the dependencies. You have to write one command

01:34:54.120 --> 01:35:00.960
over here that, uh, U V P I P pip install, I N S T A double

01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:11.970
L. Install. Sorry. Uh, projects dot P R O J C T S P R O or

01:35:14.210 --> 01:35:20.030
TOML file name is PI P R O J C T S project dot TOML. So

01:35:20.030 --> 01:35:22.690
simple pip install hyphen R the way you used to do a

01:35:22.690 --> 01:35:26.750
requirement or TXT. So in case of UV, uh, like, uh, we have

01:35:26.750 --> 01:35:29.410
this particular file which is already available. So just try

01:35:29.410 --> 01:35:32.430
to run this command, although it is supposed to capture it

01:35:32.430 --> 01:35:35.030
from my virtual library. I have already installed it. So it

01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:37.410
should not in either situation, it should not give you an

01:35:37.410 --> 01:35:39.870
issue because I have not deleted this file. This file is

01:35:39.870 --> 01:35:42.910
still available. Means all this like a libraries must be

01:35:42.910 --> 01:35:46.470
like a available over here. See A2A library is available, A2

01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:50.070
SDK is available. So technically these libraries are already

01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:53.910
available in my folder and same folder I have passed. So

01:35:53.910 --> 01:35:57.070
this is not required by the way, but yeah, if it is asking,

01:35:57.210 --> 01:36:01.010
then do it after activating your virtual environment.

01:36:05.050 --> 01:36:08.150
Yeah. Simple. No need asking. Otherwise leave it.

01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:18.100
Okay. So fine guys. Uh, these are the tasks. Just do it.

01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:21.440
Right. And then next week, one more thing. So whenever

01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:25.180
you're coming for a class, right? So next week I'll try to

01:36:25.180 --> 01:36:28.140
extend your class little bit later, right? Maybe like I'll

01:36:28.140 --> 01:36:31.800
take a class for three, four hour, uh, Sunday's class, not

01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:34.180
Saturday class. Saturday will just like a take a regular

01:36:34.180 --> 01:36:40.420
class, normal class. So just keep your account ready. So

01:36:40.420 --> 01:36:45.360
which account? AWS, Azure and GCP, all three are giving you

01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:49.020
a free credit, right? Uh, almost someone giving you 300,

01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:52.760
someone is giving you 500 kind of a credit. So just try to

01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:55.660
create an account and just try to keep your account ready

01:36:55.660 --> 01:36:59.380
because I'm going to teach, I'm going to talk about

01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:05.140
generative AI inside a cloud. For example, AWS bedrock is

01:37:05.140 --> 01:37:07.840
one of the services inside Google. There is something called

01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:10.680
as vortex AI where you can access all the models, right? And

01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:16.060
then like a Azure. So inside Azure, inside a vortex, inside

01:37:16.060 --> 01:37:19.060
AWS. So first of all, I'll try to teach you a basic concept

01:37:19.060 --> 01:37:23.100
of a cloud. I'll be starting with AWS by the way, right? So

01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:25.980
how to create many, maybe a user, how to give a permission,

01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:28.980
how to define a role over there, how to create a groups, all

01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:32.020
those things, which is a basic of cloud platform, right?

01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:35.680
Without that, you will not be able to, uh, you know, uh,

01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:40.840
access any services, right? Any services. And then I'll be

01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:44.560
talking about a particular service with respect to a cloud

01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:47.620
platform. It's very, very easy. The way they have, you know,

01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:50.760
uh, created the UI interface, the way they have created a

01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:54.420
flow. Believe me, all of you will be able to grasp easily,

01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:58.200
but you need to practice and to practice, you need a account

01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:00.860
for next Sunday. I'm talking about not a Saturday. So you

01:38:00.860 --> 01:38:02.860
have a time till Saturday. Take your time because it will

01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:05.280
Saturday I'll be talking about just a two way. I will not

01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:09.100
like, uh, uh, move myself from a two way. Okay. And, uh,

01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:12.620
then how to launch instances over there, how to access our

01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:15.720
GPUs over there. Many more things I have to teach you with

01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:19.000
respect to a cloud. What is the reason? The reason is that,

01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:21.900
that we have to do a project, right? We have to do a project

01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:24.700
now in terms of doing a project. So we have to create

01:38:24.700 --> 01:38:28.580
complete end to end CI CD pipeline. We have to create an

01:38:28.580 --> 01:38:30.560
environment called as production environment, testing

01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:33.640
environment, and then like a development environment. And we

01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:37.600
have to create basically a complete, like a GitHub action we

01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:41.100
have to use. And we have to do a CI CD. We have to host it.

01:38:41.180 --> 01:38:43.960
And that too, when I'm talking about a hosting, so we have

01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:47.440
to host it on a scale, right? Auto scaling in auto scaling

01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:51.980
mode, we have to host it. So to like, uh, do all of those

01:38:51.980 --> 01:38:57.400
things, I have to be good with a cloud and I have to be, uh,

01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:01.580
like, uh, aware about a couple of services. So around those

01:39:01.580 --> 01:39:04.560
things around those stuff, we are going to talk about the

01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:08.280
services because all four project will go for a. Heavy

01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:12.320
deployment, not just a render kind of a deployment. I can

01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:15.160
show you deployment, even on render, not a big deal at all,

01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:18.880
right? But not that, that is not a, like a, you know, the

01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:22.240
actual thing, uh, we'll, we'll try to show you, uh, the real

01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:25.180
one, uh, real part, basically the way we try to

01:39:25.180 --> 01:39:28.540
productionize the actual project. So if you will be having

01:39:28.540 --> 01:39:32.160
your cloud account, uh, it will be good, uh, great, right?

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:36.220
Uh, otherwise you can just come to class and watch that,

01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:39.380
that the only thing that you will be able to do apart from

01:39:39.380 --> 01:39:41.940
that. So we'll try to attach a Prometheus and Grafana as

01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:44.720
well, uh, so that, you know, it will be able to capture my

01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:48.660
server logs as well as logs from my code. And even if I'm

01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:51.280
going to use a GPU, so even from there, it will be able to

01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:53.940
capture a log and it will be able to show me inside my

01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:56.500
dashboard. And if there'll be some alert, we can try to

01:39:56.500 --> 01:39:59.620
configure alert as well. So if my system will go down, uh,

01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:03.620
it will like, you know, uh, initiate a alert for me. So that

01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:06.040
is a kind of a, you know, heavy, like I said, heavy

01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:08.520
deployment will go ahead with the very, very heavy

01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:12.860
deployment, uh, means the way we deploy our product. So

01:40:12.860 --> 01:40:15.540
similar kind of approach we are going to follow in this one.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.940
So that is going to start from Sunday onwards. So I mean

01:40:19.940 --> 01:40:23.500
like, uh, Sunday is just as like a starting day will take

01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:25.740
like a couple of more days to, you know, digest those

01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:31.640
concepts and to do the same fine guys. Yeah. So all three

01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:35.720
platforms, just, just keep it ready as your AWS and GCP for

01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:38.180
a month, how much cost? It will be like, uh, if you are

01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:41.280
keeping your server up and running and if user is using it,

01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:44.600
then maybe two lakhs, three lakhs per month for one product.

01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:49.480
If user is using it, maybe like a 10,000, 20,000 user. If

01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:51.560
you have just deployed and switch off your server, then

01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:53.320
zero, yeah,

01:40:55.270 --> 01:40:56.390
simple.

01:40:59.020 --> 01:41:03.960
So it's, it's up to you. I have 30K user. Okay. Then like,

01:41:03.980 --> 01:41:07.140
uh, uh, depends what, what solution you are deploying,

01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:09.920
right? Because you are going to allocate a machine and

01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:12.960
databases. And it is going to charge you for that part,

01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:18.650
right? So just, just keep your account ready. Uh, you will

01:41:18.650 --> 01:41:21.570
see some very, very real deployment. Maybe you have not seen

01:41:21.570 --> 01:41:25.630
anywhere, uh, like literally anywhere means not even on

01:41:25.630 --> 01:41:28.630
YouTube or in any other classes you will be able to find

01:41:28.630 --> 01:41:31.450
out. So I'll show you that kind of a deployment in this one,

01:41:34.170 --> 01:41:38.290
not getting ideas to implement and earn. First of all, like,

01:41:38.330 --> 01:41:41.330
you know, uh, start something, then you will start earning,

01:41:41.470 --> 01:41:45.590
right? That's not going to happen directly. Government

01:41:45.590 --> 01:41:49.630
cannot pay, sir. Uh, that's a government's problem then,

01:41:49.730 --> 01:41:51.750
right?

01:41:54.590 --> 01:41:58.950
Uh, that's true nowhere. Okay. On what basis company goes to

01:41:58.950 --> 01:42:04.090
A2A sir? See honestly speaking, A2A is new, as simple as

01:42:04.090 --> 01:42:08.350
that, right? A2A is new, very, very new. So if you will go

01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:10.790
and search, I mean like, uh, people are saying that, okay,

01:42:10.830 --> 01:42:13.410
maybe this company is using A2A, that company is using A2A.

01:42:13.410 --> 01:42:17.970
But even I'm not sure who is using A2A. That is a fact.

01:42:18.030 --> 01:42:21.130
Believe me, right? That is a fact. But yeah, it's a good

01:42:21.130 --> 01:42:24.810
technology. It's a good protocol, I would say, set of rules

01:42:24.810 --> 01:42:28.670
which has been created. So as a techie, uh, it's our

01:42:28.670 --> 01:42:31.750
responsibility to understand those things, right? It's a

01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:34.550
good one. If you will look into the philosophy of A2A, so

01:42:34.550 --> 01:42:37.450
it's a good philosophy, uh, on the philosophy that they have

01:42:37.450 --> 01:42:40.610
built it, it's going to be really helpful when agentic

01:42:40.610 --> 01:42:43.770
system will grow, right? When agentic system will grow, a

01:42:43.770 --> 01:42:45.730
team inside a particular company will grow, which is

01:42:45.730 --> 01:42:48.150
happening, right? Which is happening. It will take

01:42:48.150 --> 01:42:51.790
eventually some time and then in parallel A2A people will do

01:42:51.790 --> 01:42:56.410
some sort of, you know, uh, development and improvement.

01:42:56.750 --> 01:43:02.570
They will try to make it more easy and easy. So that's my

01:43:02.570 --> 01:43:08.100
thought about A2A. PK, what is our project? Project I have

01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:11.340
already listed down, right? So whatever is mentioned in the

01:43:11.340 --> 01:43:13.760
syllabus will go with that. Project is already listed down.

01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:18.280
It's already like, uh, mentioned here. Uh, I got a job clear

01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:20.820
seven interview in notice period. I have joined in data as

01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:23.400
an engineer. Your video helped me a lot. Okay. Let me take a

01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:27.500
snapshot. I'll post it on a LinkedIn. Thank you so much.

01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:35.920
Okay. And guys, I think I told you, right? So try to focus

01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:39.580
on your LinkedIn profile. But I see many, like very few

01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:42.900
people who is like, you know, uh, doing it on a regular

01:43:42.900 --> 01:43:46.940
basis. I see that, that, uh, people are not taking their

01:43:46.940 --> 01:43:49.980
networking, uh, in a very, very serious manner and believe

01:43:49.980 --> 01:43:53.720
me, that will hurt you. That will hurt you like anything.

01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:57.660
Right. And networking is something that can't happen like,

01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:00.300
you know, over overnight. You can't come and say even inside

01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:03.100
a group that, okay, help me out. If you are active inside a

01:44:03.100 --> 01:44:06.240
group, if you are helping people, if you are active over a

01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:09.280
social media platform, if you are helping people over there,

01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:11.920
maybe in terms of content, maybe in terms of getting a job.

01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:14.620
Okay. Maybe you are working somewhere. Right. And obviously

01:44:14.620 --> 01:44:17.620
if we are working, there will be some opportunity, right?

01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:19.840
Maybe one, maybe two, maybe for an intern, maybe for a

01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:23.020
fresher. So unless and until you are not helping other, like

01:44:23.020 --> 01:44:26.640
you can't like, you know, come and say tomorrow that someone

01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:29.800
is going, someone should help me. Right. Uh, generally

01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:33.360
people follow this, focus on your networking. I think that

01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:36.060
is important. If you're going to take it seriously, believe

01:44:36.060 --> 01:44:40.020
me, uh, a result will be exponential. And if you're not

01:44:40.020 --> 01:44:42.500
going to take me seriously, then, then that's okay. It's up

01:44:42.500 --> 01:44:46.360
to you. Okay. You're scared to share on LinkedIn as not sure

01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:49.160
how to write and share the content. You have a chat GPT, you

01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:51.320
have a UD, you have a Gemini, you have everything. Then what

01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:55.840
you are afraid of? Yeah. You have like a, but tons of AI,

01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:59.120
you're living in an AI world, you're surrounded by AI. And

01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:02.680
then you're saying you are not able to, uh, you know, do the

01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:08.500
write-ups. I'm like, that's bad. Yeah. But yes, if you're

01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:11.620
not doing it, if you're not like, uh, moving yourself, then

01:45:11.620 --> 01:45:16.520
believe me tomorrow, if you're looking for a help, you will

01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:20.420
not get, this is how world works, right? This is really how

01:45:20.420 --> 01:45:23.600
world works. And I think this is how even you works because

01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:25.760
you are the part of world, right? You are one of the unit

01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:29.420
inside this world. So, uh, even before helping someone, so

01:45:29.420 --> 01:45:30.760
you will think, so

01:45:33.290 --> 01:45:35.470
I do a lot of networking in LinkedIn in my last

01:45:35.470 --> 01:45:38.210
organization, ITC info deck. I have referred 40 people with

01:45:38.210 --> 01:45:40.370
the five active joiners and getting hands on referral

01:45:40.370 --> 01:45:44.530
amount. Yes. Yeah. People are getting, I can like, I know a

01:45:44.530 --> 01:45:46.910
lot of people like not just want to, because this is my

01:45:46.910 --> 01:45:48.930
regular job, right? Which I'm doing since a very, very long

01:45:48.930 --> 01:45:52.590
time. Uh, people are earning a lot just by giving a

01:45:52.590 --> 01:45:56.910
referrals. Company needs a candidate, right? Company needs a

01:45:56.910 --> 01:45:58.910
candidate. They're giving you a referral. So just try to

01:45:58.910 --> 01:46:02.370
give a profile. So what's wrong in that? In that way you are

01:46:02.370 --> 01:46:05.410
helping person and at the same point of time you are able to

01:46:05.410 --> 01:46:08.750
earn, right? Maybe tomorrow you can try to charge for,

01:46:08.810 --> 01:46:12.470
charge some small amount for interview preparation. Right.

01:46:12.570 --> 01:46:15.710
Maybe like ask them that, okay, fine. So if you are able to

01:46:15.710 --> 01:46:19.030
get a call, uh, I'll maybe charge 500 rupees, thousand, 5

01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:22.150
,000 rupees also. Right. Uh, just to like, uh, make you

01:46:22.150 --> 01:46:24.690
prepared for your, like an interview in the company, uh, in

01:46:24.690 --> 01:46:27.790
my company, like wherever I've given you a referral. That's

01:46:27.790 --> 01:46:32.470
okay. Right. Because see, no one, I don't say that, that you

01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:34.450
should go and you should do a charity. I don't believe in a

01:46:34.450 --> 01:46:36.870
charity. The best charity that you can do in this entire

01:46:36.870 --> 01:46:39.270
world is to earn more and more because you will earn more.

01:46:39.310 --> 01:46:43.290
You will pay more taxes. And when you are a taxpayer, so

01:46:43.290 --> 01:46:46.850
nothing can beat that as a charity, we are doing charity

01:46:46.850 --> 01:46:49.310
technically. If you are paying taxes, it simply means that,

01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:51.710
that you are doing a charity and that is a biggest charity

01:46:51.710 --> 01:46:54.530
that you can do. So how you will be able to pay more taxes,

01:46:54.670 --> 01:46:56.830
obviously if you are earning more, right, you will be able

01:46:56.830 --> 01:47:00.550
to pay more taxes. Uh, so again, it's like completely fair

01:47:00.550 --> 01:47:03.230
to, you know, go and charge someone because even that person

01:47:03.230 --> 01:47:05.450
is going to earn, right? That person is going to earn.

01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:09.830
Simple. Hope you, all of you are lying with my philosophy.

01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:13.450
I'm like, that's my, that's my personal opinion. Simple. So

01:47:13.450 --> 01:47:17.750
it's not a company's opinion. So yes, you should, you should

01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:20.230
always earn. This is how world works. This is how economy

01:47:20.230 --> 01:47:26.280
works. The strategy is awesome. Casual. Uh, next interview

01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:29.360
batch covering both AIM and engineering. Uh, can't say about

01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:34.280
that PK as of now. We'll see. Right? We'll see. So I'm

01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:37.180
working with the police department. My department has asked,

01:47:37.180 --> 01:47:41.160
asked me to build a model to use our data. Now my first task

01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:43.880
is data processing. And then fine tuning my data. I want TV.

01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:49.280
The step is right. Uh, I mean, yeah, but, uh, we'll have to

01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:51.520
look into your data and then like pipeline that you have

01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:56.340
created overall, obviously this is what you do. I'm going to

01:47:56.340 --> 01:47:58.200
say, actually, I got this right. This is a new philosophy.

01:47:58.340 --> 01:48:02.960
We should follow. Yeah. So are more pay more taxes in that

01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:06.820
way. You can say it, call yourself, you know, that, that you

01:48:06.820 --> 01:48:11.340
are doing a charity. This is what I, you know, I, I work a

01:48:11.340 --> 01:48:13.480
lot. Because, uh, you know, I know I'm paying a lot of

01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:17.800
taxes. So in that way, I'm doing a lot of charity. I'm happy

01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:18.440
about that.

01:48:21.580 --> 01:48:27.220
Uh, yes. So, uh, yeah. Okay. Fine guys. I have already given

01:48:27.220 --> 01:48:29.880
you a task. I think we have discussed enough, tried to

01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:33.780
complete those tasks and, um, uh, by Sunday nights till

01:48:33.780 --> 01:48:36.680
Saturday, you have a time. So by Sunday, keep your like a

01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:41.400
cloud account ready. So now it's time to move from local to

01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:46.480
a cloud. Right. Uh, because the cloud is a place where real

01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:50.420
things happens and you are supposed to learn a lot of

01:48:50.420 --> 01:48:54.960
things. If you have to, you know, bring your product to a

01:48:54.960 --> 01:48:58.360
life, right. So that is the initiative we are going to start

01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:03.020
from next Sunday. Yeah. Uh, as far as the, like these

01:49:03.020 --> 01:49:05.460
concepts are concerned. So I believe we are okay with the

01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:08.840
concepts, right. Uh, once you will do more, you will build

01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:11.520
more. You will be able to, you know, understand more. And

01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:14.120
even. I'm trying to understand more and more because

01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:18.320
technology is new. Yeah. I know you were paying for lack,

01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:22.620
uh, even at a time of I need on, you were paying for lack

01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:27.940
only taxes more than that for land. It was very small, uh,

01:49:28.020 --> 01:49:31.280
is a lengthy class next week. Come to the class. I'm like,

01:49:31.420 --> 01:49:34.920
no one is forcing you to see the size of the class you will

01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:39.260
pip install life on our PI project. Tom will, uh, you will,

01:49:39.260 --> 01:49:42.260
you will not recognize. Okay. So if it is saying UV is not

01:49:42.260 --> 01:49:46.340
organized, then first do pip install UV. Yeah. If it is

01:49:46.340 --> 01:49:48.640
telling you that UV is not organized, then do pip install UV

01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:52.920
and then do this one so that you will be installed and then

01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:54.180
you will be used.

01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:02.300
Can you give me a bit context about how through a camera

01:50:02.300 --> 01:50:04.720
people can be counted, which technology can we use in that

01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:07.460
case? So basically it's a object detection. So object

01:50:07.460 --> 01:50:10.220
detection and object segmentation, you can try to use. And

01:50:10.220 --> 01:50:13.120
for that, there are like a multiple model, which is already

01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:16.040
available. But yes. Uh, if your lighting condition is

01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:18.040
different, if your camera angle is different, if your feed

01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:20.860
is different, then maybe you have to go with your own custom

01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:24.160
model training that we do. So to do a custom model training,

01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:28.180
so you can try to use a Yolo model. So I think Yolo, uh,

01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:31.400
eight was the last one when I have trained, uh, which I

01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:35.180
remember after labeling by data. So just label your data, go

01:50:35.180 --> 01:50:40.670
with the training, uh, deploy your model, Yolo model. Okay.

01:50:40.770 --> 01:50:42.870
So Yolo eight was the last one, which I have trained

01:50:42.870 --> 01:50:47.550
personally. So now Yolo 11 is running. Yeah. But, uh, yeah,

01:50:47.610 --> 01:50:48.270
that was the one.

01:50:51.570 --> 01:50:55.170
Model not found A2A, uh, it should not give you ideally an

01:50:55.170 --> 01:50:57.290
issue, but yeah, if it is giving an issue, then go with the

01:50:57.290 --> 01:51:03.750
installation. So UV installation, uh, one of the interviewer

01:51:03.750 --> 01:51:06.550
asked where you learned in AI, when you learn with Anshul

01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:09.550
Kumar, simply said one of the best learning platform. That

01:51:09.550 --> 01:51:13.530
that's great. So even your interview, see after, see same

01:51:13.530 --> 01:51:15.510
thing happened even with previous company, right? Because,

01:51:15.510 --> 01:51:19.050
uh, we were like a popular in terms of our data, uh, science

01:51:19.050 --> 01:51:22.630
and AI analysis. And all those trainings, right? So after

01:51:22.630 --> 01:51:25.650
some time, what happened is that, that, uh, when person used

01:51:25.650 --> 01:51:29.290
to go for an interview, so your interviewer interview, both

01:51:29.290 --> 01:51:34.810
are from both, uh, both was like, uh, you know, happens to

01:51:34.810 --> 01:51:38.210
be our student. And, and that is, uh, that has happened not

01:51:38.210 --> 01:51:42.930
just one time, two times coincidentally, but it was almost a

01:51:42.930 --> 01:51:46.150
regular stuff for me. So same thing, see, there are very few

01:51:46.150 --> 01:51:48.170
people who are exploding and those who are exploding, right?

01:51:48.210 --> 01:51:50.610
So obviously. Obviously somewhere they will like, you know,

01:51:50.670 --> 01:51:57.730
come here and then, uh, build a network, build community as

01:51:57.730 --> 01:52:01.150
much as you can believe me, uh, you won't have to struggle

01:52:01.150 --> 01:52:04.230
in the future. You will be able to get things easily. Yeah.

01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:08.450
Okay. Fine guys. Bye. Take care everyone. See you next

01:52:08.450 --> 01:52:10.670
Saturday. I have given you a task. If you are able to

01:52:10.670 --> 01:52:13.430
complete a task, bring me inside a group that I'm able to

01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:15.290
complete a task. Two things I have given you for a

01:52:15.290 --> 01:52:18.690
modification. If you will not do it anyhow. I'm going to

01:52:18.690 --> 01:52:22.250
bring my code and I'm going to do a modification. But till

01:52:22.250 --> 01:52:26.190
that time digest, digest what I have discussed and what I've

01:52:26.190 --> 01:52:29.810
shared with all of you. Yeah. With that, thank you so much

01:52:29.810 --> 01:52:32.310
everyone. Take care and see you again. Can you start a big

01:52:32.310 --> 01:52:35.890
data course also? So I have, uh, onboarded one of the good

01:52:35.890 --> 01:52:38.990
mentor. His name is Vishal Singh. I think he's, he has

01:52:38.990 --> 01:52:42.270
already started publishing a course. Uh, so Vishal is, uh,

01:52:42.370 --> 01:52:45.770
Vishal was my student, uh, six years back, seven years back,

01:52:45.850 --> 01:52:49.430
uh, in my big data courses. And he's like a regularly doing

01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:52.950
a implementation in a big data. So soon you will be able to

01:52:52.950 --> 01:52:56.930
like, you know, find a courses, uh, in a live mode, maybe by

01:52:56.930 --> 01:52:59.790
December. So we are launching a big data course as well in a

01:52:59.790 --> 01:53:02.910
live mode. And as of now, so I have just asked him to do a

01:53:02.910 --> 01:53:05.710
recording for Databricks and Azure, although I'm doing a

01:53:05.710 --> 01:53:08.370
recording. So in Databricks, I think half of the recording

01:53:08.370 --> 01:53:10.650
is done. It's already uploaded. Even for Azure, half of the

01:53:10.650 --> 01:53:12.690
recording is done and it's uploaded in a dashboard for big

01:53:12.690 --> 01:53:16.590
data. Uh, uh, but yeah. So even I have asked him to create a

01:53:16.590 --> 01:53:19.250
copy of it. He has already started a work, I think two days

01:53:19.250 --> 01:53:23.070
back and, uh, you know, December we have a plan to make an

01:53:23.070 --> 01:53:28.230
announcement about, uh, big data. So those who would like to

01:53:28.230 --> 01:53:30.530
learn big data, Databricks, Azure and all those things,

01:53:30.590 --> 01:53:32.590
maybe you can join those live classes.

01:53:35.490 --> 01:53:38.410
I saw he started uploading video. Yes. Yeah. He has, he has

01:53:38.410 --> 01:53:40.570
started uploading. He's a very good one. Good. He's a very

01:53:40.570 --> 01:53:44.150
good techie. He's like a sound techie. And he was my student

01:53:44.150 --> 01:53:47.590
like a long back. And even he was a part of I need on like,

01:53:47.650 --> 01:53:50.330
uh, uh, he was working over there as an employee, permanent

01:53:50.330 --> 01:53:52.790
employee. So he was on a permanent role. Maybe you can go

01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:54.930
and you can check his profile on LinkedIn. You will be able

01:53:54.930 --> 01:53:59.290
to find all those details. I even, I'm working with, uh,

01:53:59.510 --> 01:54:03.770
okay. That's amazing. Yeah. Okay. Fine. Everyone. So thank

01:54:03.770 --> 01:54:07.490
you kindly. Uh, kindly add a video for system design

01:54:07.490 --> 01:54:10.390
courses. Yeah. Hybrid courses. I'm like, you know,

01:54:10.390 --> 01:54:15.090
struggling a lot because of the work and schedule and many

01:54:15.090 --> 01:54:19.550
things. I'm just trying hard. Anyhow. We have enough for

01:54:19.550 --> 01:54:22.890
like a live courses, live courses will never stop. Even this

01:54:22.890 --> 01:54:25.770
month, you must have seen that, uh, courses is like, uh,

01:54:25.810 --> 01:54:29.690
coming for a full stack automation bootcamp, uh, next month

01:54:29.690 --> 01:54:32.010
also courses will come. So next month, a couple of more

01:54:32.010 --> 01:54:34.610
courses we have planned a couple of courses from a gen AI

01:54:34.610 --> 01:54:38.790
side, a couple of courses from, uh, like a big data, as I've

01:54:38.790 --> 01:54:42.110
said, right. We have a plan of making an announcement. So

01:54:42.110 --> 01:54:46.050
we, yes, live will never stop. Live will never stop. Means

01:54:46.050 --> 01:54:49.590
literally never stop. Uh. I was like a speaking to Ram. I

01:54:49.590 --> 01:54:53.410
was saying that, that, uh, who is taking your DSA class. So

01:54:53.410 --> 01:54:56.730
I was talking to him. I was like, uh, saying that, that in

01:54:56.730 --> 01:55:00.190
December, maybe we can like a plan to launch something in a,

01:55:00.210 --> 01:55:04.190
uh, uh, like a system design site because, uh, he's like,

01:55:04.250 --> 01:55:07.490
uh, he's from Google. So he's very good mentor. He's like a

01:55:07.490 --> 01:55:10.890
very good, genuine mentor. Uh, right. Uh, even in terms of

01:55:10.890 --> 01:55:14.670
discussing a topics and giving explanation and even his

01:55:14.670 --> 01:55:16.850
academy background is very strong. He's from an IT. And

01:55:16.850 --> 01:55:19.510
then, you know, a lot of experience and then now in Google.

01:55:19.850 --> 01:55:22.470
So I was just speaking to him. So he was telling me like,

01:55:22.630 --> 01:55:27.010
uh, okay, uh, let's take a decision after December. And

01:55:27.010 --> 01:55:30.350
apart from that, even I had last week discussion with Ajay,

01:55:30.350 --> 01:55:33.490
Ajay, who is taking like a bio development, uh, uh, lecture

01:55:33.490 --> 01:55:37.450
in Hindi. So we are bringing, uh, bio development in English

01:55:37.450 --> 01:55:41.310
and we are bringing bio development this time with AI, uh,

01:55:41.510 --> 01:55:44.970
in a live mode, uh, that, that, that is also a part of plan.

01:55:44.970 --> 01:55:47.830
So, yeah, a lot of, lot of discussion is going on with many

01:55:47.830 --> 01:55:50.910
mentor. Again, there is a mentor Sachin. So he's like a

01:55:50.910 --> 01:55:56.970
working on, uh, like this one, um, um, a tab loop RBI, uh,

01:55:57.130 --> 01:56:02.190
then, uh, yeah. So then there is a ma'am called a Lakshmi ma

01:56:02.190 --> 01:56:06.150
'am. So she's like taking care of this, uh, junior one, the,

01:56:06.290 --> 01:56:10.910
uh, junior, like, uh, young year on basically the courses,

01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:14.750
which is launching under that. So, yeah. A lot of things. A

01:56:14.750 --> 01:56:16.970
lot of things you will see, uh, so throughout the year you

01:56:16.970 --> 01:56:21.130
will keep on like, uh, getting live classes, some or others

01:56:21.130 --> 01:56:24.530
that's, that's already like a plan. So we'll never stop.

01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:31.640
Yeah. Yeah. Ajay is very good mentor. He's like a literally

01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:33.780
very good mentor, even in terms of, you know, uh, giving

01:56:33.780 --> 01:56:37.340
explanations, he's very good. Uh, Ram is also, Ram is very

01:56:37.340 --> 01:56:41.480
good. Ram is like, uh, he's too mature, uh, experience wise,

01:56:41.580 --> 01:56:45.180
he's having experience, right. Uh, basically he's a best fit

01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:46.360
for, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:49.120
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, you know, when we say that, okay, we are

01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:51.620
going to teach you so that he can do a preparation for fang

01:56:51.620 --> 01:56:55.060
kind of a company, obviously I can't go in. I can claim that

01:56:55.060 --> 01:56:58.580
I never cleared any fang interview. Yeah, I'm good in terms

01:56:58.580 --> 01:57:01.860
of building a product, designing solutions and maybe because

01:57:01.860 --> 01:57:05.300
of aspiration, I never like, uh, you know, admired of like

01:57:05.300 --> 01:57:08.820
joining these companies. I had my own path, right. That is,

01:57:08.820 --> 01:57:11.260
that was one of the reason, but yeah, when we say that,

01:57:11.260 --> 01:57:13.840
that, okay, so you should, uh, we are, we are going to give

01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:17.680
you a preparation on that level. Okay. that kind of a mentor

01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:20.860
is required right so ram is that kind of a mentor when we

01:57:20.860 --> 01:57:23.640
say uh we are going to teach you everything in practical so

01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:26.420
obviously you need a mentor who understands those like a

01:57:26.420 --> 01:57:29.660
practicality in real not just like you know come to the

01:57:29.660 --> 01:57:32.900
class and discuss something basic and then go from there so

01:57:32.900 --> 01:57:35.520
yeah we are we are like uh you know bringing those kind of

01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:39.060
mentors even dhruv right so dhruv is your batchmate and he

01:57:39.060 --> 01:57:42.720
is already available here in your chat even now so he has

01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:45.260
shown his skill right he has already shown his skill he has

01:57:45.260 --> 01:57:48.640
already proven his skill and we are launching a batch full

01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:51.240
stack automation and we are saying that this is for no coder

01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:54.820
obviously if you check dhruv profile he is from no coding

01:57:54.820 --> 01:57:57.760
background he is learning coding now basically he is coming

01:57:57.760 --> 01:58:00.100
from a sales background he has worked in multiple companies

01:58:00.100 --> 01:58:03.740
he has done a lot of automation by using this no code tool

01:58:03.740 --> 01:58:08.360
then only i'm i'm considering him to like you know eligible

01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:11.740
for taking this particular batch right this particular batch

01:58:11.740 --> 01:58:15.520
so this is like how i do a selection so obviously if i'm

01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:18.840
launching some of the syllabus uh a person who is going to

01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:23.280
take it although it's it's even it was going to me i must

01:58:23.280 --> 01:58:27.660
fit for the flavor so if i'm saying that it's for no coder

01:58:27.660 --> 01:58:30.420
so obviously because then only person can come and you know

01:58:30.420 --> 01:58:33.540
they can talk about their story right that okay this is how

01:58:33.540 --> 01:58:37.620
i have worked uh because a person will be like you know uh

01:58:37.620 --> 01:58:41.000
some different background or maybe he's not having or she's

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:44.120
not having the same story students will not be able to

01:58:44.120 --> 01:58:48.480
connect you as a learner will connect so that's the reason i

01:58:48.480 --> 01:58:51.180
have finalized this one for dhruv it will be amazing so

01:58:51.180 --> 01:58:53.380
dhruv is going to give you amazing discussion with respect

01:58:53.380 --> 01:58:57.300
to n8n and automation uh right i'm going to supervise each

01:58:57.300 --> 01:58:59.980
and every lecture as i do for all the other lectures i keep

01:58:59.980 --> 01:59:03.080
on looking into every mentor's lecture that what they have

01:59:03.080 --> 01:59:07.820
delivered uh what was a gap and in all the groups i am

01:59:07.820 --> 01:59:11.240
already available and i will be available so just join like

01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:15.800
join do an automation as much as you can and believe me that

01:59:15.800 --> 01:59:16.180
is going to be a lot of fun and i will see you in the next

02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:21.320
taking lecture

02:00:47.100 --> 02:00:50.780
our own classes yeah but don't sell I don't know I'm

02:00:50.780 --> 02:00:57.660
building for like a lifetime I have done enough so every one

02:00:57.660 --> 02:01:00.080
has his own interest right so you complete your interest one

02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:03.900
by one there is one more interest that something should be

02:01:03.900 --> 02:01:08.020
made which should run for maybe like a next 20 or 30 years

02:01:08.020 --> 02:01:13.580
or even after me so this time I am on that journey I'm

02:01:13.580 --> 02:01:15.960
building something so which will go for a very very very

02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:19.600
very long time even after me last time obviously every time

02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:21.800
like objective will be different right because you are

02:01:21.800 --> 02:01:25.480
coming from a different background and you set objective you

02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:28.680
achieve it then you move on then you set the next one so

02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:31.660
this is how life works this is how I advise to everyone that

02:01:31.660 --> 02:01:37.060
set objective complete move on right I do the same I follow

02:01:37.060 --> 02:01:42.160
the same so from India will you know I don't know what will

02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:45.840
be from what but yeah I have a very very long term target

02:01:45.840 --> 02:01:48.200
for like a year on as

02:01:50.700 --> 02:01:54.220
long as the agent which can say try to and can take batches

02:01:54.220 --> 02:01:59.300
I will that would be possible okay fine guys take care we

02:01:59.300 --> 02:02:02.120
have done enough of like a quality discussion a good

02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:04.400
