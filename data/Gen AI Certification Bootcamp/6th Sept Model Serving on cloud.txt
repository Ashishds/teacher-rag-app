WEBVTT

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.670
Okay, so hi everyone, good morning and I believe I am

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.110
audible and visible to all of you. Yeah, so good morning,

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.390
good morning everyone, good morning.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.820
Hope you are enjoying your weekends, obviously with me.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.860
Okay, so we are going to start in like 2-3 minutes of time.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.460
So that all of us can join and then we can start with the

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.000
class. Again, today's class is going to be interesting for

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.520
all of you.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.320
Good morning, so AI and ML will start. Yes, we have already

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.740
made an announcement about AI and ML. So obviously it is

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.880
going to start from 27th of September. So this month itself,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.400
I am going to start with the AI and ML. And even before

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.840
that, so next week, next weekend, I believe on Sunday. So we

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.180
are going to start with the Python with BSA. So again, I am

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.660
not taking that class, by the way. I will be available in an

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.800
induction session. Ramendra is going to take that class. So

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.000
what's

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.080
the topic for this weekend, sir? We will talk about it. So

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.940
in like next couple of minutes, what is the duration of AI

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.280
and ML masters? Okay, let me discuss that as well. Yeah, so

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.040
please data engineering bootcamp too. I can do it, but only

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.640
consider this timing, basically like. Related happy

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.560
teacher's day, thank you so much.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.670
So please update hybrid batch, how long it will take? Yeah,

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.070
just trying very, very hard to, you know, there are so many

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.830
batches. There was 20 batches out of that five, I have

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.330
already closed means 100% closed. And out of this 15, I

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.410
believe for 10 batches approximately. So I'm, I was able to

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.670
update some, like not some, like lot of like lectures, still

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.170
trying hard to complete all this 15. Hopefully like it will

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.450
be completed in a month of time.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.190
You look great. Had your coffee. Yeah, I had my breakfast. I

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.110
had my coffee. So I used to wake up at like a. Seven, six or

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.470
seven a.m. So I used to get enough time for me in the

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.290
morning. Okay, so it's nine or six. So we start, guys,

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.850
everyone.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.650
Yeah. Okay, so let me set an agenda for this particular

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.130
weekend. So today and tomorrow, what we are going to

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.750
discuss, let me set that out. So last week I was talking

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.750
about RIG and with respect to an RIG. So we were talking

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.950
about one of the application, this medical chat bot

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.070
application that we have discussed. And again, so that was a

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.710
generic application where you can try to, you know, upload

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.890
any kind of a document. It's not restricted towards just a

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.110
medical. So whether you are working in a legal or maybe a

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.190
finance, maybe as a HR or maybe as a medical assistant. So

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.230
you can upload all of those documents and then you will be

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.610
able to chat with those documents. And that is something

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.910
that we have discussed in my previous previous class last

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.790
Sunday's lecture. Right. And we all were able to like

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.390
execute it. We were able to execute it in our local system

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:55.810
now. So the agenda is that that how we can try to like

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.530
convert this entire system, the system that we have already

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.710
used or system that we have seen into a real time

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.230
application. Because yes, that system was good. It was

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:13.250
working well in our local system and where we have used some

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.310
embedding models where we have used some of the elements. So

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.290
from URI. Obviously, and some embedding model we have used

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.510
from a hugging place right now, if I have to make that

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.990
application real, if I have to make that application

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.150
production ready. So obviously I have to add a couple of

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.010
more steps into it or a couple of more services or a couple

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:39.970
of more features into it so that all of us will be able to

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.470
use it. And in a real time to solve any kind of a problem.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.930
Not just that. So we all will be able to write down. Those.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.710
That particular project in our resume, right in our resume.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.730
Now what should be the step and what should be the major

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:57.130
step. So feature wise, we can try to add hundreds of

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.910
features. That's completely fine. But the core component,

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.230
right? The core component was a model. So embedding models

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.330
we have used and obviously our elements we have used. So

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.170
whenever you are going to join a company or whenever you

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.910
will be working in such kind of a project, the very first

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:18.390
requirement will be to host a model. Whether it is a

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.010
project. Whether it's an embedding model or whether it's a

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:24.210
LLM that you are trying to do, try to use for a streaming or

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:28.230
maybe for a chat completion in your own environment. That

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.330
will be the very first requirement. Maybe the second

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.610
requirement is to attach some sort of a notification

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.370
services. For example, like a mail, right? So let's suppose

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:40.830
if I'm like trying to search something with respect to a

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:45.230
particular user and if I have to send a mail notification to

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.090
a particular user saying that that, okay, fine. This was a

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:51.330
diagnosis. This was an analysis. And then like you have to

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.110
take this particular steps or maybe if you would like to

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:57.210
prescribe something to your customer in, in case of

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.810
Medichat, but in case of a legal, again, same thing will

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.530
happen in case of a finance, same thing is going to happen.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.110
So we can try to attach a notification services,

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.010
notification service wise, obviously a mail service and

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:10.710
maybe a WhatsApp service, right? These kinds of services

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:14.330
that we all will be able to attach. And then obviously third

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.030
layer is going to be, uh, like, uh, make it available.

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:20.330
Publicly to everyone, right? Make it available publicly to

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:24.410
everyone. So if we are going to attach all of these things,

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:28.910
my application will be real time. And obviously anyone and

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.490
everyone in this entire world will be able to use it. My

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.630
application will be secured. My application will be

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:39.970
independent of any LMS or any embedding out there, right?

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:44.650
And obviously I will be able to notify my user as per my

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:48.370
need, uh, inside an application. So we get the same kind of

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:53.230
So in this way you will end up saving a lot of hours, a man

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:57.090
hours, basically, those who are using that particular chat,

00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:00.550
a support system. Uh, maybe you can try to attach even a

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:03.790
ticketing system into it. Right. Uh, ticketing system into

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:06.570
it. So there are so many things, right? There are so many

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:10.210
things around it. You all will be able to add and evil, we

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.830
are able to add it successfully. Then it will become a

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:16.530
product and happily you all will be able to use it. maybe

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:21.750
from a next week onwards inside your organization or like I

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:24.510
said so you can try to like write it down even inside your

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.970
resume directly because that will be a real-time project

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:32.270
right that will be a real-time project and again so we have

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:36.050
seen that we were adding a document so when we were trying

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:39.490
to load a chat what we can do is that that we can try to

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:44.370
keep our document in some S3 bucket so inside a AWS there is

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.730
a storage services that they used to provide called as S3

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:51.350
bucket or if I'm talking about Azure so in that case inside

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:55.170
a blob storage or maybe a data like Gen2 I can try to keep

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.710
all of my documents whatever company document whatever

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:01.250
medical report that I have and then chatbot system will

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.530
automatically fetch each and everything from there itself

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.970
means after doing a vectorization after like creating such

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:11.570
kind of embeddings and yeah another layer is that that if we

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:14.910
can try to remove a Facebook AI similarity search and we can

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:19.350
try to add some of the managed vector DB right managed

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.690
vector DB along with that many people have asked me a

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:27.010
question last time that how I will be able to vectorize you

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:31.930
know a structured data a tabular data format so maybe we can

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:34.970
try to add couple of like a more layer even with respect to

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:36.930
a structure so there are there are so many application right

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.250
so many application and so many things I'm talking about all

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:43.250
together so let's write it down one by one and a couple of

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:47.070
future will try to add not all the feature because we have

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.330
just started right so we have to build so many application

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.250
not just this application so obviously we will keep on

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.490
adding all of these feature in a sequential manner yeah find

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:56.950
guys according

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.770
to course content RG is listed after a model fine tuning

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:12.590
will RG covered see I'm talking about even in my previous

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:15.490
class when I started this application after a vector

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.850
database discussion so I have simply said that that the The

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:21.830
RAG which is mentioned inside your syllabus and if you will

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:25.650
go and read it out, right? It's an agentic RAG. Have we

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:30.610
discussed about agents? I don't think so, right? Actually,

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:34.450
we talked about a vector database and we are trying to use

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:37.930
that vector database into one of the application, a

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:40.410
practical application. And this is where I am talking about

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:43.870
this RAG. So again, that RAG and that's the reason why I

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:47.570
have named it as a vanilla RAG, right? RAG without any kind

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:51.770
of agents. Basically, so when that particular portion will

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:54.530
come, so what we will do, we'll try to attach one more layer

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:58.730
in this kind of application as an agentic one. Once we will

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:00.930
be having a discussion on an agentic, that's the reason why

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:05.490
I have kept that RAG portion after having a lot of agentic

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:09.390
discussions, right? So right after your vector database, you

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.430
will be able to find out AI agent discussion, which I have

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:17.410
not even started, by the way. Yes. Yeah. And please try to

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:21.110
join all the classes. Because I think I have already

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:25.450
clarified things in the past. Do you think graph DB has a

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:28.050
more value than vector DB? No, graph DB is having a

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:30.070
different use cases. Vector DB is having a different use

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:32.470
cases. Fine, guys. So let me share my screen. Let's start

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:34.730
with the discussion. I believe my screen is visible, right,

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:36.830
guys? Everyone? Yeah. If you can confirm.

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:53.120
Yeah. Okay. So, like I said, so whenever we are trying to

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.940
build any kind of application, okay. Before that, so many

00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:01.740
people was asking about new batch announcements. Let me take

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:05.140
just two minutes of your time to talk about this one. Just

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:10.180
two minutes. And then happily, I can start with my regular

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:15.780
lecture. Yeah. So now inside this live batches, this week, I

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.960
have made an announcement for AI ML masters, basically. So

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.640
those who are completely new, those who are coming from a

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.820
non-tech background, those who are in colleges, those who

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.380
are... Maybe first, second, third, fourth year, maybe a

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:32.220
dropout, maybe they are doing their masters, means a person,

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:37.340
a people who are not at all aware about data science or AI

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:40.420
or machine learning or whatsoever, right? Maybe not even a

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.980
programming. So basically, this batch has been designed for

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:47.400
that kind of a people. So where I'm going to start a

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.180
discussion without any kind of a prerequisite, because for

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:53.140
your batch, a prerequisite was basically a Python, right?

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.700
That was a prerequisite which I have given for your... This

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:57.960
particular batch, generative AI certification bootcamp

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.920
batch. But for this particular batch, there is no such

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.720
prerequisite at all. I'm going to start from a Python. Then

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.740
I'll be moving into a statistics or calculus or algebra as

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:13.360
per the syllabus. And then I will start talking about a

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.340
machine learning algorithm, one by one, one by one, one by

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.320
one, even time series I have added over here with respect to

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.980
Arima and Arma and Facebook profit library. And then I'm

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:26.080
talking about a little bit of a neural network. Not in

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.100
depth, but yeah, a little bit of a neural network I'm

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.980
talking about in this one. And then I'm talking about a

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.580
machine learning ops, basically ML ops, so that we can try

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.780
to make use of it. And then finally, we will be able to

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.380
build two projects. So here I have mentioned two projects

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.780
and then all the underlying technology inside this project.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.720
So the highlighted one is one project. And then this is the

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.080
second number project, right? So where I'm using a lot of

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.620
technology, even some of the technology I'm using from a

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.620
generative AI stack. Some of the technology I'm using from a

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:58.340
generative AI stack. So many things, so many things I have

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.960
included because now, and again, like email notification,

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.440
WhatsApp notification, chat input, support ticket, so many

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.220
things, right? Because now this kind of projects are pretty

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.000
much important. So where we try to use a multiple

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.820
technology, a multiple stacks altogether, and we build a

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.740
massive project. That's the reason I have mentioned only two

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.940
projects. But yeah, if you will look into the stacks, it's a

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:23.100
huge number of stacks in both of this project, which I'm

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.580
using and which is in a real time, right? People are using

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:28.040
it. People are using even to build any kind of application

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.820
with respect to AI and data science. So this is basically

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:39.200
going to be like going to be for someone who is completely

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.560
new. And I was trying to align the syllabus even with

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.360
respect to a syllabus, which is running inside our colleges.

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:49.080
So in our colleges, there are so many like AI ML, which is

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.440
going on. There are so many like a data science stack, a

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.420
different kind of a data science stack or data science

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:55.820
streams. So there are a lot of things that are going on in

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.460
our colleges, which is going on in our And I have received

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.800
some requirement from some of my students. So who are still

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.980
in college, maybe in first year, second year, third year or

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:07.940
fourth year, maybe doing a BSc or BCA or maybe a MCA and

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.500
keeping that in our mind. So I have aligned this entire

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.720
syllabus so that they will be able to pass their exams and

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:17.560
not just that, right? Because passing an exam was not my

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.920
things, by the way. So they will be able to build something

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:26.520
on their own from a very, very scratch. So if some of you

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.640
are looking for this one, maybe you can, you can join this

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.340
particular batch and with your own plus, I think we all know

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.880
the game, right? With your own plus, all of these things are

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:37.360
by default available to all of us and hope all of you are

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:42.560
going to like it. Uh, please make this chat only visible to

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:46.900
you. Okay, fine. Let me do that so that I think it's fine.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.260
We all can discuss together and when, when I'll share some

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.500
of the code, right, then I'll make it visible only to me. So

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:57.760
that it will not disturb you. Yeah. When is our DSA live

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.260
class starting? Okay. So DSA live class is going to start

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.320
from next weekend. So 14 September is going to be the

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:07.740
inauguration day for this one. Uh, like I said, so Ramendra

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.360
who is going to join Google and he's a very experienced

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:14.060
mentor as well as like a techie. Uh, so he is going to take

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.740
this class. I will be available just in our induction

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:19.380
session and then I'll hand over this class to Ramendra.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.460
Ramendra is going to like continue with the entire syllabus.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:26.060
DSA. DSA with Python bootcamp. So next weekend, 14

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:30.360
September, it is going to start. Yeah. 4 PM IST to 7 PM IST.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:35.800
Okay. Uh, three hour session. So yeah, once live classes

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.880
plus doubt clearing, like we, we never restrict ourselves,

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.000
uh, towards an hour. So hours are just a number that we have

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.260
mentioned. So as long as it takes, I think we all know that

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.780
we are taking a doubt clearing, whether it's taking four

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:50.620
hour or maybe more than four hour, we are still here and we

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.920
used to discuss the doubt. So same thing is going to happen

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:53.780
in all the back. So it's going to happen in all the batches.

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:03.170
Okay. Now, uh, let's just start discussing this, uh, uh,

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:06.950
topic for today. So like I said, guys, uh, whenever you're

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:11.530
trying to build a real time RIG system, right? So real time

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:12.150
RIG system.

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:26.930
So the feature that we can try to add over here, the very

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:28.870
first feature hosting

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.640
our own

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.770
LLM for chat completion.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:54.060
Slash embedding, right? Because so far we have been using

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:57.980
URI for our chat completion and then we were trying to use

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:01.800
some model from a URI or some model from a hugging faces for

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:05.900
doing embeddings. But in reality, whenever you will try to

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.580
build this application for your client or for your company,

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:12.580
so they will never suggest you, or they will never accept

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:17.340
that you are going to use some of the APIs or some of the

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.280
third parties. System where you are sending your data

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:24.080
because it's not acceptable for anyone in this entire world

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:28.660
and especially in a world of AI. So where you are not sure

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.800
that where your data will be used by the way. So here

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.540
hosting our own limbs for a chat completion and embeddings.

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:39.960
Now second thing is notification services, notification

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.380
service.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.740
So let's suppose if I'm trying to build a system and if I

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.840
would like to notify my users or maybe my stakeholders. So

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.580
obviously I have to add, and again, this can be added in a

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:57.180
hundred different, different way. But let's take a very

00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:00.240
simple example over here that I'm chatting with my chat

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.820
system and let's suppose if I'm able to draw some sort of a

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:07.340
conclusion and if I would like to send that conclusion to my

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:10.880
user, to our respective user, maybe XYG user just while

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:16.880
doing a chat. So I can try to send maybe a mail email or

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:21.040
maybe I can try to send a SMS, maybe I can try to send up.

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:24.800
WhatsApp messages because in every real time system you will

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.140
be able to find out a notification services and again, these

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:31.860
services are not difficult to integrate just for once in a

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.780
lifetime you have to integrate it and then it will be done.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.360
But I'm talking about a product approach, whatever product

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.320
that you are going to build, obviously you will have to add

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:43.600
a notification service into this one. Then you can say that,

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:47.080
that yes, uh, like your entire application is like a

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.060
production ready. Then third. Obviously. So obviously

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.920
hosting over a public cloud,

00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:04.580
hosting over public cloud. So where I can try to use Azure,

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:09.420
AWS or maybe a GCP. So that will be a need of every

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:17.300
application or maybe a GCP or maybe XYG, any other services.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:20.560
There are so many cloud services, cloud provider, right? And

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.320
again, so we will keep on doing a refinement with respect to

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.820
our hosting. So again, uh, generally we think that, that,

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.700
okay, we have a Streamlit application. So let's go ahead and

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.700
try to host it on a Streamlit cloud, or maybe we can try to

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:34.340
use some of the services from just a single services from

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:38.480
Azure or AWS or GCP. And let's try to host it. But believe

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:42.860
me in reality things never works in that way. Uh, I'll, I'll

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.380
try to show you that kind of application. So when I'll try

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.300
to show you a URI project, so because it's a massive project

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:51.600
and where we have a separate front end, separate backend, we

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.480
have a separate middle layers. And again. We have to manage

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.080
a lot of like a things in between, and we have to even add

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.960
our domain. We have to even our map, our DNS, basically we

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:05.520
have to even do, uh, add a catching over there. We have to

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:10.380
even handle a memory over there. So when I say hosting, it's

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:15.020
a big thing in itself, but yes, once you are able to do this

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:18.820
kind of a production grade hosting, I think whatever

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:22.120
application that you will be building throughout your life,

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.560
you will be able to do that. And again, when I talk about

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.540
hosting, so obviously we have to move through a CI CD kind

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:32.300
of a pipeline or maybe a blue green kind of a blue green

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:36.240
line of a deployment where we try to create a dev system. We

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.780
try to create a test system. We try to create a production

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:43.140
system or maybe a pre prod system. And then my entire code

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:47.220
base or my entire application will flow through this dev to

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:52.040
test to pre prod to prod. So when I say hosting, like I

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.940
said, so it's not just. I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:54.140
not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:57.700
not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:05.480
not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.340
not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:08.180
not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:10.480
not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.720
not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:12.640
not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.240
not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.940
not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.980
not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:22.360
not

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.880
saying I'm not saying Fourth like a fourth thing which I can

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:34.880
try to add it inside this one, vector DB for

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:41.770
structured

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:48.780
data. Structured data means the data which is available in a

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:52.800
table format, a data for which I already have a schema. So

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.540
we have already talked about a lot with respect to

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:58.800
unstructured data. Again there can be lot that we can do

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:02.220
inside unstructured data but yeah. So there is a concept

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.740
which exists in this world so where you will be able to

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:08.700
vectorize a structured data and again philosophically it's a

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:12.640
multi like a way by which you will be able to achieve the

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:16.040
same thing that we will discuss inside the class. So

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:19.840
vectorizing a DB for a structured data. So now if we can try

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:24.640
to add all of these services and again yeah. So fifth number

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.560
is

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.360
storing or mapping.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:33.940
Mapping

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:43.760
document to cloud platform is three or the kind of a

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.080
document that we are trying to upload from the local. So

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.180
maybe we can try to host it over the cloud platform. So

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:53.860
maybe inside the S3 bucket, maybe inside the Azure blog or

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:57.120
maybe in some XYG different kind of a services, storage

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.980
services we can try to use. So where we can try to keep all

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:03.900
of our data set. So if we are able to add all of these

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:07.740
layers one by one, one by one, one by one. We can say that

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:12.040
that yes, my application is near to real time and you all

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:15.300
will be able to write down this entire project proudly

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:19.940
inside your resume. So this is the agenda. This is going to

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:24.140
be the agenda for this particular week. Is it making sense

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:28.240
guys? Auth services again, yes, you can try to add auth

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:32.160
services. We will try to add it inside a URI project, not in

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:37.020
this one. Like I said, so we will learn a lot. Uh. Inside

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:40.180
the class, uh, in a single project, it's very difficult. And

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.460
again, if I'll start talking about these things inside the

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:47.460
single project, you will feel confused. Yeah. So there can

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:50.480
be like a multiple things that can be added. So fine. What

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:54.140
we can do is that, that we can try to execute it one by one.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.900
We can try to learn one by one. So first of all, we can try

00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:01.180
to learn that how I will be able to host our own LLMs for a

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:04.100
chat completion, maybe for a streaming or maybe for

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:07.360
embeddings. This is a one time game. So if you are able to

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.980
do it once in a life, you will be able to do it in a number

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:13.880
of times. And again, the project going forward that we are

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.940
going to discuss or any application, even the agents, right?

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.920
Uh, so let's suppose from next week onwards, I'm going to

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:24.300
start your chapter with respect to agents. Agents are not

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:28.380
going to work without LLMs. And when you will try to build,

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:31.520
when you will try to develop these agents inside a company

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:36.700
or maybe for your client. So obviously. Client. Will ask you

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:41.660
that, uh, can you please try to use, uh, this LLMs model or

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:45.240
maybe any models which has been consumed by LLMs or agents

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:50.040
in my own environment because they don't trust any platform

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:53.200
out there. So they will, they will, they will just ask you

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:56.120
and it's a things that we try to follow everywhere inside

00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:01.280
the industry. So fine guys. Uh, first we'll try to do this,

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.240
then we'll try to do this one by one, one by one, one by

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:08.220
one. And then we will try to add all of these things inside

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:12.520
our project that we have discussed a midi chat bot pro

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:15.100
itself. So all of these things are going to be a part of

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:20.260
same project that we have already started. Fine. Yeah. Okay.

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:28.750
So now shall we start guys? Everyone. Yes. Okay. Not clear.

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:32.890
Hosting our own LLMs means. Okay. Uh, I don't know why it's

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:35.730
not clear because I talked about this multiple times, not

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:39.650
just one time. So which LLM you are using by the way so far.

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:44.070
So you are using LLM from URI, right? You are trying to use

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:47.610
those like a open AI model, Gemini model, or maybe a Mistral

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:51.630
model, maybe a deep seek model from URI, or maybe you will

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:54.870
go out there and you can try to use a services like a group,

00:27:55.090 --> 00:28:00.550
or maybe you can try to, uh, uh, use, uh, APIs from a open

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:04.450
AI, maybe from a cloud, a sonnet cloud, cloud, a sonnet

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:06.930
model. You can try to use or any other model, right? We have

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:10.050
so many providers for our LLMs and you can just go ahead,

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:12.710
you can create an account and then you can start using their

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:17.410
API just the way you are trying to use a URI API. But for

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:21.250
most of the clients, it's not going to be acceptable because

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:25.650
of a data breach or because of the data security policies

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:31.290
now. So what we can do, so we can try to host because most

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:35.550
of these LLMs are open sourced. Even recently, uh, open AI

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:38.870
have open source. Their model. So OSS 20 billion parameter

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:43.170
model and OSS 120 billion parameter model. So which I can

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:47.550
try to host it in my own environment. I get even try to fine

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:51.350
tune those models, right? I can even try to fine tune those

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:55.950
models on top of my own data set and I can try to host it

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:58.710
again in my environment and then I can try to use it. So

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:01.970
this is where hosting comes into a picture and again, it's

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:05.990
an integrated part of any modern day AI application that you

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:07.930
are going to use. You are going to build, you will have to

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:11.910
host your model in your own environment. And obviously if

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:14.370
I'm doing a fine tuning, right, fine tuning is also a

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:17.030
chapter. If you will go through your syllabus inside this,

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:20.770
uh, entire curriculum inside the curriculum of generative

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:23.850
with certification bootcamp. So when you are going to train

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:27.070
your own model with your own data set, technically we don't

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:29.530
train it from the scratch because of the compute and the

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:32.750
resource availability. So we try to do a fine tuning, maybe

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:36.790
a Laura and maybe a Cora fine tuning we try to do, a

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:38.970
parametric efficient fine tuning or maybe a quantized

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:41.930
parametric efficient fine tuning we try to do. So obviously,

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:45.910
uh, you have to host a model after doing a fine tuning. So

00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:48.910
you have to host a model in your own environment and then

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:52.730
only you will be able to basically use all of these model,

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:57.610
right? So let's start, let's start hosting our model. So can

00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:00.750
you please reiterate the RAG and LLMs if possible and now

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:03.110
Prabhakar, I think it's won't be possible because since last

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:05.610
three classes I'm talking about RAG, so please look into the

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:08.530
lectures. And in case of any doubts, yeah. So you can feel

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:10.950
free to ask me a doubt inside a doubt clearing because

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:14.010
reiterating everything every time it's literally not

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:19.610
possible because it will kill a time for many of us now.

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:25.500
So if you have to host a model, so obviously I need an

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.340
environment, right? I need an environment. I need a GPU

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.840
environment. So unless and until I don't have a GPU

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:34.460
environment, my inferencing will be very, very slow.

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:37.620
Inferencing means the way model is going to give a response.

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:41.180
It's going to be very, very slow based on my inputs and

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:44.580
there are so many GPU provider you will be able to find out

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:48.320
in this entire world, right? So many, not just one, not just

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.240
two, but he has so many GPU provider. You will be able to

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:54.640
get it in this entire world. There is something called as a

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:57.680
run pod.io. There is something called as Lambda lab. There

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:00.440
is something called as a famous one paper space. By the way,

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.820
there is something called as Nibus. There is something

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:06.840
called as vast AI Genesis cloud vulture. So many, right? So

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:09.960
many. and again. I mean, even on AWS Azure and GCP, you will

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:14.080
be able to get a GPUs at the end of the day. I need a GPU.

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:18.440
That's it. I need a GPU. So if I will be able to get a GPU

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:22.460
over a cloud platform, I can try to host my model. Any open

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:25.020
source model, you will not be able to host any proprietary

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:27.960
model. But yes, nowadays we are living in an era where

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:32.140
everyone has released some of their best open source models,

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:34.940
right? So some of them, they have already made an open

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.480
source models, their best one as an open source model. They

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:41.520
have already made it, including open AI, I would say, which

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:44.860
has been done like recently. So there are so many platforms

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:49.500
out there we can try to use and we can try to host our model

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.700
and I just need a GPU. Apart from that, I don't need

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:56.220
anything literally, right? Anything. So let's go ahead and

00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:00.020
let's try to complete task number one and then we'll see how

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:03.620
we can try to expose that model as an API because even

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:06.920
inside our RIG application, right, the application. Maybe

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.960
chat about pro that we have built in my last class. So we

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:13.600
were trying to consume API, right, a URI API and via URI

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:18.220
API, we were trying to hit our models. If we are able to

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:22.520
host our own model, if we are able to expose our own model

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:26.400
as an API, I can consume it, right? So I just have to

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:31.160
replace my URI with my own hosting or whatever model which I

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:34.160
have hosted. So I just have to convert it in that way. So

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:37.380
this is something that we are going to do. Not just for a

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:40.080
chat completion. So I will show you for a chat completion

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:43.360
and then you will be able to host any models means literally

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.260
anymore. There are millions of model which is available

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:47.760
every day. Some people are trying to build some of the

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:51.260
models so you will be able to host literally any models

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:54.540
means any model. So this is a kind of approach I'm going to

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:59.220
show you with respect to a real time GPU. Now where we will

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.980
be able to get a GPU, like I said, there are so many

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:06.240
platforms out there which is providing you a GPU. Now. So

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:10.780
I'm going to use one of these platforms, GPU provider by the

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:15.200
way called as HyperStack cloud. So there is a platform

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:19.860
called as HyperStack studio and I will try to use a GPU from

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:23.320
this HyperStack. It's very, very easy to use by the way plus

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:28.420
costing wise within $2, $3 I will be able to do a testing.

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:31.660
It is not going to take much because per hour I think their

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:35.380
charges are 1 point some dollars and which will be like a

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:38.380
pretty much convenient. For me and that too for each 100

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:43.420
kind of a GPU with the 80 GB of a ram. So HyperStack cloud

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:47.400
is one of the platform, but this is not just one of the

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:50.320
platform. Like I said, there are hundreds of other platforms

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:54.000
which is available and you can use any of these platform,

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.400
right? You can use any of these platform is literally any of

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.760
these platform. Like I said, there is something called as if

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:04.020
I'll go to Google, there is something called as run pod.io.

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.520
So there is something called as run pod.io. This is again

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:10.200
one of the platform. There is something called as I would

00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:14.800
say paper space. So paper space I have been using since a

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.940
very, very long time. Like I think since last like a four to

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:20.960
five year I have been using when I used to teach even a like

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.760
a computer vision and when I have to train a real time model

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:26.580
and when I have to showcase how to train a real time model.

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:30.720
So I've been using like this paper space so many times, so

00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:34.320
many times basically, right? And even my team was using a

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:37.480
lot. So run pod.io. Run pod.io is one of the platform like a

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:40.320
paper space is one of the platform which has been acquired

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:43.360
by a distal ocean. There is something called as Nibus, there

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.600
is something called as vast AI, there is something called a

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:47.760
Genesis cloud, there is something called as Vulture, there

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:52.040
is something called as G core. So these platforms are

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.280
basically going to provide you just a GPU and then whatever

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:58.920
you would like to do with the GPU, just do it right. In my

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.500
case, obviously I have to host my model, I have to expose my

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:05.040
model as an API so that I can replace a URI. And then I can

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.760
try to use my CPU. So this is a self hosted model. I can try

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.760
to use any of this GPU platform. So they are just giving you

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:13.880
a system, they're just giving you a machine. That's it. So

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:16.720
if you are able to host it with one platform, you will be

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.920
able to host it with all the other hundred platform as well

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:22.780
in the exact same way. Your code, your command is not going

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:25.980
to change at all. At all means literally at all. Even if you

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:29.440
are going to use a GPU from Azure, AWS or GCP, it is not

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:32.080
going to change because at the end of the day, all of them

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:36.440
are giving you a machine. That's it, right? A machine which

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:41.080
has been provided by Nvidia by the way. So is it Google

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:45.440
collab is enough? Not at all. Google collab is just for

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:49.660
like, you know, doing initial experimentation in reality, in

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:52.620
real time, you can't use a Google collab. So for learning

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:57.120
purposes you can use it, but I mean like Google collab gives

00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:00.440
you a very limited resources which you can't use by the way.

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:04.180
So you have to use in real time. This is something which has

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:08.320
been used. Okay. Now, so HyperStack cloud, so let me go and

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:15.070
let me like a login inside this HyperStack cloud. Yeah. I

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:17.130
have already pinged you HyperStack cloud guys. So you can

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:19.130
try to explore, you can try to log in inside this one.

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:28.370
So I'll show you how to create a GPU, how to create access

00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:31.210
for that particular GPU, how you will be able to access it

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:34.570
from your local machine, like the GPU which is available

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:36.770
over some cloud platform. All of these things I'm going to

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:38.710
show you in a practical manner now itself.

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:45.560
What happened? Why it is taking time? Okay. So yeah, this is

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:49.060
how this entire interface of this HyperStack cloud looks

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:52.940
like by the way. And obviously you have to add a couple of

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:56.800
dollars over here. So I have already added a $90 I had added

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.080
actually a hundred dollars. So I have already used my $10

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:02.300
over here. So you have to add a couple of dollars inside

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:06.240
this HyperStack cloud and this is how, because I just want

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:10.460
you to know the reality. So that, and again, so maybe if you

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:13.060
are not able to add it or maybe if you're not able to do it.

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.620
If you want to attend this particular lecture, you can just

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:19.340
try to observe that how things happens. But yes, in reality

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:22.660
today, tomorrow, maybe like after a couple of months, if you

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:25.420
are going to build some real product, you have to use such

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:28.180
kind of a system. By the way, without this kind of a system,

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:30.780
you will not be able to move forward. You will not be able

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:34.380
to build any kind of a real time product, right? Maybe you

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:36.960
can, you will end up building maybe some dummy product, but

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:40.260
yeah, not a real time. So real time requires a real time

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:44.140
system as well. Making sense? Selvi, go ahead guys.

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:52.950
Yes. Okay. So HyperStack cloud, you can try to add a couple

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:55.630
of dollars if you want. If you don't want, it's completely

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:58.270
fine. It's completely okay. My responsibility is to show you

00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:00.890
the reality. So I will be showing you the reality and

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:03.250
whenever you will get time, whenever you have like a

00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:06.570
interest to do the same thing, you can do it just by

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:11.010
watching this entire lecture. Fine. Okay. Is there some free

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:13.170
credit? I don't think that they provide you a free credit.

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:16.570
Maybe you can check once you are going to log in. So they

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:19.430
will try to show you. Your credit over here, but I'm not

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:22.170
sure that they are providing a free credit as of now. Yeah.

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:25.750
Okay. So now once you will come over here, there is an

00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:28.510
option called as virtual machine. So just try to click on

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:31.070
this virtual machine by the way guys. Yeah. Virtual machine.

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:35.410
And then you will be able to see an option called as deploy

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:38.210
a new virtual machine. So click on deploy a new virtual

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:40.670
machine and then they are going to show you a multiple

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:45.670
machines type over here. Right? So CPU only. And then A100.

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:51.730
ATG. PCI. A100. ATG. PCI. NVLinks. Lot of different,

00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:53.590
different, different, different kind of a machine that they

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:56.730
are going to show you. Now, which machine I'm going to use.

00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:59.550
So I'm going to use our cheapest one out of this one. Right.

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:02.710
And you will be able to see even a cost for these machines.

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:07.610
So $1.52 per hour. This is one of the cheapest one. They're

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:11.550
giving me H100. One H100. Let's suppose if I would like to

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:15.150
use eight H100 together, I can use it. So they're giving you

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:18.230
a managed Kubernetes layer on top of this one. So that you

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:21.810
will be able to commence any number of our GPUs because when

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:24.990
we are doing a real time training, right, when we are doing

00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:28.470
a real time training, I need hundreds, not, not hundreds. I

00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:31.990
would say a thousands of such kind of a machine. If I'm

00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:36.330
trying to build some of the LLMs in real, or even if I'm

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:40.490
trying to do a fine tuning in reality. So I need a hundreds

00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:43.330
and hundreds of these kinds of machines. Then only I will be

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:47.090
able to do it. So. So building an LLMs is not just about

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:49.370
writing a code, not just about understanding the

00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:52.870
architecture. It's also about accessing our resources and

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:55.390
that's the reason so many companies are not able to build

00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:57.790
it. And especially if I'll talk about startups. So obviously

00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:00.930
startups will not be having that much kind of a fund, right?

00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:03.870
So where they will try to burn those money on just a

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:06.950
compute. They have a talent, they have everything. But yeah,

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:09.690
if I'll talk about startups. So in general, they won't be

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:13.590
having a fund where they will be able to fund GPUs and they

00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:16.230
will be able to acquire a huge amount of money. They will be

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:18.970
able to process it because everything requires a huge

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:22.190
compute. So LLM is not just about, you know, understanding

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:27.510
the LLMs. It's also about accessing a compute, right? And

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:30.370
this is where many companies are lagging and especially if

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:32.750
I'll talk about India. So yeah, somewhere we are like a

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:36.230
lagging in that manner and we are not able to build. We are

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:38.870
able to build a couple of model, but yeah, we are not able

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:42.030
to build something which is like a world class now. So here

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:50.690
it is giving you H 180G PCI spot. I think it's spot, okay.

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:58.810
So maybe it's not available, I believe for now the spot one,

00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:04.350
I can try to use them something different. Okay, no, this is

00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:08.130
out of stock. I think I can use this one. Yeah, I think I

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:11.810
can use this one. It's just showing me a warning. Okay, no

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:16.070
hibernation, local storage only, no snapshot. So it's one of

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:20.090
the cheapest one. So H 180G PCI spot. Now I can try to use

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:22.970
maybe eight or I can go ahead with one. So as of now, I'll

00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:25.710
just go ahead with one. I don't want to spend much of my

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:30.730
money over here. So $1.52 per hour it is going to charge me.

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:34.250
So maybe I'll end up spending like a $3, $4 max to max. And

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:37.630
then I can try to call a deploy. So once you are going to

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:43.530
call a deploy after selecting this one, no, no, no, no, no,

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:48.530
no, no, this is for me, but not for all of you. I have to

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:53.390
show you the steps. Let me terminate this machine. Okay. So

00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:56.030
it will take some time. Fine. I'll select a deploy new

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:59.490
virtual machine and here. So I'm going to select basically H

00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:02.850
180G. Now once you are going to select this machine, this

00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:05.510
particular machine or any other machine, you have to come

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:10.790
down and then you have to basically set the environment,

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:14.590
select the environment. So you are accessing from a Canada

00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:18.170
or Norway or maybe a US one. So by default it's available in

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:19.950
a Canada region because in a different, different reason

00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:23.690
they are going to basically deploy a different, different

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:26.470
machine. So this machine is available in a Canada region. I

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:29.490
can even select a Norway region. No, it's not available in

00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:33.670
Norway region. It's not available in a USA region. And maybe

00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:37.690
I can try to create a new environment if I want, but leave

00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:40.790
it. I'll just try to use a default one. So this machine is

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:43.770
available in a Canada region. That's completely fine. Then

00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:46.990
you have to come down and here. So you have to select the

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:50.130
operating system. So which operating system will be like a

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:52.750
installed inside this machine, the machine that you are

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:56.510
trying to use. So here you have a multiple options. All of

00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:59.590
these Linux options are given to you, right? All of these

00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:02.270
Linux options are given to you. So I'll be selecting a

00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:06.670
default one, right? I'll be selecting a default one and I'll

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:09.330
just go ahead with the default installation of a Ubuntu,

00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:15.010
which is a Linux one, right? Now, uh, come down. So here you

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:18.550
will be able to see an option called SSH key. Now this is

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:21.170
pretty much important unless and until you are not going to

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:24.810
set up your SSH key, you will not be able to access your

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:29.610
machine. By default in my machine, I have already done a

00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:33.150
setup. So because of that, it is showing you these options,

00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:36.930
but let me delete these two options so that I can show you

00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:40.830
from the scratch. So delete a key pair and delete a key

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:46.470
pair. Yeah. So again, from the scratch, go to a virtual

00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:52.510
machine. Let me delete my, yeah. So go to a virtual machine

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:55.950
guys. Now click on deploy a new virtual machine, select your

00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:58.050
machine, whatever machine that you are looking for. So I'll

00:43:58.050 --> 00:44:02.230
be going ahead with H100, right? Now come down and then

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:05.810
select your environment, select your operating system, which

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:08.910
is a default one. As of now, there is no SSH key. I have

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:13.390
already deleted my SSH key. Right? So now here, this SSH key

00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:16.510
is going to help you out to access this machine from

00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:19.490
anywhere because obviously machine is available. But what I

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:23.010
will do if I'm not able to access it, right? So I need some

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:27.510
user ID and password in a layman way, right? So I need some

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:31.350
user ID and password by which I will be able to access my

00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:34.650
machine. And then if I'm able to access my machine, my

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:37.910
computer, I can do whatever I want that with that machine,

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:41.170
right? I can run any kind of application basically. Okay. So

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:46.110
to do that, you have to set your SSH key over here. Now how

00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:49.750
you will be able to set your SSH key. So maybe you can try

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:53.190
to go and try to generate your SSH key, right? So

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:57.650
environment is basically Canada, this region, right? And

00:44:57.650 --> 00:45:02.710
then you can try to basically like name this SSH key. So

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:05.810
maybe I can name it as a test and then it is going to

00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:09.510
generate. So just click on this generate option. Okay. So it

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:13.650
is going to generate an SSH key for you. So as you can see,

00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:19.030
it is able to generate a SSH key for me, by the way, are you

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:20.270
able to create it guys? Everyone?

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:35.060
Yes. Well, this one, anyone who is doing this experiment, by

00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:37.460
the way, anyone, okay,

00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:47.240
so yeah, people are doing it. Great. Great. Yeah. Okay. Let

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:50.200
me show you once again. So I'll go to a key pair. I'll

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:53.120
delete it. So whatever SSH key, which I have created, so I

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:55.940
can, I can delete it once again. So here, whatever SSH key

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:58.140
you are, you have created. So you will be able to see it

00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:01.360
inside a key pair by the way. So I can go ahead. I can try

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:04.680
to delete it. Yeah. I can go again to the virtual machine,

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:07.800
deploy a virtual machine. I can select a machine over here,

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:11.360
a one machine I'm going to select, uh, leave your reason as

00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:15.100
it is, leave your, uh, basically OS images as it is. Just

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:19.680
try to click on create SSH key, right? Generate SSH key, and

00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:22.740
then try to give some sort of a name over here. So maybe I

00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:27.880
can give a name as Euron. One, and then try to click on

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:31.000
generate. So it will end up generating a SSH key for me.

00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:37.500
So I just showing you, and if I'll go inside my key pair. So

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:40.200
again, you're on one and with this name, I'm able to

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:43.500
generate it. Okay. So environment is Norway. So it's a long

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:48.560
SSH key, which I have generated. I should delete it because

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:51.920
I should create this SSH key for my Canada region.

00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:03.630
Give any name fine.

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:10.790
So this is basically a SSH key. All of you will be able to

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:15.490
create it now. So SSH key access, enable public IP address,

00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:18.670
enable light. So both of these options you have to like a

00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:22.470
check basically. So enable this one, enable this one, number

00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:26.330
of VMs of deployment. So they're giving you some additional

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:29.830
configuration, callback URL, and even they're giving you a

00:47:29.830 --> 00:47:33.070
Jupiter notebook option. So if you would like to access your

00:47:33.070 --> 00:47:36.250
Jupiter notebook, you will be able to access it. It means by

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:39.030
default, they are going to install a Jupiter notebook inside

00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:42.190
your environment. If you would like to go ahead with the

00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:46.470
Jupiter notebook options, which is technically accessing

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:51.650
your GPU, right? So I can try to check this option. I can

00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:55.050
try to set this password and in this way it will be a

00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:57.750
password protected Jupiter notebook. It is going to

00:47:57.750 --> 00:48:01.930
configure, and then I will be able to hit a machines URL and

00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:05.410
at that particular URL, I will be able to access my

00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:09.050
computer. My Jupiter notebook. Yeah. So maybe password wise,

00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:11.350
I'm going to give a password.

00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:18.380
Okay. So I've just given a password for this one. Now cloud

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:21.200
in it a script. I don't want to give anything by the way. A

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:25.000
label. I don't want to give any kind of a label. Firewall

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.620
rule. So what kind of a traffic will come and what kind of a

00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:31.420
traffic you will go. So this is something called as inbound.

00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:34.360
Means what kind of incoming traffic you are going to allow.

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:38.700
So basically I'm going to allow. Okay. All the traffic. So

00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:43.080
I'm just whitelisting 0.0.0.0 slash zero. So just add it. So

00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:48.480
I'm whitelisting all of the inbound traffic by the way, a

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:51.740
port range wise, obviously I have to give a port range. So

00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:55.780
maybe I can give a port range starting from zero till maybe

00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:59.380
9999 something like this. So this is the port range I have

00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:02.460
given. So from this port to this port, just allow every kind

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:06.840
of a traffic. Yeah. So add it. No. I can add multiple

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:10.900
inbound rules. So there is a IPV4 option or IPV6 option.

00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:14.700
There is a UDP ICMP protocol which is given to me, but I

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:17.860
think this is going to work and this is going to be more

00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:20.720
than sufficient for me. So cancel it. So inbound rule wise,

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:23.400
I have already added and a port range wise. So I have added

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:27.240
a wide range of the port. Outbound rule. So here I can again

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:33.100
try to add maybe starting from zero till maybe 9999 and then

00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:37.500
0, 0, 0, 0. So just keep it as a white listed one. So

00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:41.360
inbound and outbound rule, you have to set both, I am able

00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:46.040
to configure. Now once this is done, right, once this is

00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:48.560
done. So this is basically showing you the configuration,

00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:51.140
right? This is showing you the configuration that what you

00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:55.060
will be able to get at the end of the day. So GPU wise, what

00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:59.760
kind of a GPU? So H100, 80 GB RAM GPU, you will be able to

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:03.680
access CPU wise, so 28, RAM wise 180 GB, disk wise 100.

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:07.720
Empirical means this is another mount they are giving you, a

00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:10.420
volume mount they are giving you. So you all will be able to

00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:13.540
access this configuration, which is more than enough for my

00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:17.160
like LLM hosting by the way, at least with the 20 billion,

00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:19.940
30 billion parameter model. So this is more than enough and

00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:22.700
yeah, with the limited number of user, I will be able to do

00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:26.240
even a inferencing. So these are the configuration guys,

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:28.660
which is required. Are we able to do this configuration

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:31.480
guys? Most of the configurations are going to be default

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:32.860
configurations. You don't have to worry.

00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:41.280
Yes, are you able to do it? Yeah. Now once we are able to do

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:45.980
this one, this much, right? Just click on deploy. Looks like

00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:48.820
AWS cloud. Yeah, all the cloud platform are same. It's not

00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:53.360
different by the way. Just click on deploy. It will take

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:55.560
some time and then you will be able to deploy. VM creation

00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:57.540
failed, inverted value for port 0. Okay.

00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:06.070
I have to change my port inbound and outbound starting from

00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:21.770
1. So inbound rule 1, 2, 9, 9, add, delete outbound 1, 2, 9,

00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:27.120
9, 9. Now click on deploy. How much credit we have to add? I

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:31.040
think $3 is more than enough. $3 will work for

00:51:35.110 --> 00:51:40.570
approximately two hours, $3, $4. Fine. So now as you can

00:51:40.570 --> 00:51:44.310
see, it is trying to create this. This entire machine, it is

00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:48.150
trying to configure this entire machine and here, so as of

00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:51.210
now you are able to see any, but in some time you will be

00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:53.590
able to see an IP address. And with the help of this IP

00:51:53.590 --> 00:51:56.550
address, you will be able to hit your machine. You will be

00:51:56.550 --> 00:52:00.920
able to access your machine. So outbound is again, same,

00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:05.020
just try to add some port 1-9999. It's it's same, actually.

00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:13.690
Same as they will follow almost same step. Yeah. So it's,

00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:16.090
it's very easy to spin a machine on any cloud platform,

00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:17.910
including AWS Azure GCP everywhere.

00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:25.000
So over there you have to create just a role and then you

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.420
have to create an IAM and then you will be able to spin the

00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:34.560
machine and you have to set the SSH, obviously. Okay. So

00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:38.580
just wait for a building stage, just wait for a couple of

00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:42.460
more minutes. So that, yeah. So now my machine is active and

00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:46.200
like I said, I'm able to get my IP address. Yeah. I'm able

00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:49.260
to get my IP address. So this is my public IP address and

00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:52.440
with the help of this IP address and with the help of my key

00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:56.000
pair, right. this particular key pair I will be able to

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:00.380
access this particular machine yeah I will be able to access

00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:03.300
this particular machine but how how I will be able to access

00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:07.180
this particular machine so first of all you have to go to a

00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:10.860
key pair right you have to go to a key pair and then you can

00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:20.880
try to basically okay so I think I have not downloaded again

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:22.880
problem public

00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:29.450
key I don't think I can download it I

00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:39.340
think it has a downloaded test hyper stack one this sort of

00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:43.740
seven minute ago right so I think this was the key yeah so

00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:49.680
by default it has downloaded my key so dot txt fine it is

00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:52.780
able to download it so here you can see that I have not

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:52.960
downloaded it so I think I have not downloaded it again

00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:55.660
there is another way basically so I don't use this default

00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:58.060
way by which we are creating the public key so I used to

00:53:58.060 --> 00:54:02.200
create a public key with the help of basically putty gen and

00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:04.380
then I try to attach it I'll show you that way as well don't

00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:06.720
worry I'll try to show you that way as well because the

00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:10.260
problem with this one is that that it has given me a key and

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:14.980
this key is available into a dot txt format so if you will

00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:18.340
check this file so this file is basically available into a

00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:21.600
dot txt format so any and this is basically a private key

00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:22.760
right this is basically a private key right so this is

00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:23.720
basically a private key right so this is basically a private

00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:26.000
key right so this is basically a private key right so this

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.680
is basically a private key right so this is basically a

00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:29.500
private key right so this is basically a private key right

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:32.080
so this is basically a private key right so this is

00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:32.840
basically a private key right so this is basically a private

00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:32.860
key right so this is basically a private key right so this

00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:34.200
is basically a private key right so this is basically a

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:35.820
private key right so this is basically a private key right

00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:36.920
so this is basically a private key right so this is

00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:39.140
basically a private key right so this is basically a private

00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:41.340
key right so this is basically a private key right so this

00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:43.560
is basically a private key right so this is basically a

00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:46.620
private key right so this is basically a private key right

00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:49.980
so this is basically a private key right so this is

00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:52.360
basically a private key right so this is basically a private

00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:54.960
key right so this approach as well. So there is something

00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:59.860
called as, let me show you that. So there is something

00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:05.620
called as if you'll go to Google party gen, basically there

00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:08.600
is something called as party gen. So party gen is going to

00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:12.120
help me out in terms of generating a key and I can try to

00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:16.180
attach that key to any platform to any platform is literally

00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:19.560
I will be able to attach that particular key to any platform

00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:22.620
out there. So party gen download guide for Windows, Linux

00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:25.860
and Mac and it is available for like all of these platform

00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:29.260
by the way, right? So all of these platforms, so like I

00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:32.400
said, party gen is something which I have been using since a

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:37.000
very, very, very, very long time. Maybe party gen is also

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.240
available in my drive so I can directly share that link so

00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:43.060
that you can download because they're going to show you a

00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:47.440
lot of ad by the way and then sometime it will be like a

00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:52.930
confusing. So let me share. My drive link. So where I'm

00:55:52.930 --> 00:55:53.710
keeping party gen,

00:56:24.550 --> 00:56:28.110
WinSAP is also needed. You can install WinSAP if you have to

00:56:28.110 --> 00:56:30.170
transfer the data. But as of now in this one, I don't have

00:56:30.170 --> 00:56:32.390
to transfer the data. It's better to go ahead with the

00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:33.130
WinSAP as well.

00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:41.620
Okay. So here is a link guys. So I have shared my own drive

00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:44.840
link. So I have shared two links by the way. So one link is

00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:49.420
for a party gen party gen I'm going to use to create my key

00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:53.080
by the way. So here this platform was trying to create a key

00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:56.860
and that key was available into our .txt format. I don't

00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:59.600
know. I have to convert that one. So it's better. I'll just

00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:03.300
go ahead and I can try to use a key which has been created

00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:06.940
directly by my party gen. And then there is a software, a

00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:10.840
small software called as party, which is like a KBS of a,

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:15.240
you know, or maybe in a MB max to max 3.7 MB of a file you

00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:18.200
will be able to see, which is going to help you out to do a

00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:21.720
SSH or to do a login. So these are the two link I have

00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:24.820
already shared. So please try to download both of them. If

00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:26.080
you have any questions about this, sorry,

00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:31.450
this file is infected with the virus. Only the owner is

00:57:31.450 --> 00:57:36.710
allowed. Maybe you can try to like remove your, like a

00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:42.550
security of your machine for now. Yeah. It's giving an

00:57:42.550 --> 00:57:44.850
error. Is it? It's, it's working for me. As you can see,

00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:48.150
see, I can download it in my system. Same link, which I've

00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:51.170
shared with all of you. So from the same link, I'm trying to

00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:56.470
like access it, download anyway. So, so

00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:00.740
you can download it. Maybe from my drive link or maybe you

00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:05.020
can go to Google and try to search for a party gen and then

00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:07.040
from there you will be able to download. They used to show

00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:12.000
you a lot of like, uh, uh, you know, add by the way. So see,

00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:15.300
I'm able to download this petition or party by the way. And

00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:20.360
similarly I will be able to download a petition. Yeah. So

00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:26.740
I'm able to download both. Sorry this file. Okay. So for

00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:29.700
one of my file.

00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:46.160
Hmm. Hmm. So it's working well for this party, but for party

00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:52.780
gen, it is showing you this one. So maybe you can just go

00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:54.880
ahead and use

00:58:58.910 --> 00:59:05.770
this link party gen.com yeah. So just go to party gen.com

00:59:05.770 --> 00:59:07.830
guys and then download it done.

00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:58.790
And there are so many links you will be able to find out

00:59:58.790 --> 01:00:00.790
over the internet. So these softwares are very famous

01:00:00.790 --> 01:00:03.270
software by the way. So you will be able to see a lot of

01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:05.110
link out there. So

01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:12.880
even Hitler has shared one of the link. You can just

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:15.220
directly click on that and then you will be able to download

01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:15.460
it.

01:00:18.370 --> 01:00:21.010
So I'm keeping this one inside my drive and even inside

01:00:21.010 --> 01:00:23.950
mess. So we need a party and we need petition. So first of

01:00:23.950 --> 01:00:26.210
all, try to install party and then you can try to install a

01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:29.930
petition. We need both petition to generate a key and party

01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:31.610
to do a SSH.

01:00:34.090 --> 01:00:36.930
Both of these things are required guys, party and petition.

01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:01.060
Yeah. So just use this link, which has been shared by a new

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:05.860
pool for like a downloading this, a petition and then for

01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:10.200
party. So maybe a link by Hitler, there are hundreds of

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:13.320
link. You will be able to find out over the internet just

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:16.880
for this one. This is a very, very old software, which we

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:18.340
have been using since a very long time.

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:16.580
We need actually both. We need a party as well as we need a

01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:16.900
petition.

01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:28.300
Okay, fine. So once, let me show you the process. I think

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:31.780
many of you will be comfortable once I'm going to show you

01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:36.240
the process to see in my system. I have a petition. So first

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:39.800
of all, I'm going to open up a petition, right? And then I'm

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:42.820
going to click on this generate, right? Once I'm going to

01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:46.020
click on this generate and you, I have to hover my mouse

01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:48.680
over here, so I should keep on holding my mouse so that it

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:51.660
will be able to generate a key for me, right? It will keep

01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:54.800
on generating a key for me. So now as you can see, it is

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:59.560
able to generate a key and this is a SSH key, which it has

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:03.900
been generated. Now I can try to click on save public key.

01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:06.800
Right? Save as a public key. I can try to save it as a

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:09.500
private key. I can try to save it as a public key. So once

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:12.540
I'm going to click save as a public key and maybe I can try

01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:15.840
to give some sort of a name. So in my document folder, I'm

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:22.580
going to save it. You're on, you're on hyper stack key,

01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:26.340
fine. So I can try to like a click and I can try to save it.

01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:29.860
So this is the only requirement with respect to like a

01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:33.440
petition I have. So here what I can do? I can try to go to

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:36.860
my document. And then I can show you my key. So see, this is

01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:40.620
the key which I have created, right? And as you can see,

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:46.320
like you're on hyper stack, you're on hyper stack key. Yeah.

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:50.120
So this is basically a key which I'm able to create over

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:55.740
here now. So along with this, right along with this, this is

01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:58.800
the public key which I'm able to create by the way. Now I

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:01.700
can try to go over here and then I can try to even save it

01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:04.280
as a private key. So as a public key. I can try to save it

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:06.420
or I use a private key. I can try to save it. So just click

01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:12.480
on private key and here again, click yes, you're on hyper

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:16.960
stack private key. Maybe just try to give some sort of a

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:19.960
name and then save it. So basically petition is giving you

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:23.180
an option to save any key value pair as a public key as a

01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:25.860
private key. So this is where this uses of petition comes

01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:29.440
into a picture. That's it. Apart from that, nothing is

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:33.520
actually required. Now, let's suppose, let's suppose. Let's

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:39.480
suppose. I have downloaded this key, right? This hyper stack

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:42.600
key, which is available into a text format, where

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:51.310
is my key? This hyper stack key I'm able to download. So

01:04:51.310 --> 01:04:53.390
this is also a private key by the way, but it's available

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:56.830
not in a PPK format or PPK file format. So basically it's

01:04:56.830 --> 01:05:00.970
available as a .txt format. So maybe I can try to save the

01:05:00.970 --> 01:05:03.870
same key, the private key that we are able to see. I can try

01:05:03.870 --> 01:05:07.290
to save it, save the same key into a private file format and

01:05:07.290 --> 01:05:09.890
then it is going to work. So I can try to directly use this

01:05:09.890 --> 01:05:13.090
key, which I have downloaded from a hyper stack cloud or, or

01:05:13.090 --> 01:05:16.790
what I can do. So let's suppose if I have my own key, which

01:05:16.790 --> 01:05:19.750
I'm using for a multiple platform access, for example, this

01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:23.210
is a PPK file I'm able to create, right? This is a, you're

01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:25.650
on private key and this is the public key by the way. So

01:05:25.650 --> 01:05:27.870
this is one of the file which I have created. I can try to

01:05:27.870 --> 01:05:31.010
use even this particular key. I can try to attach this

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:34.110
particular key to my instances and then I will be able to

01:05:34.110 --> 01:05:38.370
access my instances. So basically. Okay. So this is a

01:05:38.370 --> 01:05:40.850
password for you, the key which I'm talking about, right? So

01:05:40.850 --> 01:05:45.450
technically it's a password. So you can try to even download

01:05:45.450 --> 01:05:48.950
a .txt file, convert that file into a private key and then

01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:52.330
use it as a password or you can try to create your password

01:05:52.330 --> 01:05:55.930
and then you can try to attach this password to our

01:05:55.930 --> 01:05:59.590
instances. So how I will be able to attach this password, by

01:05:59.590 --> 01:06:02.230
the way, the password which I have created from a party gen,

01:06:02.370 --> 01:06:05.190
right? How I will be able to attach this password to my

01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:08.970
instances. Let me show you that part as well. So here what I

01:06:08.970 --> 01:06:11.770
have done, so I have created my own private key, right? I

01:06:11.770 --> 01:06:14.810
have created my own private key. Now I'll again go to my

01:06:14.810 --> 01:06:18.210
virtual machine. I'll try to click on deploy a new virtual

01:06:18.210 --> 01:06:21.370
machine. I'll try to select any of this machine. I will just

01:06:21.370 --> 01:06:24.550
leave everything as it is, right? Everything as it is. Now

01:06:24.550 --> 01:06:28.170
what I will do, create a new SSH key, right? And then I can

01:06:28.170 --> 01:06:34.350
select a region and then here I can try to give a name over

01:06:34.350 --> 01:06:37.470
here. So I can, I can just say that. That.

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:48.220
You're on private key stack any, any name I can try to give

01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:51.720
and then I can try to copy and paste my public key over

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:54.780
there. So in this way I will be able to even attach. So

01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:57.180
both, both of this work, both of these things are going to

01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:00.060
work fine for me. So here it is asking me to attach a public

01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:03.580
key. So here what I can do, I can try to like a copy this

01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:07.020
entire key, whatever key it is showing me over here and then

01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:09.680
I can try to attach it over here. So it is going to import.

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:14.300
Right? It is going to import and I can try to activate this

01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:16.940
one that, okay, try to use this particular key whenever

01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:20.260
someone will try to access. So basically I have created my

01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:23.600
own key. I have saved it as a private key by the way. And

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:26.420
then I have just copied this entire key and I have attached

01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:30.780
it with this environment. Leave everything as it is, right?

01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:34.800
Leave everything as it is. So maybe I can try to set the

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:39.600
inbound. So one, two, nine, nine, nine, nine added outbound.

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:42.220
So this is the only differences. You will be able to get it

01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:44.680
guys apart from that there won't be any differences that you

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:46.760
will be able to find out. So either way, whether you are

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:49.000
going to create a key on a platform and then use it, or

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.660
maybe you can try to attach your own key and then use it

01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:54.240
either way, it's completely fine. So I'm just trying to

01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:57.540
commence two different different system over here. So in one

01:07:57.540 --> 01:08:00.200
places I'm just trying to use a key which has been provided

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:03.540
by a platform itself and one key where I have created my own

01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:06.540
key and then I'm trying to attach it. Yeah. So maybe auto

01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:11.000
install password. Okay. Okay. And then click on deploy.

01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:17.140
You are attached, no, I have saved a private key. I have

01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:19.560
attached the public key. So over there you will be able to

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:22.200
see a message called as public key. So I have just copied

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:25.000
this key, right? Copied this key and pasted it over there.

01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:28.960
That's it. And I have saved my key because I'm attaching

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:32.600
this key, right? And when I will try to access a machine,

01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:36.860
even at that point of time, I need a key. So at that point

01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:39.580
of time, maybe my private key is going to work and with that

01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:41.260
I will be able to log in. I will be able to log in into the

01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:44.520
system. I'll show you just to just wait for like a few

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:44.820
minutes.

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:52.500
Have you enabled public IPSH? Okay. I think I have not. I'll

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:58.120
just try to enable it. So once my machine will be up.

01:09:06.490 --> 01:09:10.230
Yeah. So either way now, so whatever way suits you, you can

01:09:10.230 --> 01:09:12.150
just try to go ahead with that. That's completely fine. So

01:09:12.150 --> 01:09:15.710
for example, if I have like a downloaded, so I'll show you

01:09:15.710 --> 01:09:18.550
this way itself. So let's suppose this is the key which I

01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:21.070
had downloaded, right? This was the key which I have already

01:09:21.070 --> 01:09:25.210
downloaded. This one. Now what I can do, so this is my

01:09:25.210 --> 01:09:28.930
private key, right? So just try to copy this private key and

01:09:28.930 --> 01:09:32.530
then come to a puttygen because it is available into a .txt

01:09:32.530 --> 01:09:35.990
format, right? So I can try to come to this puttygen. Where

01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:49.840
is my, oh,

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:07.040
it is not giving me option on

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:27.090
supersonal, where is my D drive download? No,

01:10:50.850 --> 01:10:54.990
it is not able to load this one.

01:10:58.530 --> 01:10:59.470
Okay. Leave it.

01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:07.470
Fine. So even this machine is up. I can go to networking,

01:11:07.810 --> 01:11:11.530
public IP address is attached, private IP address is this

01:11:11.530 --> 01:11:11.750
one.

01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:22.240
So enable SSH.

01:11:26.370 --> 01:11:28.830
This looks fine. This looks fine to me.

01:11:38.430 --> 01:11:42.810
Yeah. Okay. So now this is the machine which is available to

01:11:42.810 --> 01:11:45.890
me, right? So this machine is available to me. Now what I

01:11:45.890 --> 01:11:49.150
can do, I can try to log in into this machine. So how I can

01:11:49.150 --> 01:11:52.430
log in? So first of all, I need this IP address. So without

01:11:52.430 --> 01:11:56.110
this IP address, I will not be able to log in. So just copy

01:11:56.110 --> 01:11:59.970
this IP address and putty, right? So we had putty and we

01:11:59.970 --> 01:12:04.570
have a puttygen. So just go to putty over here and in this

01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:08.270
interface, try to paste your IP address, whatever IP

01:12:08.270 --> 01:12:10.290
address, public IP address that you are able to see, just

01:12:10.290 --> 01:12:13.470
try to paste your IP address. Leave your port number as it

01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:17.070
is. So port number is going to be 22. Leave this SSH as it

01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:20.950
is. Then go to this option called SSH. It's a very small

01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:24.390
one, right? So. So I don't think that it will be visible

01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:27.230
clearly, but yeah, I can't increase the screen size of this

01:12:27.230 --> 01:12:29.470
one. So it's not possible to increase the screen size of

01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:33.830
this SSH, this putty by the way. So just click on this SSH,

01:12:34.030 --> 01:12:37.690
click add and then you will be able to see an option called

01:12:37.690 --> 01:12:42.550
auth. Just try to click on auth and then you will be able to

01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:46.370
find an option called credential. So inside this connection,

01:12:46.690 --> 01:12:51.570
there is a SSH expanded inside SSH. There is a auth. Inside

01:12:51.570 --> 01:12:55.090
auth, there is something called as credential and here you

01:12:55.090 --> 01:12:57.970
will be able to see an option. So private key file for a

01:12:57.970 --> 01:13:02.190
authentication. Private key file for the authentication. Now

01:13:02.190 --> 01:13:05.270
the PPK file that we have created and that we have stored

01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:08.110
basically, download

01:13:13.390 --> 01:13:15.090
D drive.

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:22.840
Where is my file?

01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:34.860
D drive download.

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:45.420
Yeah. So here I had created this your own private key,

01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:46.520
right? This is something that I have created. This is

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:48.540
something which I have created today. So just go to that

01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:52.440
file. So whatever file that you have created and open it up

01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:56.800
by default, it will be able to load that PPK file and this

01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:00.700
is the same key which I have attached, right? This is the

01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:04.040
same key which I have attached even inside my instances. So

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:08.280
when I was trying to like create my instances, so it's

01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:11.260
public key I have already attached and this is the private

01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:15.860
key by which I'm trying to log in into my system. So this

01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:17.680
is, this is the password by the way, right? This is the

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:20.280
password which I'm trying to give so that I will be able to

01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:23.020
log into my system and then click on open and if everything

01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:27.900
is going to work well then yeah, so it is going to show me a

01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:33.720
popup click on accept and login as so now it is asking me

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:36.780
that you would like to log in as and whenever it is asking

01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:41.260
you to log in as just try to type over here Ubuntu.

01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:45.680
Anyone guys? Who is able to? Yeah.

01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:53.230
So just try to type over here. So when it is asking you log

01:14:53.230 --> 01:15:02.190
in as just try to type U B U N T U simple and then it will

01:15:02.190 --> 01:15:05.750
try to like authenticate with your SSH key and successfully

01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:09.950
as you can see, I'm able to log in into the system. Let me

01:15:09.950 --> 01:15:13.170
now I can increase the font size. Now I will be able to get

01:15:13.170 --> 01:15:16.790
the option. So click on change setting. Click on appearance.

01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:21.130
Click on change and then I can try to increase the font

01:15:21.130 --> 01:15:26.310
size. So now I'm able to log in into my machine by the way,

01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:30.550
right? This is my machine, which, which I have like a, this

01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:33.750
process is talking, starting the right accordingly. So now

01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:36.550
if I'll go over here, so yes, this is my machine name and

01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:42.420
successfully I'm able to log in into my machine. So public

01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:44.960
key, the public key that we have attached for that same

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:47.640
public key, the private key that we have saved. Saved. We

01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:50.700
have to use that private key and we have to use it inside of

01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:54.800
party Jen selfish.

01:15:57.490 --> 01:16:00.570
So I saw you this configuration once again, the whole

01:16:00.570 --> 01:16:03.610
configuration by spinning a new machine. Yeah.

01:16:06.510 --> 01:16:09.310
It's just, it's just a one time job guys. So if you are able

01:16:09.310 --> 01:16:11.950
to do it once, you will be able to do it like a again and

01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:12.150
again.

01:16:19.970 --> 01:16:20.330
Yeah.

01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:40.460
Why neglecting IPV six? It's not required. IPV four is more

01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:40.940
than enough.

01:16:46.990 --> 01:16:49.330
So this is the step we have to follow every time. Yeah. So

01:16:49.330 --> 01:16:52.230
for any machine, even if you are going to spin a machine on

01:16:52.230 --> 01:16:54.810
AWS or Azure, you will have to follow the exact same step.

01:16:54.930 --> 01:16:57.830
Even if you're spinning a machine anywhere, you have to

01:16:57.830 --> 01:17:00.890
follow the exact same step. It will give you the IP address

01:17:00.890 --> 01:17:03.850
and whatever key that you have attached, you have to use

01:17:03.850 --> 01:17:08.470
this, that particular key and then you can try to spin your

01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.950
machine.

01:17:19.170 --> 01:17:21.610
So anyone, anyone guys who is able to do it by the way,

01:17:21.670 --> 01:17:23.490
anyone, okay,

01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:50.810
so I'm able to spin the VMs. Okay. Fine. Okay. Let's see. So

01:17:50.810 --> 01:17:51.070
what I wanted to show you is like a new application that was

01:17:51.070 --> 01:17:51.070
recently launched. Now I wanted to show you guys, so just

01:17:51.070 --> 01:17:51.670
like the first, this was, let's say like an NVIDIA NVIDIA,

01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:55.710
like a GPU over here. So there is something called as Nvidia

01:17:55.710 --> 01:17:59.850
hyphen SMI. If you're going to use this command, it is going

01:17:59.850 --> 01:18:03.810
to show you your entire GPU configuration. So basically what

01:18:03.810 --> 01:18:06.970
the series offer NVIDIA that you are or like a graphics card

01:18:06.970 --> 01:18:10.370
that you are using. So we are using basically H 100, what is

01:18:10.370 --> 01:18:12.510
the configuration each and everything it is going to show

01:18:12.510 --> 01:18:14.890
you like it, it is going to show you everything over here.

01:18:14.970 --> 01:18:18.490
So the command is Nvidia hyphen SMI. We are using a NVIDIA

01:18:18.490 --> 01:18:21.510
graphics card. H 100. 400 has been provided by basically

01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:29.070
Nvidia. So yeah, getting invalid public key error. So just

01:18:29.070 --> 01:18:34.210
try to use a correct, uh, basically like a location. So I

01:18:34.210 --> 01:18:36.970
think you are, you are not using Canada by default will be

01:18:36.970 --> 01:18:40.350
Canada. So just try to do a dropdown, select a dropdown and

01:18:40.350 --> 01:18:42.810
then, uh, like a select a Canada.

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:53.080
How we'll get to know which VM is reliable for any XYZ

01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:55.480
project. So this calculation we do based on the model size

01:18:55.480 --> 01:19:00.220
based on the hits that my system is going to get. Yeah.

01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:05.920
Okay. Now I'm going to show you, uh, like, um, this entire

01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:10.100
step one more time. So I have just closed my entire system.

01:19:10.260 --> 01:19:15.960
Let me close my party gen. Yeah. And, uh, let me go back to

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:20.280
my hyper stack cloud. Once again, go to my virtual machine.

01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:23.380
Let me delete all this virtual machine. I'll do it once

01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:27.280
again for all of you. So delete this virtual machine and

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:30.840
delete whatever machine that I've created, just deleted. So

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:33.820
I'll try to create it, uh, everything from the scratch. Uh,

01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:36.880
the only thing is that you have to configure the key. That's

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:40.260
it. So deploy a virtual machine, select a machine by the

01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:43.660
way, right? Once I'm able to select the machine, uh, select

01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:48.020
this environment or location, right? And then your operating

01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:52.340
system by default. Now majority of you will get stuck over

01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:55.180
here in terms of SSH key configuration. And this is

01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:57.240
important because without this, you will not be able to

01:19:57.240 --> 01:20:00.820
access your machine. So here, if you will click, they're

01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:04.780
giving you create a new SSH key option. These two key, I can

01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:07.440
delete, I can just go to a key pair and I can delete this

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:12.700
key pair. I can use one single key pair to access hundreds

01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:15.120
of machines together. So I don't have to like change the

01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:17.700
password again and again. So I can use the same key and I

01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:21.360
can use it. So I can click on deploy virtual machine, select

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:24.080
the machine, whatever machine that you are looking for. And

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:26.120
then. Yeah. So you will be able to find out your

01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:31.220
environment, then operating system images. Then here you

01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:34.620
will be able to find out, create a new SSH key. Click over

01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:37.340
here, select the environment. So it's a current environment,

01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:41.100
right? Uh, give a name. So maybe I can give a name as test

01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:44.300
over here and then it is asking you for a public key, right?

01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:48.000
It is asking you for a public key now. So they're also

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.820
giving you an option to generate the SSH key. So I can come

01:20:50.820 --> 01:20:53.640
over here, I can select a reason and then I can try to

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:58.520
generate SSH key. But by default it is going to attach that

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:02.780
SSH key, right? Now here, just try to read it out.

01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:06.280
Hyperstack creates a new RSA key pair for you to be used for

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:09.580
SSH access into your VNs. Simply select the environment,

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:13.100
enter the key name and then click create a button. Your

01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:16.620
public key is saved in hyperstack, right? So by default it

01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:19.540
is going to create two keys. One key is public, one is

01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:22.480
private. Same thing we are doing even with respect to a like

01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:26.040
a partition. So we are trying to attach. So. Let's say if

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:28.560
I'm generating some key with respect to a partition. So I'm

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:31.760
trying to attach a public key here with a machine and then

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:34.860
private key, I'm able to use it for a login, right? Same

01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:37.200
thing it does by the way. Same thing is that same thing. It

01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:39.820
is not doing anything different. So your public key is saved

01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:43.220
in hyperstack to be used with the VNs for SSH access, right?

01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:46.820
So by default, hyperstack is saving your public key. Your

01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:51.000
private key is downloaded to be used with the SSH client. So

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.940
private key, you will be able to download it. So I can, I

01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:56.760
can try to use any of this way. So let's suppose I, I'm just

01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:59.720
going to click on generate, right? So once I'm going to

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:02.720
click on generate, as you can see, test hyperstack two, this

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:06.080
is a TXT file that it is able to create, right? This is just

01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:10.060
a TXT file. It is able to create now by default, it is like

01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:12.980
it has already attached a public key and private key. This

01:22:12.980 --> 01:22:15.500
is my private key. By the way, the key which I'm able to

01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:19.640
download, technically it's a private key for me. As simple

01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:23.240
as that, right? Now enable the SSH. I'm not using partition

01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:25.860
by the way. As of now, I'm not using partition. In my last

01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:29.000
step I have used a partition, yeah, but in this one, so I'm

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:33.940
not using a partition at all. Uh, Canada OS, this is

01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:39.440
attached, SSH enable, fine, callback, no, maybe Jupiter

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:42.120
notebook. I can give a password over here.

01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:49.800
Okay. Image missing.

01:22:55.190 --> 01:23:01.550
Which image is missing? Canada. That's fine. Image I have

01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:06.830
already selected. Okay. So. SSH enabled. If you have not

01:23:06.830 --> 01:23:09.110
enabled it, then you can enable it after like spinning a

01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:13.110
machine. That's fine. The rest of the configuration is same.

01:23:13.290 --> 01:23:17.510
Click on deploy. Now I have this particular key, right? This

01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:20.050
particular key which has been given my hyper stack. So last

01:23:20.050 --> 01:23:22.390
time what I have done, so when I was using a partition, so

01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:26.430
in a partition, I will be able to see my public key. So I

01:23:26.430 --> 01:23:29.230
can attach it with any machines and then I can save that

01:23:29.230 --> 01:23:34.570
public key directly. But here it is giving you dot TXT file.

01:23:34.570 --> 01:23:37.350
Let me show you how to use this dot TXT file by the way,

01:23:37.450 --> 01:23:40.370
yeah, it will make your life little bit easy. So it will

01:23:40.370 --> 01:23:42.810
remove a party gen from your life by the way.

01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:53.760
We will use this private key using a party to access VM.

01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:57.040
Yes. See private key. So it's, it's a very simple

01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:00.700
fundamental concept guys. Uh, so it creates two keys, any,

01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:02.940
any of the system, right? So it doesn't matter which system

01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:06.000
you are going to use, even in AWS. So it is going to create

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.740
a public key, right now, public key, it is going to attach

01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:13.560
with the machine by default. So that now my machine knows

01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:16.520
right now, my machine knows what is the password. So

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:20.060
whenever you are going to create any kind of account, let's

01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:22.420
suppose I'm creating a Gmail account, right? Whenever I'm

01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:25.220
going to create a Gmail account for the very first time. So

01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:30.800
we try to give a password, right? Yes, everyone. Yeah. So we

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:32.820
try to give a password whenever we are going to create a

01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:35.800
Gmail account, Facebook on anything. So what Gmail does? So

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:39.200
Gmail is going to store that password somewhere in their own

01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:42.100
server, right? And then. And then when you will try to log

01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:45.400
in again, or maybe via different machine, you will try to

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:48.400
access your Gmail. So you have to add up, so you have to

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:51.880
basically give a password. So whenever you are trying to

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:56.970
give a password, so basically privately private, right? So

01:24:56.970 --> 01:24:59.490
let's suppose if you are trying to like, uh, give a password

01:24:59.490 --> 01:25:02.670
to access a machine. So whenever you give a password, it

01:25:02.670 --> 01:25:05.710
tried to match that password with the password that you have

01:25:05.710 --> 01:25:08.830
already given. So the password, which machine is storing,

01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:11.410
it's called as public, right? The password. The password

01:25:11.410 --> 01:25:14.210
that you are using to access this machine is called as

01:25:14.210 --> 01:25:18.210
private. Technically it understands like it just does the

01:25:18.210 --> 01:25:21.830
conversion, right? But technically it's the same key that we

01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:24.210
are trying to use. So machine is storing it as a public key

01:25:24.210 --> 01:25:27.130
and you are using the same key as a private key. Just think

01:25:27.130 --> 01:25:30.990
in that way, it's just a password like Gmail stores a

01:25:30.990 --> 01:25:33.110
password and then next time whenever I'm going to log in, so

01:25:33.110 --> 01:25:35.730
it is going to allow me to log in in a similar manner. It is

01:25:35.730 --> 01:25:41.170
allowing me to log in over here. Okay. So this, uh, focus.

01:25:41.170 --> 01:25:45.130
More is up and this is the IP address. Now how I will be

01:25:45.130 --> 01:25:49.170
able to hit this one, this machine. So open up putty, P U

01:25:49.170 --> 01:25:54.870
double T Y putty and now give this IP address. This is the

01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:58.650
IP address. Now go to SSH, expand it. Here you will be able

01:25:58.650 --> 01:26:02.050
to see auth, expand it. Here you will be able to see the

01:26:02.050 --> 01:26:06.250
credential. Now just browse, right? Now just browse. So

01:26:06.250 --> 01:26:08.710
where I have already stored this file. So I have already

01:26:08.710 --> 01:26:12.770
stored this file in my. Okay. D drive downloads. This is

01:26:12.770 --> 01:26:15.190
the, this is the private key, right? This is the private

01:26:15.190 --> 01:26:19.370
key. Okay, cool. This is the private key that I have. So

01:26:19.370 --> 01:26:20.810
here D

01:26:23.630 --> 01:26:27.810
drive download and now it is looking for by default, it is

01:26:27.810 --> 01:26:31.510
looking for a file in which format by the way, are you able

01:26:31.510 --> 01:26:33.310
to see the file format?

01:26:36.770 --> 01:26:40.710
Yeah. PPK, right? PPK is a file format basically for a

01:26:40.710 --> 01:26:44.010
private key, right? Basically it's a dot PPK. So it is

01:26:44.010 --> 01:26:46.910
looking for dot PPK. I can even click on all files. Now it

01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:49.310
will be able to show me all the files and this test

01:26:49.310 --> 01:26:52.570
hyperstack two, this is basically a file. I can try to open

01:26:52.570 --> 01:26:56.490
it up and then let's just try to browse this dot TXT file

01:26:56.490 --> 01:27:04.690
and then try to click on open. Now except login as U B U N T

01:27:04.690 --> 01:27:10.950
U Ubuntu not supported. Now this is the error, not supported

01:27:10.950 --> 01:27:14.410
authentication method available. So basically system was

01:27:14.410 --> 01:27:19.210
looking for dot PPK file. By default, hyperstack has given

01:27:19.210 --> 01:27:24.610
you dot TXT file, right? Hyperstack has, although there is a

01:27:24.610 --> 01:27:27.370
private key, I'm not saying that there is no private key.

01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:30.270
Yes, private key is available inside that file. That that's

01:27:30.270 --> 01:27:34.790
completely fine, but it was looking for a supported file

01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:40.470
format, which is technically dot PPK, right? Dot PPK and a

01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:46.470
hyperstack has given me a file in a dot TXT format. So

01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:49.810
that's fine. So somehow I'll have to convert that dot TXT

01:27:49.810 --> 01:27:54.310
into dot PPK. If I'm able to do it, I will be able to use

01:27:54.310 --> 01:27:57.430
the same one. That's the reason. So I have shown you the

01:27:57.430 --> 01:28:00.710
other approach. Other approach means use a party gen. It

01:28:00.710 --> 01:28:04.010
will give you public private both, right? So save it as a

01:28:04.010 --> 01:28:06.950
private and use it as a public inside the machine and then

01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:10.750
happily you will be able to log in. Now here you have one

01:28:10.750 --> 01:28:14.270
more step. You can't log in through this dot TXT file. The

01:28:14.270 --> 01:28:16.870
TXT file, which hyperstack has given to you. You have to

01:28:16.870 --> 01:28:22.290
convert this TXT file into a PPK file, right? And then only

01:28:22.290 --> 01:28:27.790
you will be able to use it. There is no other way. So I

01:28:27.790 --> 01:28:30.170
think now you are able to understand why I have used party

01:28:30.170 --> 01:28:34.050
gen. Yeah. And it's going to be the same story. Believe me,

01:28:34.090 --> 01:28:36.470
whatever machine that you will commence in this entire

01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:40.390
world, right after, because when you will like a do

01:28:40.390 --> 01:28:43.490
something in real without machine, you will not be able to

01:28:43.490 --> 01:28:46.150
do it right without machine. You will not be able to do it.

01:28:46.170 --> 01:28:49.150
Even big data. Right? Even big data. You will not be able to

01:28:49.150 --> 01:28:52.150
do it without machine because at the end of the day you will

01:28:52.150 --> 01:28:55.230
not be able to execute your spark or something in your local

01:28:55.230 --> 01:28:58.210
machine. You have to have use a cluster, a bunch of machines

01:28:58.210 --> 01:29:01.150
which will be available over the cloud and then you have to

01:29:01.150 --> 01:29:06.810
access it through a keys by the way. Yes. So try to rename

01:29:06.810 --> 01:29:13.930
dot TXT as a PPK and see how it goes. Okay. See extension is

01:29:13.930 --> 01:29:16.690
something that you can't change it in this way. By the way.

01:29:16.870 --> 01:29:21.570
Right. So let's try to open it up into a VSCode open with a

01:29:21.570 --> 01:29:26.310
VSCode right VSCode a cursor. So this is my key, right? This

01:29:26.310 --> 01:29:31.130
is my key and I can, I can try to like a, you know, create a

01:29:31.130 --> 01:29:40.170
new files. So maybe test private key dot PPK. Yeah. And then

01:29:40.170 --> 01:29:44.830
I can just save it. I can just save it. So wherever this

01:29:44.830 --> 01:29:51.190
location is. Now go and let's go and check. Yeah. So test

01:29:51.190 --> 01:29:55.070
private key. See I'm able to save it now. So just try to

01:29:55.070 --> 01:29:57.230
open it up into a VSCode. You will not be able to rename it

01:29:57.230 --> 01:29:59.270
by the way, because extension, you will not be able to name

01:29:59.270 --> 01:30:01.890
it just by like doing a right click and then rename. You

01:30:01.890 --> 01:30:05.510
have to store it as a separate file itself. So this is our

01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:09.310
way. Now I have converted the same thing, right? Same thing.

01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:12.770
Is that same dot TXT? I've done what? Like copy and pasted.

01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:15.630
I have created one file with extension called as dot PPK.

01:30:15.630 --> 01:30:18.310
And file name doesn't matter what name you have given over

01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:20.710
there and here. The only thing which matters is what is the

01:30:20.710 --> 01:30:23.330
password inside it, right? What is the password? Now let's

01:30:23.330 --> 01:30:26.550
try to use this one, the converted one, right? The converted

01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:29.370
one, which I have like a done it from the, with the help of

01:30:29.370 --> 01:30:32.970
like a VSCode, right? So I just created one file with the

01:30:32.970 --> 01:30:35.710
extension dot PPK, copy and pasted the key. That's it.

01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:39.450
Whatever key was available in dot TXT here, I'll just copy

01:30:39.450 --> 01:30:44.730
and pasted it over here. Simple end of the game. Now let's

01:30:44.730 --> 01:30:52.290
try to open up partition. Let me give the IP address. So IP

01:30:52.290 --> 01:30:54.230
address is this, IP

01:30:56.760 --> 01:31:00.280
address, click on SSH, expand it, click on auth, expand it,

01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:02.900
click on credential. Let me browse the credential, the

01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:05.180
credential which I have stored just now. So I think in the

01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:09.420
big data folder, test private key, right? Open it up. So now

01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:14.580
it's available into dot PPK, click on open. Now log in as U

01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:21.060
B U N T U, Ubuntu. Okay. So that's it. So not support

01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:23.980
authentication method, able to, I'm

01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:30.710
giving this PPK file, not

01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:41.040
supporting. That's I simply use partition majority of time.

01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:44.540
In my cases, I don't take this kind of a headache. I just

01:31:44.540 --> 01:31:50.960
like a load the private key as simply like use a partition,

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:53.840
which is like, I'm using it since many, many years by the

01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:57.680
way. Okay. Save as a private key.

01:32:00.370 --> 01:32:05.570
Let me save it somewhere. Test new private.

01:32:08.830 --> 01:32:10.170
Again I'm using partition.

01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:19.580
I follow the simple approach. Use a partition, generate it,

01:32:19.660 --> 01:32:25.100
attach it, log in. Simple. Deal done. No more headache we

01:32:25.100 --> 01:32:37.160
have to take. Test new private open, U B U N T U. Hmm. So

01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:40.700
the save that I have done over here, it has not worked

01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:44.180
actually. It has not worked. So basically I ultimately I had

01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:47.440
to open up my partition and then through a partition itself,

01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:50.680
I had to convert it into a private key. So when you have to

01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:53.480
use ultimately a partition, then use a partition since the

01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:54.900
beginning itself. Yeah.

01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:01.360
So just use partition all the time. One of my favorite.

01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:08.380
Simple. Let me increase the font size. Okay. N V I D I A

01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:12.780
hyphen S M I. Now this is my configuration of this server.

01:33:15.250 --> 01:33:19.710
Yes. So again from the next time it just take two minutes of

01:33:19.710 --> 01:33:21.730
time guys. I think we have to spend a one and a half hour of

01:33:21.730 --> 01:33:26.530
time right to spin just a machine. But I think, yeah, uh,

01:33:26.690 --> 01:33:30.310
just a one time learning because it just take two minute of

01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:33.030
time, not more than that. And I believe now we are pretty

01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:35.630
much clear with respect to a public key, private key, login,

01:33:35.770 --> 01:33:39.410
everything. Right. So now we are able to spin the machine

01:33:39.410 --> 01:33:41.990
and if you're able to spin a machine here, you will be able

01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:44.170
to spin a machine anywhere. Anywhere means literally

01:33:44.170 --> 01:33:49.270
anywhere and uh, let's do LS. So yeah, these are the files

01:33:49.270 --> 01:33:52.030
which is available. Let me do PWD present working directory.

01:33:52.230 --> 01:33:56.130
So I'm into home slash Ubuntu, right? I'm into this

01:33:56.130 --> 01:34:01.330
particular directory. Now let's start configuring my entire

01:34:01.330 --> 01:34:07.070
server. Shall we start guys now? Sure. Machine is up by the

01:34:07.070 --> 01:34:11.670
way. Okay. Yeah. Machine is up. I can even check like a

01:34:11.670 --> 01:34:12.810
Python.

01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:21.620
Python. It is not able to understand. So technically Python

01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:23.980
is not available. I'll have to install Python over here.

01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:28.280
Yeah. I'll have to install Python. So Python is not

01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:30.600
available. So this machine is completely a bare machine

01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:33.260
means there is nothing which is available. This is a new

01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:37.240
computer. You can say a new heavy computer. Uh, we are able

01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:41.700
to access and now, uh, the entire computer is blank, right?

01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:46.440
I can do whatever I want and uh, yeah, so I, I will be able

01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:49.320
to access it. Now how to access a Jupyter notebook by the

01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:52.280
way. So to access a Jupyter notebook, you have to use the

01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:55.360
same IP address, right? So paste an IP address in your

01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:59.920
browser and then just give a colon port number 8, 8, 8, 8.

01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:02.080
Jupyter notebook will be available at 8, 8. If you have

01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:04.740
enabled Jupyter notebook, if you have not enabled, you will

01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:07.240
not be able to access it. So in this machine, I have already

01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:10.320
enabled a Jupyter notebook, right? And it's available at

01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:15.740
port 8, 8, 8, 8. So hit enter. Uh, let me see whether it can

01:35:15.740 --> 01:35:17.540
reach out ideally

01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:24.650
port 88. It should allow.

01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:39.280
Yeah, it's a 4, 8, not 8, 0, 8, 8, no, no for Jupyter

01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:41.460
notebook by default, it will assign the port number. For

01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:43.920
Jupyter notebook, we don't give a port number by default. If

01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:47.380
I have enabled it, I'll have to check whether I had enabled

01:35:47.380 --> 01:35:49.560
it. I think I have enabled it for this machine because for

01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:52.060
the previous machines I have enabled it. It will be

01:35:52.060 --> 01:35:55.900
available on 8888. Okay. That's our default port number for

01:35:55.900 --> 01:36:01.780
a Jupyter notebook. But I think I have not allowed, uh, but

01:36:01.780 --> 01:36:06.320
inbound wise, even I have allowed 9999, right? So 8888 is

01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:08.800
lesser than this. Fine. We'll have to check whether I have

01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:11.080
enabled it or not. Maybe I have like forgot to enable a

01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:14.640
Jupyter notebook. So it's fine. Anyhow, I don't need a

01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:19.240
Jupyter notebook. I just need this machine. Okay. So clear

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:23.940
it, clear everything. And then let's start like, uh, doing a

01:36:23.940 --> 01:36:26.580
configuration. Step-by-step. So I have a command ready with

01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:30.060
me. So here, this is the very first command, uh, basically

01:36:30.060 --> 01:36:32.620
we'll try to install a Python. So before installing a

01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:38.620
Python, so we'll try to update this entire, like a machine

01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:43.500
that we have, the images that we are using. So just call

01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:48.860
sudo add apt repository, just call this one. So it will be

01:36:48.860 --> 01:36:50.620
able to update your entire machine.

01:36:54.220 --> 01:36:58.680
So I've already pasted a command guys. Yeah. Now. So you

01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:04.780
have to write sudo apt, sudo means super user command, sudo

01:37:04.780 --> 01:37:11.780
apt, and then U P D A T update sudo apt update. So it is

01:37:11.780 --> 01:37:12.660
going to update my machine.

01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:29.300
Do it everyone.

01:38:08.060 --> 01:38:11.780
Okay. So update is done. Uh, we are able to run two commands

01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:16.060
basically. Yeah. Someone is asking me what is apt? So apt is

01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:18.820
basically a package manager. Full form is advanced package

01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:23.660
tool. Uh, basically. So it's been used inside a Linux

01:38:23.660 --> 01:38:26.740
machine, uh, basically whether you are using a Ubuntu or

01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:29.540
maybe, uh, any Linux, like a machine Debian based

01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:34.420
distribution, uh, to basically access all the packages. The

01:38:34.420 --> 01:38:40.640
shorthand is basically apt, advanced package tool now. So

01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:44.460
once we are able to do this, right, two of these things we

01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:47.620
are able to run. Then the next thing is let's go ahead and

01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:50.660
install Python. So again, we are able to run this. We can

01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:54.840
try to call sudo apt package manager, by the way, install

01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:58.940
Python 3.12 right inside a virtual environment, uh, all

01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:02.780
years basically. So this is going to install a Python inside

01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:05.540
my environment, pasting a command guys inside your chat.

01:39:08.060 --> 01:39:12.400
Sorry. The command should be sudo. Start with sudo apt. I've

01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:15.120
just pasted like Python. Yeah. So this is the command sudo

01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:18.400
apt apt install. So there's like a pip, right? Pip we are

01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:21.360
using for a like a pi pi. So in the similar manners here

01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:23.260
inside a Linux. We are using apt.

01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:30.440
So it will take some time. It is going to install a Python.

01:39:34.690 --> 01:39:37.350
I can install Java, Python, whatever I want.

01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:56.920
Traditional portals, which we utilize till date used to run

01:39:56.920 --> 01:40:01.680
a code via git push. So obviously code, we are going to push

01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:05.600
it inside the GitHub. We are trying to host our own LLMs,

01:40:05.740 --> 01:40:11.020
right? To host LLMs, we need a machine. How you will be able

01:40:11.020 --> 01:40:13.860
to host it inside a GitHub. GitHub is a repository code

01:40:13.860 --> 01:40:21.120
manager, by the way. Right? Yeah. So still taking some time.

01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:25.240
So my machine will be ready and my LLMs will be ready next

01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:28.040
20, 25 minutes, by the way. Yup. That is the only time which

01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:28.340
is required.

01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:36.520
Oracle cloud free trade. It can provide same thing. I don't

01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:39.200
think that they're providing you a GPUs, especially H100

01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:43.040
free. No one is providing you H100 for free, by the way, no

01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:44.200
one or

01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:47.960
any real time GPUs.

01:40:51.490 --> 01:40:54.170
How to create a key using a putty and partition. Partition I

01:40:54.170 --> 01:40:56.490
have already shown you, right? Putty is for logging. Not for

01:40:56.490 --> 01:40:59.170
key creation. Partition is basically for a key creation.

01:41:01.870 --> 01:41:06.190
One GB CPU RAM they give free and which is of no use by the

01:41:06.190 --> 01:41:09.610
way. So I think more than that, Google collab is giving you,

01:41:09.710 --> 01:41:17.550
yeah, one GB CPU RAM or GPU, like it's of no use. I'm like,

01:41:17.610 --> 01:41:19.510
there are hundreds of other platform which is providing me

01:41:19.510 --> 01:41:20.150
more than that.

01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:30.870
Yeah. So there are many, no one will, like I said, right, no

01:41:30.870 --> 01:41:33.770
one will give you H100, A100 for free. No one means no one.

01:41:33.870 --> 01:41:40.460
It is too costly for any one of us. Setting up machine in

01:41:40.460 --> 01:41:42.880
house is better or setting like this. Setting up, setting

01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:45.260
like this is better because if you are going to like, you

01:41:45.260 --> 01:41:48.340
know, set up a machine in house, first of all, it is going

01:41:48.340 --> 01:41:52.000
to cost you like a lakhs and lakhs just for one single card.

01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:54.740
Let's suppose if I'm using one single card, H100 card,

01:41:54.900 --> 01:41:58.400
right? So that will cost you three, four lakh rupees in

01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:01.900
Indian currency. In US obviously it will be a bit cheaper.

01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:05.700
But yeah. So you have to like set up like so many cards, you

01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:10.300
have to maintain the networking port and above all, above

01:42:10.300 --> 01:42:15.300
all, a cooling system, which is going to like burn your

01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:19.400
electricity like anything. It will give you like a lot of

01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:24.120
electricity bill every month because just purchasing a

01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:26.520
machine is not the end of the game. Maintaining is the,

01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:29.080
maintaining that machine is another level of headache.

01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:32.000
That's the reason GPUs are very much costly. Right?

01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:43.020
Why it is taking longer for me? I don't know. It's a cloud.

01:42:43.180 --> 01:42:47.380
So cloud to cloud download is trying to do. It must have

01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:49.280
done that so far, but I don't know.

01:42:58.910 --> 01:43:02.650
So for URI what you have used. So basically there are a lot

01:43:02.650 --> 01:43:06.210
of like a bare metal provider. So basically like they will

01:43:06.210 --> 01:43:09.250
not give you a fancy interface or something, but yeah, they

01:43:09.250 --> 01:43:12.370
will give you a GPU, whatever GPU that you need. Generally

01:43:12.370 --> 01:43:14.790
we go ahead with that because it will be a little bit like a

01:43:14.790 --> 01:43:16.390
cheaper for us. So basically like they will not give you a

01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:16.890
fancy interface or something, but yeah, they will give you a

01:43:16.890 --> 01:43:19.210
fancy interface. You can say it's kind of a local vendor who

01:43:19.210 --> 01:43:22.590
is like giving you a bare metal, but not just like a fancy

01:43:22.590 --> 01:43:26.910
stuff or fancy this, this kind of, you know, things. But

01:43:26.910 --> 01:43:30.070
yeah, so just giving you a network port and then you will be

01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:32.790
able to access it. Generally we like use that kind of a

01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:37.190
machine. How to convince our manager that we need this in

01:43:37.190 --> 01:43:40.130
our company to align with the tech every time in the end he

01:43:40.130 --> 01:43:43.750
replies with the budget issue, then say that, that, okay,

01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:45.910
change your job in that case. If you're working under that

01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:49.150
kind of a manager, right? It's better to change the job

01:43:49.150 --> 01:43:53.010
instead of, you know, convincing your manager because if the

01:43:53.010 --> 01:43:55.190
person is not able to understand, you can't, you can't

01:43:55.190 --> 01:43:57.370
convince it, right? You can't go and convince every time,

01:43:57.410 --> 01:44:02.170
like everyone. So better to change the job, at least you

01:44:02.170 --> 01:44:07.610
will be able to save your future. My very simple advice, you

01:44:07.610 --> 01:44:12.410
should not go and convince, okay. It's taking too much time.

01:44:13.030 --> 01:44:19.060
Let's see what is going on. Waiting for a catch a log, could

01:44:19.060 --> 01:44:22.920
not get a log until it's held by process waiting

01:44:47.460 --> 01:44:49.280
for the catch a log.

01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:55.380
Why you are waiting?

01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:44.300
Okay. So let me kill this process. Process is eight, nine,

01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:50.420
one, six. Okay. So pseudo kill minus nine process is eight,

01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:53.780
nine, one, six. I don't know like for my system. Okay. Kill

01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:57.000
the process. Now it should not give me that issue. Yeah. Now

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:00.040
it's working. I know. I don't know, like I don't know, like

01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:03.280
whether my, my system was like got stuck somewhere and

01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:07.500
because of that, you know, it was okay.

01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:27.060
So this one is done. Now let's go ahead and try to create a

01:46:27.060 --> 01:46:33.260
Python virtual environment. So everyone just create a

01:46:33.260 --> 01:46:35.320
virtual environment, Python, it is able to download. So

01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:38.040
virtual environment, I think it is able to create. Now once

01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:40.880
it is able to create, let's activate this virtual

01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:44.180
environment. So again, I'm picking up. I'm bringing you the

01:46:44.180 --> 01:46:47.640
code. And as you can see that my virtual environment is

01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:50.160
activated, right? So this is the environment, the way we

01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:52.260
create a virtual environment in a local system in a similar

01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:56.780
manner, I'm doing it. So here I'm able to create a virtual

01:46:56.780 --> 01:46:59.460
environment and I'm able to activate my virtual environment

01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:03.500
as you can see, right in my console. So simple. So far we

01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:06.700
are able to do the Python installation, right? So we, we

01:47:06.700 --> 01:47:08.880
have, we were able to update the machine and then we were

01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:13.060
able to like install the Python environment. Now. There are.

01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:17.080
There is a Python environment is available. So you have to

01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:19.680
basically upgrade your pip. There is something called a

01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:23.320
setup tool and there is something called as wheel so that I

01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:26.600
will be able to build the file or build the binaries. So

01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:30.560
just try to run pip install, upgrade wheel. I just pinged

01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:33.200
you inside the code, successfully upgraded everything,

01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:38.400
right? It will not take much of your time now. So now my

01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:41.680
machine is ready with the Python, right? Now my machine is

01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:45.740
ready with each and everything. And now we are just two step

01:47:45.740 --> 01:47:51.260
away, just two step away to host our LMS. That's it. Once my

01:47:51.260 --> 01:47:53.560
machine is ready, right? So I have just installed a Python

01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:57.700
and now we just have to follow another two step by which I

01:47:57.700 --> 01:48:01.420
will end up doing an installation or I will like end up

01:48:01.420 --> 01:48:09.120
running a LMS in my machine. Shall we do it now? Share the

01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:11.360
kill command. So kill command is very simple. Sudo kill

01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:13.320
hyphen nine. You can remove nine or even nine you can

01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:16.680
remove, so sudo kill and then the process ID. So whatever

01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:19.840
process ID that it will show you, right? So in my case it

01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:22.580
was showing me 8916. In your case it may show you something

01:48:22.580 --> 01:48:25.320
different. So just try to give that ID. It will kill that

01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:27.900
ID, process ID basically. Yeah.

01:48:32.580 --> 01:48:36.260
Simple. Okay. So it's a standard Linux command by the way.

01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:39.420
Anyone and everyone who is using a Linux machine or even a

01:48:39.420 --> 01:48:42.840
Mac machine, I think they must be aware about it. Yeah. For

01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:45.860
a Windows user, obviously it's a first time. I do understand

01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:47.820
that. I understand that part. But yeah, anyone and everyone

01:48:47.820 --> 01:48:50.900
who is using any Mac machine or like a Linux, because Mac is

01:48:50.900 --> 01:48:55.040
also a basic Linux, right? So they can, they can use the

01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:58.860
same command. Now like I said guys, so we are only two steps

01:48:58.860 --> 01:49:03.800
away, right? Just two step away, uh, to like, you know, uh,

01:49:03.900 --> 01:49:09.460
host our LMS by the way before that. So I would like to

01:49:09.460 --> 01:49:13.440
like, uh, talk about, uh, something over here. So there is

01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:17.180
something called as V LLM, right? There is a framework

01:49:17.180 --> 01:49:21.160
called as V LLM. Anyone who is aware about this V LLM by the

01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:21.320
way?

01:49:26.550 --> 01:49:31.190
Yeah. Okay. So some people have heard, people are saying

01:49:31.190 --> 01:49:32.750
yes, yes, yes. Okay. Okay.

01:49:36.660 --> 01:49:41.790
Yeah. So basically there is a framework or there is a

01:49:41.790 --> 01:49:44.810
library which has been designed, I think by a UC Berkeley

01:49:44.810 --> 01:49:49.570
researcher, right? And uh, to do what? So basically to do a

01:49:49.570 --> 01:49:53.170
model inferencing in a efficient manner. So whenever you

01:49:53.170 --> 01:49:57.130
have this LLMs, right? Yeah. So a big, big LLMs, 20 billion

01:49:57.130 --> 01:49:59.390
parameters, 70 billion parameter, a hundred billion

01:49:59.390 --> 01:50:03.230
parameter. So these are the big LLMs. So in an optimized

01:50:03.230 --> 01:50:06.470
way, if you have to do a inferencing, right? If you have to

01:50:06.470 --> 01:50:08.930
do a inferencing and if you have to expose those model to

01:50:08.930 --> 01:50:11.670
the outer world where other people will be able to consume

01:50:11.670 --> 01:50:14.890
it as an API without even worrying about the hosting part,

01:50:15.070 --> 01:50:17.070
because hosting will be in a backend, right? So in this

01:50:17.070 --> 01:50:22.510
machine, by the way, so V LLM is basically a framework or

01:50:22.510 --> 01:50:25.850
you can say a library, which is going to help you out. In

01:50:25.850 --> 01:50:29.710
that way. So where you will be able to solve the model,

01:50:29.810 --> 01:50:34.050
especially LLM, right? LLM I'm talking about, not just any

01:50:34.050 --> 01:50:37.830
other vision model or any other NLP model. No, I'm talking

01:50:37.830 --> 01:50:41.270
about all the LLMs. So basically you will be able to solve

01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:46.130
this LLM with a scale, right? So all of these things will be

01:50:46.130 --> 01:50:51.690
taken care by V LLM itself. Yeah. V LLM itself. So because,

01:50:51.770 --> 01:50:55.330
uh, you can, you can even go ahead with the hugging phase.

01:50:55.350 --> 01:50:56.110
Yeah. You can go ahead with the hugging phase, right? So

01:50:56.110 --> 01:50:59.310
hugging phase may be like a hosting and even hugging phase

01:50:59.310 --> 01:51:01.630
are providing your TPUs and GPUs, right? You can go ahead

01:51:01.630 --> 01:51:05.650
with the hosting over there, but in general, when you will

01:51:05.650 --> 01:51:08.930
try to use a hugging phase based transformer, hugging phase

01:51:08.930 --> 01:51:11.130
based transformer, you can go ahead with that. Maybe

01:51:11.130 --> 01:51:13.630
sometime I'll show you how to do this one with respect to

01:51:13.630 --> 01:51:17.450
hugging phase, but it is not that efficient and you will end

01:51:17.450 --> 01:51:20.030
up wasting a memory. You will end up wasting a compute

01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:24.770
because of the inefficient scheduling of token. So when it

01:51:24.770 --> 01:51:29.490
tried to generate it, this is where this V LLM has been

01:51:29.490 --> 01:51:33.050
introduced and V LLM generally are using internally a

01:51:33.050 --> 01:51:37.510
pagination based attention. So which will try to optimize

01:51:37.510 --> 01:51:40.590
the entire token generation, because this is what we do with

01:51:40.590 --> 01:51:43.370
respect to LLMs, right? We generate a tokens. We had to give

01:51:43.370 --> 01:51:46.810
input as a token, output as a token. And obviously V LLMs

01:51:46.810 --> 01:51:50.030
always help you out in terms of handling a GPUs in a much

01:51:50.030 --> 01:51:53.170
more efficient way. So there are so many features. You will

01:51:53.170 --> 01:51:55.630
be able to get it. So high throughput, you will be able to

01:51:55.630 --> 01:51:58.970
get it. Continuous batching will be handled by a VLM

01:51:58.970 --> 01:52:03.450
automatically. It gives you a compatibility with all the GPT

01:52:03.450 --> 01:52:07.570
series, all the Lama series, all the Falcon series and

01:52:07.570 --> 01:52:10.530
almost every series of the model, right? So you don't have

01:52:10.530 --> 01:52:14.190
to worry about when you are using a VLMs. And again, so by

01:52:14.190 --> 01:52:17.870
default, even internally open AI and other platforms are

01:52:17.870 --> 01:52:20.930
using the same thing, right? Obviously with the big cluster

01:52:20.930 --> 01:52:23.130
of the machine, but yeah, they're using that. The same

01:52:23.130 --> 01:52:25.710
thing. And internally it will be able to handle

01:52:25.710 --> 01:52:28.850
automatically a multi GPU. Let's suppose I'm using one GPU,

01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:31.670
but let's suppose I have a stack of GPUs, right? So

01:52:31.670 --> 01:52:35.570
internally it will be able to handle all of those multi GPUs

01:52:35.570 --> 01:52:39.110
and tensor because at the end of the day, the tokens, right?

01:52:39.370 --> 01:52:42.850
So compute is going to happen on a mathematical label and

01:52:42.850 --> 01:52:45.150
that is something called as that array is called as tensors.

01:52:45.230 --> 01:52:48.470
So basically it will be able to achieve a tensor parallelism

01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:52.410
automatically. So this is where this VLM library comes into

01:52:52.410 --> 01:52:57.450
action. In terms of implementation, it's nothing, believe

01:52:57.450 --> 01:53:00.170
me, let me show you that part, right? In terms of

01:53:00.170 --> 01:53:03.250
implementation, it's literally nothing that you all will be

01:53:03.250 --> 01:53:06.590
able to find out. So command wise, let me show you the

01:53:06.590 --> 01:53:11.390
command, um, how this command looks like in terms of serving

01:53:11.390 --> 01:53:15.810
a VLMs, right? So let me show you this.

01:53:19.730 --> 01:53:22.730
So this is the command. Now what this command is going to

01:53:22.730 --> 01:53:25.330
do. So first of all, this is going to install a VLM library.

01:53:25.810 --> 01:53:28.430
Right? The way we try to install Pandas, NumPy, any of the

01:53:28.430 --> 01:53:30.970
libraries in a similar manner. So we are trying to do pip

01:53:30.970 --> 01:53:37.550
install prebuilt VLMs, right? For a GPT OSS, simple. So this

01:53:37.550 --> 01:53:40.310
is our VLM we are trying to install. So we are trying to

01:53:40.310 --> 01:53:43.590
like, uh, build a wheel over here. We are trying to build it

01:53:43.590 --> 01:53:45.950
and we are saying that, that, okay, fine. So just try to

01:53:45.950 --> 01:53:51.850
install our VLMs for this GPT OSS because we are going to

01:53:51.850 --> 01:53:57.050
host a GPT OSS model. Let's suppose. If I'm running maybe a

01:53:57.050 --> 01:53:59.930
Lama series, then this command is going to change a little

01:53:59.930 --> 01:54:03.350
bit, right? So not a core one, by the way, this sort of GPT

01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:06.950
OSS, it will be Lama or it will be Falcon or maybe it will

01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:09.310
be some different cities, same changes you have to do over

01:54:09.310 --> 01:54:11.890
here and command easily. You will be able to find out on

01:54:11.890 --> 01:54:16.230
this VLM AI website itself. So it's like easy to get it. So

01:54:16.230 --> 01:54:19.710
they are giving you a proper documentation as well. So if

01:54:19.710 --> 01:54:22.630
you will come over here, right, you will be able to see a

01:54:22.630 --> 01:54:25.050
proper documentation or else you can go ahead and ask chat

01:54:25.050 --> 01:54:28.390
GPT. Or maybe like a URI basically, right? So they will,

01:54:28.390 --> 01:54:30.530
they will give you the complete, and it's just a command.

01:54:30.670 --> 01:54:32.970
It's just a piece piece of command that you all will be able

01:54:32.970 --> 01:54:37.630
to find out and like not difficult to understand. And then

01:54:37.630 --> 01:54:41.850
it is going to install it. So this is the command which I

01:54:41.850 --> 01:54:46.270
will be using to install a VLM, a GPT OSS based VLMs because

01:54:46.270 --> 01:54:51.550
we are going to use a GPT OSS model for Lama again, like I

01:54:51.550 --> 01:54:55.430
said, so just a small changes into a command. And you will

01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:59.890
be able to use it even with respect to a Lama. So okay, this

01:54:59.890 --> 01:55:04.730
is the VLM right hit enter and it will start downloading and

01:55:04.730 --> 01:55:08.650
it will start installing it. There is a command. So what is

01:55:08.650 --> 01:55:11.050
VLM? Basically VLM is a package builder.

01:55:15.770 --> 01:55:18.830
What is pagination? Pagination means one by one giving you a

01:55:18.830 --> 01:55:22.970
like a like a output one by one, one by one, not at once.

01:55:23.070 --> 01:55:26.370
And this VLMs framework has been designed in such a way that

01:55:26.370 --> 01:55:30.390
it can efficiently handle that. So basically it is a

01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:37.420
pagination while doing a inferencing in terms of token, your

01:55:37.420 --> 01:55:38.820
YouTube done that. Then it's amazing.

01:55:49.070 --> 01:55:53.410
VLM in backend uses a tensors. Yes. Yeah. So basically it's

01:55:53.410 --> 01:55:57.310
a PyTorch based like a build. So technically it is using a

01:55:57.310 --> 01:55:57.750
tensors.

01:56:07.310 --> 01:56:10.290
It's the same using pagination in Java. See I know the

01:56:10.290 --> 01:56:12.870
concept of pagination everywhere we use a pagination. So

01:56:12.870 --> 01:56:18.010
even in a, like a beside development, we try to use even

01:56:18.010 --> 01:56:21.190
with respect to a API. We try to use a pagination. It's a

01:56:21.190 --> 01:56:22.410
concept. It's available everywhere.

01:56:30.030 --> 01:56:33.950
My VLM is something we can use. So VLM is something we can

01:56:33.950 --> 01:56:36.950
use in a real world project as well. So VLMs are something

01:56:36.950 --> 01:56:40.550
that we all are using most of the time, even in real world.

01:56:41.690 --> 01:56:44.930
So whatever we are doing, it's a real world actually. So

01:56:44.930 --> 01:56:48.290
tomorrow you are going to host hundreds of your models, same

01:56:48.290 --> 01:56:49.790
approach, sir,

01:56:54.990 --> 01:56:57.090
my direction SMS is received, but hyperstack is still

01:56:57.090 --> 01:57:02.590
loading blank page. I don't know. Like it never gives me a

01:57:02.590 --> 01:57:05.590
problem by the way I can, and you can see like I'm able to

01:57:05.590 --> 01:57:10.860
run it right. So you just like a refresh it. It will work.

01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:15.920
It should work. It always works by the way. After tuning the

01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:18.980
LM model, can we get a result same like a GPT plus pro

01:57:18.980 --> 01:57:20.160
output? Obviously yes.

01:57:27.590 --> 01:57:30.930
So Bala is saying basically VLMs is used to launch a LMS

01:57:30.930 --> 01:57:33.630
model as an API with the optimized performance. Exactly

01:57:33.630 --> 01:57:39.040
Bala. You are correct. Can we host a multiple model in one

01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:41.440
time? Obviously I can host multiple models. So see I'm able

01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:45.880
to log in into like this system, right? I can open up 10

01:57:45.880 --> 01:57:51.160
such interfaces for the same machine. I can host it and

01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:56.010
everything will be up and running. So you can host any

01:57:56.010 --> 01:57:59.010
number of model in single machine, but again, it depends

01:57:59.010 --> 01:58:01.590
upon the traffic that you are handling, right? It's not

01:58:01.590 --> 01:58:04.450
about like hosting any machines because even in your local

01:58:04.450 --> 01:58:09.190
computer, your laptop or maybe your desktop, you used to

01:58:09.190 --> 01:58:12.650
open a multiple programs, right? Yeah. But yeah, so you feel

01:58:12.650 --> 01:58:16.350
stuck sometimes. So when you try to open some of the heavy,

01:58:16.410 --> 01:58:20.350
like a process driven or a heavy resource consuming

01:58:20.350 --> 01:58:23.090
programs. So same thing is going to happen even with respect

01:58:23.090 --> 01:58:24.230
to the machine.

01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:30.520
I check in a new type of data but still in a payment based

01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:33.400
loading might be a reduction issue. Yeah, maybe, maybe.

01:58:37.190 --> 01:58:40.830
So H100 compute will be shared among the many putty session.

01:58:41.230 --> 01:58:44.310
Putty is just a login. So just like you log in into your

01:58:44.310 --> 01:58:47.450
windows machine or laptop, right? So putty is just a login.

01:58:47.470 --> 01:58:50.210
Putty is just a interface by which you are logged in.

01:58:50.230 --> 01:58:52.970
Nothing more than that. Putty has nothing to do with how

01:58:52.970 --> 01:58:55.470
many sessions you are going to open up. You can open one,

01:58:55.570 --> 01:58:57.670
you can open a hundred, I'll show you like, let's suppose

01:58:57.670 --> 01:59:03.130
this is like an ongoing one, right? Let me open up, okay, so

01:59:03.130 --> 01:59:04.870
I have already done this.

01:59:09.690 --> 01:59:13.150
I can try to open up a duplicate session. So here I can go

01:59:13.150 --> 01:59:20.370
and click on duplicate session and log in as a UBUNTU. So

01:59:20.370 --> 01:59:24.090
yeah. I'm able to log in, right? So two times, one is here

01:59:24.090 --> 01:59:27.790
and one is here. Likewise I can log in 10 times. It's up to

01:59:27.790 --> 01:59:31.450
me. So maybe in one instance I'm running some of the Linux

01:59:31.450 --> 01:59:35.250
command, maybe this one. In another one, maybe I'm running a

01:59:35.250 --> 01:59:38.890
VLLM. So likewise I can try to open up 10 such like

01:59:38.890 --> 01:59:39.770
environments.

01:59:42.010 --> 01:59:44.690
Anyhow like Python environment is not activated. So maybe I

01:59:44.690 --> 01:59:49.810
can try activating my same Python environment here as well.

01:59:50.590 --> 01:59:53.470
Yeah. So now here as well, I have activated my same Python

01:59:53.470 --> 01:59:57.750
environment. Okay. So my VLLM is installed, right? My VLLM

01:59:57.750 --> 02:00:01.050
is installed. So once this VLLM installed, now we are only

02:00:01.050 --> 02:00:06.720
one step away and after this step, everything will be done.

02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:10.580
I can, I can start using the models, right? Let me show you

02:00:10.580 --> 02:00:15.000
that part. So VLLM configuration is done. This one. Now the

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:20.680
second command is this. That's it. VLLM. I have already

02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:24.040
installed in the previous step. Okay. So VLLM serve, serve

02:00:24.040 --> 02:00:27.520
what? So serve this model. So what it will do? So it will

02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:30.940
try to download this model, right? Automatically because we

02:00:30.940 --> 02:00:35.660
have configured a VLLM based on open AI, especially GPT OSS,

02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:38.460
which is an open source model by the way, right? Our port

02:00:38.460 --> 02:00:42.880
number is 8000 GPU memory utilization is 90%. So I'm not

02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:45.300
giving a hundred percent. I'm leaving 10% for some other

02:00:45.300 --> 02:00:49.300
one. Maybe you can try to keep it like a 70%, 60%, 50%,

02:00:49.300 --> 02:00:52.300
right? But ideally you should not give a hundred percent. So

02:00:52.300 --> 02:00:55.820
GPU, otherwise your entire system will be choked and you

02:00:55.820 --> 02:00:59.440
will not be able to even log in sometime. So maximum model

02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:05.760
length is equals to 8192. That is like a, uh, basically this

02:01:05.760 --> 02:01:07.980
is giving a, this, this is something which I'm trying to

02:01:07.980 --> 02:01:10.700
give as a token output. I can try to even like a change it,

02:01:10.760 --> 02:01:13.700
right? I can try to make it as a 1 million. I can try to

02:01:13.700 --> 02:01:16.340
make it maybe as a, like a lacks basically a hundred K or

02:01:16.340 --> 02:01:18.760
something like that. But if I'm going to increase that

02:01:18.760 --> 02:01:22.200
again, my inferencing time will be more. That's it. Right?

02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:24.300
So I'm just trying to say that, okay, fine. Generate a

02:01:24.300 --> 02:01:26.380
smaller, smaller, smaller token and keep on streaming it.

02:01:26.440 --> 02:01:29.640
Keep on streaming it. So in this way, my will be relaxed and

02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:32.540
it will keep on streaming the tokens output tokens by the

02:01:32.540 --> 02:01:38.760
way. Yeah. So this is right. So this is technically, and

02:01:38.760 --> 02:01:41.400
then I'll show you the actual magic. So just copy this

02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:45.440
command, paste it, and then I'll show you the actual magic.

02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:48.860
And now you will be able to understand how URI is working at

02:01:48.860 --> 02:01:50.900
least a little bit. You will be able to understand. And now

02:01:50.900 --> 02:01:53.760
you will, you will get an idea. Yeah. That how I will be

02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:56.400
able to create such kind of a system and monetize it,

02:01:56.420 --> 02:02:00.120
monetize it just by creating simple user interface. Let me

02:02:00.120 --> 02:02:03.160
show you this. So after this command, so maybe I can come

02:02:03.160 --> 02:02:06.240
here and then I can just try to execute this one hit enter

02:02:06.240 --> 02:02:09.260
and then sit tight.

02:02:31.490 --> 02:02:35.970
Yeah. So now my VLM is up as you can see a bigger VLM

02:02:35.970 --> 02:02:39.730
symbol. And now as you can see in my machine, it is

02:02:39.730 --> 02:02:42.390
downloading, right? It is downloading that model.

02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:48.880
So it's a GBs of download, but yeah, it's a cloud to cloud

02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:51.500
download. Nothing is happening in my system by the way,

02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:54.440
because my GPUs are available on a cloud and it is

02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:57.260
downloading something from the cloud. So it will be very,

02:02:57.320 --> 02:03:00.180
very fast. As you can see, the download speed is like a

02:03:00.180 --> 02:03:00.780
super fast.

02:03:13.620 --> 02:03:16.820
How you are creating a single API, just like one key and

02:03:16.820 --> 02:03:19.740
then value wise, so maybe a list of the values. So means

02:03:19.740 --> 02:03:23.720
like list of the models, it's like that mapping to a single

02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:30.860
key, that's a core logic behind that. Yeah. So we are not

02:03:30.860 --> 02:03:33.320
installing it, we are hosting it by the way, there is

02:03:33.320 --> 02:03:35.360
nothing called installation in terms of models. It's a

02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:40.450
weights, right? It's a file by the way. So now I will show

02:03:40.450 --> 02:03:40.950
you the magic.

02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:28.280
Yep.

02:04:31.250 --> 02:04:33.910
Sir, but it too costly. Obviously everything is costly,

02:04:34.050 --> 02:04:36.550
right? Like everything comes with a cost.

02:04:43.460 --> 02:04:47.060
Okay so download is done. It was a big one and as you can

02:04:47.060 --> 02:04:53.060
see, wait for open AI GPT OSS 20 billion is done, right? So

02:04:53.060 --> 02:04:55.340
this is the highlighted one. Where you will be able to see

02:04:55.340 --> 02:04:58.800
the wait download. So this is done. Just wait for a couple

02:04:58.800 --> 02:05:01.500
of more minutes so that it will be able to host it and then

02:05:01.500 --> 02:05:04.240
I will show you how to access that model.

02:05:09.450 --> 02:05:12.670
In one time set up, can we use the API for model calling

02:05:12.670 --> 02:05:15.050
every time we need to pay the money after some time or

02:05:15.050 --> 02:05:17.730
month. So as long as this will keep on running, you will

02:05:17.730 --> 02:05:20.470
have to pay. As long as you will be consuming them, you will

02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:21.850
be using the machine, you will have to pay.

02:05:25.830 --> 02:05:31.370
. But you should know, right? You should also know key. Like

02:05:31.370 --> 02:05:34.290
how to use it. How to create such kind of a system. That's

02:05:34.290 --> 02:05:36.570
the reason so you have joined this lecture. Otherwise what

02:05:36.570 --> 02:05:42.010
is the use of like joining my lecture, right?

02:05:49.910 --> 02:05:54.650
Okay just wait couple of more minutes. Okay it's like now

02:05:54.650 --> 02:05:55.350
hosting it.

02:06:40.230 --> 02:06:43.070
Okay so now it is trying to start my application, waiting

02:06:43.070 --> 02:06:45.830
for the application to start up. Application start up

02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:50.510
complete. Okay that's cool. And application is available as

02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:55.130
you can see on this particular URL. Now it is giving you

02:06:55.130 --> 02:06:59.570
0000. So this is basically a URL of local machine. Local

02:06:59.570 --> 02:07:02.810
machine means this machine, which I am using. It will be

02:07:02.810 --> 02:07:05.950
local to a cloud, right? The way, I have my own local

02:07:05.950 --> 02:07:08.830
machine. So this is giving you this one, but you will not be

02:07:08.830 --> 02:07:11.970
able to access at 0000 where you will be able to access by

02:07:11.970 --> 02:07:15.590
the way. Guys any idea? Yeah, where will you be able to

02:07:15.590 --> 02:07:18.970
access? See this is our local to a GPU, right? In whatever

02:07:18.970 --> 02:07:21.750
like a places or Canada, right? Okay. So basically this

02:07:21.750 --> 02:07:24.630
machine is available in Canada, so obviously for Canada for

02:07:24.630 --> 02:07:27.250
that location where this entire data center has been

02:07:27.250 --> 02:07:31.670
created, so it is basically local to that one, right. Yeah I

02:07:31.670 --> 02:07:34.090
think we all know the game, so everyone is saying public IP

02:07:34.090 --> 02:07:36.430
address, obviously yes. So you have to replace this one with

02:07:36.430 --> 02:07:38.470
the public IP address and then you will be able to access

02:07:38.910 --> 02:07:41.850
this one. Let me show you how you will be able to access it.

02:07:41.950 --> 02:07:49.640
So what was my public IP address by the way? So my public IP

02:07:49.640 --> 02:07:53.300
address, this is my virtual machine, right. Let me like

02:07:53.300 --> 02:07:57.160
click and this is my public IP address. This is something

02:07:57.160 --> 02:08:01.120
which I have used. So basically now it has started doing

02:08:01.120 --> 02:08:04.320
inferencing, right, it has started doing inferencing, leave

02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:06.320
it as it is. You don't have to do anything by the way,

02:08:06.420 --> 02:08:11.340
right, leave it as it is. Now so if you have to like because

02:08:11.340 --> 02:08:14.760
in this, because one process, for example you try to start a

02:08:14.760 --> 02:08:17.340
Python program, right, API testing. So you just leave it as

02:08:17.340 --> 02:08:19.420
it is, so just leave it as it is, this particular interface.

02:08:19.680 --> 02:08:23.260
In a separate interface. Maybe you can try to like write a

02:08:23.260 --> 02:08:27.340
code and there is a code called as watch, w-a-t-c-h, watch,

02:08:27.420 --> 02:08:33.780
watch what, so watch hyphen n1 and then n-v-i-d-i-a-s-m-i.

02:08:33.980 --> 02:08:38.380
So basically watch means it will try to show you the real

02:08:38.380 --> 02:08:42.260
time use of your graphics card. So whenever I am going to

02:08:42.260 --> 02:08:45.160
access, as of now it is 0%, right, as of now it is 0% and

02:08:45.160 --> 02:08:49.180
power by 77 watt it is using out of 350 watt. Now by the

02:08:49.180 --> 02:08:51.680
time I will start hitting my mouse. So this is the model in

02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:54.300
real time. So see even this is up and running, right, I am

02:08:54.300 --> 02:08:57.220
under this watch basically, right, and for every one second

02:08:57.220 --> 02:08:59.760
what it will do, number of second is equal to one, n is

02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:02.240
equal to one I have given. So it will try to show you that

02:09:02.240 --> 02:09:05.160
this consumption will go up, this consumption will go down.

02:09:05.500 --> 02:09:07.640
Automatically it will go up, it will go down, go up, go

02:09:07.640 --> 02:09:11.260
down. So as I will start doing the inferencing. Now how I

02:09:11.260 --> 02:09:14.000
can do the inferencing? That's a question. So see this is my

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.780
watcher. I have just enabled my watcher, yeah, I have just

02:09:16.780 --> 02:09:21.600
enabled my watcher and then on this window, right. So, so my

02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:25.020
model is up and running, yeah, my model is up and running.

02:09:25.160 --> 02:09:28.760
So I'll just leave it as it is. So how I will be able to

02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:31.700
access. So this is available on cloud and now let's suppose

02:09:31.700 --> 02:09:34.880
I would like to access it or maybe you would like to access

02:09:34.880 --> 02:09:37.500
it in my class. If let's suppose you would like to access

02:09:37.500 --> 02:09:40.620
this model, how you will be able to access this model, how

02:09:40.620 --> 02:09:43.620
you will be able to do the inferencing, the way you are

02:09:43.620 --> 02:09:47.980
doing inferencing with URI, yeah, with URI, let me show you

02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:50.840
that and then in a real time you will be able to see. The

02:09:50.840 --> 02:09:53.360
numbers will fluctuate, means consumption will go up and

02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:56.480
down. So as soon as you will start like, you know, doing the

02:09:56.480 --> 02:09:59.140
inferencing with my model. So shall we do the inferencing

02:09:59.140 --> 02:10:03.180
guys now? Okay. So command for watch is simple. Watch hyphen

02:10:03.180 --> 02:10:05.820
n one, one second. You can try to put up for two second as

02:10:05.820 --> 02:10:08.540
well and then NVIDIA SMI. So this is the NVIDIA SMI

02:10:08.540 --> 02:10:11.560
configuration. Shall we do it? Shall we do the inferencing?

02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:20.820
Yeah. So as we know and as you are able to see that this

02:10:20.820 --> 02:10:24.040
model is available at this location, right. But zero zero is

02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:26.880
for this local to this machine. So basically I have to use

02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:30.100
the IP address, the IP address, this public IP address, or

02:10:30.100 --> 02:10:33.920
maybe I can try to attach with some DNS, maybe, but by your

02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:36.900
own dot your own dot com, right. So I can try to just like,

02:10:36.980 --> 02:10:39.900
instead of hitting this IP address, technically when you are

02:10:39.900 --> 02:10:42.940
trying to hit your own dot one, you are hitting some IP

02:10:42.940 --> 02:10:45.740
address. We are just hiding that IP address and we are

02:10:45.740 --> 02:10:50.280
showing you the domain name basically. Right. So that, that

02:10:50.280 --> 02:10:52.400
I'll show you in a later stage, maybe sometime. Yeah. That

02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:55.700
how you can like bind with the DNS name. But yeah, as of now

02:10:55.700 --> 02:10:58.600
it's IP address and every URL that you hit, right. Every URL

02:10:58.600 --> 02:11:01.040
you hit on over the internet, technically it's IP address.

02:11:01.200 --> 02:11:03.980
Yeah. Technically it's IP address. So I just copied this one

02:11:03.980 --> 02:11:09.020
and if I have to access this particular model, right, let me

02:11:09.020 --> 02:11:12.520
show you how I will be able to access it and then you will

02:11:12.520 --> 02:11:16.720
feel like a, it's actually same, right. It's actually same

02:11:16.720 --> 02:11:22.400
as like a hitting a URI. Yeah. So. So let me open up my

02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:28.880
notebook. Fine. Now this is the IP address, right? Just try

02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:33.680
to attach before this, just try to attach HTTP, not S, not S

02:11:33.680 --> 02:11:36.360
as of now it's not secure. I have not like attached SSL

02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:40.700
certificate for this one, slash slash this IP address,

02:11:40.840 --> 02:11:44.680
right. And then colon at which port model has been hosted.

02:11:44.860 --> 02:11:47.400
So I believe it's visible over here. Right. Right. Port

02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:50.360
number is what? Port number is 8,000. Right. This is the 8

02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:53.480
,000 port number. And again, so in my command I have already

02:11:53.480 --> 02:11:56.400
given the port number, so it's not like system is selecting

02:11:56.400 --> 02:11:59.080
automatically. I have already given the port number 8,000.

02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:06.720
So here, colon 8,000. Yeah. 8,000. Slash. V1. Slash. Chat.

02:12:07.180 --> 02:12:07.600
Slash.

02:12:11.790 --> 02:12:18.720
Completion. C O M P L E T I O N. C O M P L E T I O N.

02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:23.660
Completion. Now this is your actual URL by which you will be

02:12:23.660 --> 02:12:26.880
able to do the inferencing. Can we say in a URI we get the

02:12:26.880 --> 02:12:31.840
similar kind of a URL? And even on any other system, let's

02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:34.280
suppose you are trying to use OpenAI, just go ahead and use

02:12:34.280 --> 02:12:36.800
OpenAI API, you will be able to get the similar kind of a

02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:41.280
URL. OpenAI then slash V1 or maybe V2 chat, slash chat,

02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:43.280
slash completion, slash embedding, something like that.

02:12:43.900 --> 02:12:49.280
Right. Can we say similar kind of a, like a URL we use?

02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:53.360
Yeah. Everywhere. Whether you are using URI, OpenAI or any,

02:12:53.400 --> 02:12:56.820
any other like APIs for LLMs, you will get almost like a

02:12:56.820 --> 02:13:01.480
similar kind of a things. Yeah. So how I will be able to

02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:07.300
like hit this one, hit this particular model. Let me, let me

02:13:07.300 --> 02:13:11.560
like show it to you. Yeah. Let me show it to you by the way.

02:13:11.900 --> 02:13:19.300
So here, this is the URL. Right. And I can try to use maybe

02:13:19.300 --> 02:13:23.880
a Python code and maybe I can try to use even a curl. Both

02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:27.240
is possible. Curl I can try to use. And if I don't want to

02:13:27.240 --> 02:13:31.800
use a Python code, so maybe I can try to use a curl and then

02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:35.640
I can try to hit as a chat completion. I will show you even

02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:39.160
a streaming means it will keep on giving you a data, right?

02:13:39.200 --> 02:13:41.940
It will keep on giving you the data. So let me show you with

02:13:41.940 --> 02:13:46.100
respect to a curl over here. So curl means kind of a Linux

02:13:46.100 --> 02:13:48.580
command. So by which you will be able to hit it. So this is

02:13:48.580 --> 02:13:53.040
the curl command, by the way, this is my URL. So I'll just

02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:59.640
try to replace it with my URL. So curl post my URL, right

02:13:59.640 --> 02:14:04.520
with my IP address, header content, JSON, BRL not needed

02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:07.560
means I have not attached the key. So I would like to

02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:10.280
attack. So it's just like a URI. We have attached the key on

02:14:10.280 --> 02:14:13.740
top of this one and I believe we all know how to attach a

02:14:13.740 --> 02:14:17.020
key with respect to the API. Now data wise means payload

02:14:17.020 --> 02:14:20.000
wise. This is the payload which I'm sending. So model OpenAI

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:25.140
OSS 20 billion parameter model, right? Message explain me

02:14:25.140 --> 02:14:29.260
the quantum mechanism and maximum token is equal to 200. I

02:14:29.260 --> 02:14:31.860
can give like a 2000 over here. That's completely cool.

02:14:32.560 --> 02:14:37.120
Maybe I can like give 2000 over here. So this is the curl

02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:40.400
command and see this is my IP address, right? This is my

02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:43.860
machine. The machine which I'm spinning as of now. Machine.

02:14:43.860 --> 02:14:46.340
Machine where I have hosted this one. So now this curl I can

02:14:46.340 --> 02:14:48.420
try to, I'll show you with Python as well. Just wait with

02:14:48.420 --> 02:14:50.660
Python also I'll show you those who are, because I have

02:14:50.660 --> 02:14:52.500
already discussed about the API. That's the reasons I have

02:14:52.500 --> 02:14:55.060
taken an API classes in the beginning itself because I know

02:14:55.060 --> 02:14:57.560
that that many times we will end up using API. So you should

02:14:57.560 --> 02:15:00.080
be comfortable with the APIs. You can try to hit it even

02:15:00.080 --> 02:15:04.940
with the postman or anywhere, right? I just need this URL. I

02:15:04.940 --> 02:15:07.820
just need a URL and load. And if there is a token like a

02:15:07.820 --> 02:15:09.760
key, I have to send the key. That's it. This is the meaning

02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:13.320
of the API. Nothing much. So here. If I'm going to call this

02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:17.840
one and maybe I can try to open up a power cell because

02:15:17.840 --> 02:15:20.460
inside my system I have a Ubuntu. Yeah.

02:15:25.510 --> 02:15:29.710
Now this curl, right? Hit enter. And let's see whether I'm

02:15:29.710 --> 02:15:32.450
able to inference with my machine or not. And then

02:15:32.450 --> 02:15:33.130
parallelly,

02:15:37.050 --> 02:15:43.030
let's see it is consuming. Okay. So application is startup

02:15:43.030 --> 02:15:44.570
complete. That's cool.

02:15:58.590 --> 02:15:59.630
It's waiting.

02:16:10.890 --> 02:16:13.470
This one is running. One.

02:16:22.910 --> 02:16:26.990
Twenty five. Two. One. Six. Twenty. Twenty. Two. Six.

02:16:27.110 --> 02:16:27.810
Twenty. Twenty. Two.

02:16:31.420 --> 02:16:38.380
Just wait. No. I have already like. It enters so many times.

02:16:58.560 --> 02:17:02.580
It's a public IP, right? So I think I must be able to

02:17:02.580 --> 02:17:05.760
access. Okay. Let me do one thing. Let me hit it from the

02:17:05.760 --> 02:17:12.980
machine itself. So this is my curl from a machine itself.

02:17:13.180 --> 02:17:17.660
I'll try to hit it. So new session. Sorry. Duplicate session

02:17:17.660 --> 02:17:18.920
login

02:17:22.210 --> 02:17:28.510
as U B U N T U Ubuntu. Okay. It

02:17:41.890 --> 02:17:47.330
has not changed. Ideally, it should change if it is using my

02:17:47.330 --> 02:17:47.710
model.

02:17:52.070 --> 02:17:55.190
Okay. So no,

02:18:03.370 --> 02:18:06.010
it is not able to hit.

02:18:27.160 --> 02:18:30.020
We'll check. We'll check. What is the issue? It should not

02:18:30.020 --> 02:18:34.200
be an issue. By the way, reaching out because from a machine

02:18:34.200 --> 02:18:36.760
itself, I'm trying to reach out to the same machine, right?

02:18:38.080 --> 02:18:40.680
I could have done. Okay. Let me change this one to zero zero

02:18:40.680 --> 02:18:44.160
because if I'm hitting from the same machine, it should even

02:18:44.160 --> 02:18:47.000
work with zero dot zero dot zero dot zero because it's local

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.760
to it. Right. So zero dot zero dot zero dot zero.

02:18:55.100 --> 02:18:59.420
Let me test. Anyhow, I'll make it work. So don't worry.

02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:06.040
Details not found. Which detail it is not able to found.

02:19:07.140 --> 02:19:13.600
Okay. So it is not able to find my URL. Okay. Fine. Got it.

02:19:26.110 --> 02:19:30.250
It will work. Anyhow guys, I'll make it work.

02:19:34.670 --> 02:19:37.210
Maybe it's just a catch issue. I'll have to restart because

02:19:37.210 --> 02:19:40.770
it should work. I can see my okay

02:19:42.980 --> 02:19:46.160
four zero four not found and this is for my zero dot zero

02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:50.760
dot zero dot zero. So basically it is able to hit my machine

02:19:50.760 --> 02:19:57.180
but with this IP address why it is not able to hit. This is

02:19:57.180 --> 02:20:01.280
the IP address one eighty five two one sixty. Yeah, that is

02:20:01.280 --> 02:20:10.160
IP address for my machine, but I am saying 0.0.0, 1.6 this

02:20:10.160 --> 02:20:20.100
is active, 185.2.1.6.20.22. 185.2.1.6.20.22, yeah, that is

02:20:20.100 --> 02:20:29.220
IP address, chat completions, okay, it should be S. S, that

02:20:29.220 --> 02:20:35.400
was the issue guys, only a spelling mistake I believe,

02:20:35.660 --> 02:20:41.180
because that is the, it's S, this is what I was thinking,

02:20:41.580 --> 02:20:42.680
yeah, now let's see,

02:20:47.380 --> 02:20:49.740
okay, so it

02:20:52.330 --> 02:20:55.230
is not able to reach out, even

02:21:18.590 --> 02:21:21.970
with 0.0.0 it should work, because it's local to it, right,

02:21:22.070 --> 02:21:26.970
so ideally it should work, 0.0.0.0, let

02:21:29.150 --> 02:21:34.670
me check, with this one, yeah, it's working actually, yeah,

02:21:34.770 --> 02:21:38.350
so from the same machine, 0.0.0, it's working, and I am able

02:21:38.350 --> 02:21:41.530
to like get the chat completion, so there is some problem

02:21:41.530 --> 02:21:44.470
with the IP address, means I am able to hit my machine

02:21:44.470 --> 02:21:48.750
technically, so see, I am able to hit the machine, and now,

02:21:48.950 --> 02:21:53.030
so if I will show you the consumption, consumption has again

02:21:53.030 --> 02:21:58.050
come down to 0, let me do it with a big chunk, so maybe I

02:21:58.050 --> 02:22:01.630
can give 2000 over here, 20. 2000 over here, output token

02:22:01.630 --> 02:22:10.250
wise, and now if I am going to hit my machine, yeah, and now

02:22:10.250 --> 02:22:14.010
if I will show you my NVIDIA consumption, yeah, see, it is

02:22:14.010 --> 02:22:16.930
increasing to 86%, are you able to see it guys, and even

02:22:16.930 --> 02:22:21.610
what has increased from 77 to 188, 189, 179, now it is

02:22:21.610 --> 02:22:25.090
decreasing, so now I am able to get the output, so now I am

02:22:25.090 --> 02:22:29.330
able to get the output from my self-hosted model, there is a

02:22:29.330 --> 02:22:29.950
problem with the IP address, there is a problem with the

02:22:29.950 --> 02:22:35.290
port number, let me fix that problem first of all, so yeah,

02:22:35.370 --> 02:22:38.790
locally I am able to hit it, so at 0.0.0, I am able to hit

02:22:38.790 --> 02:22:41.170
it, basically it

02:22:43.600 --> 02:22:47.520
is, I am not able to access it with the public IP address,

02:22:47.840 --> 02:22:51.200
let me check what is the issue with respect to the

02:22:51.200 --> 02:22:55.440
networking, public IP address is attached, public private

02:22:55.440 --> 02:23:00.740
access fine, private IP address is this, firewall, disable

02:23:00.740 --> 02:23:03.540
SSH. Okay, that's

02:23:38.580 --> 02:23:40.000
fine, inbound

02:23:56.960 --> 02:24:04.140
rule, so TCP is fine, IPV and okay,

02:24:05.640 --> 02:24:10.360
port range is, okay, fine, there is an issue with this port

02:24:10.360 --> 02:24:15.100
range guys, so from outside, so port range is 8088, by

02:24:15.100 --> 02:24:17.300
default, I don't know, like by mistake I have mentioned this

02:24:17.300 --> 02:24:20.760
part, that was the, see port range is the only problem, my

02:24:20.760 --> 02:24:24.100
port was actually 8000, and here, so this is the port range

02:24:24.100 --> 02:24:26.240
which has been given, which is incorrect. So the only

02:24:26.240 --> 02:24:31.440
culprit was a port number, I will give one hyphen, 8, not

02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:33.800
8000, generally I give like, I don't know why I have done

02:24:33.800 --> 02:24:36.760
this mistake, because every time I used to give this one, so

02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:40.200
that it will be open up all the port, the only problem was,

02:24:40.240 --> 02:24:44.320
culprit was this guys, let me delete this one, yeah, because

02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:46.980
of this, it was not allowing me from the IP address,

02:24:54.020 --> 02:25:00.040
okay, from outside, so let me hit this one, from a public

02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:04.460
site by the way, so port range is this, and now it should

02:25:04.460 --> 02:25:09.440
work, so copy the IP address, maybe I will have to restart

02:25:09.440 --> 02:25:13.500
the machine, but yeah, it will work, because there is no

02:25:13.500 --> 02:25:20.260
issue at all, okay, now, so let me hit it with the IP

02:25:20.260 --> 02:25:21.780
address, now

02:25:32.020 --> 02:25:34.640
it's working, see, the only problem was port number by the

02:25:34.640 --> 02:25:39.420
way, now it is working, and now all of you can hit it, from

02:25:39.420 --> 02:25:43.120
anywhere, from your system, right, now anyone can access my

02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:46.460
machine by the way, now anyone can use my machine So, here I

02:25:46.460 --> 02:25:49.360
am using a chat completion, let me show you a streaming,

02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:52.620
streaming you will literally like, seems like a wow, wow, by

02:25:52.620 --> 02:25:56.240
the way, so to do a streaming, we just have to like, add one

02:25:56.240 --> 02:26:02.000
more command or one more parameter over here, so here, just

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:05.180
down below this max token, I can try to attach one more

02:26:05.180 --> 02:26:11.620
parameter, STREAM, STREAM is equals to TRUE, true, and this

02:26:11.620 --> 02:26:14.940
is how actually chat GPD works, actually. I'll show you how

02:26:14.940 --> 02:26:17.740
so see I'm giving 20,000 token right and I'm asking one

02:26:17.740 --> 02:26:20.840
question right I'm asking one of the question so instead of

02:26:20.840 --> 02:26:24.380
like a waiting for all the tokens to be generated it will

02:26:24.380 --> 02:26:27.580
generate stream generate stream generate stream so this is

02:26:27.580 --> 02:26:30.220
how streaming works I'll show you that streaming just wait

02:26:30.220 --> 02:26:38.110
so here clear right and even in chat GPT even in any modern

02:26:38.110 --> 02:26:40.750
system Gemini or PopXLT it will keep on streaming the data

02:26:40.750 --> 02:26:44.790
right so the only parameter is stream is equal to true now

02:26:44.790 --> 02:26:48.070
hit it now see are you able to see the streaming guys

02:26:48.070 --> 02:26:53.210
everyone it keeps on generating the tokens so my inferencing

02:26:53.210 --> 02:26:55.990
is a continuous one right it will keep on generating the

02:26:55.990 --> 02:26:59.770
tokens and then yeah so once like all the answers are done I

02:26:59.770 --> 02:27:03.070
will be able to get the final answer right so in a packets

02:27:03.070 --> 02:27:06.910
it will keep on sending the data as simple as that yeah so

02:27:06.910 --> 02:27:10.110
in a packet it will keep on sending me the data so

02:27:15.550 --> 02:27:18.250
v1 chat completion or completion how. So by the way if you

02:27:18.250 --> 02:27:18.250
have any questions please do not hesitate to ask me in the

02:27:18.250 --> 02:27:21.530
comments. So by default your VLM is doing it that slash v1

02:27:21.530 --> 02:27:24.810
slash chat slash completion right it's been attached by VLMs

02:27:24.810 --> 02:27:28.490
this is where VLMs comes into a picture yeah now if you

02:27:28.490 --> 02:27:31.150
would like to try out my model right if you would like to

02:27:31.150 --> 02:27:34.310
try out my model I'm pinging you this command try this out

02:27:34.310 --> 02:27:37.690
let me remove that stream yeah

02:27:39.900 --> 02:27:43.680
so now you can hit my model and you can watch my model here

02:27:43.680 --> 02:27:47.420
the congestion by I can I can just watch it here as well as

02:27:47.420 --> 02:27:50.460
I can watch it here in both the places. So if someone. If

02:27:50.460 --> 02:27:52.260
someone is using my model right I will be able to see it

02:27:52.260 --> 02:27:58.660
here as so okay 400 bad request 404 405 method not allowed

02:27:58.660 --> 02:28:02.460
just copy it in a better way yeah I can see it like if

02:28:02.460 --> 02:28:04.640
people are hitting it and if people are able to get the okay

02:28:04.640 --> 02:28:05.880
response 200 okay response

02:28:14.900 --> 02:28:20.760
why it is giving 405 400 guys like 404 means not found so

02:28:20.760 --> 02:28:27.700
maybe you are using okay let me let me let me just just just

02:28:27.700 --> 02:28:31.540
a minute just a minute. So power cell okay

02:28:48.120 --> 02:28:51.900
maximum token after that there is a comma oh by mistake I

02:28:51.900 --> 02:28:56.040
have not removed this comma remove the comma guys I have

02:28:56.040 --> 02:28:58.780
written one more parameter right stream parameter and I have

02:28:58.780 --> 02:29:02.640
not removed the comma after that so because of this it is

02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:08.200
giving you the issue yeah now it is 200 now it's 200 and you

02:29:08.200 --> 02:29:10.480
can see that that I'm hitting from my local machine from my

02:29:10.480 --> 02:29:14.320
machine right from my machine no no no just hit it the only

02:29:14.320 --> 02:29:18.040
problem was comma. After max token 20000 so we all had to

02:29:18.040 --> 02:29:23.620
put the comma and and yeah see I am able to get the response

02:29:23.620 --> 02:29:28.020
a big one maybe just try to change like a to 20000 to

02:29:28.020 --> 02:29:32.680
something and just see my utilization so it's 90%

02:29:32.680 --> 02:29:36.900
utilization right and some of you maybe like a 10 people 20

02:29:36.900 --> 02:29:42.940
people are trying to hit my machine just imagine this H100

02:29:42.940 --> 02:29:46.800
GPU for which I am paying one and half dollar per hour.

02:29:46.820 --> 02:29:53.200
Right one and half dollar per hour but still many of you are

02:29:53.200 --> 02:29:57.720
not able to get 200 many of you are getting 400 right 405

02:29:57.720 --> 02:30:03.940
maybe not available so just imagine that how much resource

02:30:03.940 --> 02:30:06.980
consuming it is although we have used everything in

02:30:06.980 --> 02:30:09.880
optimized way we are using VLLM right so by default it's

02:30:09.880 --> 02:30:12.600
optimized one right by default it's optimized like a

02:30:12.600 --> 02:30:15.320
resource optimized way. We are like getting a resource

02:30:15.320 --> 02:30:18.860
consumption. But. But even in that situation my utilization

02:30:18.860 --> 02:30:25.440
is going 90% right my utilization is literally going 90%. So

02:30:25.440 --> 02:30:31.440
this one single H100 is not enough to serve even maybe like

02:30:31.440 --> 02:30:33.000
200 300 people at a time

02:30:42.150 --> 02:30:46.510
yes and that is something that you all should know we all

02:30:46.510 --> 02:30:49.530
are using LLMs right we all are using chat GPT PopXLT and

02:30:49.530 --> 02:30:53.350
Gemini and like all of these system but just imagine like

02:30:53.350 --> 02:30:57.370
how much we are burning on that. That's the reason so none

02:30:57.370 --> 02:30:59.490
of these companies are profitable everyone is burning like a

02:30:59.490 --> 02:31:03.010
VC's money yeah and that's the reason so many startups right

02:31:03.010 --> 02:31:06.370
many startups are not able to you know like build this kind

02:31:06.370 --> 02:31:08.750
of a system or they are and we are just doing an inferencing

02:31:08.750 --> 02:31:10.850
we are not even talking about the training part by the way

02:31:10.850 --> 02:31:14.210
yeah. So training again like data processing your entire

02:31:14.210 --> 02:31:21.670
pipeline cluster of GPUs is required so this is a reality so

02:31:30.150 --> 02:31:32.210
yeah we can we can go ahead with the optimization we can try

02:31:32.210 --> 02:31:34.710
to put it in our queue. But again it will not give a better

02:31:34.710 --> 02:31:37.350
user experience because whenever a user is trying to hit a

02:31:37.350 --> 02:31:42.170
system they want a response very quick right. So basically

02:31:42.170 --> 02:31:45.190
we have to instead of using this one single machine we have

02:31:45.190 --> 02:31:47.890
to use a cluster of machine so that's the reason they are

02:31:47.890 --> 02:31:50.870
hyper in a hyper stack you will be able to find out one

02:31:50.870 --> 02:31:53.570
machine two machine four machine eight machines and you can

02:31:53.570 --> 02:31:56.830
try to you attach 80 machines as well so that it will be

02:31:56.830 --> 02:31:59.210
able to do a load balancing it will be able to do a load

02:31:59.210 --> 02:32:01.250
distribution automatically across a machine.

02:32:06.290 --> 02:32:08.510
Is there any way to limit this? Did the API hit per second

02:32:08.510 --> 02:32:12.810
yeah obviously we used to write a late rate limiter on top

02:32:12.810 --> 02:32:18.730
of that yes Ubuntu is needed for running this command no I

02:32:18.730 --> 02:32:21.870
think you should you must have got go through the lecture of

02:32:21.870 --> 02:32:25.290
a API Ubuntu is not required you can try to use it anywhere

02:32:25.290 --> 02:32:29.750
it is a API right fundamentals of APIs and like all of these

02:32:29.750 --> 02:32:32.930
things I have already discussed in my API classes I have

02:32:32.930 --> 02:32:36.650
already started my this particular batch from my API. Okay.

02:32:36.750 --> 02:32:39.990
So. So let's suppose I would like to like access it from the

02:32:39.990 --> 02:32:43.050
Python code right. So from Python code I would like to

02:32:43.050 --> 02:32:46.050
access it not an issue I can access it from the Python code

02:32:46.050 --> 02:32:50.350
as well so maybe I can try to open up my VS code let me open

02:32:50.350 --> 02:32:54.970
up some Jupyter notebook somewhere okay so some test Jupyter

02:32:54.970 --> 02:32:59.230
notebook or maybe I can create one any Jupyter notebook test

02:32:59.230 --> 02:33:07.040
IP why you can try to use maybe like a Google collab if you

02:33:07.040 --> 02:33:11.080
want that's also fine. Yeah. That is also fine you can try

02:33:11.080 --> 02:33:15.780
to use a Google collab. So here I'm just trying to import

02:33:15.780 --> 02:33:19.300
open AI because it's a open AI based model in case of URI

02:33:19.300 --> 02:33:23.840
what we have done we have just created a wrapper right

02:33:23.840 --> 02:33:26.580
created a wrapper basically so that you will be able to

02:33:26.580 --> 02:33:31.460
access 2529 models but here it's a direct open AI so I can

02:33:31.460 --> 02:33:35.080
just try to call open AI over here and if it's not installed

02:33:35.080 --> 02:33:38.220
you can you have to install it then I have to give this URL.

02:33:38.220 --> 02:33:41.420
So which URL by the way I have to give over here so

02:33:41.420 --> 02:33:46.260
basically I have to give the same URL a machine URL by the

02:33:46.260 --> 02:33:51.060
way yeah this one so just try to give this URL if you are

02:33:51.060 --> 02:33:55.470
trying to use it through a Python code so just give your

02:33:55.470 --> 02:34:02.130
public IP address yeah slash v1 so this is the base URL do

02:34:02.130 --> 02:34:04.730
we need a key no I have not attached any kind of a key by

02:34:04.730 --> 02:34:09.130
the way then open AI chat completion. So slash chat slash

02:34:09.130 --> 02:34:11.330
completion. So this will be handled by this one this

02:34:11.330 --> 02:34:14.050
function from the open AI which model we are trying to

02:34:14.050 --> 02:34:18.190
access 20B right from this particular URL and then explain

02:34:18.190 --> 02:34:21.150
the quantum mechanism stream is equals to true whatever you

02:34:21.150 --> 02:34:25.450
would like to like make it make it as it is and then for so

02:34:25.450 --> 02:34:28.410
it will keep on giving you the responses this is the

02:34:28.410 --> 02:34:30.910
response right. So once it will keep on giving you the

02:34:30.910 --> 02:34:34.470
response you can try to basically one by one inside a loop

02:34:34.470 --> 02:34:37.750
you can try to print it. So let me hit this one with the

02:34:37.750 --> 02:34:45.630
help of. Python code no module open AI okay good pip install

02:34:45.630 --> 02:34:50.230
open AI in my system this environment by the way okay

02:34:52.380 --> 02:34:57.940
requirement satisfied you try to access open AI chat

02:34:57.940 --> 02:35:00.940
completion but there is no longer supported in open AI

02:35:00.940 --> 02:35:05.580
greater than one okay you can migrate to automatically

02:35:05.580 --> 02:35:11.480
upgrade your code base to use a this one fine. Let's

02:35:11.480 --> 02:35:15.900
downgrade my open AI to open AI. Let me try to do that. I

02:35:15.900 --> 02:35:16.860
will just.

02:35:22.340 --> 02:35:30.920
Restart my kernel. And now hit it. Are we able to do a

02:35:30.920 --> 02:35:35.240
streaming guys. Yeah. How are you able to generate the

02:35:35.240 --> 02:35:38.100
responses and do a streaming. I think this is how chat

02:35:38.100 --> 02:35:40.500
happens right with the chat GPT or anyone.

02:35:43.400 --> 02:35:48.540
Yeah. Again, let me execute it once again. Right. See the

02:35:48.540 --> 02:35:51.120
magic. Now this this looks actually cool, right? It's

02:35:51.120 --> 02:35:54.460
nothing, but yeah, it looks cool actually. So see, I'm able

02:35:54.460 --> 02:35:57.560
to generate the response one by one, one by one, one by one.

02:35:57.600 --> 02:36:02.940
I'm able to generate it. Right. So yeah, it has generated as

02:36:02.940 --> 02:36:05.540
per the token limit, which I have given. So if you would

02:36:05.540 --> 02:36:07.540
like to generate anywhere, maybe you can use a Google

02:36:07.540 --> 02:36:12.180
collab. If you're, this one is not ready and just use this

02:36:12.180 --> 02:36:16.040
one. Just hit my machine.

02:36:23.780 --> 02:36:29.240
Fine. So in reality, right, in reality, this is something

02:36:29.240 --> 02:36:32.620
which happens. This is how we are going to host a model.

02:36:32.780 --> 02:36:35.360
This is how we are going to do a inferencing. Okay. Someone

02:36:35.360 --> 02:36:39.640
is hitting my model. I can see it. So in reality, this is

02:36:39.640 --> 02:36:42.520
how like things is going to happen. So let's suppose if I

02:36:42.520 --> 02:36:45.260
have to host one model or maybe a hundred model, maybe for

02:36:45.260 --> 02:36:48.100
an embedding, maybe for like chat completion, maybe for an

02:36:48.100 --> 02:36:50.700
image generation, maybe for a video creation, right?

02:36:50.760 --> 02:36:53.440
Anything means literally anything, right? You can try to

02:36:53.440 --> 02:36:56.600
host all. Of these model in this way, you can try to expose

02:36:56.600 --> 02:37:00.060
those model to the outer world, right? You can. So instead

02:37:00.060 --> 02:37:02.920
of like this IP address that all of you are able to see,

02:37:03.040 --> 02:37:06.940
right? Just try to bind it with your own, like a DNS name,

02:37:06.980 --> 02:37:11.060
like a domain name server, domain name server, or your own

02:37:11.060 --> 02:37:14.820
URL, right? For example, in our cases, we have your own dot

02:37:14.820 --> 02:37:18.400
one. And then after that, there will be slash V1 slash chats

02:37:18.400 --> 02:37:21.600
as completion, then slash V1 slash chat slash embeddings.

02:37:21.800 --> 02:37:24.440
Just try to change this one. Ultimately, it will. Hit the IP

02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:26.740
address of the machine, but you will, as a user, you will

02:37:26.740 --> 02:37:29.020
not be able to see it. You will not be able to see that

02:37:29.020 --> 02:37:33.240
particular IP address, but in a backend, it's same. And then

02:37:33.240 --> 02:37:37.900
if you have this URL and if you have a payload, hit the

02:37:37.900 --> 02:37:42.500
model with curl, with maybe a postman, with maybe a Python

02:37:42.500 --> 02:37:46.280
code, with a Java code, with a C, C plus plus node, whatever

02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:52.770
you want, just hit it from anywhere, any machine. Yeah. From

02:37:52.770 --> 02:37:54.750
anywhere, any machine, you will be able to hit it and you

02:37:54.750 --> 02:37:58.290
will be able to. Use it. So is it interesting guys to all of

02:37:58.290 --> 02:38:05.720
us? Yeah. Yes. This is how in reality things works. And, and

02:38:05.720 --> 02:38:08.200
you can see that you can see the limitation as well, right?

02:38:08.520 --> 02:38:11.680
That my consumption is literally going 90%. I have set my

02:38:11.680 --> 02:38:15.860
GPU at 90%, right? When I was running this LLMs, VLLMs, I

02:38:15.860 --> 02:38:18.860
said that, okay, fine. Just try to use maximum 90%. So it is

02:38:18.860 --> 02:38:22.060
fluctuating around a 90%, right? 91% max to max, but not

02:38:22.060 --> 02:38:25.540
more than that. It will go. But with a 90% of consumption,

02:38:25.740 --> 02:38:29.500
right? With a 90% of consumption, I'm able to serve maybe

02:38:29.500 --> 02:38:33.860
like a 20, 30 user or maybe a hundred user only. If I have

02:38:33.860 --> 02:38:37.000
to solve maybe a thousand user, just imagine how many

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:38.320
machines that I need.

02:38:46.140 --> 02:38:52.220
Yeah. How many machines that we need? It's working right for

02:38:52.220 --> 02:38:57.380
all of you. Yes. So when I'm going to teach you even Yuri

02:38:57.380 --> 02:39:00.180
and now see, let's suppose if I'm trying to teach you agents

02:39:00.180 --> 02:39:02.880
from next week onwards, if I'm going to teach you agents,

02:39:03.020 --> 02:39:06.680
obviously you need LLMs. Right? You can host your own LLMs

02:39:06.680 --> 02:39:10.820
and you can use your own LLMs. Simple. Even in your company,

02:39:10.960 --> 02:39:13.560
right? Every time your manager will come and say, okay,

02:39:13.600 --> 02:39:16.420
fine. So use your own LLMs. We don't have trust on any third

02:39:16.420 --> 02:39:21.440
party. Okay, fine. Go ahead. Use it. Are those companies

02:39:21.440 --> 02:39:25.760
profitable? None. ChatGPT, not profitable. PuppetsLady, not

02:39:25.760 --> 02:39:29.440
profitable. CloudA, Anthropic CloudA, again, not profitable.

02:39:29.780 --> 02:39:34.460
They have, I think, raised a big money now, right? Right.

02:39:36.540 --> 02:39:39.780
There are only three, ideally there are only four to five

02:39:39.780 --> 02:39:42.280
players in the market, right? Who have built literally a

02:39:42.280 --> 02:39:45.740
world-class model, right? Literally a world-class model,

02:39:45.860 --> 02:39:48.720
which all of us are using it, right? Maybe as a wrapper,

02:39:48.880 --> 02:39:52.780
maybe as a direct model, or maybe as in their app itself. If

02:39:52.780 --> 02:39:56.080
I'll talk about PuppetsLady, so I don't think they have like

02:39:56.080 --> 02:40:01.040
their own best model. They are ultimately using GPTs and

02:40:01.040 --> 02:40:02.640
CloudA, Sonnet and all those models.

02:40:06.140 --> 02:40:09.760
Google only profitable, not that division. Right? Not that

02:40:09.760 --> 02:40:12.080
division, I would say. Their other divisions are profitable.

02:40:16.810 --> 02:40:20.050
Can we build our own RIG in-house using this like URI?

02:40:20.150 --> 02:40:21.710
Obviously, this is what I'm trying to teach you, right?

02:40:23.930 --> 02:40:28.930
Yeah. And just imagine how much we are burning on URI. Is

02:40:28.930 --> 02:40:33.070
your own profitable? Not at all. Not even close to it. Do

02:40:33.070 --> 02:40:35.310
you think that we are profitable just by selling like

02:40:35.310 --> 02:40:38.890
affordable courses and providing all of these services? Not

02:40:38.890 --> 02:40:41.410
possible. We are also burning a lot.

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.300
Yeah, everyone is in loss, so do we.

02:40:54.040 --> 02:40:57.020
So the same moment the image will be duplicate on all the

02:40:57.020 --> 02:41:00.740
multiple blade. Yes, yeah, and traffic will be managed by

02:41:00.740 --> 02:41:03.420
Kubernetes. So basically, there will be a Kubernetes which

02:41:03.420 --> 02:41:05.580
will try to manage the traffic just like a master slave

02:41:05.580 --> 02:41:08.360
architecture, it will try to manage. So basically, they're

02:41:08.360 --> 02:41:10.480
using already K8 and you don't have to configure it.

02:41:10.520 --> 02:41:13.260
Basically, it will do it automatically.

02:41:16.160 --> 02:41:18.620
Just don't sell the company, sir. No, we won't do it this

02:41:18.620 --> 02:41:18.780
time.

02:41:22.860 --> 02:41:27.600
Okay. Anyone hosting LLMs is not profitable? Yeah. See, if

02:41:27.600 --> 02:41:30.500
you are trying to provide LLMs to n number of users, right,

02:41:30.560 --> 02:41:34.580
you will not be profitable. You will be profitable once you

02:41:34.580 --> 02:41:37.880
are able to derive the use cases out of it and then you are

02:41:37.880 --> 02:41:40.020
not charging for LLMs, you are charging maybe for something

02:41:40.020 --> 02:41:42.980
different, right, which every companies are doing it. For

02:41:42.980 --> 02:41:44.960
example, service-based companies, right? So they are

02:41:44.960 --> 02:41:47.400
basically building a product for their clients and then

02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:49.960
clients are eventually using some LLMs or maybe fine-tuned

02:41:49.960 --> 02:41:52.860
version or something like that. So obviously, the service

02:41:52.860 --> 02:41:53.900
companies are profitable. They are not profitable because

02:41:53.900 --> 02:41:56.400
they are not burning their money on a GPU, right? They are

02:41:56.400 --> 02:41:58.900
just using it. They are serving for their client and then

02:41:58.900 --> 02:42:01.360
it's fine. Like client will take care of everything. So

02:42:01.360 --> 02:42:04.780
there are different models in the market, a business model,

02:42:04.840 --> 02:42:09.280
by the way. And yeah, so it's not like you will just go

02:42:09.280 --> 02:42:12.200
ahead and like configure hundreds of GPUs and then you will

02:42:12.200 --> 02:42:15.420
say, okay, I'll provide LLMs because this is the bottleneck.

02:42:15.440 --> 02:42:18.040
This is the main bottleneck that you all will see.

02:42:21.520 --> 02:42:21.880
Yeah.

02:42:27.300 --> 02:42:29.820
With this business model, how much time? I think it's a

02:42:29.820 --> 02:42:31.320
separate discussion. We should not do it here.

02:42:34.580 --> 02:42:38.660
If everyone faces a loss, then who makes a profit? The one

02:42:38.660 --> 02:42:42.520
who will be in a market for next one decade, they will make

02:42:42.520 --> 02:42:47.240
a profit. This is how business happens, right?

02:42:49.340 --> 02:42:51.740
Everyone is trying to do a user acquisition and then they

02:42:51.740 --> 02:42:54.800
will start charging you heavily. Once they will be able to

02:42:54.800 --> 02:42:55.420
get their dominance.

02:42:59.170 --> 02:43:02.710
So then API key is good rather than running the server.

02:43:02.870 --> 02:43:04.750
Depends upon your use case, right? Right. Right. Right.

02:43:04.750 --> 02:43:07.810
Right. So if someone is having an issue with sharing a data

02:43:07.810 --> 02:43:10.970
over like some different server, in that case, obviously,

02:43:10.970 --> 02:43:13.510
no, you will not be able to use the API key. Your client

02:43:13.510 --> 02:43:19.590
will not allow it. Geo Airtel policy. Exactly. Yeah. I think

02:43:19.590 --> 02:43:24.110
we all know this case, right? And now you have to pay,

02:43:24.210 --> 02:43:29.590
basically, right? We all are paying for Geo and Airtel. And

02:43:29.590 --> 02:43:33.330
everyone, like I remember like five or eight years back,

02:43:33.410 --> 02:43:36.870
there were so many telecom providers, right? Right. And now,

02:43:36.870 --> 02:43:38.990
obviously, major one is BSNL from a government side, which

02:43:38.990 --> 02:43:42.950
is gone. There was an Airtel. There was a Vodafone. So many,

02:43:43.050 --> 02:43:46.750
actually. Like there was, I don't even able, I'm not able to

02:43:46.750 --> 02:43:49.250
recall the name because since last 10 years, I'm using

02:43:49.250 --> 02:43:53.710
Airtel. So it's just Airtel for me. 11 years. So I'm using

02:43:53.710 --> 02:43:56.650
Airtel. But yeah, there was so many, Uninor or something,

02:43:56.790 --> 02:44:00.250
which I'm able to recall. So there are so many like players

02:44:00.250 --> 02:44:03.010
in the market and everyone has gone. Now there are only two.

02:44:03.130 --> 02:44:06.270
And that too in India-like market, right? So where we have 1

02:44:06.270 --> 02:44:10.710
.5%. 5 billion population, right? One of the world's largest

02:44:10.710 --> 02:44:16.530
populous country. Idea, Vodafone, Uninor, MTS, Docomo. Yeah.

02:44:16.650 --> 02:44:26.210
Yes. Yes. Yes. Right. And like, anyone has gone. Is it

02:44:26.210 --> 02:44:28.930
possible information can be still in open source model? That

02:44:28.930 --> 02:44:32.490
is not possible, right? See, I'm using my system. See, this

02:44:32.490 --> 02:44:35.370
system is mine, right? This system is mine. Everything is

02:44:35.370 --> 02:44:37.890
running in my environment. How anyone can steal my

02:44:37.890 --> 02:44:41.550
information? Not possible. Unless and until you are not

02:44:41.550 --> 02:44:47.440
sharing your private key. Yeah. No one, no one can like

02:44:47.440 --> 02:44:50.080
steal anything from here. This is the one of the secure

02:44:50.080 --> 02:44:54.220
system. You know, on telegram. First, education should work,

02:44:54.260 --> 02:44:59.440
not restarting. Sell free and acquire all. Yeah, but that

02:44:59.440 --> 02:45:03.220
strategy never works everywhere. Like that strategy works in

02:45:03.220 --> 02:45:06.100
some of the market segment. But I have seen that will not

02:45:06.100 --> 02:45:09.280
work everywhere. So hope all of you have enjoyed. All of you

02:45:09.280 --> 02:45:13.320
are able to get a reality check. Basically how to do this,

02:45:13.320 --> 02:45:15.820
like an installation, how to do this kind of a setup, right?

02:45:16.140 --> 02:45:19.640
I will be sharing this document. So this document, maybe

02:45:19.640 --> 02:45:22.220
even if you are going to follow it after a couple of years,

02:45:22.460 --> 02:45:25.740
just one by one line by line, execute the command and you

02:45:25.740 --> 02:45:27.960
will be able to test it, right? This is how I've created

02:45:27.960 --> 02:45:31.560
this document. And yeah, so this will be shared inside your

02:45:31.560 --> 02:45:36.560
dashboard, by the way, proper, well-documented line by line,

02:45:36.580 --> 02:45:40.400
line by line, line by line. We just had five steps. We

02:45:40.400 --> 02:45:43.020
didn't have like more than five steps. So all of these steps

02:45:43.020 --> 02:45:45.000
are already mentioned, even for our testing. Everything is

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:50.040
mentioned over here. Just use it experimented. Try to spend

02:45:50.040 --> 02:45:52.720
a couple of dollars that will give you a real knowledge. I

02:45:52.720 --> 02:45:57.100
believe, right? That will give you a real reality check to

02:45:57.100 --> 02:46:01.640
all of you, right? And then in case of any kind of a doubt,

02:46:01.760 --> 02:46:06.000
do let me know. Yeah, do let me know. I'll try to resolve

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:11.060
it. So this is the part. Number one, only one that we are

02:46:11.060 --> 02:46:14.220
able to complete it. Now, if you are can host a completion

02:46:14.220 --> 02:46:17.180
model, chat completion model, embedding model, any model,

02:46:17.340 --> 02:46:20.500
anyone will be able to host it. Yeah, just a little bit

02:46:20.500 --> 02:46:23.360
changes into a last line of command VLM command. That's it.

02:46:24.340 --> 02:46:27.760
This is not going to be a big deal. I will try to show you

02:46:27.760 --> 02:46:31.780
in 15-20 minutes itself. How to configure email for SMS and

02:46:31.780 --> 02:46:35.140
WhatsApp. I'll show you my like a prod account. Basically.

02:46:35.140 --> 02:46:38.400
I'm using a services from a Vati. Vati is a service provider

02:46:38.400 --> 02:46:41.280
for SMS and WhatsApp. There are other service provider as

02:46:41.280 --> 02:46:44.640
well, but that account is already set for me. So I'll try to

02:46:44.640 --> 02:46:47.320
show you show you that how you can send a WhatsApp messages

02:46:47.320 --> 02:46:50.720
and email without any account email. Everyone can configure

02:46:50.720 --> 02:46:53.260
it. No time like there are two ways. So one way I'm going to

02:46:53.260 --> 02:46:55.580
show you a simple one where you will be able to configure

02:46:55.580 --> 02:46:57.700
the email. So it does not take more than 15-20 minute of

02:46:57.700 --> 02:47:00.940
time for me. So both of this one email and WhatsApp both I

02:47:00.940 --> 02:47:03.600
will show you but WhatsApp you will not be able to practice

02:47:03.600 --> 02:47:06.140
it because you need a corporate account. You need a

02:47:06.140 --> 02:47:07.940
registered account. And you need approval from Facebook

02:47:07.940 --> 02:47:11.900
basically. So as a single user you will not be able to do it

02:47:11.900 --> 02:47:15.520
but email. Yeah, you will be able to configure it and then

02:47:15.520 --> 02:47:18.400
hosting on some cloud platform. We'll try to show you vector

02:47:18.400 --> 02:47:21.220
DB with the structured data again. Not a big game. I will

02:47:21.220 --> 02:47:24.800
try to show you and storing all of this document that you

02:47:24.800 --> 02:47:28.140
are uploading over a AWS cloud that also I'll try to show

02:47:28.140 --> 02:47:30.920
you the biggest part was this one rest is very like a

02:47:30.920 --> 02:47:33.220
easiest steps that we can try to follow.

02:47:36.210 --> 02:47:41.770
Yeah. Will command the same for Windows base? No, it is not

02:47:41.770 --> 02:47:45.670
going to be same and don't try to run it on a Windows. You

02:47:45.670 --> 02:47:49.890
will get a lot of issues. So just avoid it use Linux or any

02:47:49.890 --> 02:47:51.050
like this kind of a hosting.

02:47:54.710 --> 02:47:58.010
Okay, fine guys. So I'll share this. I'll upload this entire

02:47:58.010 --> 02:48:02.070
document and everything inside your dashboard so that you

02:48:02.070 --> 02:48:04.810
all will be able to download it and it will be with you as

02:48:04.810 --> 02:48:08.150
long as you will be having a dashboard access. So with that,

02:48:08.150 --> 02:48:12.470
thank you so much. Everyone. This is it from my side. I

02:48:12.470 --> 02:48:14.650
think we have already made an announcement with respect to

02:48:14.650 --> 02:48:18.390
the new okay. Still someone is using my GPUs. Okay, good use

02:48:18.390 --> 02:48:22.910
it. So I believe we are done for today's class and I have

02:48:22.910 --> 02:48:25.730
already made an announcement as well that which batch is

02:48:25.730 --> 02:48:29.170
going to start some batches will be taken care by me. Some

02:48:29.170 --> 02:48:32.690
batches someone else is taking and even for kids. I have

02:48:32.690 --> 02:48:35.930
launched the batches. So I had a interest in terms of

02:48:35.930 --> 02:48:40.990
teaching a young generation our kids. A small small kids

02:48:40.990 --> 02:48:44.330
that how to use a AI how to keep yourself relevant in our

02:48:44.330 --> 02:48:47.490
age of AI. So if you know someone if you have a kids you can

02:48:47.490 --> 02:48:50.690
ask them to join. It's not costly again offer the will I'm

02:48:50.690 --> 02:48:52.790
going to take the post personally. I'm going to take some of

02:48:52.790 --> 02:48:54.970
the class. It's not some of the classes this entire batch. I

02:48:54.970 --> 02:48:57.890
will be taking maybe in upcoming batches. I'll try to deploy

02:48:57.890 --> 02:49:01.010
some other mentors. But yeah, even but I have already shared

02:49:01.010 --> 02:49:03.530
also share with my friend. Thank you. That's great. Thank

02:49:03.530 --> 02:49:07.470
you so much. It'll yeah, it will be fun by the way. Yeah, it

02:49:07.470 --> 02:49:11.890
will be fun. For anyone everyone please upload system design

02:49:11.890 --> 02:49:15.270
videos on a master series. Yeah, I'm like that. You can say

02:49:15.270 --> 02:49:18.270
it will take time many people are like scolding me for that

02:49:18.270 --> 02:49:22.610
because it's getting delayed. But yeah, the reality is I'm

02:49:22.610 --> 02:49:28.070
also a human being and that to be the limited resources and

02:49:28.070 --> 02:49:29.290
trying to manage things.

02:49:31.830 --> 02:49:34.630
Thank you so much. Anoop. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks

02:49:34.630 --> 02:49:37.270
everyone. Thanks. And yeah, if your friends is coming by

02:49:37.270 --> 02:49:40.370
you. So maybe you can ask my team to give you additional

02:49:40.370 --> 02:49:43.450
discount will be happy to do that. We don't have any kind of

02:49:43.450 --> 02:49:46.230
a issue at the end of the day. I just wanted to teach as

02:49:46.230 --> 02:49:49.570
many people as possible, right? So that you're on can be

02:49:49.570 --> 02:49:52.610
profitable. We can go for a very long time. We can keep on

02:49:52.610 --> 02:49:56.570
teaching. We can keep on serving to everyone. Yeah, can I

02:49:56.570 --> 02:49:58.570
join you on sir as a how

02:50:00.650 --> 02:50:03.630
can you carry with our team for like sales and marketing? So

02:50:03.630 --> 02:50:05.550
number is already given. So if you'll go to a website,

02:50:05.690 --> 02:50:09.430
right? So just go to a footer and then you will be able to

02:50:09.430 --> 02:50:12.590
see. See two numbers. So two numbers. I have already given

02:50:12.590 --> 02:50:15.730
over there. It's a sales and marketing team. So anyone can

02:50:15.730 --> 02:50:17.990
connect and if someone is looking for discount, maybe

02:50:17.990 --> 02:50:21.030
someone is coming through you or maybe XYG. Someone is

02:50:21.030 --> 02:50:23.150
taking a kids you're on or something young you're on

02:50:23.150 --> 02:50:27.490
basically. So yeah. So fine guys with that, thank you so

02:50:27.490 --> 02:50:29.950
much. I'm done with today's class. So those who is having

02:50:29.950 --> 02:50:32.630
any kind of a doubt, please be here. Those who is not having

02:50:32.630 --> 02:50:35.510
a doubt, you can drop off now and we'll continue with the

02:50:35.510 --> 02:50:38.530
class tomorrow. Same time. So those who is having a doubt,

02:50:38.630 --> 02:50:40.890
please raise your hand. I'll start taking your doubts now.

02:50:41.910 --> 02:50:44.210
Yeah. So Naresh, go ahead. Anil, go ahead. Akash, go ahead.

02:50:44.250 --> 02:50:48.970
Heetal, go ahead. Yeah. Yeah. Hi Siddhanshu, Naresh here.

02:50:49.250 --> 02:50:53.490
Yeah Naresh, go ahead. Yeah. So my first question is you see

02:50:53.490 --> 02:50:58.290
we have seen A100 and H100. So what does it what different

02:50:58.290 --> 02:51:03.750
does it make? Which one? Which one? In VM creation, we have

02:51:03.750 --> 02:51:08.350
seen several options like H100 mission, A100 mission, right?

02:51:08.690 --> 02:51:13.450
Yeah. Yeah. So A100 is even like bigger than this H100. So

02:51:13.450 --> 02:51:16.010
basically there is a different different GPU CPU is

02:51:16.010 --> 02:51:19.130
basically graphics card, right? And everything comes with a

02:51:19.130 --> 02:51:21.710
different different capacity. So H100 will be having a

02:51:21.710 --> 02:51:24.350
different configuration again inside H100. There will be

02:51:24.350 --> 02:51:27.930
multiple series just like your like a i3, i5, i7 you use,

02:51:27.970 --> 02:51:31.090
right? So different for configuration. So likewise GPU is

02:51:31.090 --> 02:51:33.530
having a names and with names configuration will be

02:51:33.530 --> 02:51:38.030
different. Okay. So let's say now we are running the model

02:51:38.030 --> 02:51:42.490
successfully, right? If any error occurs in between or it

02:51:42.490 --> 02:51:45.650
went into infinite loop. So what will happen in that case?

02:51:45.890 --> 02:51:48.930
No, just run it and then leave it. Run it and leave it. Your

02:51:48.930 --> 02:51:51.430
server should be up and running, right? Your VLM should keep

02:51:51.430 --> 02:51:54.690
on serving. So if it goes to infinite loop, model goes to

02:51:54.690 --> 02:51:57.870
infinite loop. I have observed couple of times this issue.

02:51:57.970 --> 02:52:01.290
That's why. So model will go into an infinite loop. Then

02:52:01.290 --> 02:52:04.170
what you are expecting from user side or server side? Server

02:52:04.170 --> 02:52:08.250
side. So maybe you can apply rate limit. Apply rate limit.

02:52:08.450 --> 02:52:11.630
Every. Everyone even inside a URI, right? If you will be

02:52:11.630 --> 02:52:14.390
able to see we have applied a rate limit 50 messages per

02:52:14.390 --> 02:52:18.290
day. Apply rate limit. If someone is crossing more than that

02:52:18.290 --> 02:52:22.530
plus token limit. So for one single hit how many tokens it

02:52:22.530 --> 02:52:24.810
should yield. That's the first part number one because it

02:52:24.810 --> 02:52:27.530
will not go into an infinite loop because once it will

02:52:27.530 --> 02:52:29.150
produce that many number of tokens, it will stop

02:52:29.150 --> 02:52:31.910
automatically. For example, in my case, I have given 20,000,

02:52:31.910 --> 02:52:35.110
right? It will not generate tokens more than 20,000 at all.

02:52:35.290 --> 02:52:38.630
So even if your client is in an infinite loop, doesn't

02:52:38.630 --> 02:52:40.830
matter. At all. My server will never go in an infinite loop.

02:52:41.370 --> 02:52:45.050
And then like that is the first point first check token

02:52:45.050 --> 02:52:50.030
limit. And then second is basically a rate limit. Okay, and

02:52:50.030 --> 02:52:54.370
basically if we run more just kind of applications, right?

02:52:54.410 --> 02:52:59.590
We use PM to so that if npm actually npm npm build. No, no.

02:52:59.590 --> 02:53:04.190
PM to service. We use in case a server goes wrong. It will

02:53:04.190 --> 02:53:10.110
restart the service. Not just service, right? No. Okay. So

02:53:10.110 --> 02:53:13.230
such kind of thing like if any error occurs, it got closed.

02:53:13.470 --> 02:53:16.570
So is there any tool is there, you know, to restart

02:53:16.570 --> 02:53:20.350
basically like MongoDB MongoDB service is there. So it will

02:53:20.350 --> 02:53:23.170
out of system will automatically restart it, right? Mm-hmm.

02:53:23.990 --> 02:53:27.950
Like this. If model model got closed, how do how do it

02:53:27.950 --> 02:53:30.930
restarts automatically? Or do we just we just tried a simple

02:53:30.930 --> 02:53:33.690
plain cell script and we say that okay fine. So when this is

02:53:33.690 --> 02:53:36.370
not running run it once again, so kill the previous process

02:53:36.370 --> 02:53:41.030
and run it once again. Simple. Okay. It's a cell script that

02:53:41.030 --> 02:53:43.330
we are running right at the end. That's true. So yeah, got

02:53:43.330 --> 02:53:47.610
it. Got it. And next question. Like if I now if I stop the

02:53:47.610 --> 02:53:50.490
system and I start the system again, do I need to follow all

02:53:50.490 --> 02:53:53.330
the process or last step is enough to only last step only

02:53:53.330 --> 02:53:57.070
last only last last step is only last. Yeah, not all the

02:53:57.070 --> 02:54:03.430
steps. Can I can you explain like differences between VLLM

02:54:03.430 --> 02:54:07.690
and Ollama like what to choose? What are basically Ollama?

02:54:07.690 --> 02:54:10.650
Ollama Ollama is also giving you all of this access but

02:54:10.650 --> 02:54:13.970
Ollama majorly compatible with the open baby UI and Ollama

02:54:13.970 --> 02:54:17.770
is giving you its own chat interface as well. So it's just

02:54:17.770 --> 02:54:22.170
another version you can say or another library which has

02:54:22.170 --> 02:54:25.130
been built one is a VLLM. Then there is a hugging face

02:54:25.130 --> 02:54:27.610
transformer library. Then there is a Ollama kind of a

02:54:27.610 --> 02:54:30.730
library. Ultimately everyone is helping you out in terms of

02:54:30.730 --> 02:54:34.470
doing a serve but VLLM is one of the best in terms of doing

02:54:34.470 --> 02:54:37.850
a pagination in terms of running or handling. A GPUs and

02:54:37.850 --> 02:54:40.950
inferencing in parallel basically. So Ollama is also a

02:54:40.950 --> 02:54:43.850
framework but yeah majorly Ollama supports Ollama baby UI

02:54:43.850 --> 02:54:49.930
and open baby UI. So are there any hidden costs are there in

02:54:49.930 --> 02:54:54.190
this VM because VM cost we have seen $1.5 something per

02:54:54.190 --> 02:54:57.150
hour, right? Is there any data transfer costs also they

02:54:57.150 --> 02:55:00.970
consider actually actually from public access, right? So

02:55:00.970 --> 02:55:03.910
when you will commence your entire system in a bottom they

02:55:03.910 --> 02:55:08.810
will show you that that cost. Yeah, and again so every like

02:55:08.810 --> 02:55:10.730
provider will show you a different different cost. Some

02:55:10.730 --> 02:55:13.550
provider are asking you for a data transfer even for a

02:55:13.550 --> 02:55:17.030
network bandwidth users some like so there will be a

02:55:17.030 --> 02:55:19.370
different cost and some people will just give you a flat

02:55:19.370 --> 02:55:21.870
cause that okay fine use for this many hours. This is the

02:55:21.870 --> 02:55:26.150
cost. So I think HyperStack is much more sorted in that term

02:55:26.150 --> 02:55:30.390
costing wise. Okay. Yeah, that's it. Thank you. Thank you so

02:55:30.390 --> 02:55:34.410
much. Okay. Thanks. Okay. Go ahead Akash. Go ahead. So so

02:55:34.410 --> 02:55:38.990
that's when I am. Running it on using my own like post API.

02:55:39.210 --> 02:55:45.590
So I think like maybe port number. I'm not able to match

02:55:45.590 --> 02:55:48.770
like how you match it like the support range that you share

02:55:48.770 --> 02:55:51.110
the screen share the screen. I'll I'll say it. Yeah, share

02:55:51.110 --> 02:55:58.330
it. Now. Lingo summer. Sumo. Hi. Hi. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Hi.

02:55:58.410 --> 02:56:01.270
Please go ahead. Yeah. Yeah. I should say about the

02:56:01.270 --> 02:56:04.410
pagination, right? Well, what does it mean the pagination in

02:56:04.410 --> 02:56:07.730
that one? Pagination means let's suppose we understand

02:56:07.730 --> 02:56:10.910
pages, right? For example, books. Yeah. So in a book, there

02:56:10.910 --> 02:56:14.490
will be multiple pages, right? So book itself is a big

02:56:14.490 --> 02:56:17.250
content, right? So what people have done, they have divided

02:56:17.250 --> 02:56:20.450
that content into one one pages so that as a user, you will

02:56:20.450 --> 02:56:23.470
go ahead with one page at a time in a similar manner here.

02:56:23.630 --> 02:56:27.350
So let's suppose I'm trying to produce a 50,000 token, but I

02:56:27.350 --> 02:56:29.990
will not try to yield all of those 50,000 token at once.

02:56:30.150 --> 02:56:33.710
What I will do 5000 or maybe 2000 then 2000 then 2000 then

02:56:33.710 --> 02:56:37.310
2000 just like a pages. That is called as pagination. So

02:56:37.310 --> 02:56:39.670
even in website load, right? Whatever website that you are

02:56:39.670 --> 02:56:42.690
using in real time, whether Amazon flipkart or even our your

02:56:42.690 --> 02:56:46.090
own website, so everything it will not load at once. Once

02:56:46.090 --> 02:56:48.570
you will scroll, right? So on the scroll, it will keep on

02:56:48.570 --> 02:56:51.770
loading, but you will not feel like it's loading again and

02:56:51.770 --> 02:56:54.310
again, but actually it's loading one by one on every

02:56:54.310 --> 02:56:57.750
scrolls. It's not loading at a time. So basically we have

02:56:57.750 --> 02:56:59.570
configured a server in such a way that it will look real

02:56:59.570 --> 02:57:03.210
time, but actually it is loading page by page. So one home

02:57:03.210 --> 02:57:05.870
page itself. If you'll go to your own page. On right. So one

02:57:05.870 --> 02:57:08.750
home page itself. It loads in three to four times three to

02:57:08.750 --> 02:57:15.550
four pages. And one more doubt for example. Now when you

02:57:15.550 --> 02:57:20.130
create any system as a transaction data, like for example,

02:57:20.130 --> 02:57:26.450
in my company, we are we are like a small system. We will

02:57:26.450 --> 02:57:29.850
create the users. We will assign the users with the

02:57:29.850 --> 02:57:33.190
accommodations or anything like a transactional screens. Is

02:57:33.190 --> 02:57:40.170
it possible to do this activities in the chat in the in the

02:57:40.170 --> 02:57:44.610
in the agentic a application without a genetic also, it's

02:57:44.610 --> 02:57:46.990
possible agentic is nothing but just a function with the LM

02:57:46.990 --> 02:57:51.190
access without also agentic also, it is possible. Without

02:57:51.190 --> 02:57:55.890
without HMS. How do we need to maintain the screen like that

02:57:55.890 --> 02:57:59.810
or just to chat? We can do this activities. We can do this

02:57:59.810 --> 02:58:06.190
activities just assigning the users to that. But I like

02:58:06.190 --> 02:58:12.650
calling the API rag using these features, right? Yeah, let's

02:58:12.650 --> 02:58:14.890
let's join couple of more classes. I think then your

02:58:14.890 --> 02:58:18.170
understanding will be clear. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank

02:58:18.170 --> 02:58:22.830
you. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Anil go ahead and Akash

02:58:22.830 --> 02:58:25.890
share your screen. I think you are facing some issue, right?

02:58:26.010 --> 02:58:29.550
So share it. Yeah, in between. So Anil go ahead with your

02:58:29.550 --> 02:58:36.190
question. Yeah. One of the questions. Same only. Okay. Okay.

02:58:36.430 --> 02:58:40.770
Okay. It's clear, right? Okay. I hope you can see the

02:58:40.770 --> 02:58:44.190
screens. Yeah, cuz I can see your screen. Let me check. What

02:58:44.190 --> 02:58:47.790
is the issue? Yeah, I ran it with your one. It is working

02:58:47.790 --> 02:58:52.890
good. But when I tried it with my one, you can see you have

02:58:52.890 --> 02:58:57.390
given 1000 port number. It's actually I tried with 8000. It

02:58:57.390 --> 02:59:00.870
was not working and this is other is why I'm getting like it

02:59:00.870 --> 02:59:04.390
is getting logged off. Again and again, like after just two,

02:59:04.510 --> 02:59:07.210
three minutes off. So maybe you're so the reason only reason

02:59:07.210 --> 02:59:09.490
is your network is not stable. Your internet is not stable.

02:59:10.350 --> 02:59:13.470
Okay, but anyhow server will run. See, even if you are going

02:59:13.470 --> 02:59:16.030
to close this putty, right? Putty is just a client. Your

02:59:16.030 --> 02:59:19.850
server will up and running by the way. So even if you are

02:59:19.850 --> 02:59:22.190
going to close a putty, your server will be up and running.

02:59:24.340 --> 02:59:27.500
Oh, it should like so the consumption increase or decrease

02:59:27.500 --> 02:59:31.380
what it is like staying zero. No, no, just just go do one

02:59:31.380 --> 02:59:33.240
thing. Go to your VLM hosting last part.

02:59:36.490 --> 02:59:46.950
This one. No, no, this one like a putty. Okay. Close it. Not

02:59:46.950 --> 02:59:52.310
I mean like control C. Actually that was not working. I

02:59:52.310 --> 02:59:56.230
tried it. No, everything was everything was actually give me

02:59:56.230 --> 02:59:58.970
give me the control. Okay, I'll do it from my side.

03:00:02.850 --> 03:00:05.850
What is your IP address? Just log in log in into your

03:00:05.850 --> 03:00:06.930
system. Yeah, just a little.

03:00:11.170 --> 03:00:13.690
You can even save it. So you don't have to like do it again

03:00:13.690 --> 03:00:16.690
and again. There is a save option. I'll show you that part

03:00:16.690 --> 03:00:21.990
as well. Okay. Just wait, wait, wait. No, no, no, no, no. Go

03:00:21.990 --> 03:00:26.800
go to the home screen. Go to home screen. Session. Session.

03:00:26.960 --> 03:00:30.280
Session. Yeah. Now just give a name session saved setting.

03:00:30.420 --> 03:00:34.080
Give a name. Give a name. Yeah. Now save it. Click on save.

03:00:34.420 --> 03:00:39.180
Yeah. Now click on load. Select the selected. Okay. Open it.

03:00:39.200 --> 03:00:41.520
Open it. Open it. From next time. You can just try to like,

03:00:41.640 --> 03:00:45.080
you know, it won't have to, you know, again and again, give

03:00:45.080 --> 03:00:45.540
a key.

03:00:49.160 --> 03:00:50.080
Hmm. Login.

03:00:58.720 --> 03:01:02.800
Fine. And on the last part. No, no, no, no. All these things

03:01:02.800 --> 03:01:05.380
you don't have to run. Okay. So environment, right? Yeah.

03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:11.140
Now run the last part, but with the 8,000 port number. Hmm.

03:01:12.840 --> 03:01:14.920
Fine. 8,000. Okay. Got it. Run it.

03:01:26.330 --> 03:01:31.350
In between. Show me your hyper stack dashboard. Hmm. Go to

03:01:31.350 --> 03:01:38.640
network. Is it working? Hmm. Public IP attached. Fine. Go to

03:01:38.640 --> 03:01:47.050
firewall. Hmm. Disable access. Switch off. Yes. Come down.

03:01:48.230 --> 03:01:51.590
Down, down, down, down, down. Outbound. You have not defined

03:01:51.590 --> 03:01:54.250
inbound. Go up. Go up. That's a problem. Inbound was a

03:01:54.250 --> 03:01:59.990
problem. Yeah. Now give a range. Yes. Add. That was a

03:01:59.990 --> 03:02:03.250
problem. It was. Yeah. I got it. Got it. Right. Now you will

03:02:03.250 --> 03:02:05.250
not face the problem. You will be able to hit it. Just like

03:02:05.250 --> 03:02:07.590
you are able to hit it. Mine. Okay.

03:02:11.880 --> 03:02:15.380
Wait. Uh, if you're like a server is up. Yeah. I think it

03:02:15.380 --> 03:02:17.880
just started getting. Yeah. Now you are able to see, right?

03:02:17.960 --> 03:02:20.720
88%. Yeah. I can see it. Yes. That was the only issue. It

03:02:20.720 --> 03:02:24.220
was not allowing your inbound traffic inside traffic. Yeah.

03:02:24.440 --> 03:02:29.360
Thank you so much. Yeah. Thanks. Okay. Anyone else is facing

03:02:29.360 --> 03:02:34.320
any issues? One issue. Not issue. Yeah. Go ahead. Go ahead.

03:02:34.380 --> 03:02:39.160
First. Then next one. Yeah. So you have listed your code

03:02:39.160 --> 03:02:43.300
that in Python, but it is giving me error in opening a chat

03:02:43.300 --> 03:02:50.100
completion dot create line. Hmm. So me. Okay. So I'm

03:02:50.100 --> 03:02:52.320
promoting you as a panelist. Yeah. And he got the question.

03:02:53.500 --> 03:02:58.960
Uh, as we like, uh, using the cloud for bay. So can we have

03:02:58.960 --> 03:03:02.420
a similar setup at home? Like, is there, but you have to

03:03:02.420 --> 03:03:05.740
like a buy H 100 kind of system and not just one, you have

03:03:05.740 --> 03:03:09.660
to buy multiple one. And let me show you the current price

03:03:09.660 --> 03:03:21.400
of H 100. So H 100 GPU price in India is 2,090,000. 29,00

03:03:21.400 --> 03:03:26.440
,000. Okay. I'm not 20. I'm not, not 29. I'm sorry. No, no,

03:03:26.460 --> 03:03:30.940
no, no. It should not be that much. Oh no. Uh, Nvidia H

03:03:30.940 --> 03:03:36.640
quarter. I think it's two or three. Okay. 30 X higher.

03:03:36.840 --> 03:03:40.440
Little bit higher. Let me check the actual price. Okay. So

03:03:40.440 --> 03:03:44.840
one GPU that we have commenced today. Right. So price of one

03:03:44.840 --> 03:03:47.900
single GPU is the one that we are using a TGV, right? This

03:03:47.900 --> 03:03:50.780
is something that we were using today. Right. And the price

03:03:50.780 --> 03:03:56.020
of that one is 34,00,000. So yeah, it's 29, 29,00,000. Now

03:03:56.020 --> 03:03:59.940
you can take a decision. Yeah. I didn't, it'll make your

03:03:59.940 --> 03:04:02.480
life easy in terms of taking a decision. Right. 34 light.

03:04:02.520 --> 03:04:05.080
Just imagine. And if you're, if I'm coming in like 10. So

03:04:05.080 --> 03:04:08.900
GPU is literally very like, there is a reason why startups

03:04:08.900 --> 03:04:11.900
are crying in India, right? There is a very, very big

03:04:11.900 --> 03:04:14.900
reason. Uh, every startup is trying, right? Including us.

03:04:15.100 --> 03:04:18.060
Uh, when we like try to give this kind of a services, this

03:04:18.060 --> 03:04:20.340
is the cost. And if we are going out with the cloud again,

03:04:20.480 --> 03:04:25.500
it's a huge cost. And again, if, even if I'm going to take

03:04:25.500 --> 03:04:28.700
one unit, it will not make any changes for me. I don't need

03:04:28.700 --> 03:04:32.680
only one unit. I need at least 200 plus units to serve, like

03:04:32.680 --> 03:04:36.140
to build something like a, uh, reliability. And just do the

03:04:36.140 --> 03:04:44.120
calculation. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. Just, just wait.

03:04:44.280 --> 03:04:46.820
Yeah. Uh, yes. You can share the screen. Okay.

03:04:55.670 --> 03:05:01.850
Hmm. What is the issue? Not really this, uh, uh, response.

03:05:02.030 --> 03:05:04.450
Open it. Show me the error. What is the error? By the way?

03:05:04.770 --> 03:05:05.170
Hmm.

03:05:09.560 --> 03:05:13.800
Go down, go down. OPI base URL, 8,000 to be one. That's

03:05:13.800 --> 03:05:18.020
fine. Okay. Hmm. Do this one. Yeah. So basically it's

03:05:18.020 --> 03:05:22.000
installing, uh, 1.2, 1.0 or something, but yeah, it's not

03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:23.240
compatible. Just install this.

03:05:35.360 --> 03:05:35.800
Okay.

03:05:39.020 --> 03:05:39.880
Okay. Okay.

03:05:42.960 --> 03:05:46.320
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

03:05:46.320 --> 03:05:46.560
Okay. Okay.

03:05:49.760 --> 03:05:57.260
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

03:05:59.860 --> 03:06:03.000
Okay. Okay.

03:06:05.740 --> 03:06:06.800
Okay.

03:06:10.480 --> 03:06:18.440
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. 9 lakhs

03:06:18.440 --> 03:06:20.720
rupees and then you are buying maybe hundreds of GPUs right

03:06:20.720 --> 03:06:26.060
so utna into utna ho gaya but after that so networking at

03:06:26.060 --> 03:06:28.880
least you have to keep one very good network engineer that's

03:06:28.880 --> 03:06:33.000
another part then another part is cooling which will give

03:06:33.000 --> 03:06:36.700
you a lakhs and lakhs of bill for couple of GPUs not for

03:06:36.700 --> 03:06:40.280
like thousands or hundred GPU just for couple of GPUs it

03:06:40.280 --> 03:06:42.580
will give you a lakhs and lakhs of monthly electricity bill

03:06:42.580 --> 03:06:46.180
and then you have to create a complete storage a cold

03:06:46.180 --> 03:06:48.820
storage basically you have to create a proper cold storage

03:06:48.820 --> 03:06:52.480
are you able to run it or is it like yes I think it will

03:06:52.480 --> 03:06:55.100
work I don't think that I don't see any reason for not

03:06:55.100 --> 03:06:56.600
working yes

03:07:03.000 --> 03:07:07.560
it has started like streaming the data just like you see the

03:07:07.560 --> 03:07:13.620
data is streaming in a yes it's feeling very nice when we

03:07:13.620 --> 03:07:17.980
are seeing output yeah it looks amazing a kind of a matrix

03:07:17.980 --> 03:07:23.020
kind of feeling yeah and one more one more thing we are

03:07:23.020 --> 03:07:27.380
using that API key we are not using it we are not using it

03:07:27.380 --> 03:07:30.380
that's the reason not needed right okay okay there is there

03:07:30.380 --> 03:07:32.820
is no beer I have not attached so I have just opened up my

03:07:32.820 --> 03:07:36.080
entire server technically you are hitting my server right

03:07:36.080 --> 03:07:39.160
and I have not attached any kind of a password in between

03:07:39.160 --> 03:07:42.940
password layer in case of a URI I have attached it so that

03:07:42.940 --> 03:07:46.020
in a in case of URI you have to give API key but the server

03:07:46.020 --> 03:07:48.480
demo which I am showing you here I have not attached so far

03:07:48.480 --> 03:07:50.480
I can attach it like that will take another half an hour or

03:07:50.480 --> 03:07:55.040
500 times for me okay sir okay okay because in production we

03:07:55.040 --> 03:07:58.220
need that API key used yeah obviously obviously in a URI

03:07:58.220 --> 03:08:01.600
like we are using it so like API key you have to generate in

03:08:01.600 --> 03:08:03.860
case of URI right and then only you will be able to hit the

03:08:03.860 --> 03:08:06.260
model so yeah in a production obviously you have to like a

03:08:06.260 --> 03:08:09.500
protect it okay sir okay thank you so much yeah thanks

03:08:09.500 --> 03:08:16.240
thanks okay so next question for me Bala please go ahead sir

03:08:16.240 --> 03:08:22.320
I just have curiosity like is the If VLN continuously up and

03:08:22.320 --> 03:08:27.700
running, does it cause any cache issue? No, it will not see

03:08:27.700 --> 03:08:29.740
the cache issue. It's just like a function, right? So

03:08:29.740 --> 03:08:33.180
basically you are trying to put something as an input, as an

03:08:33.180 --> 03:08:35.700
argument, and then you are able to get the return. So there

03:08:35.700 --> 03:08:38.680
is no cache issue you will see in general. So unless and

03:08:38.680 --> 03:08:41.760
until you are not maintaining heavy logs. Yeah, if you are

03:08:41.760 --> 03:08:44.860
maintaining the heavy logs, then this issue you might face.

03:08:44.940 --> 03:08:50.040
But as of now, I am not maintaining that part. One more

03:08:50.040 --> 03:08:53.900
question, I am just curious about, if we have one server,

03:08:54.160 --> 03:08:59.940
like we have a H182GP server, so if these servers are

03:08:59.940 --> 03:09:07.100
handling 20 to 25 requests at a time, if we pass more than

03:09:07.100 --> 03:09:10.900
100 requests, then how it will be? So basically, from a

03:09:10.900 --> 03:09:13.620
program side, you have to handle the queues. Otherwise, it

03:09:13.620 --> 03:09:17.060
will start giving you 400, 400, 400. Server? Server is not

03:09:17.060 --> 03:09:21.720
available, not available, kind of. Yeah, so generally we try

03:09:21.720 --> 03:09:23.880
to set it in a queue. But again, when you are setting it up

03:09:23.880 --> 03:09:26.160
in a queue, and if you are getting a high traffic, that is a

03:09:26.160 --> 03:09:29.460
programmatic things that we used to do, basically, right? So

03:09:29.460 --> 03:09:33.020
basically, from your API, so we try to add one more layer,

03:09:33.140 --> 03:09:36.640
an intermediate layer. So where we define that how traffic

03:09:36.640 --> 03:09:40.400
should move, basically. How I will be able to even make my

03:09:40.400 --> 03:09:49.180
resource consumptions better, by the way. So if we are, if

03:09:49.180 --> 03:09:53.020
we host VLLM in one of the server, then how can how can I

03:09:53.020 --> 03:09:59.180
access VLLM publicly? How is so sorry, if you are if you If

03:09:59.180 --> 03:10:04.560
I host VLLM on one of the server, I have a server like I

03:10:04.560 --> 03:10:08.860
have an up and running VLLM on one server. I want to make it

03:10:08.860 --> 03:10:13.360
publicly. So how can I make it publicly? Use ng-roc? ng-roc.

03:10:13.500 --> 03:10:16.580
Okay. I have shown you right, where I have made my system

03:10:16.580 --> 03:10:19.660
publicly available in an API class. So where you all were

03:10:19.660 --> 03:10:22.500
able to hit the API, but technically that API was not

03:10:22.500 --> 03:10:25.760
running in a cloud. It was running in my cloud system. Yes,

03:10:25.760 --> 03:10:30.820
in my local system, right? Use use ng-roc so that you will

03:10:30.820 --> 03:10:33.480
be able to expose anything which is running publicly to

03:10:33.480 --> 03:10:36.600
anyone. Sorry, anything which is running privately in your

03:10:36.600 --> 03:10:39.700
system to anyone means you are basically technically trying

03:10:39.700 --> 03:10:43.000
to create your system as a public system. Means it will be

03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:45.920
exposed to us. What's the world ng-roc just one line of

03:10:45.920 --> 03:10:49.340
command so download ng-roc CLI and then like port forwarding

03:10:49.340 --> 03:10:51.520
you have to do so everything anything is running on one

03:10:51.520 --> 03:10:54.380
single port the forward it to the public port. That's it.

03:10:55.140 --> 03:11:00.540
Hi, sir. Yeah. Yes, I go ahead, please. So we did that in

03:11:00.540 --> 03:11:03.980
fencing today deploying the model over there. So if we can

03:11:03.980 --> 03:11:07.660
integrate with this one with the open web web UI to get that

03:11:07.660 --> 03:11:10.000
a better representational and get the output, right?

03:11:10.360 --> 03:11:12.980
Exactly. Yeah. So with you can now try to attach it with

03:11:12.980 --> 03:11:17.420
any. Any like a user interface UI interface, right and then

03:11:17.420 --> 03:11:21.520
like you can do the inferencing for example, open web UI or

03:11:21.520 --> 03:11:24.980
maybe like a chat GPT kind of a UI just integrated and then

03:11:24.980 --> 03:11:27.800
ulama provides it right how we have to how we can do it from

03:11:27.800 --> 03:11:31.440
this this in this machine ulama ulama provides you basically

03:11:31.440 --> 03:11:35.500
one so you are able to get the URL access right or API

03:11:35.500 --> 03:11:39.080
basically so ulama provides you to attach your own custom

03:11:39.080 --> 03:11:44.000
API as well. Correct correct. So just. Just try to pass that

03:11:44.000 --> 03:11:49.580
just try to do that setting. But in your example in the what

03:11:49.580 --> 03:11:51.780
you have put in YouTube, but you have integrated this with

03:11:51.780 --> 03:11:55.460
open web UI right sir. But I'm not wrong. No. So one with

03:11:55.460 --> 03:11:59.460
open web UI. Yes. Yeah. Open web UI and one video I have

03:11:59.460 --> 03:12:01.540
created just for this one, the demo which I've shown you

03:12:01.540 --> 03:12:06.720
today. Normal deployment only right. Even with the ulama web

03:12:06.720 --> 03:12:09.280
UI I have always shown the example. So in my YouTube it's

03:12:09.280 --> 03:12:12.260
already available. But what you said in that YouTube

03:12:12.260 --> 03:12:15.700
basically that. In the we do not have a very nice user

03:12:15.700 --> 03:12:19.340
interface so you have moved from the normal ulama web UI

03:12:19.340 --> 03:12:22.900
interface to open web UI right. It was it was not about the

03:12:22.900 --> 03:12:25.740
nice user interface it was about handling the inferencing

03:12:25.740 --> 03:12:28.860
data that's a complex part user interface anyone can create

03:12:28.860 --> 03:12:31.980
it any kids can create it but the main part is not that main

03:12:31.980 --> 03:12:34.280
part is basically when you are inferencing the data when

03:12:34.280 --> 03:12:36.460
you're streaming the data right so how to handle the

03:12:36.460 --> 03:12:38.920
formulas how to handle the tables how to handle the code

03:12:38.920 --> 03:12:41.860
part many many like edge cases comes into a picture. Yeah.

03:12:42.820 --> 03:12:45.680
The one question that I have basically followed with not the

03:12:45.680 --> 03:12:49.320
in the code which you have shared that there's a python

03:12:49.320 --> 03:12:52.580
installation which is talking which is basically a suit. Let

03:12:52.580 --> 03:12:59.840
me ask you that maybe. Yeah. One second. That's the pseudo

03:13:03.240 --> 03:13:06.700
Once you once you I don't know why. No no it's fine take

03:13:06.700 --> 03:13:07.180
your time.

03:13:11.240 --> 03:13:16.220
If my. This one got her. And I don't know. text edit that

03:13:23.200 --> 03:13:26.420
installation python with like a multiple commands you passed

03:13:26.420 --> 03:13:29.380
over there let me i don't know where is that

03:13:38.820 --> 03:13:43.040
sorry my this one got hanged actually turn text edit i don't

03:13:43.040 --> 03:13:45.460
know why i have to restart okay okay

03:13:48.780 --> 03:13:50.240
one

03:13:53.670 --> 03:13:54.710
second yeah

03:14:07.920 --> 03:14:12.620
it was like a sudo apt install python 3.12 python 3.12

03:14:12.620 --> 03:14:17.920
hyphen v and v python 3.12 dave hyphen dave so all three

03:14:17.920 --> 03:14:20.180
commands you are running in the one place so what are those

03:14:20.180 --> 03:14:24.200
actually so basically it's downloading the python okay three

03:14:24.200 --> 03:14:28.120
three three we have to pass that commands python 3.2 yeah

03:14:28.120 --> 03:14:31.260
yeah so basically it's trying to download the python and

03:14:31.260 --> 03:14:33.540
then in the next step so we are trying to create the

03:14:33.540 --> 03:14:36.900
environment so obviously to create an environment i need a

03:14:36.900 --> 03:14:40.460
python right okay got it thank you sir yeah yeah i'm done

03:14:40.460 --> 03:14:48.240
thanks yeah okay prasheel go ahead please um sir last i'm

03:14:48.240 --> 03:14:52.520
trying to

03:14:52.520 --> 03:14:57.800
deploy one of the application to ec2 instance okay and i

03:14:57.800 --> 03:15:01.540
tried everything there is some versioning issue related to

03:15:01.540 --> 03:15:05.540
land chain community and land chain so that was an issue

03:15:05.540 --> 03:15:09.700
that has not been solved yet and secondly sir the medical

03:15:09.700 --> 03:15:15.120
chat that you did in the last class i tried to code it

03:15:15.120 --> 03:15:19.480
myself uh deployed it did not work deployment run it it did

03:15:19.480 --> 03:15:23.200
not work but then i just took the zip file and i tried to

03:15:23.200 --> 03:15:28.260
run it even that is not working so not sure what is going

03:15:28.260 --> 03:15:35.220
wrong okay uh department i'm so sorry i'm still i have not

03:15:35.220 --> 03:15:37.920
shown the deployment so i'll show you i will talk about the

03:15:37.920 --> 03:15:41.680
deployment once uh we'll go there right but yeah in between

03:15:41.680 --> 03:15:44.640
this screen let's see why you're not able to run the zip

03:15:44.640 --> 03:15:47.980
file yes share the screen

03:15:50.800 --> 03:15:52.200
join as a panelist

03:15:54.800 --> 03:15:58.640
and then they can share the screen sir open

03:16:03.730 --> 03:16:06.210
outer are doing the same thing hosting model edge yes yeah

03:16:06.670 --> 03:16:12.550
same thing everyone like even like a group they are doing

03:16:12.550 --> 03:16:12.990
the same thing

03:16:21.100 --> 03:16:23.960
yeah Prashil I think you have a screen sharing access you

03:16:23.960 --> 03:16:24.520
can share the screen

03:16:28.680 --> 03:16:29.120
ok

03:16:37.170 --> 03:16:41.450
are you able to see my screen sir yeah I can see your screen

03:16:41.450 --> 03:16:48.310
now yes so this is where I am trying to do I will just call

03:16:48.310 --> 03:16:54.170
this service and again run it it is chainlet run

03:17:04.160 --> 03:17:11.640
so till here it looks good ok whenever I run it here it

03:17:20.310 --> 03:17:25.390
will be maximum data exceeded with the url ok, fine this

03:17:25.390 --> 03:17:28.870
this this this this certification and able to get the load

03:17:34.200 --> 03:17:41.370
you are using a wrong API key just go to your URI just go to

03:17:41.370 --> 03:17:43.530
my URI ok hmm

03:17:48.090 --> 03:17:51.710
sir but when I run this it is running but

03:17:53.860 --> 03:17:57.620
this is not the correct way yeah use API key create API key

03:18:00.050 --> 03:18:01.270
create new API key

03:18:07.120 --> 03:18:10.760
ok hmm now so copy it hmm

03:18:13.510 --> 03:18:15.010
go to the code

03:18:20.660 --> 03:18:25.280
config hmm change it ok

03:18:29.440 --> 03:18:36.740
save control s done that ok and and one more thing just

03:18:36.740 --> 03:18:41.260
delete this zip file zip file ok anyhow that is not going to

03:18:41.260 --> 03:18:47.080
make any change that's fine so here basically like execute

03:18:47.080 --> 03:18:51.280
once again stop it yeah and which environment you are using

03:18:51.280 --> 03:18:53.060
so have you done the installation of this one of all these

03:18:53.060 --> 03:18:55.620
files ok that's the reason you are yes I did the

03:18:55.620 --> 03:18:59.240
requirements and requirements of txt I did run it run it run

03:18:59.240 --> 03:18:59.960
it run it

03:19:02.910 --> 03:19:08.050
select to file hmm SSL there

03:19:10.740 --> 03:19:15.240
is some certificate error sir I tried asking cloud my cloud

03:19:15.240 --> 03:19:21.940
free limit is over asking ok ok ok now ping me once this

03:19:21.940 --> 03:19:25.360
error is coming SSL should come from there only line number

03:19:25.360 --> 03:19:29.060

03:19:29.060 --> 03:19:33.860
transformer ok here it is going error ok hugging face

03:19:33.860 --> 03:19:38.380
transformer you are not able to hit understand yes and for

03:19:38.380 --> 03:19:43.140
that hugging face I have stopped no no I mean you understand

03:19:43.140 --> 03:19:46.960
no no you have a problem there hugging face line number 6 is

03:19:46.960 --> 03:19:51.180
showing there line number 6 here below below it is showing

03:19:51.180 --> 03:19:54.680
in error hugging face error copy it and send it to me ok you

03:19:54.680 --> 03:19:56.760
have sent that is the issue of hugging face understood

03:19:56.760 --> 03:19:58.500
understood ok understood so

03:20:01.220 --> 03:20:05.980
sir now I am going to name I am just new send complete error

03:20:05.980 --> 03:20:11.320

03:20:12.000 --> 03:20:15.300
certificate verification failed hmm

03:20:20.040 --> 03:20:24.880
your system there is a text limit sir there is

03:20:27.790 --> 03:20:33.610
a text limit I will just show local sorry I think there is a

03:20:33.610 --> 03:20:38.690
text limit in on to the chat ok I can only share up to some

03:20:38.690 --> 03:20:43.460
characters got the got the issue got the issue so I am

03:20:43.460 --> 03:20:49.020
unable to send it ok so just do one thing run this one I

03:20:49.020 --> 03:20:50.720
have I have just pinged the command paper stall upgrade

03:20:50.720 --> 03:20:56.520
paper certificate request you are a lib I did that sir ok

03:20:56.520 --> 03:21:03.800
didn't work so that is your system issue that can be an

03:21:03.800 --> 03:21:05.680
issue sir I totally agree

03:21:20.680 --> 03:21:25.060
No, it will work. It's your local system issue. So, there is

03:21:25.060 --> 03:21:26.540
no other issue. Just a minute.

03:21:29.720 --> 03:21:33.400
I guess I will have to change my system. No,

03:21:36.840 --> 03:21:40.260
you don't have to change the system. You can reboot the

03:21:40.260 --> 03:21:48.580
system. Why change the system? I mean, I spent last 18

03:21:48.580 --> 03:21:52.860
hours. Just think of it. How much I would have tried. One

03:21:52.860 --> 03:22:01.880
minute. You can update the operating system. Because your

03:22:01.880 --> 03:22:04.680
system is giving you an issue. Yes, I have an issue. I have

03:22:04.680 --> 03:22:06.920
just pinged you something. Execute it one by one.

03:22:31.240 --> 03:22:32.460
Your MAC password.

03:22:53.140 --> 03:22:54.640
Time is already on.

03:23:10.600 --> 03:23:14.580
I am little late in the game, sir, but I am trying to get to

03:23:14.580 --> 03:23:17.920
the speed. Yeah, not an issue. Take your time. I am not

03:23:17.920 --> 03:23:18.560
running anywhere.

03:23:23.280 --> 03:23:24.600
Closing connection.

03:23:27.340 --> 03:23:33.860
I ran several commands to update the certificate also

03:23:33.860 --> 03:23:38.120
because this could also be the issue with the certificate.

03:23:38.720 --> 03:23:43.680
No, the issue is the same. There is no other issue. Just do

03:23:43.680 --> 03:23:48.460
this one. Closing connection powered by hugging face. Okay.

03:23:48.460 --> 03:23:53.460
And after this, is there any other error? Yes.

03:23:56.140 --> 03:23:56.660
Hmm.

03:24:00.360 --> 03:24:02.120
Okay, now you run the program and try it again.

03:24:17.370 --> 03:24:20.570
Sir, without GPU, we can't host. There will be an issue in

03:24:20.570 --> 03:24:23.110
inference, but we can use a little high configuration like

03:24:23.110 --> 03:24:26.170
10

03:24:26.170 --> 03:24:31.390
cores, 64 GB RAM. No, that is the issue. I

03:24:35.680 --> 03:24:39.480
was able to fix this. Is it your laptop or the company's

03:24:39.480 --> 03:24:44.120
laptop? It is the company's. Is it the company's? Yes. Then

03:24:44.120 --> 03:24:48.100
you can't do anything. They have blocked it. They can't do

03:24:48.100 --> 03:24:51.800
anything. Tell them to remove the certificate issue.

03:24:52.320 --> 03:24:55.240
Actually, it is happening. If you look at line number 6, it

03:24:55.240 --> 03:24:58.660
is going to the hugging face. And it is downloading your

03:24:58.660 --> 03:25:01.220
model from there. Right. It is downloading your embedding

03:25:01.220 --> 03:25:06.740
model. Now it is getting an issue there. Basically. So, sir,

03:25:06.900 --> 03:25:10.440
I got into one stage after fixing this. It was able to

03:25:10.440 --> 03:25:14.500
process the files. And in one of my project, which is in

03:25:14.500 --> 03:25:21.040
this computer only. But when we are chatting with the bot, I

03:25:21.040 --> 03:25:23.180
mean, when we are chatting in here, that's when it is not

03:25:23.180 --> 03:25:27.820
working. So, at that time, it must be blocking URI. Okay.

03:25:28.520 --> 03:25:32.660
URI is not in your server. URI is also a different server

03:25:32.660 --> 03:25:37.740
for your system. Right. Okay. So, sometimes this, sometimes

03:25:37.740 --> 03:25:41.240
that. Technically, it is a company laptop. Right? You can't

03:25:41.240 --> 03:25:46.420
fix the certificate issue. Okay. Your password is your ID.

03:25:46.680 --> 03:25:48.280
Basically, it is a user ID. Right? You don't have the admin

03:25:48.280 --> 03:25:53.020
access. You don't have the admin access. Right? I think I am

03:25:53.020 --> 03:25:55.360
the admin of this machine, sir. Because they are not able to

03:25:55.360 --> 03:26:00.060
push so many policies in Mac. No. What are you saying? See,

03:26:00.220 --> 03:26:05.380
all the policies are pushed. Okay. No, sir. There are very

03:26:05.380 --> 03:26:09.360
few people. There are only maybe 10 or 20 Mac laptops in the

03:26:09.360 --> 03:26:12.880
company. Maybe that's the reason. Yes. So, your admin won't

03:26:12.880 --> 03:26:18.060
know. But whatever it is, your issue is of the company

03:26:18.060 --> 03:26:22.900
laptop. Okay. So, one last question, sir. When we are trying

03:26:22.900 --> 03:26:26.200
to connect to URI app, even that is something which is like

03:26:26.200 --> 03:26:29.080
external and that is also being blocked somewhere by SSL.

03:26:29.460 --> 03:26:32.560
Obviously. Okay. If your company has kept it blocked, then

03:26:32.560 --> 03:26:35.960
it must be blocked. You won't be able to do it. Okay. Sir,

03:26:36.020 --> 03:26:40.580
one last thing. That is about my… Okay. For EC2 instance,

03:26:40.780 --> 03:26:44.740
you are going to teach us later, right? I should be fine.

03:26:45.620 --> 03:26:48.380
Okay. That is it from my end, sir. Thank you so much. Okay.

03:26:48.480 --> 03:26:53.440
Thanks. Thanks. Yeah. Take care. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So, fine,

03:26:53.480 --> 03:26:56.860
everyone. I am done for today. Hope all of you have enjoyed

03:26:56.860 --> 03:26:59.840
this. Okay. Do we have… Okay. Narish, please go ahead. Yeah.

03:26:59.920 --> 03:27:04.940
Then I will close. Yeah, Narish. Hi, Sudhanshu. Yeah. Please

03:27:04.940 --> 03:27:09.900
go ahead. Sudhanshu, this is related to URI security. So, I

03:27:09.900 --> 03:27:15.140
think I should talk privately. With respect to? Okay. URI

03:27:15.140 --> 03:27:17.880
security. Okay. You can ping me on WhatsApp. DM me on

03:27:17.880 --> 03:27:22.200
WhatsApp. Yeah. Okay. Sure. We can chat there. Sure. Sure.

03:27:22.280 --> 03:27:25.420
Sure. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Sir, one

03:27:25.420 --> 03:27:28.580
last question. Yeah. If there is any doubt, who should I

03:27:28.580 --> 03:27:32.480
ask, sir? I can ask in the group. I asked in the group.

03:27:33.320 --> 03:27:37.220
Yeah. Yeah. Look, you can discuss in the group. There are 2

03:27:37.220 --> 03:27:39.240
-3 people there. Make them your friends. So, they can help

03:27:39.240 --> 03:27:42.680
you in studying. And after that, ultimately it is only us.

03:27:43.720 --> 03:27:45.900
When it is not cleared, obviously it is only us who have to

03:27:45.900 --> 03:27:50.240
clear it. Right? Yeah. Okay. Okay, thank you, sir. So, look,

03:27:50.240 --> 03:27:53.700
you have ChatGPT. You have URI. You have Gemini. You have

03:27:53.700 --> 03:27:56.160
Jay Patel. There are more than 600 people in the group, you

03:27:56.160 --> 03:27:59.720
don't need 600 people, you can find 2-4 people who match

03:27:59.720 --> 03:28:05.080
your mindset and then make a group and do more experiments.

03:28:07.080 --> 03:28:13.180
Because what is the issue that can't be fixed? But if there

03:28:13.180 --> 03:28:14.900
are 2-4 people with you, then what will happen in the

03:28:14.900 --> 03:28:17.740
future? You will be able to work on some big projects and

03:28:17.740 --> 03:28:22.440
believe me as an engineer, everyone should do this. No one

03:28:22.440 --> 03:28:26.360
has ever benefited from studying. We say this from day 1 of

03:28:26.360 --> 03:28:29.120
the class. You will only benefit when you literally

03:28:29.120 --> 03:28:36.740
experiment, break things, build something. So I always

03:28:36.740 --> 03:28:39.620
suggest that you choose your friends, that's why that

03:28:39.620 --> 03:28:42.680
community has been created. It's not just that we talk about

03:28:42.680 --> 03:28:47.340
it, it's just for that. It's not just for us. So I think in

03:28:47.340 --> 03:28:49.600
that way, it will be very helpful and believe me, very

03:28:49.600 --> 03:28:52.160
fruitful. Some of your friends will become like this. Maybe

03:28:52.160 --> 03:28:56.080
after 10 years, you will be sitting and partying. So do it.

03:28:56.720 --> 03:29:01.020
No, no, that's okay. If you get good friends, if you get bad

03:29:01.020 --> 03:29:05.180
friends, then leave it. No sir, they will become. I am

03:29:05.180 --> 03:29:10.100
making good friends. I am very social, so it is easy. More

03:29:10.100 --> 03:29:13.160
than code, there is an issue of setting and version. That's

03:29:13.160 --> 03:29:19.400
true. That's true. We don't know how to build one thing. We

03:29:19.400 --> 03:29:20.980
used to spend 2-3 days at night when we used to build a

03:29:20.980 --> 03:29:27.280
package in Java. So it happens. Sir, the thing is that the

03:29:27.280 --> 03:29:29.920
fire has reduced a little. 20 years ago, sir, it used to sit

03:29:29.920 --> 03:29:33.980
for 15-20 hours. Now, after 20 years, it is a little

03:29:33.980 --> 03:29:37.520
difficult. But yes, I am coming back. Exactly. We are also

03:29:37.520 --> 03:29:40.620
trying the same. It is also difficult for us after 11 years.

03:29:40.880 --> 03:29:42.580
Especially after going to the university and then companies

03:29:42.580 --> 03:29:45.680
etc. etc. It is very difficult. But even I am trying to

03:29:45.680 --> 03:29:48.020
bring myself back. Earlier we used to study for 14 hours.

03:29:48.540 --> 03:29:50.440
Similarly, we have studied for 14 hours with the same

03:29:50.440 --> 03:29:52.900
energy. Now look, you have launched a hybrid course. We are

03:29:52.900 --> 03:29:55.860
not able to do much recording. Okay. The kids are abusing

03:29:55.860 --> 03:29:59.760
from above. The hybrid course is not coming. So it happens.

03:29:59.820 --> 03:30:02.100
Even I am trying to regain my energy. I am trying to like

03:30:02.100 --> 03:30:07.020
bring back myself in a stealth mode. You also do it. What is

03:30:07.020 --> 03:30:09.180
the problem? Because look, you will not do it. The world is

03:30:09.180 --> 03:30:12.940
running ahead. And we have already seen. Exactly. It is like

03:30:12.940 --> 03:30:17.740
the world is not the same. So the way we used to like think

03:30:17.740 --> 03:30:21.660
about the world 2 or 3 years back. So it has changed a lot

03:30:21.660 --> 03:30:25.100
in the last 2-3 years. So if you want to be relevant on any

03:30:25.100 --> 03:30:27.660
position. It doesn't matter if you have like 10, 20 or maybe

03:30:27.660 --> 03:30:31.480
25 years of experience. If you want to be relevant, then you

03:30:31.480 --> 03:30:35.580
will have to hustle a little for 2-4 months. Otherwise, it

03:30:35.580 --> 03:30:38.360
will be difficult to be relevant. The surprising thing is

03:30:38.360 --> 03:30:41.100
that I have not done more than 10 years of work. I think I

03:30:41.100 --> 03:30:46.300
have worked only 2-3 hours a week. Last 10 years. Now I have

03:30:46.300 --> 03:30:49.640
to bring it back. Exactly. This is the story of everyone.

03:30:49.640 --> 03:30:53.600
But now it has become a need. And we will say for the whole

03:30:53.600 --> 03:30:56.980
industry. You must have seen it. Right. This is a complete

03:30:56.980 --> 03:30:59.160
difference. San Francisco does not have jobs. Sir, I am

03:30:59.160 --> 03:31:02.900
here. You should get the most jobs in Silicon Valley. But

03:31:02.900 --> 03:31:06.720
there are no jobs. Exactly. Exactly. And this situation will

03:31:06.720 --> 03:31:09.920
go a little worse. I mean, it will go right on its own.

03:31:09.920 --> 03:31:14.480
Before that, it will go a little worse. As I can see. As I

03:31:14.480 --> 03:31:17.900
am getting feedback from people. So, we have to wait for it.

03:31:18.000 --> 03:31:20.640
I mean, we have to be ready for it. And the way to be ready.

03:31:21.000 --> 03:31:23.380
Sir, I have to find a job by January. Sir, no matter what

03:31:23.380 --> 03:31:26.200
happens. So, I will hopefully find it. But he said the same.

03:31:26.280 --> 03:31:28.640
Make a couple of friends. Experiment. Don't wait for us.

03:31:28.780 --> 03:31:31.680
Make a project. Even the project given in the course in the

03:31:31.680 --> 03:31:33.800
class. Pick it up. Make it yourself. Why do we have to wait?

03:31:35.820 --> 03:31:38.540
We are masters. So, obviously. According to us. We will

03:31:38.540 --> 03:31:42.300
teach according to our own rhythm. Right. Things will end.

03:31:42.820 --> 03:31:45.040
But you already know the topic. There is a topic listed

03:31:45.040 --> 03:31:47.640
there. The topic is given. Okay. Read it. Come and discuss

03:31:47.640 --> 03:31:52.380
with me. Yes, sir. Okay, sir. Okay, sir. Have a good night,

03:31:52.420 --> 03:31:54.960
sir. Thank you. You too. It is a day for me. Have a good

03:31:54.960 --> 03:31:58.960
night for you. Yes. Okay, sir. Thank you. Okay. Take care.

03:31:59.140 --> 03:32:03.060
Yes. Sir, it is different. No. I mean, it is a reality. We

03:32:03.060 --> 03:32:05.440
are living into it. It is not a sorrow. It is a new reality.

03:32:05.440 --> 03:32:08.940
By the way. Which we all are going through. So, you have to

03:32:08.940 --> 03:32:14.360
be ready for that. Yes. Kamal. R. Kamal. Yes, sir. So, in

03:32:14.360 --> 03:32:19.320
this project. Right. So, a kind of caption project. We would

03:32:19.320 --> 03:32:23.420
be creating a URI kind of system. Right. No. URI he will

03:32:23.420 --> 03:32:26.140
create it. Not URI kind of system. We will create URI. Which

03:32:26.140 --> 03:32:30.420
you can monetize it on your own. Okay. Okay. Because in, I

03:32:30.420 --> 03:32:33.520
mean, today in the session what we have learned for the

03:32:33.520 --> 03:32:37.420
hosting and the endpoint creation for this. Just for the

03:32:37.420 --> 03:32:40.260
model. Just for the model actually. Not for the entire URI

03:32:40.260 --> 03:32:42.320
like system. Because when URI like system comes into the

03:32:42.320 --> 03:32:44.040
picture there will be multiple things which will fall in

03:32:44.040 --> 03:32:47.660
between. Yeah. Yeah. So, you, I mean, in between the session

03:32:47.660 --> 03:32:51.540
you also mentioned this connection is not secure like HTTP

03:32:51.540 --> 03:32:56.980
we are using. So, in order to make it more secure, SSL keys,

03:32:57.080 --> 03:32:59.620
all those things. Right. Yes. We will add the certificate.

03:32:59.800 --> 03:33:01.480
We will add the certificate. We will teach you how to add

03:33:01.480 --> 03:33:03.480
the certificate basically. We will try to teach you how to

03:33:03.480 --> 03:33:04.380
do a transfer. We will try to teach you how to do domain

03:33:04.380 --> 03:33:07.260
mapping. Everything. Everything. Means we are basically at

03:33:07.260 --> 03:33:10.660
the end of this lecture. Means at the end of this class we

03:33:10.660 --> 03:33:12.780
will end up building not a caption project, a product

03:33:12.780 --> 03:33:16.860
actually. And one more thing like the way we are creating

03:33:16.860 --> 03:33:20.660
the key in the URI system. Right. That step also. That also.

03:33:20.700 --> 03:33:23.640
Yes. Complete URI. URI means whatever feature that you are

03:33:23.640 --> 03:33:27.180
able to see. Exact same feature like a key or maybe like a

03:33:27.180 --> 03:33:29.080
multi-model basically. Today I have shown you just one

03:33:29.080 --> 03:33:32.260
model. Right. But in case of URI. So, you are hitting just

03:33:32.260 --> 03:33:35.900
one API. But you are able to access multiple models just by

03:33:35.900 --> 03:33:40.300
changing a model tag or model name. Right. We will do that

03:33:40.300 --> 03:33:45.360
as well. Because I just recently I mean two days back only

03:33:45.360 --> 03:33:47.760
just joined the batch. Okay. Okay. So, I am going through

03:33:47.760 --> 03:33:50.600
the previous recordings as well. Please go through the API

03:33:50.600 --> 03:33:53.660
part. That is important. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I am going

03:33:53.660 --> 03:33:56.520
through it. Because I am coming from the big data

03:33:56.520 --> 03:33:59.600
background. I think you will be able to pick up the pace

03:33:59.600 --> 03:34:01.940
then. I don't see like. Because people who are coming for

03:34:01.940 --> 03:34:05.340
the big data background. Right. I believe many things they

03:34:05.340 --> 03:34:08.400
have already seen. Because I am coming from the big data

03:34:08.400 --> 03:34:11.320
background by the way. No. No. I know you from my neuron

03:34:11.320 --> 03:34:16.660
days. I know you. Okay. Okay. Then. The only thing I mean I

03:34:16.660 --> 03:34:19.880
am not able to relate. I mean the use case is what we can

03:34:19.880 --> 03:34:22.840
showcase. Right. Okay. Probably I am very new to the gen AI.

03:34:22.940 --> 03:34:27.840
So, I am not able to relate it with real time. Yeah. Next

03:34:27.840 --> 03:34:32.440
one to month I think you will be. Okay. Yeah. And probably

03:34:32.440 --> 03:34:34.820
in the. Okay. I mean currently in the healthcare system. So,

03:34:34.920 --> 03:34:39.520
the chatbot you have demoed. Right. You help us to create

03:34:39.520 --> 03:34:44.420
during the class. That thing I mean I can use as a real time

03:34:44.420 --> 03:34:47.000
project in the. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Just wait for tomorrow's

03:34:47.000 --> 03:34:48.460
class. Tomorrow I am going to add a couple of more

03:34:48.460 --> 03:34:51.080
configuration in the same project. Right. And that too with

03:34:51.080 --> 03:34:54.220
the model that we have deployed today. Right. With that one.

03:34:54.660 --> 03:34:57.600
So, we will try to add those features. So, that this will be

03:34:57.600 --> 03:35:01.340
like you know without using any kind of a URI or any other

03:35:01.340 --> 03:35:06.760
embedding model. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Sir, the nexus you have

03:35:06.760 --> 03:35:08.980
told me and the drag you have told me, this is being

03:35:08.980 --> 03:35:11.940
implemented in my company. I am also from the healthcare.

03:35:12.220 --> 03:35:16.400
Hmm. And this is being implemented as of today. It would be

03:35:16.400 --> 03:35:20.060
awesome if I just showed this app saying that see I could

03:35:20.060 --> 03:35:23.640
build it which your team of 10 people have not built it so

03:35:23.640 --> 03:35:28.880
far. Okay. Okay. So, show it to me tomorrow evening. Sir, it

03:35:28.880 --> 03:35:32.360
is not yet ready. We will make it. Okay. No problem. It will

03:35:32.360 --> 03:35:36.780
be ready. Okay. Okay. Sir. Sir, we have to shut down the GPU

03:35:36.780 --> 03:35:40.460
server. Sir, yes, obviously. Otherwise, the bill will be

03:35:40.460 --> 03:35:43.760
raised by you. It is taking hourly charge from you. Okay.

03:35:43.860 --> 03:35:46.080
So, obviously, you have to and you should shut down your

03:35:46.080 --> 03:35:49.740
like GPU. We will up it again tomorrow. You can also do

03:35:49.740 --> 03:35:51.540
Hibernate. By the way, there is an option for Hibernate in

03:35:51.540 --> 03:35:57.140
it. So, that they will not like charge you like a full

03:35:57.140 --> 03:35:59.840
amount. Maybe they can charge you a little bit of amount.

03:36:00.760 --> 03:36:03.800
Yeah. Okay. So, fine, guys. Thank you so much. Hope all of

03:36:03.800 --> 03:36:07.240
you are enjoying. Even like tomorrow, day after tomorrow,

03:36:07.400 --> 03:36:09.600
you all will enjoy and we will do literally like a practical

03:36:09.600 --> 03:36:13.660
things. We will try to like get a status, we will try to get

03:36:13.660 --> 03:36:15.880
a label where we will end up building a product, not just

03:36:15.880 --> 03:36:19.280
like learning something because that is not my, that is not

03:36:19.280 --> 03:36:22.360
how I teach and that is not my even area of interest by the

03:36:22.360 --> 03:36:25.920
way. So, we will try to build a product. With that, thank

03:36:25.920 --> 03:36:28.420
