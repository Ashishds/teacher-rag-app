WEBVTT

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.870
Okay, so hello everyone, good morning, I think I'm audible

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.030
and visible to all of you and we are going to start a class

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.410
in a couple of minutes, so maybe in 5 minutes we are going

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.750
to start with the class, yeah, so once everyone of us is

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.750
going to join, so in between, so you guys can chat with each

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.790
other, so I have just opened up a chat, Vijay, good morning,

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.510
good morning Vijay,

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.630
Manish, good morning, yeah, good morning everyone, we

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.370
are going to start in some time, so maybe in like next 4 to

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.430
5 minutes, we are going to start with the lecture, yeah, so

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.930
just wait,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.900
okay, so good morning once again guys, shall we start or

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.440
shall we wait for a couple of more minutes, okay,

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.580
good morning, good morning everyone, good morning, good

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.360
morning, so maybe we can wait for another 2 minutes,

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.170
okay, fine guys, so let's get started, so good morning once

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.750
again to all of you, so today guys, we are going to talk

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.610
about a vector database, so I believe we were talking about

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.870
a vector DB and we have already. seen a theoretical

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.950
assumptions behind a vector database, plus we have already

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.570
discussed about a Facebook AI similarity search and we

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.130
talked about a quadrant, right, this is I think we have

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.870
discussed in my previous lecture, now in today's lecture, so

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.630
I am going to talk about again another vector DB, so which

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.310
is going to be a chroma DB, which is going to be a pine

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.610
cone, which is going to be a wave here and that will be an

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.550
agenda for today's class, now tomorrow, what we are going to

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.770
do, so tomorrow we are going to use this vector DB and with

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.530
the help of these vector DB, so we are going to build a RAG

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.970
based application, so retrieval augmented generation based

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.990
into end application, we are going to build a chatbot kind

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.550
of a system, you can say, so we are going to build a chatbot

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.570
kind of a system, so where you will be able to chat with any

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.450
of your documents, so maybe a finance document, maybe a

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.530
healthcare document, maybe a HR related document, maybe a

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.830
company policies related document, so these kind of a use

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.250
cases we will try to see. So, if time allows, in that case,

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.230
I will try to show you even a modern recommendation system.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.050
So, we used to build a recommendation system since ages not

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.410
like a recommender system is not a new concept not a new

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:29.050
idea, but how you will be able to build it, where you are

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.810
going to use of vector data base and how vector database is

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.650
going to help you out in terms of building a modern, most

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.090
reliable system, with respect to a recommendation. Maybe a

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.430
product. Okay. recommendation or maybe a user recommendation

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.650
maybe a job recommendation so many things right so many

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.230
things which comes in between so these are the things that

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.470
we are going to build and one more example i was uh thinking

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.330
about a code search engine basically a code search engine so

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.590
where let's suppose i have a millions of lines of a code and

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.750
with the help of rag so how i will be able to build a system

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.990
so which is going to search a relevant code and then it

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.550
should be able to give me a response so again it will be a

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.450
combination of a rag plus it will be a combination of a

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:19.990
vector data base because behind the scene a backbone for any

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.350
rag application that we are going to create is going to be a

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.450
vector db where we are going to use our or where we are

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:30.510
going to keep our massive amount of a data so there are so

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:33.230
many use cases so many use cases you will be able to find

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.750
out in a real world so document knowledge base search is one

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.430
of the applications so where you can build a chatbot uh

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.090
finding you can build a chatbot uh finding out basically uh

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.530
like a semantic or based on the syntactic product research

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.470
or maybe a code search maybe you can try to build an

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.130
application which can try to do a deduping deduping means

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:54.390
which will be able to like you know eliminate a duplicates

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:58.290
from a huge huge documentation you can try to build even a

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:01.750
recommendation system you can try to build a clustering so

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.370
where you can divide a data into a different different kind

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:07.650
of zones or you can say a different different kind of

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:12.150
packets uh by the way based on the similarity uh we can try

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:15.970
to even build a system which will be able to flag anomalies

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:19.230
in between so like like i said so there are not just one

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.450
single application you will be able to find out a lot of

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.670
application in a real world which we can try to build with

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:31.150
the help of vector database and if we are going to add reg

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.890
on top of it it simply means that we are trying to add a

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:38.730
capability of uh llms by the way right llms by the way so in

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:42.310
this manner so many problems we can try to solve and the rag

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:45.410
application which i will be talking about in my tomorrow's

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:50.910
class uh that is going to be a kind of a vanilla rag there

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:54.750
is a rg called as rag with the agents so if you will go

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:58.850
through a syllabus so after a lot of agent tki discussion so

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:02.770
i have kept even that particular section so where i'll be

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:06.450
talking about rag with respect to an agent so with respect

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.250
to agent means we are going to add one more intelligent

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.550
application so layer on top of the similar kind of

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.230
application that I will be talking about in my tomorrow's

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:17.050
class. Yeah. So, shall we start guys, everyone?

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:25.670
So, for UI, we have to learn. So, Streamlint UI, no one

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:28.310
learns Streamlint by the way. Streamlint is a very, very

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:31.650
simple library where you can try to call, you know, if you

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.530
have to add a button. So, just try to call a button. If you

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:36.910
have to add tabs, you can try to just call a tab. If you

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.490
have to add a search bar, just try to call a search bar. Or

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:43.710
this is how simple the entire Streamlint library is. So, we

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:47.310
don't learn technically Streamlint library. So, wherever it

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.970
is required based on my imagination or based on my design, I

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:53.450
just try to search. I just try to call those components.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.550
This is how easy, by the way, Streamlint application is.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.970
Simple, right? So, you don't have to learn Streamlint

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.830
separately. No one learns. I had never learned in my entire

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:05.770
life. So, whenever I need it. So, I know that I have to put

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:08.450
one button. I know that I have to put maybe one search bar.

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:11.170
I have to. Well. I know that I have to put one panel. So,

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:12.930
where I will be able to see all my chat, all my

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.650
conversation. So, I just call those components and that

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:19.150
component will be available in front of me inside my UI. As

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:23.870
simple as that. Sir, can we implement React in UI for a

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.810
front-end? That will be better, actually. So, if you know

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:29.830
React, because this is how we build a real-time application.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:33.390
So, if you know React, that's amazing. That's awesome thing.

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:37.070
Right? So, even we are using a React in terms of building

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:42.190
our application that you see. Okay. So, let's get started.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.550
So, let's get started. Let me share my screen. And like I

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:47.990
said, so, today I'm going to complete a discussion about a

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:51.630
database of a DB. So, three databases. I'm going to like a

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:55.810
discuss. And again. So, conceptually this database are not

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:58.650
going to be very different. It's going to be approximately

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:01.130
same that we have already discussed with respect to a

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:03.670
Facebook as similarity search and with respect to a

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:06.650
quadrant. So, it is not going to be different. But yeah, at

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.930
least you should know that how I will be able to access

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:11.270
those. those databases, how I will be able to store the data

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:15.330
or how I will be able to search a data after storing a data.

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:19.190
And then tomorrow, like I said, we all are going to consume

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:23.790
those databases in our real application. So that that

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:27.190
discussion is going to happen tomorrow, not today. Because

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:30.410
today I think once we are going to discuss these three

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:35.490
databases, time will be over. How to handle chunks for a

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.070
bigger PDF? Let's see tomorrow. Yeah, because tomorrow we

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.590
are going to deal with the PDFs. And we are going to deal

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:46.130
with the bigger data set. Okay, so and then whatever

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:49.390
question that you have, so please keep your question handy.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:51.690
So I'm going to answer I'm going to take all the question

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:54.290
the way we used to discuss like in a doubt clean session.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:59.370
Okay guys, so first of all, let's try to open up my VS code.

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:02.090
Everyone try to open up VS code guys.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:18.840
Okay, I'm going to create one folder. I think folder was

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:25.520
already available. Generative AI. Vector DB, okay, so this

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.500
folder is already available or maybe you can try to create

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.940
one folder and our very first database that we are going to

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:38.640
discuss is chromadb.ipynb. So first of all, we are going to

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.200
talk about chromadb. So we have already discussed about our

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.400
Facebook AI similarity search and Facebook AI similarity

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:48.320
search is technically a databases that we can try to install

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.280
anywhere. So if I would like to install it. In my local

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.020
system, so I can try to install it in my local system or if

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:57.200
I would like to install it maybe in some cloud system, so I

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.480
can try to install it in a cloud system. Let me select my

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.200
kernel. So yeah, one of my kernel I have already selected.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.700
So whatever environment that we have created last time, you

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.360
can try to use the exact same environment. It's completely

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:14.740
fine. Yeah, it's completely fine. Now let's

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:21.900
start. So first DB is going to be guys. A chromadb and by

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:25.060
default chromadb will not be available inside your system.

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:29.540
So you have to install a chromadb in a very, very first

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.680
place. Whatever environment that you are going to use,

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.800
obviously you have to install it to install a chromadb. Just

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:39.760
write pip install pip install I N S T A double L C H R O C H

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:43.820
R O M A D B. Yeah. So this is something that you have to

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:47.940
write pip install chromadb and execute in some time it will

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.080
be able to install. So in my system requirement is already

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.960
satisfied because I have already installed it. But yeah, in

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.740
your system it won't be available. So please try to paste

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.120
this command. I have already pasted this command inside your

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:03.560
chat box. Just copy and paste this command and you will be

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.780
able to install a chromadb inside your system and

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:13.850
if chromadb is installed and if you have to check that

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:17.190
whether my chromadb is installed or not. So you can try to

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:20.230
write even pip show. So this is going to show you the

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:24.090
chromadb. So pip show chromadb. And in my system chromadb is

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:27.030
already available. Maybe your version could be different. I

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:31.410
have installed a couple of weeks back, not month if I'm not

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:33.870
wrong. But yeah, so a couple of weeks back, so I have

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:36.690
already installed a chromadb inside my system. So in my

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:40.190
system, the version is this one. In your system it could be

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:45.050
maybe eight or nine. Okay. It's two zero. Okay. So my latest

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:47.870
is two zero. That's completely fine. So there is a minor

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:51.230
update, not a major one. So your and mine is going to be

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:55.170
approximately same. Same in terms of installation. Done guys

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:59.550
everyone. So please ping me in a chat yes or no. I have

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:03.650
already pinged you the command. And then you can try to do

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:06.590
the confirmation pip show chromadb. If chromadb is

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.890
available, it is going to show you the version. If it is not

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:14.330
available, then obviously error. Taking a bit of time. It's

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:19.290
a light weighted library by the way. I don't think it should

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:23.230
take much of your time. Okay. Installing. Fine. We will wait

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:24.430
for two minutes. Not an issue. Yeah.

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:37.470
chromadb. Okay.

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:15.060
Do I need to create the environment technically? No. The

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:18.040
same environment that we have already created last time. So

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:22.320
I think we can try to use a same environment that's like

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.460
completely okay with me.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:56.030
Okay. Fine. So this is one of the way by which you will be

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:58.930
able to configure a chromadb inside your local system. Now

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.530
apart from that, right? So apart from that. If I'll talk

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:05.810
about just a chromadb. So let's go to Google. Yeah. Let's go

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:09.650
to Google and try to search for chromadb. So simple. Go to

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:12.630
Google and try to search for the same thing chromadb and

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:15.750
here so you will be able to find out a link called as a

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:21.350
trichroma.com and this is an official you can see the

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:25.750
website for a chromadb. You all will be able to find out now

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:29.210
here. So process is very simple. You can just click on login

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:32.210
and maybe go ahead with the Google login. No need to even do

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:35.290
a sign up. I have not done the sign up. So just go ahead

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:38.670
with the Google and then try to do a Google sign up and

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:42.030
immediately it will be able to do a sign up. Now this is

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:46.290
basically a managed version of a chromadb or you can say a

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:50.090
cloud version of a chromadb where you are not doing any kind

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:52.570
of a configuration. Obviously you have to do a library

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:55.810
installation inside your local system but you will be able

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:59.950
to use even a cloud version of a chromadb or even they are

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:02.450
giving you a flexibility. Okay. So where if you have a

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:05.450
database in your local system you can try to migrate those

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:09.110
entire databases to a cloud platform so that everything will

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:12.790
be public and anyone and everyone will be able to access it

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:16.090
or any application will be able to access it because for an

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:19.790
application creation in a real time right for any kind of

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:22.170
application that I am going to create it for a real time

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:25.950
things should be available over the cloud. If things are not

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:29.270
available over the cloud your application will not be able

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:32.110
to interact. So you have to host it. You have to manage it

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:36.710
from your side right. But if someone is already providing me

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:40.350
that solution so maybe I can try to use those solution and

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:43.870
chromadb is providing you that solution. So even we have

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:47.170
seen in case of a quadrant right. So in case of a quadrant

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:50.630
we were able to do the exact same thing. So quadrant was a

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:54.330
database which was already available over the cloud platform

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:58.210
which was already having a managed solution means cloud

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:02.430
solution right. I can try to create a databases or

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:05.090
collections over there. I can try to store my data over

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:07.890
there in a form of a vector along with the meta information.

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:12.270
So similarly in case of a chromadb you will be able to do

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.790
the exact same thing. So maybe I can come over here I can

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:17.810
try to write maybe a test create your first database. So I

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:21.770
can write test database create database and then if you will

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:25.030
come here so you will be able to find out a simple solution

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:28.990
a very very simple solution copy a local chroma database. So

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:31.950
if you have to migrate your database from your local system

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:35.690
to this system I can do it. Let's suppose I don't want that

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:38.450
right. So I can go ahead with the very first option. So

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:42.150
configure chroma SDK software development kit and here so

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:45.250
again you have to do pip install chromadb. We have already

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:47.670
done that yeah. So we have already done that in my local

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:50.450
system. So I have already installed a chromadb inside my

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:55.210
local system and then this is a client. Client means

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:58.370
connection basically right. From my system to this cloud

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:01.550
system I will be able to configure or from any system to any

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:05.130
system I will be able to configure it with the help of this

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:09.290
particular URL where I have to pass my API key for a

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:12.810
chromadb. How I can create the API key simple click on

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:16.230
create API key and it is going to create a API key for you

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:21.030
as simple as that and by this you will be able to connect

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:24.510
with a chromadb which is available on a cloud platform.

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:28.770
Yeah. Which is available on a cloud platform and then you

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:32.710
will be able to you know upload the data and then like you

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:36.030
will be able to perform a search operation or any operation

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:38.910
with respect to a chromadb that you can perform in a local

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:42.430
system. Same thing you all will be able to do it even on a

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:45.670
cloud system. So are you able to log in guys everyone. Yeah.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:52.540
Today generative AI interview boot camp will be done. No.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:56.280
Today is not a day for a generative AI interview boot camp.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:03.020
Basically. The dates are Monday and Tuesday. They have

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.600
already mentioned days dates each and everything for each

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.600
and every classes. So I do not think that there should be a

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:07.900
confusion.

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:14.370
Is it a free version? Yeah. So you do not have to like a pay

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:17.610
initially unless and until you are not going ahead with the

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:21.390
you know like heavy instances or dedicated instances.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:28.280
Yeah. Do we have assignment solution last week one. So many

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.240
people have already posted our assignment solution. So

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.560
please look into that. We have a group for that one and this

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.460
is how we do assignments. Yeah.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:41.520
Please send a link for login into the chromadb I mean her

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:45.560
expectations are very wrong over here I believe this is the

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.940
link but yeah I should not this should not be the

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:51.780
expectation by the way I believe we all can just go and

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:57.700
Google it. Yeah. Okay. Fine guys. Move ahead. So now we have

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:01.120
a chromadb installed in my local system part number one and

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:05.080
even we are able to log in into a chromadb over a cloud

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.280
system. This is a cloud platform and they are giving you a

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.640
$5 of credit. So once you are going to exhaust this credit

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:14.300
obviously you have to pay as simple as that. Yeah. Otherwise

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:18.520
just use some different account and then maybe you can try

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.460
to test it. So basically for a testing purpose it's

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:26.040
completely fine. They are giving you enough credit and if

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:30.060
you are going ahead with a dedicated one so in that case you

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.400
have to make a payment and then you can try to use a

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:36.200
chromadb as simple as that. Yeah. So both the options are

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.040
already available to all of you. Okay. So even in my local

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.400
system guys I am able to install a chromadb and even in a

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.840
cloud platform so I have a chromadb available to me. Now

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.440
what is next? So let's go ahead with the step next step

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:52.980
basically. So here first of all what I will do I will try to

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:57.720
import a chromadb. So simple import a chromadb and then

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.160
after doing a import you have to create a client. Client

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.740
means connectivity basically. Right. So client means

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:07.260
connectivity you have to create. So this is a very simple

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.600
plain line of code that you have to write. Pinged you inside

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.500
the chat once again.

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:18.580
Yeah okay. So this is the client that you have to create and

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:23.540
execute it. Okay so client execution is done and I am able

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:28.180
to import a chromadb. Okay that's cool. Now what is next? So

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:31.260
once we are able to do this much right once we are able to

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.740
do this much then I have to prepare my data set. So let's

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.940
suppose this is my data set that I have. So as of now I have

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:41.480
taken a list of the data set and let me ping you this data

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:45.100
set by the way guys to all of you. So this is the data set

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.360
list of the data which I have already prepared and here this

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:51.080
data set talks about me by the way. So I have already

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.740
prepared this data set for all of you a sample one in a real

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:58.380
time what we are going to do. So in a real time someone is

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:02.500
going to give me a huge huge PDF or someone is going to give

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:07.420
me a huge chunk of a JSON. file maybe XML file maybe a txt

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:12.040
file and if you remember last week itself in your group I

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:16.580
have posted I believe four big chunk of the data and that

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:20.280
data set was about a transcript of our class right guys

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:23.180
anyone who have used it yes

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:29.160
that was a very very huge data because we are taking four

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:33.720
hour of classes right so just imagine 16 hour of 4 into 4 so

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.360
16 hour of a transcript. I have posted and I don't know

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.380
whether you have opened up that data set or not even that

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.960
data set is available inside your dashboard. So if you have

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.280
missed that data set inside a group not an issue at all. So

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:50.020
I have made it available even inside your dashboard. If you

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:55.180
will go to your dashboard let me go to your class. So

00:24:55.180 --> 00:25:00.480
generative AI certification boot camp and here and your last

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:03.120
class resource yeah

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:29.260
so this was the assignment. Yeah. And assignment

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:51.180
of gen AI vector DB no I think I have just posted that data

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:56.500
set into your group but not over here. It was available

00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:00.420
inside the group. Are you posted in whatsapp group yeah I

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:02.380
have posted in a whatsapp group because some people are

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:05.360
asking for you know a big data set. So I have just given

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:09.480
them their class data set itself okay. So I will just try to

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.860
upload it even over here because anyhow we are going to use

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:17.980
it in my class tomorrow. So okay so let me ping this

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:21.320
particular text data once again yeah. So this is the text

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.440
data set. You shared a drive link in a whatsapp group yeah

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:28.920
drive link yes drive link was there. So that was a very very

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.700
huge data set by the way yeah that was a very huge data set

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:35.840
and that was a complete unstructured data set. So this was

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:39.240
that was not at all a structured data set the way we have a

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:43.100
data as of now. So we have technically a structured kind of

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:46.040
a data set. Where we have a list inside a list we have data

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:49.440
number one then two then three four five six and so on this

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.460
kind of a data. But the data set which I have already shared

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:56.280
with you last week there was a complete unstructured data

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:59.700
set but one of the beautiful data set you will be able to

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:03.620
find out in a real time. So where you can try to build a lot

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:08.040
right that and it was a huge one right. So fine I will try

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.480
to share the data set once again not an issue so it's been

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:13.780
already shared and anyone of you. Anyone of you can share it

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:16.580
again once again inside the group I believe that will be

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:20.620
great yeah yeah. So Abhijit has already shared that data

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:23.800
inside your group guys once again thank you Abhijit.

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:30.310
Now so this data set is available to me I am not going to

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:33.170
use that data by the way so leave it the drive data set I am

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:35.990
going to use it tomorrow not today so leave that data yeah

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:39.550
leave that one assignment link as well assignment link is

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:43.630
already available inside your drive sorry dashboard guys. So

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:50.600
don't have to ask anyone fine. Now so once my data set is

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:54.560
available to me the very first task which I have to perform

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:59.620
over here to convert this data set into an embeddings right

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.800
into an embeddings because this is what we try to store

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.580
inside the vector database right. So unless and until we are

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:07.980
not going to convert this data set into embeddings means a

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:11.280
numeric space if we are not able to convert it into a vector

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:15.320
if we are not able to convert it. So we will not be able to

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:19.680
store this particular data inside our databases how we are

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:24.000
going to convert guys I think we all have idea about it we

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.620
have already done that right multiple times yeah. So how we

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:31.700
can try to convert this entire data into a vector data set

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:32.700
we

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:40.930
need a embedding model exactly yeah. So we need a model

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:44.530
which will be able to convert which will be able to take

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:47.990
this data and it will be able to convert. That data in a

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:51.170
particular dimension right. So in a numeric space it will be

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:57.110
able to convert it now as far as embedding is concerned. So

00:28:57.110 --> 00:29:02.050
we have many models not just one or two we have many models

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:05.730
available to us by which I will be able to convert this

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:11.850
entire data into a vector space now. So we have those things

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:15.390
available inside a Euron so let's go ahead and let's try to

00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:17.870
use embedding model. So we have a model from a Euron itself

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:21.970
because we have one lakh token limit and I think one lakh

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:26.210
token limit will be more than enough to you know convert

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:31.030
this data set. So we can try to go to a URI API first of all

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:35.230
right we can try to go to a code example second and then

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:39.870
here so we have a code example given for a embedding. So

00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:42.850
with the help of this one I will be able to convert my data

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:46.630
set into an embedding simple right. So with the help of this

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:49.030
embedding so I will be able to convert this data set into an

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:52.690
embedding. So just try to copy this code yeah just try to

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:55.410
copy this code generate embedding code we have already used

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:59.130
it even in my past so we all are aware about it. So generate

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:02.650
embedding and we are going to use open AI model called as

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:06.110
text embedding 3 small. It is going to convert my data set

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:12.250
into a dimension of 1536, 1536 dimension. So each and every

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:14.510
data it is going to take and then it is going to eventually

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:18.190
convert those data set into a dimension of 1536. So this

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:23.010
model is from open AI. Now I have even shown you that let's

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:26.090
suppose you have a token limitation right you have a token

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:31.070
limitation and you have a big big PDF file maybe PDF file

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:34.470
with a 900 pages or maybe a thousand two thousand kind of a

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:39.350
pages and let's suppose like a API token is not enough

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:43.170
enough token is available to you in that case maybe I could

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:46.310
try to use some sort of a model from a hugging phase. So I

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:48.930
can try to download those model offline and then I can try

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:52.930
to use those model and I believe I have even shown you that

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:55.790
particular approach. You can just go ahead with any of these

00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:58.090
approach it is completely fine with me I don't have any kind

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:01.550
of a issue at the end of the day I have to convert my data

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:07.490
into a numeric space but yeah model matters a lot. So if I

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:11.330
am using some of the weak model so in that case my

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:15.370
embeddings will be weak or my vector space will be weak and

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:17.930
it will not be able to understand the relation in a proper

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:21.750
manner if my model is good obviously I will end up creating

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:26.010
a better embeddings for any kind of a data set but yes I

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:29.050
have both the approaches available to me and both the

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:31.150
approach I have already shown you in my previous lecture

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:35.830
when we have already started a vector DB. So okay I have to

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:39.330
use this one now to use this one I have to replace this

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:43.690
hysteric with the API key. Yes API key. I will be able to

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:46.770
access this URL and then I will be able to hit this model

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:49.510
and then I will be able to pass my data and then I will be

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:54.550
able to convert my data set into a vector space. So I can

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:58.230
remove this part I just need this still return embedding. So

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:02.190
this is the function. Now let me pass a key. So how I will

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:05.610
be able to get a key. I think we all are aware about it but

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:08.790
those who are not able to recall that's completely fine. So

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:12.390
just click on API key. So we have API key option. Just click

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:16.230
on API key. Create API key and then try to give any kind of

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:20.350
a name to this API key and my API key will be ready over a

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:23.350
Euron platform so that I will be able to access the model

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:26.290
and with the help of model I will be able to convert that

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:34.530
into a embeddings. So just use this API key and replace it

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:38.350
over here. So this is my API key and now this function is

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:41.190
complete. So are we able to do it guys? Everyone.

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:50.830
Yes. Nothing new. We have already done that. So it's a

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:52.470
repetitive task for all of us I believe.

00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:01.180
Using model is compulsory. Is there a library to create a

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:04.260
vector embedding from the scratch? See models are

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.740
compulsory. The reason is very simple. I think I have

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:08.960
already given that reason more than 10 times in my previous

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:13.740
classes. Unless and until you are not using a model or you

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:16.520
don't have a mechanism where it will be able to understand

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:20.000
the semantic and syntactic meaning of a data, you will not

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.520
be able to get a proper vector. It's not like you have to

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.240
use a vector. You have to use the model. I can just go ahead

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:29.040
and I can try to create our embeddings even with the help of

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:32.680
TF-IDF, even with the help of word to vector. But those

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:36.340
embeddings are going to be weak. So I should not like advise

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:42.340
those model. Sir, it has become a habit to embed. This is

00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:49.200
what we want. Okay, fine. So this data, this function is

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.940
available to all of us where we can try to pass our textual

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:54.440
information. And as a return, it is going to give me the

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:57.280
embedding. So this function is already available and I have

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:00.920
already attached my API key, right? I have already attached

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:03.840
my API key and not just from your own platform. So maybe you

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:08.480
are trying to use, you know, embedding or any other APIs

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.080
from some other platform mechanism is going to be same,

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:14.080
right? Mechanism is going to be same. And this is how we

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:17.740
have created this entire URI API ecosystem. Like I said in

00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:19.840
the beginning itself that we are going to use URI API

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:23.780
ecosystem in almost every class. Almost every class means

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:26.660
every class. So we have to have the need without it. So

00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:28.980
maybe you can go ahead and you can try to consume the same

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:32.400
model from some other provider, but you have to pay, but

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:36.960
here so, yeah, it's available to all of us. Okay so this

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:41.060
function is available to me. Now my responsibility is to

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:45.120
take my data, this data, right, this particular data and

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:49.520
convert this entire data set. Yeah, convert this entire data

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:54.100
set into the respective embedding format. Fine. respective

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:58.740
embedding format so how I will be able to do it so let's

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:05.140
write a loop over here for I in right for I in text so text

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:11.000
is a variable which is holding my entire data set T X T X T

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.680
s okay so just try to run through a loop and maybe I can try

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:21.120
to write a comprehension over here or even without

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:25.740
comprehension it's completely fine let me do it okay

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:44.730
so we are going to iterate through our data so one by one

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:47.650
one by one one by one it will try to extract the data right

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:50.570
and we have to pass this data where so we have to pass this

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:54.650
data inside a generate embeddings okay that's cool so for I

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:58.070
in text one by one extract my data and then try to call

00:35:58.070 --> 00:36:00.710
generate embedding function the function that we have

00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:05.150
written this auto-completion is giving me a lot of pain it's

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:07.890
better not to use auto-completion at least in your life

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:09.370
classes okay

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:18.420
generate embeddings function I am going to call and I am

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:22.900
going to pass my data over here one by one one by one one by

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:26.980
one and then finally I am going to call to list so that I

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:32.340
will be able to get the final data as a list yeah so now

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:35.800
this is going to call my API as you can see it's calling my

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:41.580
API one by one one by one one by one yeah and it will be

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:46.440
able to give me eventually a embeddings for all of this in

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:50.720
line yeah so I am able to receive the embedding now if I'll

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:53.980
go here and if I'll try to check the users you will be able

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:58.580
to even track the users that how many tokens is been used

00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:02.180
and you can even try to check the log so here I have just

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:07.920
called right just called this embeddings and yeah so one by

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:11.600
one as you can see so it has has called this embedding these

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:14.740
many number of times and I can track it, I can track each

00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:17.000
and everything. So whatever request which I am trying to

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.960
send, so I will be able to track all of these requests. This

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:25.960
is the time, right? So 30th, 8th, uh, 36 past nine. So this

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:33.760
is the time for now that we are doing it. Okay. So here we

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:37.360
are able to get the embeddings fine. I'll call it once

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:39.560
again. I'll try to save it inside the variable called as

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.060
embeddings.

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.560
So I'm just calling it once again.

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.800
Can anyone share the function code? You don't have to ask

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:55.560
anyone by the way to share a function code. So here you can

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:58.140
go and you can try to check code example, right? Code

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:01.900
example tab is already available. Just copy it. This is the

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:06.160
code. No need to ask anyone by the way, for a code example,

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:10.140
for API key, everything is already available. Now. I have

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:13.760
already given a lot of demo for that. So here we are able to

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:16.440
generate the embeddings. Now if I'll go and I'll try to

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:22.820
check. So here is my embeddings for all the data, excuse me,

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:27.160
for all the data. Now if I have to check my very first

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.920
embedding for the very first data, so maybe I can try to

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:34.200
write over here, embedding of zero. And this is a embedding

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:37.420
of a very first data set, which data set, by the way, the

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:39.620
very first line. Zanshu Kumar was born in Jamshedpur,

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:42.460
Jharkhand, India to the modest family. So this is basically

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:45.980
the embedding that you are able to see. So that embedding is

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:49.040
for this one, right? This particular one, the very first

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.500
line. So in the similar manner, you will be able to check

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:56.140
the embeddings for all the other. Now if I'll try to show

00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:59.140
you the length of the embedding. So it is supposed to be

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:02.120
one, five, three, six, right? This is what model returns. So

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:06.920
length of this embedding auto completion is horrible. I

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:12.650
believe. Okay. So one, five, three, six is a length, length

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:17.610
of this particular embedding. Fine. Okay. So now we are able

00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:20.330
to convert our data into a embedding. My data set is

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:24.310
available into a numeric format for everyone. Is it done

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:28.630
guys? Yes. Is it done?

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:35.840
Yeah. So when I write a code, when I create a project right

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:39.920
for myself, then auto completion is fine. But in like a live

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:43.120
lectures. It creates a lot of problems. It creates a lot of

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:43.400
disturbance.

00:39:56.610 --> 00:40:03.960
Okay. So now, so we are able to convert this one into an

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:07.580
embeddings fine. Just a simple plain line of code. I'm not

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:11.340
writing anything like a difficult over here. So I'm just

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:14.400
trying to write a simple plain for loop. I believe we all

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:17.700
are able to understand that part. Now once I'm able to

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:22.200
convert my data into a numeric space, we have to store those

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:25.800
information, embedded information, by the way. Okay. A

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:30.100
vector information inside my DB, inside my database, how I

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:33.140
will be able to store it. So whenever you will try to store

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:37.180
our data into a chroma DB, right, because we are using a

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:39.440
chroma DB. So whenever you have to store our data into a

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:43.000
chroma DB, first of all, you have to create a collection.

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:46.600
Collection is nothing. Even in MongoDB, we try to create a

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.680
collection. Even in Cassandra, we try to create a

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:52.420
collection. In case of a MySQL databases, we try to create a

00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:55.640
tables. Right. So you can think like that. That okay, fine.

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:59.020
So we are trying to give a name space for that. Okay, fine.

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:01.560
So this is the collection name inside that I'm going to dump

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:05.460
all my vector or all my data set. So how I will be able to

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:08.680
create a collection. So to create a collection, call your

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:11.900
client, client that we have already created over here,

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:14.640
right. Chroma DB client. So which is going to establish a

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:17.980
communication by the way. So just try to call your client.

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:22.600
Yeah. So client dot and then you can try to call create

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:26.260
collection. Fine. Create collection and then you can try to

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:29.820
maybe give a name to the collection. So name is equal to the

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:32.420
answer collection. Maybe you can try to give your own name.

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:36.120
I don't have any kind of issue at all. Yeah. So this is how

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:39.160
you will be able to create a collection again. Simple, easy.

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:43.040
Yes. So basically a tabular kind of a structure or in other

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:46.080
word, you can say you are trying to create a document and

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:49.480
you are giving a name to it. Yeah. So tech collection

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.560
technically means that that you are trying to create a

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.460
document. You are trying to give a name to it. So that you

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:57.740
will store all of those information inside that document. So

00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:00.340
this is where the collection comes into a picture. You can

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:03.280
try to even compare this collection name with the tables

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.720
that, okay, fine. So I have created a table. Now I can try

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:08.460
to store the data into the table in case of a MySQL system.

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:13.280
So here I can try to maybe create a variables collections, C

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:18.280
O L L E C T I O N collection variable. Okay. So this is how

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:20.560
you can try to create the collection guys. So everyone

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:25.960
create a collection. Yeah. I can try to store my data. So

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:29.500
simple, create a collection. Now once we are able to create

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:31.960
a collection, right? Once we are able to create the

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:36.060
collection, I can start adding my data into the collection.

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:39.820
Yeah. I can start adding my data into the collection. So to

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:45.260
add a data, so simple collection dot add dot add, you have

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:49.220
to call and then there is a variable called as document.

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:52.760
Document is equal to text means I would like to store even

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:57.120
this data. Text data. Yeah. I would like to even store the

00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:59.660
embeddings, the embeddings which I have generated the

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:02.240
numerical information which I have generated. I would like

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:06.860
to store that as well. Fine. And then for every information,

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:09.840
for every document and embedding that we are trying to

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:14.580
store. So maybe I would like to give a unique ID to it.

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:18.300
Yeah. Unique ID to it. So I'm just generating a ID, a means

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:21.500
unique number I'm trying to generate that. Okay, fine. So ID

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:24.840
one, two, three, four, five, six. And so on. Right. As you

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:27.700
can see. Yeah. So one, two, three, four, five, six and so

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:30.520
on. So it will try to generate an ID. You can try to maybe

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:33.460
write some different logic to write, create the ID. That's

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:36.220
completely fine. You can try to give your own name in terms

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:39.280
of like creating the ID or maybe in terms of creating the

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:44.740
record basically for this one and here. So it will end up

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:49.720
adding a data. This is how simple it is. Now this step is

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:54.520
going to add a data into your data base. As simple as that.

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:59.900
Is it making sense to all of us guys? Yeah. Is it making

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:02.740
sense to all of us? Are we able to add the data? Are we able

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:06.740
to execute it till a collection? Okay. So we are able to

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:09.660
execute it till a collection. Now I can try to cross check.

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:13.580
I can try to write like a collection dot collection dot.

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:17.020
There is a function called as count. So I can try to call

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:20.440
count by the way. And I'm able to see that that there are 10

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:25.100
data which is available inside the collection. I had 10

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:29.840
data, right? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:33.800
nine, 10. So I had 10 data. I am able to add those data into

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:37.900
the collection. As simple as that. Okay. That's cool. I, if

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:39.920
I would like to see all the data, how I can see all the

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:43.880
data. So again, collection dot, there is a function called

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:47.520
as get, yeah, there is a function called as get. Now, if you

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:50.360
are going to call a collection, not get, it is going to show

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:52.880
you the IDs. ID was zero one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:53.500
seven, eight, nine, 10. One, two, three, four, five, six,

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.620
seven, eight, nine. This is the logic that we have

00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:57.380
mentioned, right? This is the logic that we have written to

00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:02.260
create the ID. Fine. So now it is able to show me now

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:05.200
document wise, the original data wise, it is able to show me

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:09.220
this one. Fine. So here metadata, I have not added any kind

00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:11.580
of a metadata so far. So that's the reason it's none, none,

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:14.820
none. I have this parameter as well. So where I can try to

00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:17.980
add a metadata. Metadata means any information, additional

00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:20.920
information, maybe a length of the data or any other

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:23.180
information which I would like to add. I can try to add it,

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:27.100
but I have purposely not added it. I have just added IDs and

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:31.460
I have just added a document inside this one as simple as

00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:34.580
that. Is it making sense to all of us?

00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:45.540
Why embedding is showing as none? I'll show you. Don't

00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:48.500
worry. I'll show it to you. Yeah. I'll show it to you.

00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:58.350
Yes. Till this point we are able to do it. Yeah. Okay. So

00:45:58.350 --> 00:46:01.570
now we are able to create a collection and inside the

00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:05.010
collection we are able to store the data. Okay. That's cool.

00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:09.830
So storage is done. Adding a data set is done. Now what we

00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:13.550
can do is that, that we can try to query, right? We can try

00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:16.950
to search something from this data and we can try to check

00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:21.070
that whether we are able to do this, you know, a vector

00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:24.890
search inside my chroma DB or not. We'll try to like cross

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:28.810
verify it. So here to perform any kind of a search, we can

00:46:28.810 --> 00:46:31.690
try to write a query. So let's suppose if I'm writing a

00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:35.430
query, Q U E R Y query. Okay. And what is the query? So

00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:42.360
query is let's suppose Danshu worked in which company let's

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:46.120
or maybe Danshu worked at Deloitte,

00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:54.430
Deloitte, yeah. So maybe this is my query and let's suppose

00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:57.690
if I would like to fire this query in a data set that I have

00:46:57.690 --> 00:47:00.530
already stored inside my chroma DB, it should be able to

00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:04.230
give me, or it must be able to give me a relevant record or

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:07.530
maybe a nearby record it should be able to produce. Okay.

00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:10.610
That should be able to give it to me. So this is my query by

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:14.190
the way. Now if I have to do any kind of a search, like if I

00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:17.810
do any kind of a search, so obviously I have to convert this

00:47:17.810 --> 00:47:21.790
query into embeddings once again by using a same embedding

00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:25.890
mechanism that I have already used it for storing the data.

00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:29.430
So here I can try to call again generate embedding function

00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:33.090
and then I can try to pass a query. I can try to pass a

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:36.230
query and then this is going to give me a embedding for

00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:40.330
query. So query underscore EMBED embed in this variable I'm

00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:43.890
going to store it. So this is my query guys. Yeah. So this

00:47:43.890 --> 00:47:47.530
is my query and then I'm going to call this query

00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:52.410
embeddings. So this is going to convert my query into again

00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:57.230
a vector space. So my query Danshu worked at Deloitte. So

00:47:57.230 --> 00:48:01.190
this query is now available into a embeddings. Now once this

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:04.250
is available as an embeddings, I can try to perform a search

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:08.050
operation. So how I will be able to do a search operation.

00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:12.030
So here to do a search operation, again collection in which

00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:14.830
you have already stored the data. So collection dot query

00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:17.990
you can try to call, yeah, collection dot query you can try

00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:22.210
to call and then here, so query embedding is equals to query

00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:25.330
embedding. So the query embedding vector that I have already

00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:28.250
created from my query. So I'm supposed to pass that one and

00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:31.210
then top K result, top K result means I'm looking for top

00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:33.370
two results. This is the, this is the meaning of it. Yeah.

00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:36.390
This is the result I'm looking for. So top two result and

00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:39.290
now execute it now here. So when you are going to execute

00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:43.350
it, right, so here it is trying to give you IDs three and

00:48:43.350 --> 00:48:46.830
four. What was my query by the way? My query was Danshu

00:48:46.830 --> 00:48:50.450
worked at Deloitte. Yeah. So this was my original query and

00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:54.030
here, so it is trying to return me IDs three and four.

00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:56.530
Danshu earned computer science and engineering degree. So

00:48:56.530 --> 00:49:00.790
this is the nearest one it is able to find out and he worked

00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:04.150
at Wipro, Deloitte, Verizon labs, Ernest and Young. So these

00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:08.310
are the two, right? These are the two and it is giving you

00:49:08.310 --> 00:49:10.890
even a distance. It is even giving you a distance, right?

00:49:11.330 --> 00:49:16.890
The distance is 0.87 for a document ID three and distance is

00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:21.910
0.95 for a document ID technically four. Yeah. So based on

00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:24.770
this distance, so it is trying to give you this one. So this

00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:27.650
one is the nearest one. Danshu earned a computer science and

00:49:27.650 --> 00:49:31.410
engineering degree, which is the nearest one with respect to

00:49:31.410 --> 00:49:34.090
Danshu worked at Deloitte. It doesn't look like nearest one

00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:41.150
by the way. So Danshu was born in Jamshedpur. Now let's go

00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:44.970
ahead with this query. Yeah. So with this query, it is able

00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:49.570
to give me ID zero and ID three. So ID zero is having the

00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:53.310
nearest one and ID three, it is having like a 0.94, which is

00:49:53.310 --> 00:49:56.970
almost far. So Danshu was born in Jamshedpur, Jharkhand,

00:49:57.070 --> 00:50:00.690
India, the modest family. So yes, it is closer to my query.

00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:02.490
So Danshu earned a computer science engineering degree. So

00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:05.470
this is the second nearest one. Yeah. This is the second

00:50:05.470 --> 00:50:09.830
nearest one, which doesn't looks good to me by the way. Yes.

00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:13.290
It doesn't look good to me. Making sense guys, to all of us.

00:50:14.350 --> 00:50:14.750
Yes.

00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:39.220
So sir, this value is greater than one. I'm getting 1.68. It

00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:43.780
simply means that that your search is not relevant.

00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:59.860
Yeah. So by default, it is trying to use a cosine

00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:03.540
similarity, but yes. So inside a chroma DB. So they have

00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:05.980
already given an option for a Euclidean distance and they

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:09.580
have even given an option for a IP, inner product. So both

00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:11.660
the options are available, but yes, if you're not trying to

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:14.040
give anything in that case, it is going to use a cosine

00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:15.880
similarity and cosine similarity is something that we have

00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:19.100
already discussed, right? So we already like know about the

00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:21.920
formula. We already know about the manual calculation in

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:27.420
terms of doing a cosine similarity. Find everyone. Yeah.

00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:30.700
Results are different. Obviously your result and my result

00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:33.040
is going to be different. It is not going to be same. Even

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:37.760
embeddings are not going to be same for you and for me. And

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:40.060
even distances are not going to be the same. So if my

00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:43.120
embeddings itself is not going to be same to how distance is

00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:45.860
going to be same, it will be nearby. It will be approximate,

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:50.280
but it is not going to same at all. Means at all. So if

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:52.740
you'll take, check this number, right? It is not going to be

00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:54.840
same at all because your embeddings and my embeddings are

00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:57.740
different because the embeddings are the generated one,

00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:01.280
right? It's not a fixed one. It's a generated one. And if it

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:04.380
is a generated one, it's a nearby number, not the exact same

00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:09.660
number, fine. So now we are able to perform a search

00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:12.000
operation as simple as that. We are able to perform the

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:16.260
search operation and somehow approximate search. We are able

00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:19.740
to get it. We'll try to tune this one more and more. That is

00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:22.400
a lot of a scope where we can go and we can try to tune this

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:25.380
entire things. And that depends upon a lot of factor that we

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:28.040
have already discussed in my previous classes. But yeah, as

00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:30.740
of now, so I'm able to complete the full cycle. So where I'm

00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:35.200
able to, you know, uh, search and based on my search, it is

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:37.980
able to give me a approximate result. Plus I'm able to see

00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:42.160
even my distances. Yeah. Plus I'm able to see my distances.

00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:46.080
So that's cool. Till this point you have to perform this

00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:49.120
operation. Let me bring you this last piece of the code. So

00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:52.200
here we are able to perform this operation in my local

00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:55.160
system. Now let's suppose, let's suppose if I have to

00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:58.500
perform this operation over here, so I have to push this

00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:01.320
entire things inside a cloud. Cloud platform, chroma DB

00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:04.200
cloud platform, by the way. So again, that is not going to

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:07.040
be the big deal. I can try to copy this client. So

00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:10.740
previously my client was local, yeah, previously my client

00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:13.920
was local. Now let's suppose this is my client, yeah, this

00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:19.000
is my client. So okay, execute it. So it will be able to

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:22.680
connect, okay, fine. It is able to connect with the database

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:27.680
test and then I can try to call my client dot, uh, create

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:30.880
collection, right? Create collection. And let's suppose I'm

00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:33.180
creating a collection with the name Dhanashukumar and I can

00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:37.640
try to give a name collection, same, same as step you have

00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:41.780
to do, right? So once your client is ready, so your steps

00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:44.480
are not going to change. Whatever steps that you are doing

00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:47.240
in a local system, even in local system, you have created a

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:50.500
client which is nothing but a collection connection by the

00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:53.500
way. And even here, so I'm trying to do the exact same

00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:55.660
thing. So I have created my client and then collection I'm

00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:59.660
trying to create once my collection is ready. So once this

00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:04.400
one is ready, then try to call add and add the entire

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:11.590
information, this one. So collection not add, fine,

00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:19.750
okay, now execute.

00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:28.070
And now it is taking some time because it is trying to store

00:54:28.070 --> 00:54:32.010
my entire information inside a cloud database. Now if I'll

00:54:32.010 --> 00:54:37.390
go and check my cloud database, so see, here is my data

00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:41.410
which is available to me. So are you able to do it guys?

00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:45.750
Steps are completely same. I'm just trying to use my new

00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:50.810
client, a client which is basically designed for my cloud

00:54:52.570 --> 00:54:59.920
based chromadb. Yes, as simple as that. Are these test API

00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:03.100
key provided by chromadb for testing? Obviously yes, I have

00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:05.760
just created it right in front of you, fine.

00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:12.030
Now here, if you are going to click on your IDs, you will be

00:55:12.030 --> 00:55:15.910
able to even see the embeddings. And not just that. It is

00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:18.830
even giving you a top three search. As you can see by

00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:25.250
default, chromadb is giving you a top three search. So it is

00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:28.250
trying to show you the embeddings. I have not added any kind

00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:30.630
of a meta information. If I would like to add some meta

00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:33.810
information, I can try to add it. That's completely fine in

00:55:33.810 --> 00:55:37.430
a JSON format, but I have not done that. And here, so it is

00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:42.170
trying to give me the top nearest one by default, right?

00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:44.990
That, okay, fine. So with respect to this one. If this is

00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:48.010
this. If this itself is a query, then which one is going to

00:55:48.010 --> 00:55:52.630
be the nearest one? It is even trying to show it to me. So

00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:55.310
this is how you will be able to set a embedding model. So

00:55:55.310 --> 00:55:59.850
you can even try to select a embedding model where, so it

00:55:59.850 --> 00:56:02.730
can try to use an embedding model from a chromadb itself,

00:56:02.890 --> 00:56:08.410
but yeah, that will come with the charges. As of now, so I

00:56:08.410 --> 00:56:10.550
have just used my own embedding model and as you can see

00:56:10.550 --> 00:56:14.650
that I mentioned 1536. This is my own embedding model. If I

00:56:14.650 --> 00:56:16.910
would like to use some other embedding model from some other

00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:19.930
provider, I can try to use that as well. Even even they are

00:56:19.930 --> 00:56:22.490
giving you this option. Even they are giving you this

00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:25.730
option. So basically in case of a chromadb, they are giving

00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:28.770
you two options. So one option is so where you can try to

00:56:28.770 --> 00:56:32.650
convert your data into an embedding and then store it.

00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:35.530
Otherwise they are giving you an option. So where you can

00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:39.790
just try to take your textual information and store it. You

00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:42.930
don't have to even send the embeddings and what it will do.

00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:45.990
So let's suppose. If I have selected one of these models,

00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:49.230
like one of these models, if I have selected, so by default

00:56:49.230 --> 00:56:52.590
it is going to use one of these model and then it is going

00:56:52.590 --> 00:56:56.370
to create the embeddings. But again, it comes with the

00:56:56.370 --> 00:57:02.910
charges by the way. Yes, it comes with the charges. So even

00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:05.790
they are giving you the same model access, the model that is

00:57:05.790 --> 00:57:11.410
available inside a URI API. Text embedding 3small. I believe

00:57:11.410 --> 00:57:16.470
this is the model that we have used. Just now. Making sense

00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:16.750
guys.

00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:26.320
Yes

00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:33.570
hugging face model will be free to use locally. Yes if you

00:57:33.570 --> 00:57:36.470
last time even I have shown you right. So hugging face are

00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:39.590
providing you lots of open source models. So you can try to

00:57:39.590 --> 00:57:43.390
download any of the best model, maybe a Mr series model,

00:57:43.550 --> 00:57:47.070
maybe a llama series model. You can try to download and then

00:57:47.070 --> 00:57:48.010
you can try to use it.

00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:58.220
Okay. So that's cool guys. No. I think we are able to

00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:01.200
perform all of these operations and finally into a local

00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:04.240
system as well as into a cloud system. Now whenever I'll be

00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:07.120
talking about building a solution, so I will not be using a

00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:09.240
local solution. I will be using always a cloud solution,

00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:12.480
maybe from a chroma, maybe from a baby, maybe from a pine

00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:15.620
cone, maybe from a quad quadrant or maybe like some other.

00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:19.860
But yeah, so we all are going to use a cloud based solution.

00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:22.940
We are not going to use a local based solution. So maybe

00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:26.040
till embedding it's completely fine. So even till embedding.

00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:30.280
We have a API key. So those APIs are already global, right?

00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:33.620
Anyone and everyone can use it. And at the end of the day we

00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:35.960
have to make sure that every system, whether it's an

00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:38.160
embedding system, whether it's a storage system, whether

00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:42.200
it's a query system, everything should be global. Nothing is

00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:44.640
supposed to be local. Then only you will be able to build a

00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:49.000
real time application which can be used by anyone. Now our

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.760
embedding system, which is a URI API, it's already global

00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:56.420
chroma, it's already global. Now any application that we are

00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:58.460
going to build it, which is going to communicate with the

00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:03.200
embeddings and this one, I can, I can make it global with

00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:09.630
ease. Local where data gets stored in chroma DB. Chroma

00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:12.750
itself is providing you the storage, right? So here is a

00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:16.570
data set, right? Inside my test database, it has been a

00:59:16.570 --> 00:59:23.730
stored. Fine. Okay. No. So once we are able to do this, uh,

00:59:23.850 --> 00:59:25.830
I think now we are able to like, uh, you know, we're, you

00:59:25.830 --> 00:59:28.150
know, do some experimentation with the chroma. So chroma is

00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:31.490
done. Now moving to the next one guys. So once chroma is

00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:34.130
done, so move to the next one, there is another database we

00:59:34.130 --> 00:59:37.970
can try to use. I'm going to create a new file and it's

00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:43.810
going to be pinecone, I P Y N B, yeah, pinecone. So chroma

00:59:43.810 --> 00:59:47.130
DB is providing you two option, one local and one is

00:59:47.130 --> 00:59:51.010
basically a global. A shared, a shared space you can try to

00:59:51.010 --> 00:59:53.590
use or manage the space you can try to use to perform the

00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:56.230
same thing. Now there is another database. A vector based

00:59:56.230 --> 01:00:02.330
database, which is called as pinecone. Yeah. So pinecone, I

01:00:02.330 --> 01:00:06.530
can try to use it again with the ease, which is again a self

01:00:06.530 --> 01:00:09.790
managed database. I can go over here. I can try to search

01:00:09.790 --> 01:00:13.670
for pinecone and you will be able to see this option. So

01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:16.570
just go to the pinecone.

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:24.160
Here is a link pinecone.io and then try to click on login.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:29.560
Pinecone is also same as like a chroma DB. Almost all the

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:34.040
vector databases are same. Yeah. Let me delete my previous

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:34.720
data.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:47.760
Okay. So just log into the pinecone guys, everyone. And once

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:50.740
you are able to log in, you will be able to see the exact

01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:54.900
same page like me. Once you are going to log in for the very

01:00:54.900 --> 01:01:00.020
first time. Yeah. So pinecone is again another vector

01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:04.480
database, a managed database, which is going to give you a

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:10.400
complete industry grade application. Building facilities. So

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.440
here they are giving you like a start building a RIG Q and a

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:17.700
multimodal search, a semantic search. I don't have to like

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:20.920
go and pay to a pinecone to build these things. I can, I can

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:22.980
build it even without paying to a pinecone. This is what

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:26.820
we'll do. Yeah. But yes, just to make it easy. So they are

01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:31.440
giving you like a lot of examples as well. So here you can

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:33.740
come and you can try to search even like a lot of examples,

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:38.280
but I don't think that it's. It's like a required, I'm going

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:42.120
to show you now with my own data set. So are we able to log

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:46.300
in guys, everyone into pinecone, just log in and you will be

01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:47.100
able to see this page.

01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:55.030
Yes. Aman is saying yes. Okay. What about others? Pinecone

01:01:55.030 --> 01:01:58.350
done. Okay. Gala is saying we've been saying yes. Okay. Do

01:01:58.350 --> 01:02:01.170
it guys. You have two minutes of time.

01:02:10.050 --> 01:02:16.050
Okay. Many people are saying now. Yes. Hmm. Cool. Hmm. So

01:02:16.050 --> 01:02:20.230
again, like I said, guys. Pinecone is another vector DB. So

01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:23.490
where you can try to store the data. So I will be storing

01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:27.070
the same data, the data which I have used just now for a

01:02:27.070 --> 01:02:29.750
chroma DB. So I can try to use the same data. I can try to

01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:35.470
store the same data inside a pinecone. How I will be able to

01:02:35.470 --> 01:02:39.130
store a data into a pinecone. So first of all, you have to

01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:41.910
do pip install pinecone as per the instruction which has

01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:45.350
been mentioned. So let's do it. Pip install pinecone. So

01:02:45.350 --> 01:02:48.550
I'll go to my Jupyter notebook. And I'll try to write pip

01:02:48.550 --> 01:02:54.770
install pinecone. Okay. Fine. Select kernel. So same kernel.

01:02:55.410 --> 01:02:56.810
So pip install pinecone.

01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:03.550
In my system, it's already available. So it is telling me

01:03:03.550 --> 01:03:08.010
that requirement already satisfied. Done everyone. Pip

01:03:08.010 --> 01:03:11.610
install pinecone. Even they have mentioned the same query.

01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:19.880
Pip install pinecone. Now once you are able to do this. Pip

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:23.380
install pinecone. Right. Once you are able to do this pip

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:26.200
install pinecone. So we have to establish a connectivity

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:29.240
connectivity between my local system and the pinecone. And

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:32.080
don't worry, you don't have to add a card over here. By

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:34.960
default, they're giving you a free spaces. So you can try to

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:37.660
use it, which is more than enough, I believe for doing any

01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:41.620
kind of experimentation. So here, once you are able to do

01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:44.440
pip install pinecone, you have to click on create indexes.

01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:48.120
So the way we have created a collections basically, in case

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:51.680
of this one, chroma db. So similarly, you have to click on

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:53.240
create indexes. Similarly, we can try to create the indexes

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:57.060
over here. So here I can try to enter my index name. Maybe I

01:03:57.060 --> 01:04:00.060
can try to write sudahanshu underscore s t o r y. Sorry.

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:06.500
Sudahanshu story. Right. So this is the index name I'm going

01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:08.940
to give. You can try to give any of your name. That's

01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:12.560
completely fine. Now by default, you will be able to see

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:16.920
that pinecone is showing you some of the model. So it is

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:19.400
going to show you a llama text embedding version two,

01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:21.680
multilingual E5 large. Pinecone is showing you some of the

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:25.220
model. fine cone is sparse, english is v0, text embedding 3

01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:28.260
large, right. So again similar kind of a model, text

01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:31.520
embedding 3 small, the model that we already have. And they

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:34.680
are giving you even this manual configuration. So by default

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:40.060
they are giving you some of the embeddings LLMs by the way.

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:43.220
By default they are giving you some of the embedding LLMs.

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:48.340
So in that situation you don't have to you know use any kind

01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:53.180
of LLMs locally. For example we are using this one. We are

01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:56.240
using text embedding 3 small which is available with respect

01:04:56.240 --> 01:05:00.040
to a URI API. But let's suppose if I am going to select it

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:03.400
over here or if I am going to select anything over here. So

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:08.260
I don't have to go and I don't have to you know convert

01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:11.720
anything into the embeddings in my local. I can simply send

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:16.900
a data and automatically it will try to convert. But it is

01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:21.960
going to give you a charges. Yes. You will end up getting a

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:27.040
charges by the way. And again a starter limit. So they are

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:31.880
giving you 5 million token. So 50 lakh token is a free token

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:36.880
that they are giving you. But beyond that they will charge.

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:40.360
Yeah. So a starter limit for Painkuners Pass English is not

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:46.260
available. You can't use it. Again there is no, they have

01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:49.700
not mentioned about the starter limit for this one. Not even

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:51.780
for this one. So they are going to charge you by the way.

01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:55.800
Yeah. They are going to charge you for these models. But

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:59.280
here so I don't want to use their embedding models. What I

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:02.980
want. So I wanted to use my own embedding models. Maybe from

01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:08.880
a hugging phase. Maybe my own URI API provided model. So I

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:12.300
would like to use those models. In that situation you have

01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:16.160
to select this custom setting. All of those models will be

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:20.120
gone. Yeah. So all of these models will be gone

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:23.340
automatically. So just try to select on this custom setting

01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:26.700
and then vector type is equal to dense and sparse. So

01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:29.620
basically the meaning of dense and sparse is very simple.

01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:33.620
Dense means so for every vector you will be able to get a

01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:37.040
non zero values. Means there will be some numbers. Sparse

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:40.100
means a vector with the zero numbers. For example if we are

01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:43.240
going to use a one hot encoding. So majority of time my

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:47.920
vector will be 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Vector value will be 0 0 0 0 0

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:50.860
0. That is something called as sparse. Right, sparse. Dense

01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:53.940
means I have a numeric. So obviously I will be having a

01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:56.880
numeric. So I can try to select a dense. Now what is the

01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:01.500
dimension? So dimension of my model is going to be 1 5 3 6.

01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:07.300
Right. I'm going to use open air txt small. So dimension is

01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:11.020
going to be 1 5 3 6. And then whenever I am going to store

01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:16.280
embeddings. So which mechanism I would like to use for a

01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:17.900
distance or for a matching. So I am going to choose

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:19.140
intelligent imagination. So, maybe I can try to use a

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:22.040
cosine, I can try to use a Euclidean, I can try to use a dot

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:25.340
product. So, I can try to use a cosine, by default it will

01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:27.640
be cosine, otherwise you can try to even go ahead with the

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:29.820
Euclidean, you can try to even go ahead with the dot

01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:33.120
product, your wish, right. ChromaDB was providing you again

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:35.880
all three options, Facebook as Semantic Search was providing

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:39.420
you all three options, so all of this DB eventually is

01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:43.400
providing you all of these three options. Making sense guys,

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:48.960
yes, more dimension of vector is better, no, I will not

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:52.780
agree with that point, that more dimension means more

01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:58.340
accurate or more stable vector, it depends upon the model

01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:00.880
data as well and the kind of a training that we have done,

01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:08.520
yes everyone, done.

01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:36.400
So, Karthik is asking me a question that difference between

01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:39.960
dense and or sparse, so see dense simply means, let me open

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.660
up my pen. So,

01:08:46.970 --> 01:08:51.410
dense vector means a vector, so where you will be able to

01:08:51.410 --> 01:08:58.010
get the numbers, right. So, even over here 0.031022 or like

01:08:58.010 --> 01:09:02.610
0.123, so if we have this kind of a vector and we have very

01:09:02.610 --> 01:09:06.370
less zeros over here or may be a value closer to 0, so this

01:09:06.370 --> 01:09:11.590
is basically called as dense vector and if I will talk about

01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:15.850
the sparse vector, so sparse vector means 0, 0, 0, 0. So,

01:09:15.850 --> 01:09:20.970
then somewhere 1, somewhere like a 0.01 and then 0, 0, 0, so

01:09:20.970 --> 01:09:25.150
wherever we have a majority of data available as a zeros

01:09:25.150 --> 01:09:32.450
value is called as sparse, sparse vector. Now so in case of

01:09:32.450 --> 01:09:35.850
a dense vector, you will always end up getting a dimension

01:09:35.850 --> 01:09:40.930
may be between a range of I would say 256 to 4096, right.

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:45.190
For example, so here we have a dimension is equals to 1536.

01:09:45.190 --> 01:09:49.910
If it is a dense vector, if it is a sparse vector, then

01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:53.150
again the dimension is going to be very, very, very, very

01:09:53.150 --> 01:09:56.790
high. So if you remember from your childhood, we used to do

01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:59.750
one hot encoding, in case of one hot encoding, let us

01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:03.370
suppose we have a 10,000 unique words. So in that case,

01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:07.130
there will be 10,000 zeros, right and out of those 10,000

01:10:07.130 --> 01:10:11.030
zeros, only one is going to be one positive means up value

01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:15.550
or one you can say and rest of 9,999 values are going to be

01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:20.010
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, right. So it can go till any kind of a limit

01:10:20.010 --> 01:10:22.550
depends upon the mechanism that we are trying to use to

01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:28.450
convert our data set. So in case of a dense, your dimension

01:10:28.450 --> 01:10:31.870
is going to be very, very compact. In case of a sparse, your

01:10:31.870 --> 01:10:35.190
dimension is going to be very, very high and again so in

01:10:35.190 --> 01:10:39.210
terms of capturing a semantic meaning, dense will be able to

01:10:39.210 --> 01:10:43.950
capture a semantic meaning in a better way. Whereas if I

01:10:43.950 --> 01:10:46.670
will talk about the sparse. So in case of a sparse vector,

01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:51.790
it actually try to count the frequency means how many times

01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:56.670
the same data has occurred into the entire document by the

01:10:56.670 --> 01:10:59.670
way, which is not good in terms of capturing a semantic

01:10:59.670 --> 01:11:03.130
meaning. So basically wherever I am trying to use a REG kind

01:11:03.130 --> 01:11:04.990
of application, wherever I am trying to build a

01:11:04.990 --> 01:11:07.750
recommendation system, wherever I am trying to build this

01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:11.010
kind of a semantic search operation, so I should always use

01:11:11.010 --> 01:11:16.770
a dense vector for any kind of a data. Not a sparse one, not

01:11:16.770 --> 01:11:18.870
a sparse one at all.

01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:26.380
Aman sir used 1536 which was same as a text length, that is

01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:30.600
why I asked that question, which one? Which was same as a

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:34.340
text length, no, my text length was I think 8 or 10 words

01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:38.100
and again it was not even across the document, yes.

01:11:42.670 --> 01:11:47.510
Moving ahead, so here we have a pine cone, so we have a pine

01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:50.250
cone, matrix wise I can try to use any of this matrix. I can

01:11:50.250 --> 01:11:52.830
try to use cosine. I can try to use Euclidean. Cosine is one

01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:57.630
of the best one by the way. Now so if I have to create this

01:11:57.630 --> 01:12:01.690
one, if I have to create a pine cone indexes, so I can

01:12:01.690 --> 01:12:04.590
select a serverless, by default cloud provider is going to

01:12:04.590 --> 01:12:09.270
be AWS region, so Virginia US East 1 by default selection,

01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:12.950
so keep it as it is and then just try to click on create

01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:16.990
indexes. I am under starter plan means free plan, so create

01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:17.570
indexes.

01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:23.860
Now once you are able to create the indexes. You will be

01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:27.000
able to get the URL, URL by which you will be able to

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.260
connect, yeah and my Sudhanshu story right, my Sudhanshu

01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:35.600
story index is up now and reason is this, type is dense,

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:38.980
capacity mode is serverless, dimension is equal to 1536,

01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:42.180
matrix is cosine. So all of this information you will be

01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:46.040
able to see. Now I have to establish a connectivity, yes I

01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:48.300
have to establish the connectivity. Connectivity with this

01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:50.900
URL means technically this particular pine cone, I have to

01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:54.080
hit this pine cone DB. So here you will be able to see a

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:56.460
connect button, yeah, all of you will be able to see a

01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:58.680
connect button, just follow my mouse cursor, click on

01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:01.900
connect and once you are going to click on connect, it is

01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:04.400
going to give you multi language options. So it is giving

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:07.280
you node option, it is going to give you python option, java

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:10.320
option, go option, cell option, nowadays everyone is

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:13.920
providing you all the options. So simple, you need this URL,

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:17.600
you need this one, that is it, right, this is the only thing

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:20.160
which is required. So pine cone and then you have to provide

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:23.360
the API key. We will provide the API key, so just try to

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:26.700
select this one in the very first place and then go to your

01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:31.700
Jupyter notebook, fine. So from pine cone, import pine cone

01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:33.960
and before that you have to install the pine cone. So I

01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:36.560
believe we all have done the installation of pine cone. So

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:39.360
here from pine cone, import pine cone and then here we have

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:42.440
to attach the API key for a pine cone, yeah, we have to

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:45.440
attach the API key for a pine cone so that it will be able

01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:48.280
to hit the pine cone server, the indexes that we have

01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:51.760
already created, okay, that is cool. So just close this. So

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:54.660
close this one, right, we need a API key. So here they have

01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:57.480
provided you the API key option, just like a URI API by the

01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:59.920
way, yeah, even in URI we have a similar kind of a system.

01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:03.400
So API key and I believe we all understand the meaning of

01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:07.360
API key, that is the reason. So before starting my lectures

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:10.400
or before starting with the topics, I discussed about the

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:15.020
API key first because whenever you are going to build a real

01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:18.440
-time application without API key, it is not possible, yes,

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:23.660
okay. So click on this API key. By default, it will be blank

01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:27.820
for you. Just click on create API key and then give a name.

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:31.060
So maybe I am giving a name su dh and then it will end up

01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:36.960
creating the API key. Now copy, yeah, copy the API key and

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:39.380
then I can try to paste it here.

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:49.350
Done guys, everyone, till this point and execute. So it is

01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:54.550
giving 404 means not found, we will see, but yeah, are you

01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:57.110
able to do it till this point guys, everyone, yeah,

01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:25.840
done

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:32.180
everyone, yes. So basically it is giving me not found

01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:36.700
exception and reason not found HTTP response header this,

01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:42.080
this, this, this, this and code not found, that is fine. Now

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:46.080
here pinecone API key is fine. It is giving me issue at this

01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:51.360
point. So pinecone.index and by default, so it is giving me

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:54.960
index name is equal to quick start, right. This is the index

01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:59.020
name, which is by default one. And here my code is getting

01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:04.400
crashed. What was my index name by the way guys, yeah. What

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:08.400
was my index name by the way, can I say this was my index

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:12.360
name, sudhanshu story, right. So by default, it is giving me

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:14.760
inside a code quick start, which is a default one that they

01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:17.920
have set. But what is my actual index name? My actual index

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:20.640
name is actually sudhanshu story. This is the index name

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:23.520
which I have given, right. And maybe you had given. I have

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:27.160
given a different index name. So just try to use that index

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:30.180
name. It will be fixed automatically. So sudhanshu story

01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:34.280
index name I have given execute and this time it should not

01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:37.860
give me any kind of a issue like you can see. Yeah. So this

01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:41.040
time there is no issue at all. So just try to replace it

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:45.760
with your index name guys. Yeah done everyone API key from

01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:49.840
where API key from here. This one, this option, right. Just

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:51.960
follow along with a mouse cursor API key. Click. Click.

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:58.020
Create. Done. Just like a URI API. Yeah. Just like a URI

01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:00.760
API. So every, everything is like copy and paste kind of

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:04.980
things in case of these DBs. Okay. So I am able to establish

01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:08.660
a connection with respect to a pine cone. Now once I am able

01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:11.480
to establish a connection, I will be using the same data. So

01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:14.260
let's suppose this is the data which I am going to use. Same

01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:17.600
as before. As of now, I am not changing the data by the way.

01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:21.520
And even to, you know, generate the embeddings. I can try to

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:22.940
use the same function.

01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:29.470
Just call the same thing. Exact same thing. So whatever we

01:17:29.470 --> 01:17:32.450
have done for a embedding, the steps are going to be same. I

01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:35.670
am going to use a URI API and a text embedding three, a

01:17:35.670 --> 01:17:38.810
small model I am going to use to create the embeddings. So

01:17:38.810 --> 01:17:42.970
just use it once again. Now even for loop wise, it is going

01:17:42.970 --> 01:17:48.910
to be same. There is no differences, right? So execute and

01:17:48.910 --> 01:17:49.990
create the embeddings.

01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:12.850
Yeah. So embeddings are already created. Now once embeddings

01:18:12.850 --> 01:18:16.570
are created, yeah, once embeddings are created. So now what

01:18:16.570 --> 01:18:19.250
we can do, we can try to store this data. So even till this

01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:22.630
point, we have like done the exact same thing with respect

01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:25.670
to chroma DB. Even with respect to a Facebook, a similarity

01:18:25.670 --> 01:18:27.970
search, we have done the exact same thing. Even with respect

01:18:27.970 --> 01:18:31.210
to a quadrant, we have done the same thing. Yeah. So same

01:18:31.210 --> 01:18:34.730
thing we are doing nothing different. So I'm able to convert

01:18:34.730 --> 01:18:38.850
my data into the embeddings. Now what is next? Okay. So next

01:18:38.850 --> 01:18:42.650
step is going to be insert the data, right? Insert a record.

01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:47.210
So here to insert a record, my entry point should be index,

01:18:47.350 --> 01:18:49.630
right? Index is something that I have created as an object.

01:18:49.890 --> 01:18:54.170
So which is connected with my story. So here I can try to

01:18:54.170 --> 01:18:59.070
call basically a index, right? So index, and then there is a

01:18:59.070 --> 01:19:02.170
function called as absurd. So absurd is a function which is

01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:06.270
available for a pine cone. Yeah. Absurd. So I can try to

01:19:06.270 --> 01:19:11.390
call absurd. Yeah. And then I can try to store a data, maybe

01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:16.510
one by one, one by one. I can try to store or maybe I can

01:19:16.510 --> 01:19:21.010
try to store all the data in one go. That is also possible.

01:19:21.190 --> 01:19:23.850
So one single record, I can try to store one single

01:19:23.850 --> 01:19:26.950
embedding. I can try to store, or I can try to store the

01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:31.210
whole data set possible, right? Possible. Both the things I

01:19:31.210 --> 01:19:36.090
can, I can do it. So here, as you can see. So we are going

01:19:36.090 --> 01:19:40.170
to store the whole data. Let's, let's remove it. I'll, I'll

01:19:40.170 --> 01:19:43.910
try to show you the single storage first. So here there is

01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:48.770
a, a parameter called as vector. And now inside that, right

01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:53.650
inside that, so we can try to maybe like a bright, whatever,

01:19:53.650 --> 01:19:56.990
whatever I would like to like a store over here. So let's do

01:19:56.990 --> 01:20:04.250
it. So inside a vector, I can try to give maybe an ID the

01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:09.030
way we have given ID for a chroma DB. I'm trying to call,

01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:14.070
uh, basically embeddings. So let me write it this way. Let

01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:20.150
me store just a zeroth value. Embedding of zero. Yeah.

01:20:20.450 --> 01:20:25.510
Embedding of zero. Uh, let's remove this for loop. I'm going

01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:30.530
to store only one record and text is again zeroth. So as you

01:20:30.530 --> 01:20:34.390
can see, I'm giving ID is equal to zero, right? I can try to

01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:36.770
give any kind of IDs. I'm going to store. I'm going to store

01:20:36.770 --> 01:20:41.410
a zeroth record from our embeddings vector, right? And for

01:20:41.410 --> 01:20:45.030
the same, I'm going to store that text information means the

01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:50.150
complete line. I'm going to store it over here. So simple,

01:20:50.270 --> 01:20:55.090
right? Simple. Now let's go ahead and let's try to store it.

01:20:55.450 --> 01:20:59.530
So if I'm going to execute index dot upsert, it is going to

01:20:59.530 --> 01:21:03.750
upsert the data. So here is a code guys. Same as before. I'm

01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:07.530
going to store only one vector. So this is the vector ID of

01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:12.810
the vector embedding zeroth one and the text zeroth one. I'm

01:21:12.810 --> 01:21:16.430
going to store it. Now upserted count is equals to one.

01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:20.670
Okay. So this is the response which I'm able to see. Now go

01:21:20.670 --> 01:21:24.670
to the database, right? Go to the, your indexes by the way.

01:21:25.250 --> 01:21:29.590
And uh, here. So now I'm able to see, so the Anshu Kumar was

01:21:29.590 --> 01:21:32.410
born in Jamshedpur, Jharkhand, India to the modest family.

01:21:32.610 --> 01:21:36.590
Okay. So this is the record which I'm able to see already.

01:21:36.770 --> 01:21:39.990
And now if I'll click over here, if I'll try to click on

01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:45.050
edit, I will be able to see it's dense vector as well. So

01:21:45.050 --> 01:21:47.950
this is the vector. This is the embeddings. It is able to

01:21:47.950 --> 01:21:51.390
store our text walls. So this is the text which it has a

01:21:51.390 --> 01:21:54.310
stored metadata wise. I have not added anything. If I would

01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:56.530
like to add it, I can try to add it. That's completely fine.

01:21:56.650 --> 01:22:00.610
Leave it ID by default zero. So I believe we have given ID.

01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:03.870
We have given a dense value. And we have given a text and

01:22:03.870 --> 01:22:07.350
all of these values are already stored inside my record

01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:10.810
already stored inside my DV. So are we able to sort it guys?

01:22:10.970 --> 01:22:11.990
A very first record.

01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:16.660
Yes. All of us.

01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:25.280
Yeah. Mukesh is saying, can someone share the command to

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:28.480
generate the embedding? Uh, command to generate embedding is

01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:31.620
nothing. It's already available here. Just replace it with

01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:34.140
your API key. I have just pinged you in a chat.

01:22:37.410 --> 01:22:40.970
What is absurd? Absurd is nothing but a function, which is,

01:22:40.970 --> 01:22:44.370
which I'm using. To insert the data absurd is just a default

01:22:44.370 --> 01:22:48.690
function available inside the pine cone. And inside absurd,

01:22:48.910 --> 01:22:51.410
I'm trying to absurd only means I'm trying to insert only

01:22:51.410 --> 01:22:54.110
one record. So if I'm trying to insert one record, so here

01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:56.990
I'm trying to give the ID. So a string of zero. So it will

01:22:56.990 --> 01:23:00.470
become a zero embeddings. Embedding of zero means what? For

01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:06.100
a zeroth. So we have a embeddings, right? Embedding of zero

01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:11.440
means what? This one for which data, right? So for text of

01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:12.520
zero. For this data.

01:23:16.290 --> 01:23:20.090
For this line. So for this line, I'm trying to storing a

01:23:20.090 --> 01:23:22.010
lines. I'm trying to store the embeddings. I'm trying to

01:23:22.010 --> 01:23:26.470
store the ID. That's it. Only this much. Yeah. So only this

01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:30.990
much. I'm trying to store nothing much over here. So if I'll

01:23:30.990 --> 01:23:34.490
go here, I'm able to see this data is that same data. So

01:23:34.490 --> 01:23:37.710
this is how I can try to insert only one record. If I have

01:23:37.710 --> 01:23:41.610
to insert a multiple record, I can run it through the loop

01:23:41.610 --> 01:23:44.830
as simple as that, right? I can try to run it through the

01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:48.590
loop. And then I will be able to store the entire record.

01:23:50.970 --> 01:23:52.510
Making sense guys to all of us.

01:24:07.310 --> 01:24:10.850
So for embedding, we are using Euron. For storing, we are

01:24:10.850 --> 01:24:14.470
using pinecone. Correct. Yeah. So for embedding, we are

01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:17.670
using URI API and for storage, we are using pinecone.

01:24:17.990 --> 01:24:18.390
Correct.

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:25.080
What is the metadata visually do? So any kind of a key value

01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:28.120
pair, maybe you can try to add some sort of a label. So file

01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:30.860
name and its value, maybe like a page number or something,

01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:34.000
if you would like to store. You can store your Meta. Meta

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.420
information is nothing but data of data information about a

01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:39.200
data that depends upon me precisely.

01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:55.420
Okay. So everything is available now to all of us. So one

01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:58.920
record I'm able to insert. If I have to insert a record into

01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:01.640
a bulk, for example, if I have to insert all the records,

01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:05.300
right, if I have to insert all the records, so I have to

01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:08.640
basically like a form something like this, right? Something

01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:11.220
like this. I have to form. And one by one, one by one, one

01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:15.680
by one. Okay. So I can try to store the complete values. So

01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:18.400
I can write function. I can write a code over here.

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:24.760
Index dot index

01:25:26.770 --> 01:25:27.850
dot absurd.

01:25:30.410 --> 01:25:36.290
Yeah, absurd. And then I can try to go ahead with one and

01:25:36.290 --> 01:25:38.870
then two and then three. But I don't want to go ahead with

01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:43.230
one, two or three. So I would like to like go ahead with the

01:25:43.230 --> 01:25:48.210
entire dataset. Okay. So here, if I have to store the entire

01:25:48.210 --> 01:25:53.920
dataset, let me create a record for that records.

01:25:58.050 --> 01:26:01.210
Let's suppose I'm good. I'm creating a one single list over

01:26:01.210 --> 01:26:07.350
here and here. So I'll try to create a data in this format.

01:26:07.470 --> 01:26:10.850
Yeah. So that I can try to store it, how I can do it. So

01:26:10.850 --> 01:26:14.010
for, yeah.

01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:23.700
So for I in a range of this one. So record dot append ID.

01:26:24.020 --> 01:26:28.000
Okay. Embeddings and then a data. Now if I'm going to

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.680
execute and if I'm going to show you the records, so this is

01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:37.340
how my records looks like by the way. So ID embeddings and

01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:40.840
the data, yeah. Textual information. Now this is the format

01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:44.040
which was required. So I have already created a record. So

01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:47.540
inside my record, I have a record of everything. So simple

01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:52.560
for loop, simple Python code. You are moving too fast. Is

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:54.820
it? I'm moving too fast. I'm writing. I'm writing the same

01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:57.860
piece of the code multiple times. I'm not moving too fast.

01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:01.480
I'm doing the same embedding, which I have done even in my

01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:05.320
previous classes twice. Not not twice, maybe more than four

01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:06.440
or five times. Yeah.

01:27:10.340 --> 01:27:13.260
So if you are able to focus on every classes, you will be

01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:15.460
able to focus other, if I'm going to miss any of these

01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:21.640
classes, then it will be a painful game. Yep.

01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:29.000
Okay. So fine. We are able to convert this entire data into

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.900
our records. Now I have a record. So the cost means I have

01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:35.400
like all the collections. Now I have to update this record

01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:39.620
in one single sort, uh, inside my DB. So I can try to call

01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:49.540
index dot absurd, right? And then vector, uh, vectors is

01:27:49.540 --> 01:27:52.840
equals to records simple because the costs are already

01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:56.720
available into a compatible format. Execute it. And in a one

01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:59.620
single go, it will be able to insert all the records. So

01:27:59.620 --> 01:28:02.900
update absurd count is equal to 10. So 10 record it is able

01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:07.360
to absurd. Now if you will come here and if you are going to

01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:12.100
refresh it, right, if you are going to refresh it, you will

01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:15.160
be able to see all of these records, record count is equal

01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:15.700
to 10.

01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:27.480
So yeah, all of these records are available as you can see,

01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:30.760
right? All of these records are already available to me.

01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:34.560
Okay. So this is how I'm able to insert the data, right? I'm

01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:36.940
able to insert the data. So all of these data set is already

01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:40.740
available to me inside my DB. Now once all of this data set

01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:43.360
is available inside my DB, maybe I can go ahead with the

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:45.800
search operation. So again, that is going to be very, very

01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:49.140
easy. It's not at all a difficult task. So let's go ahead

01:28:49.140 --> 01:28:53.520
and let's do a search operation guys. So absurd is done. I'm

01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:57.400
able to insert the record. Now if I have to do a search

01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:00.660
operation, like if I have to do maybe a search operation,

01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:07.440
so, um, I can prepare a query, query and uh, here. So let's

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:11.620
suppose my query says that the Hanshu has worked

01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:20.120
at Wipro, right? Now let's suppose this is a query. So what

01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:22.380
is the game? The game is very simple. First of all, we have

01:29:22.380 --> 01:29:25.460
to convert this query into embeddings. Once my query is

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:28.340
available into an embedding, I can go ahead and I can do the

01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:32.040
search. So here to convert this query into the embedding, I

01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:34.700
can call my generate embedding function. One query and two

01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:39.400
list, uh, Q U E R Y. Okay. Whatever is the spelling doesn't

01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:46.060
matter at all. Generate embedding. So yeah, it is able to

01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:48.440
generate an embedding for this query for this line. It is

01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:51.500
able to generate the embedding and now I have to just do a

01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:55.060
cosine similarity. Yeah. So maybe I can try to show it as a

01:29:55.060 --> 01:29:56.380
variable Q U E R Y

01:29:59.490 --> 01:30:01.070
embeddings.

01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:09.220
So this is my query embedding by the way guys, my query,

01:30:09.340 --> 01:30:12.820
this query is available into the numerical space now. Okay.

01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:17.810
Same query I'm using, which I have used it last time. So

01:30:17.810 --> 01:30:23.770
everything is same except the connectivity. And now, so once

01:30:23.770 --> 01:30:26.570
I'm able to convert, once I'm able to convert my query into

01:30:26.570 --> 01:30:31.870
the embeddings, I can simply try to call index dot query. So

01:30:31.870 --> 01:30:35.870
default function is already available. So index dot a query

01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:39.590
and then index dot query. I can try to pass a query

01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:44.310
embedding vector. This one, right? I can try to pass

01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:47.170
basically a top case search. So give me a top three result,

01:30:47.250 --> 01:30:52.550
top five result or whatever, right? And include a meta data.

01:30:53.090 --> 01:30:56.790
You can make it true or false. Doesn't make any kind of a

01:30:56.790 --> 01:31:02.210
sense. It's fine. So here it is able to give me the matches.

01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:07.410
So the very first match is ID four with the fourth doc, with

01:31:07.410 --> 01:31:10.110
the fifth document technically. And what is the distance

01:31:10.110 --> 01:31:16.530
cosine distances? So it's going to be a 0.5796 and then

01:31:16.530 --> 01:31:20.890
there is something a 0.5731, no, the nearest one is this

01:31:20.890 --> 01:31:21.130
one.

01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:29.000
The nearest one is this one. Then you walked at Bipro,

01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:33.360
Deloitte, Verizon. Okay. So ID four, then ID three, it is

01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:37.340
able to give me, and then ID zero, so zero, three and four.

01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:41.700
So this is the final answer, which I'm able to receive. In

01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:45.620
terms of cosine. Cosine, similarity, distance, check.

01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:50.340
So this is the final result guys.

01:32:02.690 --> 01:32:08.170
Yeah. Closer to one means similarity. So this should be, ID

01:32:08.170 --> 01:32:11.990
three should be the ideal case means this is the nearest

01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:18.390
one. And then this is the second nearest one, 0.5797. So

01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:23.090
this is the second nearest one. Yeah. So we are able to get

01:32:23.090 --> 01:32:26.870
the final record. Okay. So this is how you will be able to

01:32:26.870 --> 01:32:35.060
do a search similar to the previous one, by the way. Now so

01:32:35.060 --> 01:32:38.400
pinecone is done. Now there is another DB that you will be

01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:41.280
able to find out as per your syllabus. And that is basically

01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:45.560
a Baviot. So chroma is done. Pinecone is done. Storage and

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:48.340
searching operation. Now let's try to talk about a Baviot.

01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:51.540
Is it fine guys? Shall we move? Everyone?

01:32:55.690 --> 01:32:58.410
Hello sir. In the same way, we can store the data in a JSON

01:32:58.410 --> 01:33:02.270
format in a vector DB. Okay. So we are actually storing our

01:33:02.270 --> 01:33:07.530
data in the exact same format. Yes. Yeah. Okay. So moving

01:33:07.530 --> 01:33:10.630
ahead guys, let's move to the next one. Create a new

01:33:10.630 --> 01:33:15.970
notebook. Baviot. So Baviot is another one, w-e-a-v-i-a-t

01:33:15.970 --> 01:33:23.770
dot i-p-y-n-b. Baviot database. Now Baviot is also a managed

01:33:23.770 --> 01:33:28.910
one. So you don't have to worry about a Baviot. Let me go to

01:33:28.910 --> 01:33:36.930
Google. And search for a Baviot. So this is a link for a

01:33:36.930 --> 01:33:39.290
Baviot database guys. I have already pinged you a link

01:33:39.290 --> 01:33:45.830
inside a chat. So just go and log in now. So again, click on

01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:49.470
try now. Once you are going to click on try now, they are

01:33:49.470 --> 01:33:52.750
going to give you an option. So you have to do a sign up

01:33:52.750 --> 01:33:59.730
first and let me do a sign up then. All tech courses. Okay.

01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:13.160
So they are sending me for an email verification.

01:34:21.180 --> 01:34:24.540
Let's do it. Sign up guys. Everyone.

01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:51.100
Okay. So once you will be able to do a sign up and once you

01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:55.200
will be able to do a verification, you will be able to see a

01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:59.680
page like me. Are you able to see it everyone? Just do a

01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:02.360
sign up and just do an email verification. You will be able

01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:07.920
to see a page just like me. Yeah. Everyone. They are giving

01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:10.800
you a couple of more option apart from the embeddings and

01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:13.920
everyone is trying to increase the offerings by the way. So

01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:17.800
just like a, you know, a Euron. So even inside the Euron, we

01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:20.340
keep on increasing the offering so that we'll be able to get

01:35:20.340 --> 01:35:24.640
more user. We'll be able to target more customers or like a

01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:28.320
more diversified market will be able to get in the similar

01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:32.540
manner. They have even added a agents and, and believe me,

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:34.600
in some time you will be able to find out similar kind of

01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:37.760
agent in pinecone. Okay. Chroma DB because if one people

01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:40.120
have one have done that, then for sure other will do

01:35:44.100 --> 01:35:47.520
a Kiran. I'll come to the, your question in a later stage

01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:52.860
after discussing about this baby yet. So just to answer your

01:35:52.860 --> 01:35:55.560
question in a brief, there is nothing called as best or

01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:58.580
worst. We have seen everywhere and I have already shown you

01:35:58.580 --> 01:36:03.200
everywhere that most of this managed DB are giving you an

01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:06.340
option for embeddings, right? And again, embedding will be

01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:09.480
under my control. If I would like to use X, Y, Z. G model, I

01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:12.780
can try to use X, Y, G model, right? I can try to use it.

01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:16.560
Everyone is giving you a cosine. Everyone is giving you a

01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:20.020
gradient. Everyone is giving you a dot product. Yeah. So

01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:22.740
even in case of a distance matching, everyone is giving you

01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:26.080
all the facilities. Again, there is no differences at all.

01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:30.020
So the only difference that you will be able to find out is

01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:34.640
the technically uprising part, right? So whenever we try to

01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:37.480
decide that, okay, we have to go ahead with the baby yet, or

01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:40.060
maybe a pine cone. Maybe with the chroma DB, maybe with the

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:45.040
quadrant, generally, we think about our pricing in a very,

01:36:45.100 --> 01:36:48.040
very first place. And with that pricing, what kind of

01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:51.440
instances they are giving me, right? What kind of uptime

01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:54.320
they are giving me, what kind of a latency my application

01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:57.440
will be able to face. So we just try to consider that part

01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:01.760
because facilities and feature wise and under the hood, you

01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:03.880
will be able to find out that everyone is doing the same

01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:08.640
thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So what basically is available in

01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:11.860
AWS azure and GCP? So all the services are available on AWS.

01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:15.400
All the services are available on Azure. All the services

01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:18.820
are available into GCP, right? Now, it depends upon their

01:37:18.820 --> 01:37:22.000
marketing, depends upon their customer acquisition, they try

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:26.220
to onboard so AWS has already, like, you know, received our

01:37:26.220 --> 01:37:29.820
first mover advantage, majority of like, you know, cloud

01:37:29.820 --> 01:37:33.720
customers, AWS is able to procure or you can say secure, but

01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:36.640
yeah, Azure came into a market in the latest stage. But

01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:39.680
again, Azure is able to secure. your good chunk of the

01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:43.200
market so just like that performance

01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:49.260
wise it depends upon the instances see when you will go with

01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:52.520
the paid plan right they will give you the instances even

01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:55.660
when I was talking about this pinecone so you must have

01:37:55.660 --> 01:37:59.700
observed that they are not using their own hosting they are

01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:02.420
giving you AWS option they are giving you Azure option they

01:38:02.420 --> 01:38:06.040
are giving you GCP option for example if I will click on

01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:08.440
pinecone and if I will try to create a new indexes once

01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:11.440
again so see here they are not doing anything by the way

01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:14.660
right so basically they have created a services under those

01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:16.620
services they have created basically services means

01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:19.520
converting something into the embeddings storing it doing a

01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:21.760
search cosine similarity search or maybe a Euclidean

01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:26.520
distance search or maybe a dot product search yeah but they

01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:29.140
are they are not like a hosting it directly they are

01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:33.140
basically using our instances of AWS Azure and GCP because

01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:37.120
see at the end of the day for any services on a cloud I need

01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:39.580
a machine cloud is one of the most important services in the

01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:42.400
cloud and cloud is one what just a machine right yeah just a

01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:46.100
machine the way we we are running something in my laptop in

01:38:46.100 --> 01:38:48.480
the similar manner that laptop is global and that we used to

01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:54.000
call as a cloud that's it so the cost depends upon the kind

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.780
of instances you are going to use plus their pricing model

01:38:57.780 --> 01:39:01.380
so see some of them are going to charge based on the fixed

01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:05.020
instances for example if I have taken a like configuration

01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:08.980
with XYZ right with AWS so there will be maybe a fixed cost

01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:18.920
options application D V for the default

01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:25.880
So this will be basically kind of a corporate tie up and in

01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:29.160
that way so we try to negotiate we say that okay fine so we

01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:32.200
are not going to pay you paper use you don't want to go

01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:35.000
ahead with that model so we will we would like to go ahead

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.080
with the reserve model reserve means for next three year for

01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:39.560
next four year we are going to resolve and you will have to

01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:39.560
pay for that rest of the time you have to make a new

01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:42.800
application So in that case my cost will be 70-80% less and

01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:45.860
even for them cost will be 70-80% less because even AWS

01:39:45.860 --> 01:39:49.040
Azure and GCP is providing you the reserve model for 3 year

01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:51.560
or more. So you can try to reserve the entire instances and

01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:55.020
then your prices will be 70-80% down. If you are going with

01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:57.240
the pay per use model, so again they are going to charge you

01:39:57.240 --> 01:39:59.880
for every hit, for network IO they are going to charge you,

01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:02.460
for embedding they are going to charge you, for a search

01:40:02.460 --> 01:40:04.480
query they are going to charge you, for everything again. So

01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:06.880
everyone is having a different kind of a pricing model by

01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:10.600
the way. So keeping everything in our mind we try to set the

01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:13.600
calculation that okay fine this is my uses and let us go

01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:15.640
ahead with the pay per use model, let us go ahead with the

01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:18.940
long term model, let us go ahead with the maybe some sort of

01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:22.100
a corporate client or there are some third party sellers as

01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:24.260
well. So sometime we go ahead with even that.

01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:31.840
Which one is used in URI, URI do not need this vector DV,

01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:39.020
why does URI need a vector DV, inside URI there is no vector

01:40:39.020 --> 01:40:43.980
DV, it is not required. We are using a DV for storing

01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:47.740
information plus we are using Redis for a catching over

01:40:47.740 --> 01:40:53.320
there to make it fast. So hope all of you are able to

01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:57.020
understand the game, game of the cost and again so with cost

01:40:57.020 --> 01:41:00.300
you will be able to see the performance, simple, so if my

01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:03.500
instances are higher obviously because technically it is AWS

01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:07.980
instance or GCP instances or Azure instances, as simple as

01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:13.450
that. So it is just like you are trying to create a startup.

01:41:13.730 --> 01:41:17.670
Right. Maybe you are trying to use like a OpenAI API and

01:41:17.670 --> 01:41:20.650
then you have created your own startup. For example URI,

01:41:20.770 --> 01:41:25.210
right. So for example like we are providing you GPT-5 model

01:41:25.210 --> 01:41:30.050
access but GPT-5 model we are not hosting it and we are not,

01:41:30.150 --> 01:41:32.390
we cannot even host it, it is not an open source model by

01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:36.750
the way so we cannot host it. Maybe a 20B OSS or 120B OSS we

01:41:36.750 --> 01:41:38.930
can host it because that is an open source format, OpenAI

01:41:38.930 --> 01:41:42.770
but if I will talk about a GPT-5, GPT-4 series we cannot

01:41:42.770 --> 01:41:46.510
host it, right. So we are trying to like you know use their

01:41:46.510 --> 01:41:49.890
API key and we are providing it to you. So basically we have

01:41:49.890 --> 01:41:52.510
created one more layer on top of it, right, a wrapper layer

01:41:52.510 --> 01:41:55.490
so that you will go through our system but technically you

01:41:55.490 --> 01:42:00.430
are accessing OpenAI itself even in case of this embedding

01:42:00.430 --> 01:42:04.010
model that we have used, right. So you are going through URI

01:42:04.010 --> 01:42:07.990
API but technically what you are able to access, the same

01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:10.690
one. So if you are going to access same one from OpenAI

01:42:10.690 --> 01:42:14.190
maybe they will charge you after some time. And here so we

01:42:14.190 --> 01:42:19.390
are giving you just as a complimentary services, simple. You

01:42:19.390 --> 01:42:22.390
are using fast API and create the router. We don't use a

01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:24.970
Python in our backend stack, we are using Node in our

01:42:24.970 --> 01:42:28.610
backend. So for a your own application. So we never use a

01:42:28.610 --> 01:42:31.890
Python over there. It's a complete mon.

01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:37.680
Okay, so hope all of you are able to understand the game,

01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:41.420
the real one, right. That how do we decide and which one is

01:42:41.420 --> 01:42:43.440
good, which one is bad. So nothing is good, nothing is bad,

01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:47.440
it's just a business deal. Now let's talk about waviate. So

01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:50.160
hope all of you are able to see this page. Yes everyone, all

01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:55.580
of you are able to see this page, yes or no guys, okay, yes,

01:42:55.740 --> 01:43:01.640
cool. Now so here you have to create a cluster, cluster

01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:04.800
means instances once again, right. So just click on cluster,

01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:08.120
create cluster and here so they are giving you sandbox,

01:43:08.420 --> 01:43:11.240
serverless and enterprise. So for serverless again they will

01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:13.620
ask you for a charge, for enterprise again they will ask you

01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:16.020
for charge. Context sales, go ahead with the sandbox.

01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:19.460
Sandbox means experimentation box, simple. A cluster name I

01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:24.100
can try to give like a su dh nshu, zansu something like

01:43:24.100 --> 01:43:27.220
this, yeah. A cloud provider, leave it as it is, seo

01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:30.880
pacific, leave it as it is, leave all this like things as it

01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:34.140
is. Now vector dimension, so what is a vector dimension that

01:43:34.140 --> 01:43:37.560
I will be having 1536. So by default 768 they have selected,

01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:41.340
go ahead with the 1536, yeah and this size 20 GB, it's a by

01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:44.100
default, fine. So they are giving you a size example. So

01:43:44.100 --> 01:43:46.660
that's the variable experimentation limit, don't worry. But

01:43:46.660 --> 01:43:49.520
again with the sandbox you can't deploy in a server in real

01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:53.900
time for the real user. Now click on create, yeah.

01:43:57.540 --> 01:44:00.040
So it will take some time as you can see, right, it will

01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:05.420
take some time to make this sandbox up and running. Your

01:44:05.420 --> 01:44:09.220
cluster has been created, it may take few minutes. So just

01:44:09.220 --> 01:44:10.120
wait for those minutes.

01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:42.230
So in between guys just try to install a baviot client

01:44:42.230 --> 01:44:46.830
inside your local system. Okay. So let me ping you the code

01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:47.910
so

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:57.040
that you will be able to hit baby yet. So in between, just

01:44:57.040 --> 01:45:00.360
go to your Jupiter notebook, uh, it will take some time to

01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:08.530
spin your cluster. So in between, just install this pine

01:45:08.530 --> 01:45:11.940
cone, sorry baby yet.

01:45:15.690 --> 01:45:18.670
So could you please tell the vector dimension? I think we

01:45:18.670 --> 01:45:20.370
all know what is the vector dimension? What is the vector

01:45:20.370 --> 01:45:20.890
dimension guys?

01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:29.010
Yes. What is the vector dimension? See, we have the answer.

01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:32.390
We are using the same dimensions as my previous three

01:45:32.390 --> 01:45:33.890
classes because

01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:38.520
that, that is the dimension that we are able to get from our

01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:44.250
open AI, uh, text three, a small model. No, no. I mean the

01:45:44.250 --> 01:45:47.290
setting on the grid. So same setting I'll use, right? So

01:45:47.290 --> 01:45:49.490
one, five, three, six, I have used, I have already shown you

01:45:49.490 --> 01:45:52.670
if my dimension is one, five, three, six or same, I'll use

01:45:52.670 --> 01:45:53.790
at the time of creation of cluster.

01:45:57.950 --> 01:46:01.410
So still it will take some time, maybe two, three minutes,

01:46:01.530 --> 01:46:03.050
not sure, still

01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:18.580
creating in between. Just install this client guys inside

01:46:18.580 --> 01:46:19.920
your system. Oh,

01:46:33.460 --> 01:46:34.760
not an issue. So it's fine.

01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:52.380
Still it is creating. So maybe a couple of more minutes it

01:46:52.380 --> 01:46:52.980
is going to take.

01:47:14.890 --> 01:47:18.770
Is this the last topic for today? Uh, yes. Yeah. And

01:47:18.770 --> 01:47:21.790
tomorrow we are going to use all of these, not all of these,

01:47:21.850 --> 01:47:25.230
one of these vector DB. I'm going to use it and I'm going to

01:47:25.230 --> 01:47:28.930
show you end to end application even with the UI. So UI

01:47:28.930 --> 01:47:32.890
front end back end, uh, deployment, all of these things,

01:47:32.930 --> 01:47:35.370
full cycle, we are going to cover with respect to one of the

01:47:35.370 --> 01:47:38.990
amazing RIG application. We'll try to build it inside the

01:47:38.990 --> 01:47:39.210
class.

01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:47.520
Meanwhile we can create the sample data. Yeah, that we have

01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:52.100
already done the right, uh, twice, uh, so we'll just do a

01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:54.120
copy paste to create the sample data.

01:48:02.860 --> 01:48:07.660
Sir, ab Hindi mein koi batch nahi hai kya? Samay ka abhav

01:48:07.660 --> 01:48:10.580
chal raha hai, samay agar hoga toh jarur lekar aa jayenge.

01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:17.340
Pinecone is more famous. Uh, no. Nothing is famous. Uh,

01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:22.840
majority of time, uh, you know, uh, we live in a influencer

01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:26.300
driven world. So if influencers have taken like this name,

01:48:26.340 --> 01:48:29.180
some name, like 10 times, 10 people have taken the same

01:48:29.180 --> 01:48:33.180
name. Then we think that it's a, you know, a famous one, but

01:48:33.180 --> 01:48:34.580
it's not like that.

01:48:41.780 --> 01:48:43.960
Embedding takes a lot of time if working for the large data

01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:46.580
set, what to do? No embedding is just a one time game,

01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:49.240
right? Embedding is nothing, not something which you will do

01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:51.840
again and again and again for the same data set. It's just a

01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:54.560
one time. So if, uh, even if it is going to take a time,

01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:57.420
it's not a costliest operation. It's fine.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.380
After 14 days, you need to create the cluster, need to pay.

01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:10.260
Yes. You can go ahead with basically, uh, another ID waiting

01:49:12.060 --> 01:49:15.700
for a big data engineering bootcamp. Okay. In, in between.

01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:18.520
So it is, it is taking some time, right? Okay. Let's talk

01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:22.600
about a new release inside your own. At least we can talk

01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:24.780
about that. Shall we talk about that guys? Yeah. Yeah. It is

01:49:24.780 --> 01:49:28.320
taking some time. So cluster creation. So see guys, one new

01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:31.580
things we have released, uh, young Euron. So I was, I was

01:49:31.580 --> 01:49:34.480
thinking about this, uh, since a very, very long time that,

01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:38.260
uh, uh, let's go ahead and let's try to teach AI to our kids

01:49:38.260 --> 01:49:40.340
and that too in a similar manner application building

01:49:40.340 --> 01:49:43.900
manner, because my style is not like, uh, you know, teach a

01:49:43.900 --> 01:49:47.680
theory, then drag it for a very, very long time and then try

01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:50.320
to build something as small. No, that's not my style. My

01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:54.400
style is simple. Build it and then learn it. It means learn

01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:58.200
by doing it, actually doing and keeping that in a mind. So

01:49:58.200 --> 01:50:02.860
we have launched a young Euron and uh, yeah. Uh, so if you

01:50:02.860 --> 01:50:06.260
have kids, if your neighbors have a kids or if you have like

01:50:06.260 --> 01:50:09.020
a, any, if you know any kids in your society or somewhere,

01:50:09.140 --> 01:50:11.600
so maybe you can try to spread this news and if they're

01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:14.620
coming through you, so you can simply say them that, okay,

01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:17.340
fine, you're going through me, then you will be able to get

01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:20.900
a huge discount. You just call a team and just give a

01:50:20.900 --> 01:50:23.700
reference, just say a name. Okay. And my team is going to

01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:27.400
give you a huge discount with respect to a young Euron and

01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:30.480
don't worry. So even if now someone is going to enroll for a

01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:33.240
young Euron, they will be able to like, uh, their, their

01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:36.620
subscription or their one year is going to start from 4th of

01:50:36.620 --> 01:50:40.680
October. So it is not going to start now. And yeah. Uh, so

01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:42.560
if someone is coming through you, so they will be able to

01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:45.280
get a huge discount. Like I said, and this is the very

01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:49.800
first, you know, a batch I'm going to start, but back to

01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:52.360
back. So I'll try to bring other batches as well. I'll try

01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:55.220
to bring up. Uh, programming batches. I'll try to bring, uh,

01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:57.920
a lot of different, different kind of a real time AI

01:50:57.920 --> 01:51:02.280
application batches inside a Euron system. So hope this idea

01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:06.780
is good, right everyone, uh,

01:51:09.140 --> 01:51:12.420
young Euron, please give Euron plus for my Euron plus no

01:51:12.420 --> 01:51:16.420
Euron plus is Euron plus is for adult basically for like

01:51:16.420 --> 01:51:21.000
anyone who is in engineering or beyond that, right? Yeah.

01:51:21.080 --> 01:51:27.440
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If it is you, anyone is coming

01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:29.840
through your referral, then they will be able to get a

01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:33.000
direct discount. You can negotiate with a team, maybe you

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.760
can talk to a team and then you can negotiate. They will

01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:38.940
give you like additional whatever negotiation, whatever best

01:51:38.940 --> 01:51:42.300
negotiation that you will be able to do based on that. So

01:51:42.300 --> 01:51:45.120
this is the instruction which I have given to my team. And,

01:51:45.140 --> 01:51:50.960
uh, yeah, inside the Euron. So live batches wise. Uh, we are

01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:54.040
going to start this DSA with Python. So this will be, uh,

01:51:54.180 --> 01:51:57.220
taken by Raman. Ramendra, I think I have already discussed

01:51:57.220 --> 01:51:59.840
about Ramendra, so he is the person who is a very very

01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:02.560
experienced person who is going to join Google this month

01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:06.480
itself in a month of September and yeah, so he is going to

01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:11.280
take this DSA with Python boot camp. Then there is a Bev

01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:14.520
development batch which is coming, so again this Bev

01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:17.700
development batch will be taken by Ajay Sharma, Ajay is

01:52:17.700 --> 01:52:20.100
again a very good mentor and this batch is going to be in

01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:25.500
Hindi by the way yeah, so and again even Ramendra was like

01:52:25.500 --> 01:52:28.280
you know telling me that we can try to bring some batches in

01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:32.160
Hindi, so very soon we can try to plan, so maybe I do not

01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:34.600
have a bandwidth, but if he will be having a bandwidth or

01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:37.000
anyone any other mentor will be having a bandwidth, so we

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.040
will try to bring a courses in Hindi as well as in English.

01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:43.960
One more I think batch we are going to release this month

01:52:43.960 --> 01:52:47.500
which will be AI ML masters, so where I am going to teach

01:52:47.500 --> 01:52:51.240
Python. I am going to teach Python. Stats I am going to

01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:54.360
teach machine learning from scratch means I am going to

01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:59.420
launch a batch AI ML masters for those people who are coming

01:52:59.420 --> 01:53:03.360
from a complete complete complete no coding, no programming

01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:08.520
background and they do not know about even a Python, so

01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:11.040
basically we will try to start from the Python, then we will

01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:13.720
try to discuss the complete statistics part, then machine

01:53:13.720 --> 01:53:16.760
learning part, then MLOps part inside that one and then a

01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:21.260
project part, so that is the again another batch I believe

01:53:21.260 --> 01:53:24.720
will make an announcement in some time, maybe in a couple of

01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:26.960
days, maybe by next week we are going to make an

01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:29.960
announcement about that batch and yeah like I said, so with

01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:33.500
Euron plus every all of these batches are available, young

01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:36.540
Euron is a different product, so this is for kids, this is

01:53:36.540 --> 01:53:39.760
how we have made the segregation, so Euron plus is basically

01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:44.280
for adult and young Euron is for our kids, so even on young

01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:46.900
Euron segments, so we will keep on bringing many many many

01:53:46.900 --> 01:53:51.040
many like live batches where we can do a hand holding and

01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:55.260
again for a young Euron, so we have even given you a

01:53:55.260 --> 01:53:59.020
WhatsApp group but for parents, I would love to connect with

01:53:59.020 --> 01:54:02.200
the parents, I would love to understand their pain points, I

01:54:02.200 --> 01:54:05.160
would love to understand the kind of a growth that they are

01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:08.720
looking into their children, their kids basically, so that I

01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:14.520
will be able to align my entire classes, any plan for big

01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:18.480
data, see everything is a matter of time, so it is like I

01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:23.080
have only 24 hour, out of that 24 hour, I have to even sleep

01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:26.580
for 6 to 8 hours and then for rest of the time I have to

01:54:26.580 --> 01:54:29.180
work on a multiple things including tech and many other

01:54:29.180 --> 01:54:32.720
things, we are still growing, so we have a limited team and

01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:36.220
we have a limited resources but yeah as soon as we will be

01:54:36.220 --> 01:54:38.860
having more, I will be having more bandwidth, I will take

01:54:38.860 --> 01:54:42.060
classes as simple as that because I love taking classes,

01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:54.440
okay so let us go and check guys whether this

01:55:01.820 --> 01:55:04.640
still it is showing, me time,

01:55:06.990 --> 01:55:08.930
okay so still

01:55:11.900 --> 01:55:16.280
it is taking time guys, can't do anything, so we have to

01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:18.080
wait, we don't have any other option,

01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:24.280
same message getting, yeah so it takes time, it takes time

01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:26.220
because they are giving you sandbox right, it's not a

01:55:26.220 --> 01:55:29.020
dedicated server that they are giving you, it's a shared

01:55:29.020 --> 01:55:32.360
instances that they are giving you and many people right,

01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:35.440
for example hundreds people from this class itself is trying

01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:39.400
to hit a sandbox and let's suppose they have a very very

01:55:39.400 --> 01:55:45.780
limited sandbox, obviously it will take time, I have a Euron

01:55:45.780 --> 01:55:48.860
plus, I can also access young Euron, no, why you want young

01:55:48.860 --> 01:55:52.440
Euron access in a Euron plus because Euron plus is for adult

01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:55.800
right, you are not going to take or attend the classes for a

01:55:55.800 --> 01:56:00.400
children, so we have not attached any young Euron inside the

01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:05.320
Euron plus, it's a complete separate product, yeah okay for

01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:08.800
your younger brother, yeah so if someone is like I said just

01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:13.280
negotiate hard with the team, simple and don't worry, just

01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:13.620
negotiate hard with the team, simple and don't worry, I am

01:56:13.620 --> 01:56:16.920
going to take the classes so I will make sure that anyone

01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:21.080
and everyone who is you know taking those classes they will

01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:25.320
learn something which they can use it immediately in like

01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:26.220
life.

01:56:31.270 --> 01:56:34.370
So can you come with the courses? See the courses wise I

01:56:34.370 --> 01:56:38.010
have so many courses in my mind, the only constraint that I

01:56:38.010 --> 01:56:42.870
am facing as of now is bandwidth, we are trying to onboard

01:56:42.870 --> 01:56:44.630
more and more mentors so

01:56:51.770 --> 01:56:58.030
I am going to, Pavan come to this one, come to this

01:56:58.030 --> 01:57:01.210
interview preparation batch. I think over there we will be

01:57:01.210 --> 01:57:03.670
having lot of discussions with respect to this query,

01:57:03.850 --> 01:57:07.290
especially this query. Young Euron could you please try

01:57:07.290 --> 01:57:11.450
different timings also could you take little, for young

01:57:11.450 --> 01:57:14.770
Euron it will be very very slow, the reason is very simple

01:57:14.770 --> 01:57:18.830
that it is for kids right. So here we have a different

01:57:18.830 --> 01:57:22.810
audience. And I used to adopt the way I used to give a

01:57:22.810 --> 01:57:26.330
classes or the way I should deliver things depends upon and

01:57:26.330 --> 01:57:29.310
that completely depends upon the audience. So if my audience

01:57:29.310 --> 01:57:32.050
are completely different, the way I am going to take the

01:57:32.050 --> 01:57:34.130
classes will be different. It's not going to be same.

01:57:39.870 --> 01:57:43.270
Yeah Armaan, so like send me your recording. So anyone who

01:57:43.270 --> 01:57:46.150
would like to join Euron as a mentor, maybe in a part time

01:57:46.150 --> 01:57:50.030
right. So maybe send me your recording on any topics, Hindi,

01:57:50.230 --> 01:57:53.650
English, anything is fine, that's okay with me. Once we'll

01:57:53.650 --> 01:57:57.210
see the recordings, we'll be able to give you the feedback

01:57:57.210 --> 01:58:01.430
or we'll be able to go ahead. Yeah. Send me the recordings

01:58:01.430 --> 01:58:06.430
first. Yeah. So anyone guys, it's an open offer for everyone

01:58:06.430 --> 01:58:10.310
for a part time mentoring, right. You can, you can maybe go

01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:12.970
ahead going forward, you can try to teach inside the young

01:58:12.970 --> 01:58:16.290
Euron, you can try to teach inside the Euron. The very

01:58:16.290 --> 01:58:19.630
minimum criteria is send me your recording with a good audio

01:58:19.630 --> 01:58:24.910
and a video quality. Okay. On any topic that you know,

01:58:24.950 --> 01:58:27.670
because we are going to observe, my team is going to observe

01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:32.450
the delivery mechanism, basically how engaging or how

01:58:32.450 --> 01:58:35.210
entertaining your entire lecture is.

01:58:41.220 --> 01:58:43.800
Apart from mentors, if anything else is there, see my

01:58:43.800 --> 01:58:52.560
operations are completely like a good tech is awesome. So we

01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:55.760
don't do marketing by the way. We just like rely upon the

01:58:55.760 --> 01:59:00.020
social media. Social media means that to organic, we just go

01:59:00.020 --> 01:59:02.220
ahead and make an announcement. So we don't do much of

01:59:02.220 --> 01:59:02.700
marketing.

01:59:05.260 --> 01:59:09.180
So yeah, as of now, no, as of now only in like a mentoring

01:59:09.180 --> 01:59:11.540
side, but yeah, maybe in future. So we'll be having an

01:59:11.540 --> 01:59:14.800
openings in a sales side as well as in a marketing side.

01:59:18.720 --> 01:59:23.060
Okay. So still I'm waiting guys and anyone who is able to

01:59:23.060 --> 01:59:25.540
see the cluster, anyone?

01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:39.480
No. Okay. So everyone is facing the same issue. Okay. It's

01:59:39.480 --> 01:59:44.780
because of actually us. So many people are trying to hit the

01:59:44.780 --> 01:59:51.700
same server and their server is not that big. If you will do

01:59:51.700 --> 01:59:54.220
it after a class, right? Maybe it will take just one, two

01:59:54.220 --> 01:59:54.460
minute

02:00:02.140 --> 02:00:08.410
DDoS attack. Something like this. We have done. We have

02:00:08.410 --> 02:00:10.830
already crashed their server. Yeah. Actually we'll see when

02:00:10.830 --> 02:00:13.170
a hundred people, 200 people will try to hit the same

02:00:13.170 --> 02:00:16.530
server, right? That to their sandbox. It's not meant for

02:00:16.530 --> 02:00:18.510
scaling, right? It's not meant for scaling. It's basically

02:00:18.510 --> 02:00:21.850
meant for a very, very limited use. And we all are trying to

02:00:21.850 --> 02:00:24.630
hit the same cluster and it's down.

02:00:31.890 --> 02:00:34.390
Just pause the course. Okay. Fine. Let's go ahead and

02:00:34.390 --> 02:00:36.750
discuss the code directly. I mean like code wise, nothing.

02:00:36.890 --> 02:00:39.650
Code wise, believe me, there is nothing. So once your server

02:00:39.650 --> 02:00:41.670
will be up and running, right, they will be able to give you

02:00:41.670 --> 02:00:44.010
the client client connection. So they will be able to give

02:00:44.010 --> 02:00:46.270
you the cluster ID and they will be able to give you the API

02:00:46.270 --> 02:00:49.930
key. Let me paste you that part. Yeah. So how this things is

02:00:49.930 --> 02:00:53.350
going to work. It's very simple. Uh, uh, I think the SIM

02:00:53.350 --> 02:00:54.670
similar kind of a thing. Yeah. So one of the things that we

02:00:54.670 --> 02:00:57.910
have done, uh, with the baby at and pinecone chroma DV, it's

02:00:57.910 --> 02:01:00.290
the same thing. See, so this is how this way it will look

02:01:00.290 --> 02:01:04.290
like. I already have a code from my previous lecture. Uh, so

02:01:04.290 --> 02:01:07.450
let me show you. So first of all, you have to import a baby

02:01:07.450 --> 02:01:10.710
yet, right? And once your cluster will be ready, uh, you

02:01:10.710 --> 02:01:14.390
will be able to see two things. One is a URL, right? So one

02:01:14.390 --> 02:01:17.890
is a URL and then second one is basically a API key. So this

02:01:17.890 --> 02:01:20.310
is going to create the client and this is the only thing

02:01:20.310 --> 02:01:22.810
which is required again. So you will go ahead with the

02:01:22.810 --> 02:01:26.210
insert operation and then you will go ahead. With the search

02:01:26.210 --> 02:01:29.630
operation, that's it. So this, once this client will be

02:01:29.630 --> 02:01:32.130
ready, which is not ready, which is taking time because of

02:01:32.130 --> 02:01:37.070
our DDoS attack that we have done, uh, then I'll just like

02:01:37.070 --> 02:01:39.270
go ahead and store the data. Simple.

02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:52.740
Yeah. So we are, we are just waiting for this client by the

02:01:52.740 --> 02:01:57.380
way, if client is not available. So we can't like, uh, um,

02:01:57.620 --> 02:02:03.000
push the data and I think it will not be up. So once we are

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:06.840
going to end this lecture. Then only this will be back

02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:12.520
because many people are trying to hit it. Ideally it never

02:02:12.520 --> 02:02:13.420
takes this much of time.

02:02:16.900 --> 02:02:21.400
Even in past we have crashed so many servers, uh, for

02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:22.380
different vendors.

02:02:27.010 --> 02:02:30.450
Okay. Fine guys. Uh, so we'll, we'll, uh, this is not a big

02:02:30.450 --> 02:02:32.530
deal. I believe I have already shown you. So you have to

02:02:32.530 --> 02:02:34.350
basically connect with the client. So this is the client

02:02:34.350 --> 02:02:37.170
code, which you will be able to get it, not from like

02:02:37.170 --> 02:02:40.070
anywhere else. There itself client code will be available,

02:02:40.230 --> 02:02:42.870
there itself API key will be available. So just you have to

02:02:42.870 --> 02:02:45.710
do a copy and paste, convert your data into the embeddings

02:02:45.710 --> 02:02:48.810
and then insert the data and then search the data. That's

02:02:48.810 --> 02:02:51.990
it. That's the only story that you have to build around it.

02:02:52.830 --> 02:02:57.650
Okay. So I think we should close

02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:02.280
a lecture for today.

02:03:05.380 --> 02:03:05.900
Yeah.

02:03:09.210 --> 02:03:13.010
Please show us your PC configuration, my PC configuration.

02:03:13.010 --> 02:03:17.550
So my PC configuration. My PC configuration is this. Where

02:03:17.550 --> 02:03:19.450
is my, can

02:03:36.670 --> 02:03:39.370
we do a vivid tomorrow? Yeah. So keep it up and running. So

02:03:39.370 --> 02:03:41.890
keep your vivid cluster up and running and then tomorrow,

02:03:42.010 --> 02:03:48.090
uh, we'll do it in five, 10 minutes. So this is my PC

02:03:48.090 --> 02:03:52.330
configuration by the way, 96 GB of a Ram, then 24 GB of a

02:03:52.330 --> 02:03:58.330
dedicated, uh, Nvidia, a GeForce 4090 graphics card, and

02:03:58.330 --> 02:04:03.210
then like a 6 TB of a hard disk. So yeah. Okay. And this is

02:04:03.210 --> 02:04:05.530
your Ram. So, so

02:04:13.500 --> 02:04:17.420
please try to create the sandbox guys. Yeah. Leave it as it

02:04:17.420 --> 02:04:21.020
is, or maybe, uh, terminate it and, uh, try to, you know,

02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:25.420
uh, connect some time, some like, uh, maybe, uh, during

02:04:25.420 --> 02:04:28.860
afternoon or maybe during the evening to try to connect and,

02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:31.240
uh, here, so they have already given you the connectivity

02:04:31.240 --> 02:04:34.800
URL and they have already given you basically a API key.

02:04:35.180 --> 02:04:38.500
Right. Not API key. API key. You will be able to create it.

02:04:39.740 --> 02:04:44.680
And then you will be able to connect. So tomorrow agenda is

02:04:44.680 --> 02:04:47.460
very simple. Tomorrow I'm going to talk about a project

02:04:47.460 --> 02:04:50.240
where I'm going to use our vector database, where I'm going

02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:54.100
to use a concept of RAG, where I'm going to use a URI

02:04:54.100 --> 02:04:59.320
embeddings, where I'm going to use a LLMs as well from a

02:04:59.320 --> 02:05:03.600
URI. So maybe I can try to use a LLM. So where I'm going to

02:05:03.600 --> 02:05:07.560
use a chat completion model, or even I can go ahead with the

02:05:07.560 --> 02:05:12.040
real time web search model. So I'm going to show you an

02:05:12.040 --> 02:05:16.140
application. Like I said in a beginning of your class. So

02:05:16.140 --> 02:05:19.420
here we are trying to learn a vector DB. Now many people

02:05:19.420 --> 02:05:22.400
must be curious about the use cases that where we are going

02:05:22.400 --> 02:05:25.520
to use a vector database. So we are going to use our vector

02:05:25.520 --> 02:05:29.480
database in, uh, tons of use cases. Uh, very first use

02:05:29.480 --> 02:05:32.480
cases, obviously, RAG based use cases. I'll show you the

02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:35.680
practical demo tomorrow itself via project. So we'll try to

02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:38.720
build end to end application. Uh, that you can try to use it

02:05:38.720 --> 02:05:41.980
even in real time, immediately, like immediately in your

02:05:41.980 --> 02:05:45.120
company, you can start using it wherever you have to do a

02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:47.980
product search. For example, Amazon search, Flipkart search,

02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:50.740
or maybe a Myntra search. So wherever you have to do a

02:05:50.740 --> 02:05:54.180
product search, so where user can type anything, but still

02:05:54.180 --> 02:05:57.160
they will be able to get the proper result. Even over there,

02:05:57.260 --> 02:06:00.720
again, a lot of tuning will be required in that case. Uh,

02:06:00.800 --> 02:06:04.180
then let's suppose if I'm doing a code search, right, let's

02:06:04.180 --> 02:06:05.740
suppose I have a code repository. Let's suppose I have a

02:06:05.740 --> 02:06:07.680
repository of a millions of line of lines up for the code,

02:06:07.820 --> 02:06:10.620
right? Because in every big company there will be a millions

02:06:10.620 --> 02:06:12.940
of line of code and let's suppose we are looking for

02:06:12.940 --> 02:06:15.600
something. So where it should be able to do a search

02:06:15.600 --> 02:06:18.500
immediately, right out of those millions of line of code.

02:06:18.780 --> 02:06:21.580
Uh, plus maybe it should be able to do the refinement. So I

02:06:21.580 --> 02:06:24.240
can try to use a RAG kind of application with respect to a

02:06:24.240 --> 02:06:27.660
code search deduping. So let's suppose if I have to remove

02:06:27.660 --> 02:06:31.260
the duplicates, not the exact word matching, but a semantic

02:06:31.260 --> 02:06:34.420
meaning matching duplication, if we have to remove, again,

02:06:34.500 --> 02:06:37.640
we can try to use a vector database for that one. Uh, let's

02:06:37.640 --> 02:06:39.940
suppose if I'm trying to build a modern recommendation

02:06:39.940 --> 02:06:42.640
system, we all are aware about the recommendation system,

02:06:42.720 --> 02:06:45.140
right? So let's suppose if you're going to Amazon flip card

02:06:45.140 --> 02:06:48.100
and maybe YouTube, uh, so it, it recommends you a lot of

02:06:48.100 --> 02:06:50.840
things, right? Maybe Instagram, it recommends you a lot of

02:06:50.840 --> 02:06:53.940
things. So everywhere, all the applications are using

02:06:53.940 --> 02:06:56.180
recommendation system by default. And let's suppose if I

02:06:56.180 --> 02:06:59.140
would like to build my own best of best recommended system,

02:06:59.420 --> 02:07:03.780
I can use our vector data base, right? Let's suppose if I

02:07:03.780 --> 02:07:05.920
have to perform the clustering group. Grouping of the

02:07:05.920 --> 02:07:08.740
grouping operation. So I have to separate the segregate the

02:07:08.740 --> 02:07:11.540
data, right? Based on maybe a cities based on maybe a

02:07:11.540 --> 02:07:15.360
countries or maybe based on some other parameter. Again, I

02:07:15.360 --> 02:07:18.100
can try to use vector databases. Yeah. Let's suppose if I

02:07:18.100 --> 02:07:20.840
have to do some sort of anomaly detection, right? Maybe a

02:07:20.840 --> 02:07:23.220
DDoS attack kind of things. Maybe if I'm trying to build

02:07:23.220 --> 02:07:25.560
something for a cyber security, something from a banking or

02:07:25.560 --> 02:07:29.140
finance application or anywhere where maybe a drug discovery

02:07:29.140 --> 02:07:31.580
or maybe a drug anomaly detection, if you're trying to do so

02:07:31.580 --> 02:07:35.480
even over there, I can try to use a vector data base. So

02:07:35.480 --> 02:07:39.260
it's not just one single application. Generally when I talk

02:07:39.260 --> 02:07:41.900
about a vector data base, people say that, okay, so we can

02:07:41.900 --> 02:07:45.900
use vector DB with the RAG application, but no, right, no,

02:07:46.020 --> 02:07:49.540
it's technically a data which is trying to store something

02:07:49.540 --> 02:07:52.360
in a numerical format and which is helping you out in terms

02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:55.980
of doing a better search, right? Better search based on the

02:07:55.980 --> 02:07:59.620
semantic. So my use cases can be infinite in that situation,

02:07:59.780 --> 02:08:02.740
right? It's not just a one single use cases that you all

02:08:02.740 --> 02:08:05.180
will be able to drive. And yes, we are using. We are using

02:08:05.180 --> 02:08:08.820
it into a different, different like a way, even inside the

02:08:08.820 --> 02:08:12.720
industry, which gradually we'll try to understand. Yeah. So

02:08:12.720 --> 02:08:15.820
tomorrow we are going to see a vanilla RAG, vanilla RAG

02:08:15.820 --> 02:08:20.480
means without any kind of a agentic power. And as we will

02:08:20.480 --> 02:08:23.320
progress inside the class or even you can go now and check

02:08:23.320 --> 02:08:26.680
your syllabus, we have a RAG tab. Yeah. So inside our

02:08:26.680 --> 02:08:28.860
syllabus we have a RAG tab. So at that point of time,

02:08:29.100 --> 02:08:33.440
obviously the concept is going to be same for RAG, but we'll

02:08:33.440 --> 02:08:37.140
try to add agent. Yeah. Over there. Then we'll come to that

02:08:37.140 --> 02:08:40.720
chapter. But tomorrow it's not going to be agentic. It's

02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:44.200
going to be vanilla. Yeah. And then from next week onwards,

02:08:44.460 --> 02:08:48.920
agentic because our agent chapter will start. So then we'll

02:08:48.920 --> 02:08:51.720
start building a lot of agents with Lang chain, Lama

02:08:51.720 --> 02:08:55.640
indexes, Lang graph from next, next week onwards, not, not

02:08:55.640 --> 02:09:01.400
tomorrow. So hope all of us are good. Now I'm done with

02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:04.920
today's class. Cluster is still not up. Okay. It is taking

02:09:04.920 --> 02:09:08.020
time. Thanks to our entire like audience, our students.

02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:15.760
So successfully we are able to do a DDoS attack on a Baviot.

02:09:17.540 --> 02:09:20.860
So those who is not having any doubt, they can drop off. I'm

02:09:20.860 --> 02:09:22.700
done with today's class. Those who are having a doubt,

02:09:22.820 --> 02:09:27.600
please be here and we can start discussing your doubts. We

02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:32.390
can start talking about your questions today while joining,

02:09:32.450 --> 02:09:34.890
I was not able to join asking a meeting ID. No, it will not

02:09:34.890 --> 02:09:37.870
ask for meeting ID. I don't think so. You are able to join,

02:09:37.910 --> 02:09:40.370
right Mukesh. So I don't think that it will, it should ask

02:09:40.370 --> 02:09:44.450
for the meeting ID. Also on Jenny LLM house with a real time

02:09:44.450 --> 02:09:47.110
production deployment here itself, I'll discuss, don't

02:09:47.110 --> 02:09:49.590
worry. Like I said, time is the only constraint. I love

02:09:49.590 --> 02:09:51.490
teaching. I love like, you know, interacting with the

02:09:51.490 --> 02:09:56.010
people, uh, for me, time is the only bottleneck. That's it.

02:09:58.400 --> 02:10:01.580
I have shared sample video on a WhatsApp to your number

02:10:01.580 --> 02:10:05.420
mentioning, sure, if you have shared, then obviously I'll

02:10:05.420 --> 02:10:08.480
look into it. And, uh, I'll get back to you. I reply to

02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:12.460
everyone on a WhatsApp by the way, uh, not a hundred

02:10:12.460 --> 02:10:15.660
percent, maybe 99%, but yeah, I do reply, uh,

02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:22.540
regarding, uh, obviously everything will be covered. That's

02:10:22.540 --> 02:10:23.740
the reason. So we have a class, right?

02:10:27.420 --> 02:10:30.000
Could you please discuss the practical problem? Not a very

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.300
basic text. Obviously that's the reason we have a project.

02:10:36.430 --> 02:10:39.730
Okay. So shall we take a break guys for maybe four or five

02:10:39.730 --> 02:10:42.610
minutes and then started out clearing. Yeah.

02:10:47.810 --> 02:10:50.870
RAG is vector DB. No. RAG is different. RAG is different.

02:10:51.810 --> 02:10:56.210
We'll understand tomorrow. Why don't you clone yourself?

02:10:56.430 --> 02:10:59.110
See, uh, many people are talking about AI and everything,

02:10:59.250 --> 02:11:02.770
right? I think no one will be able to replace teachers even

02:11:02.770 --> 02:11:05.670
after a hundred years, because I don't know. I don't think

02:11:05.670 --> 02:11:08.910
that my kids or maybe your kids, uh, our future generation

02:11:08.910 --> 02:11:14.450
would love to learn from a robots, although they will be

02:11:14.450 --> 02:11:16.650
having a better knowledge, right? Even chat GPT. If I'll

02:11:16.650 --> 02:11:19.050
talk about chat GPT, it's having a world's knowledge, none,

02:11:19.130 --> 02:11:22.050
none of the human, none of us can beat chat GPT in terms of

02:11:22.050 --> 02:11:24.530
our knowledge. But still, when it comes to our discussion,

02:11:24.730 --> 02:11:27.310
when it's come to a, you know, empathy, when it comes to,

02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:30.570
uh, discussing something in practice, uh, with something, I

02:11:30.570 --> 02:11:39.190
think AI is going to be very, very boring. So, uh, it might

02:11:39.190 --> 02:11:41.390
not be interactive, even if it is going to be interactive

02:11:41.390 --> 02:11:45.850
the time I would, I will get to know that, uh, it's a robot.

02:11:46.150 --> 02:11:49.990
I lose the interest. Yeah. Yeah. It's not going to be

02:11:49.990 --> 02:11:53.770
interactive, but still, okay, fine guys, let's take a break

02:11:53.770 --> 02:11:57.710
for four or five minutes. So it's a 11 or 11 as of now in my

02:11:57.710 --> 02:12:03.850
clock. So we will start a doubt clearing by 11 or 15, four

02:12:03.850 --> 02:12:06.810
minute of break. Yeah. Are you on? So four minute of break

02:12:06.810 --> 02:12:10.030
will take a search to do a tour car, do you have a good

02:12:10.030 --> 02:12:14.270
video and I think take a four minute break guys. And then 11

02:12:14.270 --> 02:12:17.090
or 15, we are going to resume and be ready with your screen

02:12:17.090 --> 02:12:18.430
sharing. Be ready with your doubts.

02:15:00.450 --> 02:15:03.590
Okay. Yeah. So we are back guys. Uh, and, uh, just raise

02:15:03.590 --> 02:15:06.310
your hand and those who would like to share their screen. So

02:15:06.310 --> 02:15:08.770
please ping me in a chat so that I can add you as a

02:15:08.770 --> 02:15:15.800
panelist. So one by one, then Ranjit, then Arun, then Amit,

02:15:15.800 --> 02:15:20.860
then Ramesh, then Anoop, then Bishrot and then Vijay. Yeah.

02:15:22.600 --> 02:15:27.160
Yeah. Go ahead. Uh, yeah. Go ahead, please. Hello. Yes. Yes.

02:15:27.200 --> 02:15:29.900
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So

02:15:29.900 --> 02:15:33.640
basically today's session is really useful, sir, because of

02:15:33.640 --> 02:15:36.540
the first time to learn on this. Uh, so I have some question

02:15:36.540 --> 02:15:39.960
on the, from the today session, especially you have

02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:43.360
explained this parse and dense. so on what scenario do we

02:15:43.360 --> 02:15:45.720
need to go with it i understood sparse we have the n number

02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:50.580
of many zeros but what is the drawback in the sparse and on

02:15:50.580 --> 02:15:54.500
you you mentioned the dense is the better performance so how

02:15:54.500 --> 02:15:56.600
can we understand that can you please little bit elaborate

02:15:56.600 --> 02:16:00.040
on those yeah see so basic understanding is clear right what

02:16:00.040 --> 02:16:02.940
is the difference between parts and sparse matrices and

02:16:02.940 --> 02:16:06.480
dense matrices right yes yeah sparse we have the more number

02:16:06.480 --> 02:16:09.240
of zeros yes more number of zeros for example we are trying

02:16:09.240 --> 02:16:11.720
to do one hot encoding so i believe you understand one hot

02:16:11.720 --> 02:16:16.300
encoding yeah yes yeah yeah i understood that so whenever we

02:16:16.300 --> 02:16:19.280
have to do a keyword search just one single keyword we are

02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:21.800
looking for so in that case we can try to go ahead with the

02:16:21.800 --> 02:16:24.640
sparse vector so one single keyword whenever we are trying

02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:27.220
to match because the sparse will be good with that because

02:16:27.220 --> 02:16:29.960
there will be zero zero zero zero zero and then one so

02:16:29.960 --> 02:16:32.920
wherever it will be able to find out that one means that a

02:16:32.920 --> 02:16:35.900
specific keyword only one keyword which is going to match

02:16:35.900 --> 02:16:39.520
exactly right exactly the same in a lower case or maybe in a

02:16:39.520 --> 02:16:41.240
upper case in that case we can try to go ahead and match

02:16:41.240 --> 02:16:41.440
exactly the same in a lower case we can try to go ahead with

02:16:41.440 --> 02:16:44.980
a sparse but wherever we are look we are looking for a

02:16:44.980 --> 02:16:47.960
semantic search semantic search means let's suppose i am

02:16:47.960 --> 02:16:51.180
trying to write who is dhanshu kumar right but inside my db

02:16:51.180 --> 02:16:55.280
uh my data set is not exactly like who is dhanshu kumar so

02:16:55.280 --> 02:16:57.900
something like us dhanshu kumar is an entrepreneur something

02:16:57.900 --> 02:17:01.400
like this so wherever we have to match a semantic meaning in

02:17:01.400 --> 02:17:04.220
that case we should go ahead with the dense vector got it

02:17:04.220 --> 02:17:08.900
okay in a single in a single keyword search we'll go ahead

02:17:08.900 --> 02:17:11.940
with the sparse wherever we are looking for a semantic

02:17:11.940 --> 02:17:14.780
understanding of the data or semantic matching of the data

02:17:14.780 --> 02:17:18.480
so in that case we'll go with the dense vector simple yeah

02:17:18.480 --> 02:17:22.620
yeah so so my next question is that uh i think gromo db

02:17:22.620 --> 02:17:26.000
right when we uh when we look at the gromo db exercise have

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:30.600
we graded the ure embedding ure we have taken examples uh so

02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:34.280
the dimension value is one five three six right but when we

02:17:34.280 --> 02:17:37.660
insert the data into gromo db right and the web the cloud

02:17:37.660 --> 02:17:41.220
gromo db uh i think would it be uh referring to dhanshu

02:17:41.220 --> 02:17:44.060
kumar or dhanshu kumar or dhanshu kumar no it will be it

02:17:44.060 --> 02:17:46.420
will be referring to the exact same dimension in a chroma db

02:17:46.420 --> 02:17:49.040
so they have not given you an option in in general so

02:17:49.040 --> 02:17:52.080
whenever we try to insert the data so there is no limitation

02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:54.880
on the embedding dimension that chroma db is trying to put

02:17:54.880 --> 02:17:58.300
up but if we'll talk about a pine cone it will try to talk

02:17:58.300 --> 02:18:01.340
about the quadrant it will try to talk about maybe a variant

02:18:01.340 --> 02:18:03.920
so in that case they have given you that dimension size as

02:18:03.920 --> 02:18:07.760
well as a parameter yeah right actually in the text variable

02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:12.540
we have the 10 lines right so we will try to i try to run

02:18:12.540 --> 02:18:16.140
the two times or three times the um to click the same

02:18:16.140 --> 02:18:19.700
operation collection dot add operation but why is not why

02:18:19.700 --> 02:18:22.960
did it make some incremental append but i am not able to see

02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:26.180
the any duplicates because because by default by default it

02:18:26.180 --> 02:18:30.280
is trying to do a d duplication by default oh default okay

02:18:30.280 --> 02:18:34.100
but all the databases vector db is only for chroma db not

02:18:34.100 --> 02:18:39.240
all i would say in general majority of database supports are

02:18:39.240 --> 02:18:41.200
d duplications means by default it will be d duplication by

02:18:41.200 --> 02:18:41.240
default by default it will be d duplication by default it

02:18:41.240 --> 02:18:43.920
will be able to remove but yes there is a parameter which we

02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:48.520
can set so where we can try to label a data and in that way

02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:52.440
you will be able to even insert a duplicate values okay so

02:18:52.440 --> 02:18:55.360
automatically handle that okay yes yeah sir and one more

02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:58.420
thing uh when we pitch the query right the collection dot

02:18:58.420 --> 02:19:01.860
the collection dot some method can you show me that your

02:19:01.860 --> 02:19:05.220
notebook chrome would be notebook sir yeah sure let me share

02:19:05.220 --> 02:19:09.840
once again i believe my screen is visible so here is my

02:19:09.840 --> 02:19:12.700
chroma db yeah tell me yeah yeah yeah scroll up the result

02:19:12.700 --> 02:19:19.060
scroll up little bit below blow below yeah below blow yeah

02:19:19.060 --> 02:19:25.570
wait wait here here uh i think yeah here is we are passing

02:19:25.570 --> 02:19:28.550
embedding right why why is coming embed equals to none the

02:19:28.550 --> 02:19:31.310
second way by default this get function that has been

02:19:31.310 --> 02:19:33.490
written right so it is not returning the embedding by

02:19:33.490 --> 02:19:35.770
default it is not debugging the embeddings but it does not

02:19:35.770 --> 02:19:38.050
mean that embedding is not stored embedding is already

02:19:38.050 --> 02:19:42.250
stored uh just as a return of this get function that has has

02:19:42.250 --> 02:19:45.870
been written by this chroma db people it is not returning it

02:19:45.870 --> 02:19:52.470
by the way. Ok and one more question when we insert this

02:19:52.470 --> 02:19:57.310
kind of the records into vector db so can we define the

02:19:57.310 --> 02:20:03.610
schema for each and every things. Define the schema no as we

02:20:03.610 --> 02:20:06.830
are trying to store it as a document so here we don't define

02:20:06.830 --> 02:20:11.110
the schema by the way. Ok we cannot what is a default schema

02:20:11.110 --> 02:20:14.630
is a documents only right. Yeah it's a document documents no

02:20:14.630 --> 02:20:17.490
schema see schema comes into a picture wherever we have a

02:20:17.490 --> 02:20:21.210
column names right this is something that we try to refer as

02:20:21.210 --> 02:20:24.950
a schema by the way in terms of a mysql databases in case of

02:20:24.950 --> 02:20:29.250
a vector database or in case of even a mongodb in case of

02:20:29.250 --> 02:20:33.390
even a cassandra so we don't try to create a schema it's a

02:20:33.390 --> 02:20:36.710
document based databases. So this is the document. This one

02:20:36.710 --> 02:20:40.110
line is called as. Document right. So this is something that

02:20:40.110 --> 02:20:44.870
we are trying to store yeah. Yeah so my next question is

02:20:44.870 --> 02:20:49.070
that you have told that semantic and syntactic so syntactic

02:20:49.070 --> 02:20:52.990
is kind of that do we create some test data or what about

02:20:52.990 --> 02:20:55.910
that what is the difference between semantic and syntactic.

02:20:56.130 --> 02:20:59.470
Semantic means basically a meaning so wherever meanings are

02:20:59.470 --> 02:21:02.330
relevant so at that point of a time we try to call that data

02:21:02.330 --> 02:21:05.630
set is a semantic data set syntactic means so we are just a

02:21:05.630 --> 02:21:10.990
keyword matching. It's called as syntactic. Syntax okay it's

02:21:10.990 --> 02:21:14.130
kind of the one card encoding you told right yeah yeah yeah.

02:21:14.950 --> 02:21:18.670
So one more final question from my project level so

02:21:18.670 --> 02:21:22.390
basically in my project is like that there is a cube from

02:21:22.390 --> 02:21:27.470
ssas okay synapse analysis server something right we created

02:21:27.470 --> 02:21:31.930
one cube to derive the multi-dimensional data okay so we

02:21:31.930 --> 02:21:37.250
have to convert into our etl system. Etl system means we can

02:21:37.250 --> 02:21:39.110
convert into a database. We can convert into our Python code

02:21:39.110 --> 02:21:43.250
PySpark or something so what is the requirement means we

02:21:43.250 --> 02:21:46.990
need to convert from cube to semantic model so semantic

02:21:46.990 --> 02:21:50.550
model is nothing but right it's kind of a star schema one

02:21:50.550 --> 02:21:53.950
pack table or multiple dimension like this so is there any

02:21:53.950 --> 02:21:57.270
challenges if you are going to convert from cube to semantic

02:21:57.270 --> 02:22:03.290
model and do deal this projects. No. So generally I'm

02:22:03.290 --> 02:22:08.350
asking. No. No right. Can we convert it. Is it tricky to

02:22:08.350 --> 02:22:12.190
convert or any not at all you can you can try to flatten the

02:22:12.190 --> 02:22:14.430
data set so there is something called as unravelling so we

02:22:14.430 --> 02:22:16.930
can try to call the unravelling means if you have a multi

02:22:16.930 --> 02:22:19.290
-dimension it will try to convert those entire data set into

02:22:19.290 --> 02:22:21.930
a single dimension for example images right technically

02:22:21.930 --> 02:22:25.190
images are going to be a multi-dimension right so we can try

02:22:25.190 --> 02:22:27.570
to unravel those data sets so in that way it will try to

02:22:27.570 --> 02:22:30.010
create the flattened data set and then if we have a

02:22:30.010 --> 02:22:32.670
flattened data set we can try to convert those data set into

02:22:32.670 --> 02:22:37.530
like embeddings or we can do any process that we want. Okay.

02:22:37.590 --> 02:22:41.230
Okay. Any other challenges other than parsing parsing or

02:22:41.230 --> 02:22:44.430
flattening or something. No not at all not at all not at all

02:22:44.430 --> 02:22:46.650
once we have flattened the data set so my data set will look

02:22:46.650 --> 02:22:51.150
like just like this one just like this and then we can

02:22:51.150 --> 02:22:56.350
process it yeah yeah okay okay yeah okay sir that's it my

02:22:56.350 --> 02:23:00.070
question thank you yeah thank you thank you yeah next one

02:23:00.070 --> 02:23:04.410
Arun please go ahead Aruna sorry Aruna please go ahead yes

02:23:04.410 --> 02:23:08.190
sir can you hear me now yeah I can hear you yes. Sir I want

02:23:08.190 --> 02:23:12.930
to share my screen actually okay sure so I'm promoting you

02:23:12.930 --> 02:23:15.150
as a panelist you will be joining as a panelist Ranjit

02:23:15.150 --> 02:23:18.810
please go ahead with the question yes I also want to share

02:23:18.810 --> 02:23:21.750
my machine with you and because I told you I am going to

02:23:21.750 --> 02:23:25.310
demo you okay sir yeah yeah it's you okay so by the way guys

02:23:25.310 --> 02:23:28.890
Ranjit sir we have and don't who are not aware of Ranjit sir

02:23:28.890 --> 02:23:32.150
so he's a 70 year old still learning AI and trying to do a

02:23:32.150 --> 02:23:35.930
lot of experimentation I have even pinged you on a whatsapp

02:23:35.930 --> 02:23:38.190
sir so maybe you are not able to see it. Okay. So please

02:23:38.190 --> 02:23:40.690
like my message yeah please join as a panelist in between

02:23:40.690 --> 02:23:44.830
Angad please go to the question sir can I share my screen

02:23:44.830 --> 02:23:48.970
now sure just just a minute so let me clear the queue

02:23:48.970 --> 02:23:52.390
basically let me take all the questions Angad what is your

02:23:52.390 --> 02:23:56.230
question yes sir I want to share my screen okay Angad would

02:23:56.230 --> 02:23:58.590
like to share the screen promoting you as a panelist okay

02:23:58.590 --> 02:24:02.350
Abhijeet yeah Abhijeet yeah I have small questions Sudhanshu

02:24:02.350 --> 02:24:07.650
yeah for generate completion right we are selecting the

02:24:07.650 --> 02:24:09.070
questions. Okay. So we are selecting the temperature like

02:24:09.070 --> 02:24:12.630
and then for chunking we are selecting the chunking length

02:24:12.630 --> 02:24:18.390
right so so these kind of things do do we have anything like

02:24:18.390 --> 02:24:22.470
in machine learning right we do the clustering while we do

02:24:22.470 --> 02:24:26.270
so we can see what will be the optimal cluster right and

02:24:26.270 --> 02:24:30.830
while we do like ROC card we can see what is the my best

02:24:30.830 --> 02:24:34.690
thing I am going to insert so that kind of mechanism we do

02:24:34.690 --> 02:24:38.090
we have here in gen AI that we can. Okay. So basically you

02:24:38.090 --> 02:24:40.030
are talking about hyper parameter tuning yeah hyper

02:24:40.030 --> 02:24:43.830
parameter tuning yes in general no it's going to be

02:24:43.830 --> 02:24:47.190
experimental by the way and there are some predefined values

02:24:47.190 --> 02:24:50.390
in terms of a temperature in terms of a chunking size I

02:24:50.390 --> 02:24:53.730
think you are talking about that right yes the chuck size

02:24:53.730 --> 02:24:56.310
that we try to decide so in general it's going to be

02:24:56.310 --> 02:25:00.910
experimental and in general there is a size which has been

02:25:00.910 --> 02:25:04.090
defined so we try to always take it in between that range

02:25:04.090 --> 02:25:06.530
for example if I am looking for a very very accurate result

02:25:06.530 --> 02:25:09.830
in that case my temperature should be close to zero but will

02:25:09.830 --> 02:25:14.930
not try to keep it close to a zero because maybe like it

02:25:14.930 --> 02:25:17.570
will not be able to give me the result so we try to keep it

02:25:17.570 --> 02:25:21.890
maybe 0.3 0.4 0.5 or even 0.7 till 0.7 is completely fine

02:25:21.890 --> 02:25:24.730
and it will not hallucinate much yeah there is a chance that

02:25:24.730 --> 02:25:27.010
it is going to hallucinate even in terms of a chucking so we

02:25:27.010 --> 02:25:30.370
try to create a chuck size of maybe 300 watts 400 watts on

02:25:30.370 --> 02:25:33.450
an average which is a good one right maybe sometime even 800

02:25:33.450 --> 02:25:36.770
which is a good one so this is just an assumption that we

02:25:36.770 --> 02:25:39.850
try to take and so hit and trial we try to like a do

02:25:39.850 --> 02:25:42.190
experimentation with respect to our use cases that we are

02:25:42.190 --> 02:25:45.730
trying to build got it but there is something not something

02:25:45.730 --> 02:25:48.750
called as hyper parameter like a muscle learning or deep

02:25:48.750 --> 02:25:53.810
learning right so yeah okay fine got it thank you okay

02:25:53.810 --> 02:25:58.290
thanks but I didn't get an option of sharing like Angad you

02:25:58.290 --> 02:26:00.330
will be joining as a panelist first of all join as a

02:26:00.330 --> 02:26:05.990
panelist yeah yeah okay Ajit your question please so hi

02:26:05.990 --> 02:26:09.150
Siddhant good morning my question is regarding the adding

02:26:09.150 --> 02:26:13.190
the document in the vector db okay suppose I am working in a

02:26:13.190 --> 02:26:17.010
real-time project and my some of the policies got updated in

02:26:17.010 --> 02:26:20.710
the document do I need to load the whole document again or I

02:26:20.710 --> 02:26:25.050
need I can upload load the even the selected chunk of that

02:26:25.050 --> 02:26:28.510
document you can even update the chunk of the document you

02:26:28.510 --> 02:26:32.790
don't have to update the whole document at all that option

02:26:32.790 --> 02:26:35.370
is already available setting or a conclusion where we can

02:26:35.370 --> 02:26:37.170
allow the document because some of the documents are already

02:26:37.170 --> 02:26:41.750
updated so I don't need to do that okay so

02:26:41.750 --> 02:26:44.490
let me let me show you the update operation in my tomorrow's

02:26:44.490 --> 02:26:47.030
class yeah I'll show you the code wise with one of the

02:26:47.030 --> 02:26:50.870
vector database yeah but yes update option is available and

02:26:50.870 --> 02:26:53.170
in case of update observation you don't have to go ahead

02:26:53.170 --> 02:26:55.630
with the whole document update you can try to go ahead with

02:26:55.630 --> 02:26:58.410
the only chunk or only one documentation update that is

02:26:58.410 --> 02:27:01.750
going to work for you okay because we have a deed

02:27:01.750 --> 02:27:04.550
application option right so if the document is like let's

02:27:04.550 --> 02:27:07.310
suppose closer to ninety percent so in that case it will try

02:27:07.310 --> 02:27:09.490
to remove the previous one it will try to update the new one

02:27:09.490 --> 02:27:13.390
if document overlap or maybe in terms of semantic meaning

02:27:13.390 --> 02:27:16.370
meaning is matching me by fifty percent and you have written

02:27:16.370 --> 02:27:20.370
the rule that no so in case of fifty percent of match don't

02:27:20.370 --> 02:27:22.830
delete the previous one create the new one so it will try to

02:27:22.830 --> 02:27:25.150
create the new one it will try to insert the new update if

02:27:25.150 --> 02:27:27.090
you have written the rule over there that okay fine so if it

02:27:27.090 --> 02:27:30.670
is matching fifty percent update it don't keep the previous

02:27:30.670 --> 02:27:33.070
one so in that case it will try to update it so all this

02:27:33.070 --> 02:27:36.630
control we already have and are we also going to cover this

02:27:36.630 --> 02:27:38.730
thing how was it. so if I am searching on my enterprise

02:27:38.730 --> 02:27:43.190
query system whatever the query are there are we going to

02:27:43.190 --> 02:27:47.330
save those queries in any of the pipeline so are we going to

02:27:47.330 --> 02:27:50.810
save those queries you are saying yes so how was for example

02:27:50.810 --> 02:27:55.530
I want to optimize my things so I just my application is

02:27:55.530 --> 02:27:58.970
developed whole and I am doing query okay and some of the

02:27:58.970 --> 02:28:02.390
query I got as a new and user want to store how many queries

02:28:02.390 --> 02:28:04.950
we are getting as a day so we are storing we want to store

02:28:04.950 --> 02:28:09.450
those query as a document. so you can do that you can you

02:28:09.450 --> 02:28:12.030
can you can store the query but just for storing a query

02:28:12.030 --> 02:28:15.170
there is no specific provision which has been made so you

02:28:15.170 --> 02:28:17.850
can try to treat your query if you would like to store your

02:28:17.850 --> 02:28:21.570
query into the same database then you have to insert as a

02:28:21.570 --> 02:28:25.030
new record maybe you can try to store those query as a log

02:28:25.030 --> 02:28:28.330
information so in that case you can try to spin the another

02:28:28.330 --> 02:28:30.870
cluster or other instances and then there you can try to

02:28:30.870 --> 02:28:33.890
store it so in either way but yeah by default it's not going

02:28:33.890 --> 02:28:35.970
to store the query at all okay

02:28:38.240 --> 02:28:43.060
okay got it making sense right no I am asking is there any

02:28:43.060 --> 02:28:47.840
way we can directly store this query anywhere on noqtb or

02:28:47.840 --> 02:28:51.040
any setting not yeah so obviously you can try to store the

02:28:51.040 --> 02:28:53.160
query this is what I said so if you would like to store a

02:28:53.160 --> 02:28:57.080
query like permanently somewhere so you can try to call any

02:28:57.080 --> 02:28:59.820
of the databases maybe you can try to call a vector db

02:28:59.820 --> 02:29:02.120
itself but I don't think that it is going to give you any

02:29:02.120 --> 02:29:05.060
kind of a uses so in general what we try to do so we try to

02:29:05.060 --> 02:29:08.200
create a log log means so whatever operation that we are

02:29:08.200 --> 02:29:11.020
doing or whatever result this particular query is going to

02:29:11.020 --> 02:29:13.380
give so everything I will end up storing so in that case

02:29:13.380 --> 02:29:16.880
maybe I can try to use a noqtb for storing a query in that

02:29:16.880 --> 02:29:19.540
case maybe I can try to use some sort of a sql query sql db

02:29:19.540 --> 02:29:22.960
to store this query so my sql or maybe msql I can try to use

02:29:22.960 --> 02:29:26.380
or db2 I can try to use and I can store this query the way

02:29:26.380 --> 02:29:29.820
we try to store any other data set in a similar manner okay

02:29:29.820 --> 02:29:33.820
yeah that is possible right but not directly not directly

02:29:33.820 --> 02:29:37.200
you have to configure a sql db and then inside a sql db you

02:29:37.200 --> 02:29:40.420
have to insert. This particular record or maybe you have to

02:29:40.420 --> 02:29:42.980
configure a mongodb mongodb atlas you can try to configure

02:29:42.980 --> 02:29:45.800
and then inside that just try to store this particular query

02:29:45.800 --> 02:29:49.260
that okay fine so in this way you generally we try to call

02:29:49.260 --> 02:29:53.220
that as a log information so in a typical manner our

02:29:53.220 --> 02:29:56.140
business want to see whether we are somebody utilizing that

02:29:56.140 --> 02:29:59.480
bot or not yeah so basically if someone would like to

02:29:59.480 --> 02:30:02.100
investigate in a later stage that what query has been fired

02:30:02.100 --> 02:30:05.500
or maybe what kind of a search user is trying to do so for

02:30:05.500 --> 02:30:08.960
those kind of investigation we do. We try to log each and

02:30:08.960 --> 02:30:12.080
everything so even a query and even the output of the query

02:30:12.080 --> 02:30:14.100
because I have to check the reliability of my system right

02:30:14.100 --> 02:30:16.920
and let's suppose my system has been used by thousands of

02:30:16.920 --> 02:30:19.960
people on a daily basis and I would like to know that what

02:30:19.960 --> 02:30:22.140
kind of a query you are asking what kind of a query someone

02:30:22.140 --> 02:30:26.020
else is asking so in that case yes we try to log each and

02:30:26.020 --> 02:30:33.480
everything okay okay in any of the databases so yeah okay so

02:30:33.480 --> 02:30:38.560
next question is sahil just just just wait just wait. We'll

02:30:38.560 --> 02:30:42.760
start solving your doubt your like a problems so in between

02:30:42.760 --> 02:30:45.660
sahil please go ahead yeah hi sir thanks for the session

02:30:45.660 --> 02:30:50.080
yeah I have a question related to that in chroma db it was

02:30:50.080 --> 02:30:54.940
providing us that some default embedding models I believe

02:30:54.940 --> 02:30:58.800
which we have not used it and we have used that euro api

02:30:58.800 --> 02:31:03.120
model embedding models so shell can we utilize those models

02:31:03.120 --> 02:31:06.980
also or we have to yes yes that's the reason so they have

02:31:06.980 --> 02:31:09.920
given you the model so let's suppose while creating a chroma

02:31:09.920 --> 02:31:13.240
db instances if I have selected all let's suppose I'll go

02:31:13.240 --> 02:31:17.360
ahead with maybe a pine cone right pine cone we have over

02:31:17.360 --> 02:31:21.480
here get started and let's suppose database wise creator

02:31:21.480 --> 02:31:24.120
indexes let's suppose I have given this index any different

02:31:24.120 --> 02:31:27.120
any name and let's suppose if I have selected this one right

02:31:27.120 --> 02:31:30.280
this multilingual e5 large this one is the model which I

02:31:30.280 --> 02:31:33.980
have selected now so I don't have to insert so let's suppose

02:31:33.980 --> 02:31:36.260
if I have selected this model so at that point of a time I

02:31:36.260 --> 02:31:39.740
don't have to go ahead and insert embeddings so what I'm

02:31:39.740 --> 02:31:42.760
supposed to insert in that situation only this much so this

02:31:42.760 --> 02:31:46.180
is pine cone right so in case of pine cone when we were

02:31:46.180 --> 02:31:50.000
doing a insert operation here yeah

02:31:52.690 --> 02:31:55.570
so when we are doing this absurd operation so in case of

02:31:55.570 --> 02:31:58.810
absurd operation we'll skip this part because this embedding

02:31:58.810 --> 02:32:02.510
is being created by uri api right so we'll try to skip this

02:32:02.510 --> 02:32:05.330
particular part we'll try to insert just a id and we'll try

02:32:05.330 --> 02:32:08.790
to insert just a text information and automatically when it

02:32:08.790 --> 02:32:10.870
will be inserted inside the pine cone it will be using the

02:32:10.890 --> 02:32:14.610
this model also it will be used by internally by pine cone

02:32:14.610 --> 02:32:17.830
not us we have to put the code because if you go to if you

02:32:17.830 --> 02:32:22.770
go back go back to main main place it is providing some url

02:32:22.770 --> 02:32:26.530
I believe somewhere okay where I've seen that url url for

02:32:26.530 --> 02:32:31.310
what url it has given that when you created that database I

02:32:31.310 --> 02:32:34.790
believe okay so it has given some url I thought that that

02:32:34.790 --> 02:32:39.470
url will be you we have to give and we have to give that api

02:32:39.470 --> 02:32:42.530
key to convert that's a you if you go back to your database

02:32:42.530 --> 02:32:45.570
or like a database this is this you are talking about yes

02:32:45.570 --> 02:32:47.930
yes yes I'm talking about that sir yeah no no it's fine it's

02:32:47.930 --> 02:32:50.610
fine so it's it's not required because whenever you are

02:32:50.610 --> 02:32:53.530
going to call this connect operation right so by default

02:32:53.530 --> 02:32:57.590
pine cone has provided you the sdks correct even if you will

02:32:57.590 --> 02:33:00.390
go and check see they have this is basically called as sdk

02:33:00.390 --> 02:33:02.370
sdk means software development kit they have provided you

02:33:02.370 --> 02:33:05.110
for example even in case of a uri let me show you that part

02:33:05.110 --> 02:33:09.410
meaning of this and differences so see we have a uri api and

02:33:09.410 --> 02:33:12.970
here so whenever we are trying to like hit this uh embedding

02:33:12.970 --> 02:33:17.850
model so there is a url right now so we have also released

02:33:17.850 --> 02:33:20.810
the sdks we have also released the sdks are you able to see

02:33:20.810 --> 02:33:24.390
any urls over here correct I can see that sir no you are not

02:33:24.390 --> 02:33:27.190
able to see anyone no no no you are like consider but api

02:33:27.190 --> 02:33:30.530
key we have to pass right exactly exactly so whenever we

02:33:30.530 --> 02:33:33.370
have created the sdk right we have already configured that

02:33:33.370 --> 02:33:37.250
url for you so similarly similarly so in case of pine cone

02:33:37.250 --> 02:33:40.610
if you are using the sdk if you are using this one you are

02:33:40.610 --> 02:33:42.230
using this one right so they have already configured so

02:33:42.230 --> 02:33:44.810
whenever you are calling this api key right by default it

02:33:44.810 --> 02:33:47.110
will be able to understand that okay fine so what is the url

02:33:47.110 --> 02:33:50.930
so internally it has been mapped never complete you go after

02:33:50.930 --> 02:33:54.330
that making sense yeah yes it is making so I believe you are

02:33:54.330 --> 02:33:57.750
saying that to me that whatever the embedding we are doing

02:33:57.750 --> 02:34:01.170
that we can skip that part and directly we can use it so

02:34:01.170 --> 02:34:04.470
internally whenever we push the data into that pine cone

02:34:05.010 --> 02:34:07.850
pine cone will automatically internally it will do the

02:34:07.850 --> 02:34:10.150
embedding right so exactly it is going to use this

02:34:10.150 --> 02:34:10.610
particular model exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly

02:34:10.610 --> 02:34:12.190
exactly exactly exactly and you don't need don't have to

02:34:12.190 --> 02:34:15.350
provide the url or anything just a pine cone api call about

02:34:15.350 --> 02:34:17.570
your point sir okay thank you so much sir yeah thanks thanks

02:34:17.570 --> 02:34:20.830
okay so Avinash please go ahead with the question yeah

02:34:23.010 --> 02:34:28.530
Avinash Anup if you have any question yeah

02:34:31.470 --> 02:34:32.370
Anup Mohit

02:34:36.600 --> 02:34:41.480
yeah Mohit please go ahead so my question is it's like if I

02:34:41.480 --> 02:34:47.800
have to create embedding for a whole book so what's the

02:34:47.800 --> 02:34:50.060
what's the logic I have to follow because I have to do

02:34:50.060 --> 02:34:52.520
because a single embedding can't work for a whole book so

02:34:52.520 --> 02:34:55.740
how I have to we are we are not going to create a single

02:34:55.740 --> 02:34:58.580
embedding so in my previous class I believe I have shown you

02:34:58.580 --> 02:35:01.680
a checking operation I think someone some of us was even

02:35:01.680 --> 02:35:03.960
talking about the checking operation so we try to break it

02:35:03.960 --> 02:35:06.800
down into a small small small small chunks and then we try

02:35:06.800 --> 02:35:08.860
to store it and this is something which I am going to show

02:35:08.860 --> 02:35:11.260
you tomorrow because tomorrow the data set which I will be

02:35:11.260 --> 02:35:14.580
using is basically a transcript let me show you that someone

02:35:14.580 --> 02:35:18.620
has already shared a drive link right so this is the kind of

02:35:18.620 --> 02:35:21.460
a data set so for example this is the recording right now

02:35:21.460 --> 02:35:25.380
let me show you the massiveness of this data and obviously

02:35:25.380 --> 02:35:29.920
we are not going to create a one single embedding for this

02:35:29.920 --> 02:35:36.300
massive data so this data set will be used tomorrow let me

02:35:36.300 --> 02:35:38.540
open it up yeah

02:35:40.400 --> 02:35:44.880
so see this is the data this is a huge data set a very very

02:35:44.880 --> 02:35:47.260
huge data set and basically it's a transcript of your live

02:35:47.260 --> 02:35:50.080
classes your live classes only your generative i live

02:35:50.080 --> 02:35:53.280
classes previous class right last class so this is a huge

02:35:53.280 --> 02:35:57.980
huge huge data set and likewise I have shared so many files

02:35:57.980 --> 02:36:01.220
so basically files for all the four classes plus I have even

02:36:01.220 --> 02:36:04.440
shown even I have shared the chat data if you will go ahead

02:36:04.440 --> 02:36:07.700
right you will be able to find out a chat from your badge so

02:36:07.700 --> 02:36:10.060
this this kind of a data which is a real-time data right

02:36:10.060 --> 02:36:12.380
which is a real-time data and which is a chat which is

02:36:12.380 --> 02:36:15.300
coming from like your badge itself so what I will be doing

02:36:15.300 --> 02:36:17.620
tomorrow so I will be showing you an application where I

02:36:17.620 --> 02:36:19.620
will be using this massive data set and obviously for

02:36:19.620 --> 02:36:21.900
massive data set. I am not going to create one single

02:36:21.900 --> 02:36:25.320
embedding. For one data set no we are going to break down

02:36:25.320 --> 02:36:27.720
this data set into a small small small small chunk then

02:36:27.720 --> 02:36:30.180
there will be an overlap we are going to create and then we

02:36:30.180 --> 02:36:32.860
are going to convert those data set into embeddings and this

02:36:32.860 --> 02:36:36.120
is how in reality things happens for example if I am having

02:36:36.120 --> 02:36:40.960
a pdf of size maybe a 500 pages or maybe a 900 pages it's

02:36:40.960 --> 02:36:43.420
not like I will create only one embedding because that in

02:36:43.420 --> 02:36:45.720
that way I will lose the entire sense of creating the

02:36:45.720 --> 02:36:50.720
embeddings got it so come to the come to tomorrow's class I

02:36:50.720 --> 02:36:53.560
will be using this data set. That's the reason so I have

02:36:53.560 --> 02:36:55.960
already shared even like in my previous lecture that okay

02:36:55.960 --> 02:36:58.900
fine maybe if you are building something in a real time you

02:36:58.900 --> 02:37:02.640
can go ahead and use this one. Yeah thank you sir. Okay

02:37:02.640 --> 02:37:06.900
yeah. Next question from Sariq please go ahead.

02:37:10.560 --> 02:37:16.840
Sir actually while executing that file chroma db in that

02:37:16.840 --> 02:37:23.740
line my kernel is crashed on the site multiple times. Okay

02:37:23.740 --> 02:37:27.740
so just just share your screen then I'm promoting you as a

02:37:27.740 --> 02:37:33.440
panelist yeah show me your screen. Sir here I am also facing

02:37:33.440 --> 02:37:36.800
the same issue while doing the chroma db kernel is crashing

02:37:36.800 --> 02:37:42.520
multiple times. Okay okay not an issue Arun so I think we

02:37:42.520 --> 02:37:46.420
can start taking some of the screens let me stop sharing my

02:37:46.420 --> 02:37:52.320
screen first of all yeah so I will stop sharing. Okay. Just

02:37:52.320 --> 02:37:55.420
just a minute guys just a minute just a minute so yeah I

02:37:55.420 --> 02:37:57.760
don't have to wait much so Ranjit sir please share your

02:37:57.760 --> 02:38:00.880
screen so guys Ranjit sir is going to show you some demo

02:38:00.880 --> 02:38:04.080
that he has created so let's have that demo first and then

02:38:04.080 --> 02:38:07.960
I'll start resolving all of your queries yeah

02:38:10.140 --> 02:38:13.000
so I think Ranjit sir's screen is visible to all of us yeah

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:17.160
yeah can you see my screen yes sir yeah we can see your

02:38:17.160 --> 02:38:21.140
screen okay so I have a company called Atala cloud. Okay.

02:38:21.240 --> 02:38:27.860
Okay. So I created an application which is basically a

02:38:27.860 --> 02:38:31.040
customer support and bot okay and it's a lightweight

02:38:31.040 --> 02:38:35.980
production style support assistant it has got three parts

02:38:35.980 --> 02:38:42.360
and and this is in AWS okay so I just today I put it in AWS

02:38:42.360 --> 02:38:47.980
okay and which service you are using in AWS this is very

02:38:47.980 --> 02:38:51.480
interesting. Okay. Okay. So this service is called Light

02:38:51.480 --> 02:38:55.540
what's

02:38:55.540 --> 02:39:01.740
that okay yeah I will tell you maybe a little later because

02:39:01.740 --> 02:39:08.140
it's like something like that okay okay okay and this

02:39:08.140 --> 02:39:13.760
service today because this is on NGINX and this is there was

02:39:13.760 --> 02:39:17.560
lots of code it's the first time I deployed something on

02:39:17.560 --> 02:39:21.440
AWS. Okay. And now let me tell you what does this

02:39:21.440 --> 02:39:27.600
application does okay so this application is also on it's on

02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:31.940
Streamlit also okay and this application is exactly

02:39:31.940 --> 02:39:37.960
application is on AWS cloud on my website okay and and in

02:39:37.960 --> 02:39:43.180
fact this is my website and if I go to home okay so this is

02:39:43.180 --> 02:39:48.620
my website and basically and I do lots of projects. I did

02:39:48.620 --> 02:39:52.280
lots of projects before for major major big companies okay

02:39:52.280 --> 02:39:57.180
and now I I'm I'm going to put another page here where I'll

02:39:57.180 --> 02:40:01.540
be putting all my projects for AI related projects okay so

02:40:01.540 --> 02:40:06.060
try to try to promote sir you're on as well yes yes actually

02:40:06.060 --> 02:40:09.480
you know this is what is this is I'll show you about this

02:40:09.480 --> 02:40:12.640
product then you will realize that okay so basically it's a

02:40:12.640 --> 02:40:15.580
customer support first okay and then the second part is

02:40:15.580 --> 02:40:20.340
employee support and the third part. What is URI so I have

02:40:20.340 --> 02:40:24.200
integrated a URI model here first let's let's start with

02:40:24.200 --> 02:40:28.560
customer support so customer support so basically I have all

02:40:28.560 --> 02:40:33.080
three documents for for the support of the customer and and

02:40:33.080 --> 02:40:37.960
suppose if I want to search something which is predefined

02:40:37.960 --> 02:40:43.920
and I click a search button and it is going to show me okay

02:40:43.920 --> 02:40:49.760
the rank score ID and then I'm going to show me the title of

02:40:49.760 --> 02:40:53.760
that because this title is a return something okay and this

02:40:53.760 --> 02:40:59.040
is going to be snippet that okay this particular has 0.53

02:40:59.040 --> 02:41:04.040
score so this is a result for that this is a because top so

02:41:04.040 --> 02:41:08.480
this is the exactly answer to the question over here suppose

02:41:08.480 --> 02:41:13.620
if I go to select another one and I search here so this is

02:41:13.620 --> 02:41:16.400
international shipping for example so this international

02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:19.600
shipping here okay answer. Okay. The top so this is the

02:41:19.600 --> 02:41:25.960
answer for that question and I can even put here any type my

02:41:25.960 --> 02:41:29.560
own queries okay and then it will go ahead from the database

02:41:29.560 --> 02:41:34.180
so what what I have used here is okay so this is basically

02:41:34.180 --> 02:41:40.880
internal policy using open AI model and the why URI okay and

02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:45.820
and plus I have used face face for the storing of the

02:41:45.820 --> 02:41:54.540
embeddings okay. And and from URI I took this embedding

02:41:54.540 --> 02:41:59.120
model okay so first to create a chunking chunking of course

02:41:59.120 --> 02:42:03.660
done by the other way but to create the to create the

02:42:03.660 --> 02:42:07.060
embeddings okay so and then

02:42:09.180 --> 02:42:13.060
this particular shows you top care how many top care you if

02:42:13.060 --> 02:42:16.620
you want to get only maybe four answer or three answer for

02:42:16.620 --> 02:42:19.520
example. It will provide you now for answer it will not

02:42:19.520 --> 02:42:23.540
provide you for answer and you can go to even three so it

02:42:23.540 --> 02:42:27.240
will provide you three answers okay and and I believe there

02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:32.780
is okay so so this one is for the customer supports so

02:42:32.780 --> 02:42:36.100
anything customer related will come here and then if there

02:42:36.100 --> 02:42:40.220
is suppose an employee is not doing fine but he needs to be

02:42:40.220 --> 02:42:44.020
trained so then we have the employee support. So what is it

02:42:44.020 --> 02:42:48.740
does is that there is a csv. file that has got question and

02:42:48.740 --> 02:42:53.020
answers so basically this is training so suppose that

02:42:53.020 --> 02:42:56.520
employee is not doing good he can he needs to go for a

02:42:56.520 --> 02:43:01.600
training so for example this is a I mean that what is a

02:43:01.600 --> 02:43:05.820
standard us shipping time after processing for the apply can

02:43:05.820 --> 02:43:11.960
select let's put any answer okay so basically if an employee

02:43:11.960 --> 02:43:17.840
need to be trained so he can go ahead and do. training here

02:43:17.840 --> 02:43:21.300
so if I check my answers it will tell you how many are

02:43:21.300 --> 02:43:24.800
correct and how many are wrong so why they are correct why

02:43:24.800 --> 02:43:28.780
they are wrong and and then what is the source it's coming

02:43:28.780 --> 02:43:33.980
from okay and what is the id okay so basically it tells me

02:43:33.980 --> 02:43:41.480
exactly that what a person can redo re take the quiz and

02:43:41.480 --> 02:43:45.020
pass the quiz and then become the again the the support

02:43:45.020 --> 02:43:48.780
basically to help the sport. So he can retake the quiz

02:43:48.780 --> 02:43:52.780
suppose if he retakes the quiz the quiz is still there the

02:43:52.780 --> 02:43:56.460
only answers which are not correct he can answer those okay

02:43:56.460 --> 02:44:02.780
and then basically suppose if I select this one what does

02:44:02.780 --> 02:44:08.020
what does the one year warranty cover so maybe it covers a

02:44:08.020 --> 02:44:12.020
defect material for example okay and I check answers now

02:44:12.020 --> 02:44:14.280
there are two correct okay before that there was only one

02:44:14.280 --> 02:44:17.720
correct see now there are two. correct. So basically these

02:44:17.720 --> 02:44:22.300
are the two correct answers now so and and and like this I

02:44:22.300 --> 02:44:26.580
can take the training again and if I need to suppose start

02:44:26.580 --> 02:44:33.740
from beginning so there is a reset button so this reset

02:44:33.740 --> 02:44:38.860
button will reset everything so this basically all the I can

02:44:38.860 --> 02:44:42.300
take the training from the start again and and and if there

02:44:42.300 --> 02:44:46.260
is another you have got another csv for example that has got

02:44:46.260 --> 02:44:49.840
more number of questions for example 100 questions so there

02:44:49.840 --> 02:44:53.480
is no problem so this one you can upload that your question

02:44:53.480 --> 02:44:57.420
and answer file so it will be basically provide you the

02:44:57.420 --> 02:45:01.060
training the instead of five questions you can have 100

02:45:01.060 --> 02:45:05.180
questions so this is for an employee support okay and the

02:45:05.180 --> 02:45:09.500
third part here is you see here there is a browse file

02:45:09.500 --> 02:45:14.240
button okay so that you can put the new file and right away

02:45:14.240 --> 02:45:17.140
it will be here coming here there is no it's basically

02:45:17.140 --> 02:45:21.020
because there is no embedding involved here this is just a

02:45:22.020 --> 02:45:25.860
question answer basically it's it's a training okay and the

02:45:25.860 --> 02:45:30.560
third piece I have put in the chat yuri so here what I have

02:45:30.560 --> 02:45:36.520
done is and so chat yuri is basically it's using your model

02:45:36.520 --> 02:45:42.920
4.1 gpt and it is using your completion what you call that

02:45:42.920 --> 02:45:48.600
url you have apis and here for example so this is system is

02:45:48.600 --> 02:45:52.780
saying your italic clouds have full assistant be concise and

02:45:52.780 --> 02:45:55.860
accurate so it will provide you the temperature so basically

02:45:55.860 --> 02:46:01.640
temperature is 20 point two here and its tokens are 400 you

02:46:01.640 --> 02:46:06.040
can increase the token maybe maximum 2000 something okay but

02:46:06.040 --> 02:46:11.680
400 is by default okay so and I can answer let's say provide

02:46:14.160 --> 02:46:15.240
a python

02:46:18.800 --> 02:46:24.930
function on sort for example it it doesn't matter so you

02:46:24.930 --> 02:46:30.430
could have any question so it is going to give you this

02:46:30.430 --> 02:46:35.890
example and of course that and then again you can write here

02:46:35.890 --> 02:46:42.230
let's say hello where is London for example I mean just any

02:46:42.230 --> 02:46:47.310
example London so I want to show you something here and so

02:46:47.310 --> 02:46:52.670
if I do say yes so here so this provided you the answer but

02:46:52.670 --> 02:46:57.570
then you see this this bar it moves so the the bar from up

02:46:57.570 --> 02:47:03.310
it has moved here so it is you are always like very close to

02:47:03.310 --> 02:47:07.550
the to what you are asking basically so so it it won't that

02:47:07.550 --> 02:47:11.570
you will have to go there up and and and and type your

02:47:11.570 --> 02:47:14.790
question so basically and then there it provides you the

02:47:14.790 --> 02:47:20.030
clear chat so this chat is clear now so how do you interact

02:47:20.030 --> 02:47:22.150
with this so you can start from the chat so I have

02:47:22.150 --> 02:47:27.750
integrated the video with your Yuri okay and then employee

02:47:27.750 --> 02:47:32.150
support then the customer support and I have put this on the

02:47:32.150 --> 02:47:39.410
adult cloud own sorry and uh uh on the on on the aws okay

02:47:39.410 --> 02:47:44.810
and and and I have used in such a way that this this is

02:47:44.810 --> 02:47:49.490
extremely secure this is your virtual private cloud i don't

02:47:49.490 --> 02:47:52.770
have to create endpoint security i don't have to create

02:47:52.770 --> 02:48:00.090
private links everything is taken care by default by aws

02:48:00.090 --> 02:48:05.490
okay and and and this goes very bare minimum cost and it has

02:48:05.490 --> 02:48:12.050
got a i have got two trillion uh uh um what's that uh uh

02:48:12.050 --> 02:48:17.370
transfer means uh uh available of the uh it's it's a very

02:48:17.370 --> 02:48:21.830
big model okay and and and and it costs no money i mean very

02:48:21.830 --> 02:48:24.990
little money i spent only seven bucks per month and it's

02:48:24.990 --> 02:48:31.010
free for three months okay and and and this is uh it's an

02:48:31.010 --> 02:48:36.170
vps a virtual private service okay yeah and i put this today

02:48:36.170 --> 02:48:40.810
i spent a few hours just trying to uh because it's the first

02:48:40.810 --> 02:48:47.410
time i deployed something on uh on aws and it's a it's a big

02:48:47.410 --> 02:48:51.870
application so basically this application is uh this is my

02:48:51.870 --> 02:48:56.510
insignia and and this is basically a name and it's it has so

02:48:56.510 --> 02:49:04.190
many things like it's a uh uh for example if i talk uh that

02:49:04.190 --> 02:49:08.690
front-end is streamlit with the custom hd hd

02:49:12.890 --> 02:49:18.510
um download then embedding i have got openai text embedding

02:49:18.510 --> 02:49:26.070
three small basically invoked by uh why yuri platform which

02:49:26.070 --> 02:49:29.410
is openai compatible endpoint and i have got vector store

02:49:29.410 --> 02:49:33.670
which is phase and phase has got in inner product on l2

02:49:33.670 --> 02:49:39.130
normalized vector and and i have got chat llm chat

02:49:39.130 --> 02:49:44.170
completion basically default model i have used gpt 4.1 nano

02:49:44.170 --> 02:49:49.550
and and and the data i have used is json and csv basically

02:49:49.550 --> 02:49:54.310
it's a tiny phase index committed for basically demo

02:49:54.310 --> 02:49:57.970
convenience so it could be extended to any number i mean the

02:49:57.970 --> 02:50:02.430
way it is right now i have put only tiny data just for the

02:50:02.430 --> 02:50:06.490
uh for the uh demo purpose yes you were talking about which

02:50:06.490 --> 02:50:08.270
service i have used it's called light

02:50:13.530 --> 02:50:20.510
And it is also on the cloud for Streamlit cloud and on here,

02:50:20.790 --> 02:50:26.350
so basically and also it's in what we call in GitHub. And

02:50:26.350 --> 02:50:28.830
also the first time I put something on the GitHub, I never

02:50:28.830 --> 02:50:30.470
really

02:50:33.160 --> 02:50:38.220
I have all this code here. Then I have got my site here

02:50:38.220 --> 02:50:44.180
where I want to put all these all my because I'm working on

02:50:44.180 --> 02:50:46.940
so many things. So I want to show you something here as

02:50:46.940 --> 02:50:53.080
well. Can you see? Yeah, I can see no, sir, I think you have

02:50:53.080 --> 02:50:56.260
a stop sharing your screen, please share once again. How to

02:50:56.260 --> 02:51:00.920
share again down, you will be able to see the up arrow

02:51:00.920 --> 02:51:05.640
button share button. Same same way. No, I don't see

02:51:05.640 --> 02:51:05.900
anything.

02:51:08.680 --> 02:51:14.060
Okay, let me share the ones and yeah, now, can you see the

02:51:14.060 --> 02:51:21.680
sharing option? I love this time and then just below in a

02:51:21.680 --> 02:51:23.180
zoom zoom basically.

02:51:27.550 --> 02:51:31.270
So anyone else can you please share a screen try setting a

02:51:31.270 --> 02:51:33.930
screen so that we can test because I can see the option from

02:51:33.930 --> 02:51:39.010
my side. I don't see. Yeah. Yeah, so I'm gonna screen

02:51:39.010 --> 02:51:41.130
visible, right? So in the similar manner. Oh, yeah. Oh,

02:51:41.210 --> 02:51:44.550
yeah. Okay. Yeah. Now, please stop sharing the screen for

02:51:44.550 --> 02:51:47.350
some time. So that our needs are can share. Let me finish

02:51:47.350 --> 02:51:53.530
his like, yeah, yeah, no. So do you see this? Yes, yes, yes.

02:51:53.690 --> 02:51:58.570
We can see. So this is another project which I am working

02:51:58.570 --> 02:52:01.790
on, okay, it is not complete yet, but it is what it is

02:52:01.790 --> 02:52:07.130
there. So basically, it suppose a company has it. Okay.

02:52:07.130 --> 02:52:11.470
Yeah. 100 employees. So this is for 100. So it can be

02:52:11.470 --> 02:52:15.030
extended to 5000. It doesn't matter for 10,000, because this

02:52:15.030 --> 02:52:17.730
is a very good program. So what it is showing is that so

02:52:17.730 --> 02:52:22.750
basically, it I load the metadata. Okay. So basically,

02:52:22.750 --> 02:52:25.550
metadata will be loaded here. Maybe I should start from the

02:52:25.550 --> 02:52:31.230
beginning. And what to start from beginning? It should be

02:52:31.230 --> 02:52:34.210
maybe load the load the URL. Yeah, load the URL. It will

02:52:34.210 --> 02:52:38.930
start from the beginning. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So

02:52:38.930 --> 02:52:42.850
basically, this is an employee's thumbnail search. So it is

02:52:42.850 --> 02:52:48.590
on the clip and face. So face is that embedding for use and

02:52:48.590 --> 02:52:52.250
the clip is for the image. So basically, it does the image

02:52:52.250 --> 02:53:00.410
similarity. And so basically, click on any image to use as a

02:53:00.410 --> 02:53:04.530
query. So so so it's a gallery. Basically, I have the

02:53:04.530 --> 02:53:08.750
metadata stored here in these two files. Okay. Mm hmm. So

02:53:08.750 --> 02:53:15.250
and then it will the way the moment I will click load

02:53:15.250 --> 02:53:19.770
metadata, so it will show you the images, all those

02:53:19.770 --> 02:53:23.490
thumbnails for this. So basically, these are thumbnails,

02:53:23.670 --> 02:53:26.790
okay, right now, they are 100. And if I want to search

02:53:26.790 --> 02:53:30.450
something, suppose a department, a company has maybe 10

02:53:30.450 --> 02:53:34.310
department. So suppose if company has a engineering manager,

02:53:34.550 --> 02:53:38.530
HR specialist, marketing, or something like that. If I just

02:53:38.530 --> 02:53:44.730
click here, and I want to run as a preset query, okay. So I

02:53:44.730 --> 02:53:48.490
can now here, see that there is nobody here from this

02:53:48.490 --> 02:53:57.560
department. Let's see if I maybe click here. And not here.

02:53:57.840 --> 02:53:59.400
Okay. See.

02:54:04.410 --> 02:54:10.570
Oh, okay, maybe I'm having the wrong. Okay. Okay. Search by

02:54:10.570 --> 02:54:16.950
text. Oh. I think I'm connecting to the wrong file. So

02:54:16.950 --> 02:54:20.890
otherwise, you will see here on here that all those people

02:54:20.890 --> 02:54:24.770
belonging to this department, you will see them all their

02:54:24.770 --> 02:54:28.430
thumbnails here. And then it will tell you that what role

02:54:28.430 --> 02:54:31.510
they have, and what is the department they belong to. And

02:54:31.510 --> 02:54:38.610
then we can do this and it will be able to you can upload

02:54:38.610 --> 02:54:43.010
any image as and then it will do the similarity search.

02:54:43.670 --> 02:54:47.930
Okay. And it will give you a similarity score. So maybe the

02:54:47.930 --> 02:54:53.230
next time when this is ready, so I want to put this on my

02:54:53.230 --> 02:54:56.430
site. So basically, I want to create so many different

02:54:56.430 --> 02:55:00.690
programs. So in this one, basically, you are using like

02:55:00.690 --> 02:55:03.790
direct so you're doing a search with a metadata or you're

02:55:03.790 --> 02:55:08.530
doing a search with the image directly. Image pixels. The

02:55:08.530 --> 02:55:12.610
search is with that. There are two things. So image for the

02:55:12.610 --> 02:55:19.890
image, but to bring data, I go for this metadata. So it's

02:55:19.890 --> 02:55:24.170
doing two types of searching. It's doing because that's why

02:55:24.170 --> 02:55:28.370
I needed a clip to do that searching image for image

02:55:28.370 --> 02:55:33.010
searching. But then it does go with the metadata. So because

02:55:33.010 --> 02:55:37.530
you see role, what is role that will come through a metadata

02:55:37.530 --> 02:55:42.930
and for that, you don't need a clip. Okay. Hmm. So, so, so

02:55:42.930 --> 02:55:46.770
two types of, uh, uh, uh, means, uh, it's, it's doing the

02:55:46.770 --> 02:55:51.530
searching. So, so, so, so how do you like these two products

02:55:51.530 --> 02:55:55.050
to be charged? That's amazing. So like that to, uh, in a

02:55:55.050 --> 02:55:58.290
fourth or fifth class, you are showing us these things. So

02:55:58.290 --> 02:56:02.390
what about, uh, Oh, how, what is your feedback guys?

02:56:02.530 --> 02:56:07.770
Everyone is very inspiring us. Yeah. So very good. I didn't

02:56:07.770 --> 02:56:12.930
see Rangin sir's age is 70 year. Yeah. Yeah. And still he's

02:56:12.930 --> 02:56:15.250
having an interest in that technology is still, he's

02:56:15.250 --> 02:56:18.610
learning. He's still, he's doing it something on his own.

02:56:18.770 --> 02:56:22.630
Right. So he's, he's trying to like, uh, uh, think about the

02:56:22.630 --> 02:56:24.930
product and then he's trying to like, uh, building

02:56:24.930 --> 02:56:28.870
something. So I think it's, uh, inspiration for all of us,

02:56:28.890 --> 02:56:32.790
uh, especially like, uh, people like me who is a half of

02:56:32.790 --> 02:56:36.810
your age, maybe less than that. But if, if we are not doing

02:56:36.810 --> 02:56:39.590
something like this, then it's the same on us. I would say.

02:56:41.210 --> 02:56:44.090
But yeah, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's amazing. And I

02:56:44.090 --> 02:56:46.210
believe, uh, in next two or three months, you will be able

02:56:46.210 --> 02:56:49.210
to create a lot, right? Because obviously we'll keep on

02:56:49.210 --> 02:56:52.710
adding a lot of like, uh, learnings experiences. And even

02:56:52.710 --> 02:56:54.910
after tomorrow, you will be able to build a lot of things

02:56:54.910 --> 02:56:58.970
tomorrow for tomorrow's class. Right. I'll, I'll show you so

02:56:58.970 --> 02:57:01.690
many things tomorrow. Yeah. Actually so many things I have

02:57:01.690 --> 02:57:04.930
in the pipeline, which I have done, they are 50% or 70%

02:57:04.930 --> 02:57:07.770
done. So many projects based upon what you gave the

02:57:07.770 --> 02:57:12.190
projects. Okay. And, uh, but, uh, right now, uh, it was a

02:57:12.190 --> 02:57:16.730
challenge to put this on AWS. Okay. It was, it was lots of

02:57:16.730 --> 02:57:20.710
work. Okay. And, and, and also first time I used the GitHub,

02:57:20.830 --> 02:57:23.750
I never used the GitHub before it was a challenge. It was a

02:57:23.750 --> 02:57:27.390
challenge to get that GitHub also cleaned up properly. And

02:57:27.390 --> 02:57:32.490
then basically also the way I have, uh, uh, done this, uh,

02:57:32.650 --> 02:57:36.530
the project, which I showed you. So, so, so this project is

02:57:36.530 --> 02:57:43.290
like a. It's a. Very secure. And, uh, and I believe that,

02:57:43.290 --> 02:57:46.090
uh, with maybe a little bit of modification, it could be

02:57:46.090 --> 02:57:49.050
used somewhere for the good purpose. Obviously, sir.

02:57:49.090 --> 02:57:51.890
Obviously. And just before tomorrow's class, believe me in

02:57:51.890 --> 02:57:55.630
the same project, you will do a modification. You will do a

02:57:55.630 --> 02:57:58.870
lot of modification and then it will be amazing one in that

02:57:58.870 --> 02:58:03.690
way. Okay. But I will need your help in one case. Okay. Uh,

02:58:04.010 --> 02:58:09.510
see, see, I have my site here. Okay. So this site I built

02:58:09.510 --> 02:58:14.990
maybe, uh, seven, eight months ago. So a hundred percent of

02:58:14.990 --> 02:58:18.750
the site is built by me on AWS. That's amazing. So that's

02:58:18.750 --> 02:58:22.610
amazing. Another label. Yes. So, so this was everything here

02:58:22.610 --> 02:58:30.310
is cloud and I built this whole of this site and, uh, uh,

02:58:30.310 --> 02:58:36.070
basically, uh, put it here with all these . So I'm going to

02:58:36.070 --> 02:58:38.390
change, of course, a lot of things. Okay. At that time.

02:58:38.650 --> 02:58:41.950
Okay. They are also images created by AI. I mean, seven,

02:58:42.070 --> 02:58:48.810
eight months ago. Okay. I think. Okay. And, uh, so services

02:58:48.810 --> 02:58:54.850
and my projection. And then of course there's a team, like,

02:58:54.850 --> 02:58:59.110
uh, I I'm trying to build some people. I'm trying to some

02:58:59.110 --> 02:59:02.770
friend. Okay. This is me. Okay. Okay. That's amazing. That's

02:59:02.770 --> 02:59:04.430
amazing. That's good to see your face. Yeah. That's amazing.

02:59:05.310 --> 02:59:11.090
Yeah. Yeah. And, uh, and of course contact us. So, uh, so

02:59:11.090 --> 02:59:16.210
basically this was created last year. Okay. So, so, so now

02:59:16.210 --> 02:59:21.830
my question to you is maybe it's a, uh, you can very quickly

02:59:21.830 --> 02:59:27.470
help me that outcome, this application and this site is

02:59:27.470 --> 02:59:32.610
right now. It's not searchable. So, uh, uh, I mean. Okay.

02:59:32.630 --> 02:59:36.250
How can I make this application and this, uh, site and that

02:59:36.250 --> 02:59:39.230
people are able to search it? Okay. So basically you are

02:59:39.230 --> 02:59:44.790
this, uh, adult cloud, right? Uh, Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So

02:59:44.790 --> 02:59:48.610
basically you are talking about the SEO. Yes. Yes. Search

02:59:48.610 --> 02:59:51.990
engine optimization. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So if you can provide

02:59:51.990 --> 02:59:55.490
me some guidance on that. Not a guidance. Maybe I can just

02:59:55.490 --> 02:59:58.430
engage one or two people from my side, from my team, because

02:59:58.430 --> 03:00:01.270
I have a tech team. Right. Because in terms of SEO. So we

03:00:01.270 --> 03:00:04.470
try to like, uh, update lots of like, uh, root files. Um,

03:00:04.590 --> 03:00:07.270
right. Robot TXT files. We try to update, we try to do our

03:00:07.270 --> 03:00:10.450
indexings over there. And, uh, plus we try to do a CDN

03:00:10.450 --> 03:00:14.690
mapping. Um, so maybe I can try to engage one or one people.

03:00:14.830 --> 03:00:17.090
I think they will be, they will sit for maybe one or two

03:00:17.090 --> 03:00:19.990
days and, uh, they will be able to configure it in that way.

03:00:20.290 --> 03:00:23.430
But yeah, search on a Google search will be like, uh,

03:00:23.470 --> 03:00:25.430
anyone, if they're searching with the name, they will be

03:00:25.430 --> 03:00:27.950
able to search it immediately within like a one or two

03:00:27.950 --> 03:00:30.750
weeks. So once we'll do that. Uh, like, uh, do this, uh,

03:00:30.770 --> 03:00:32.930
thing. Right. Once my team will do this thing. So I think,

03:00:32.990 --> 03:00:35.850
uh, anyone is going to search it and they will be able to

03:00:35.850 --> 03:00:38.390
get it. And then if you would like to like a rank your

03:00:38.390 --> 03:00:41.710
website, then you have to run the ads or maybe, uh, some

03:00:41.710 --> 03:00:44.090
social like, uh, connects basically like, uh, if, if you are

03:00:44.090 --> 03:00:48.390
posting a lot on a LinkedIn, on Twitter, right. So even it

03:00:48.390 --> 03:00:51.850
will increase the SEO of your website. So your website will

03:00:51.850 --> 03:00:56.010
come on top, but if you are facing a problem in terms of

03:00:56.010 --> 03:00:59.150
doing a search on a Google, if Google is not able to search

03:00:59.150 --> 03:01:01.970
this particular page, it simply means that that robot or TXT

03:01:01.970 --> 03:01:05.010
is missing or some indexing is missing. So I think my team

03:01:05.010 --> 03:01:08.810
can fix it quickly. Yeah. I mean, if, if you want, I can pay

03:01:08.810 --> 03:01:12.290
them. Not an issue that it is not a big task. It's a very

03:01:12.290 --> 03:01:15.430
small task. Right. Uh, but yeah, it needs to be done for any

03:01:15.430 --> 03:01:19.670
website. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If you can help me in that.

03:01:19.750 --> 03:01:23.330
So basically then this site will start coming and, and I can

03:01:23.330 --> 03:01:27.890
even, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, I had a Google service also

03:01:27.890 --> 03:01:32.630
after that. Okay. Okay. So that's my site. Uh, and, uh,

03:01:32.630 --> 03:01:36.910
basically, uh, because I'm excited from January purpose,

03:01:37.150 --> 03:01:40.630
like, uh, I was, uh, you know, I retired, I retired a couple

03:01:40.630 --> 03:01:44.670
of years ago, but then I came back because I felt, uh, I was

03:01:44.670 --> 03:01:45.270
bored. So

03:01:48.970 --> 03:01:51.930
It's literally like, uh, inspiring for all of us that I'm

03:01:51.930 --> 03:01:56.530
like, uh, I had very big, yeah, I had very big project to

03:01:56.530 --> 03:02:01.370
basically say no, no mileage, which is of India. Okay. So I,

03:02:01.370 --> 03:02:04.730
uh, I migrated there, all their Brazilian application in

03:02:04.730 --> 03:02:08.610
Spanish application, they were in Spanish language. So for,

03:02:08.670 --> 03:02:14.850
uh, and, uh, this is a company and then of course, them, the

03:02:14.850 --> 03:02:19.070

03:02:19.070 --> 03:02:22.490

application, uh, I improved to 16,000%, 16,000%. Hmm. Hmm.

03:02:30.590 --> 03:02:33.830
Hmm. So for one day of my work, one day of my work, they

03:02:33.830 --> 03:02:39.130
saved more than $50,000. Hmm. That's amazing. Yeah. And

03:02:39.130 --> 03:02:42.970

03:04:52.120 --> 03:04:55.780
decommissioned their whole quick place infrastructure and

03:04:55.780 --> 03:04:59.040
which they were trying for a very long time but when i went

03:04:59.040 --> 03:05:03.160
i just as a senior solution architect this was awesome uh

03:05:03.160 --> 03:05:10.060
this was in 20 2010 or 2011 i mean i mean how many years ago

03:05:10.060 --> 03:05:18.740
15 15 years ago so yeah yeah so quick place infrastructure

03:05:18.740 --> 03:05:22.300
it was a complete retirement of the infrastructure which

03:05:22.300 --> 03:05:29.300
like they saved you know how many millions dollar they saved

03:05:29.300 --> 03:05:35.560
uh oh my god he was huge i'm super and and and and then the

03:05:35.560 --> 03:05:42.400
signal healthcare this is why the project like uh i i say

03:05:42.400 --> 03:05:50.580
that 99 of the united states pharma companies data so all

03:05:50.580 --> 03:05:57.700
the medical debates they are by this program which i this i

03:05:57.700 --> 03:06:02.740
come created from end to end like they had this project was

03:06:02.740 --> 03:06:08.820
not existing before so this projector uh how much uh more

03:06:08.820 --> 03:06:14.620
than three billion dollars more than three billion dollars

03:06:14.620 --> 03:06:18.140
of medical debates every month process through this

03:06:18.140 --> 03:06:21.160
application which i created from scratch from ground zero

03:06:22.080 --> 03:06:27.700
because in snowflake than in aws and then 800 plus pharma

03:06:27.700 --> 03:06:32.380
companies of united states so all the medical debates they

03:06:32.380 --> 03:06:36.060
were processed through this application which i created from

03:06:36.060 --> 03:06:41.640
scratch for them huge huge application which was which used

03:06:41.640 --> 03:06:47.080
to take i think maybe 60 hours to run but by the time i re

03:06:47.080 --> 03:06:51.980
-architected the whole system because neither aws was able

03:06:51.980 --> 03:06:56.500
to run it because i to do anything nor tableau so tableau

03:06:56.500 --> 03:07:01.760
was is it the visualization was done through tableau now

03:07:01.760 --> 03:07:10.260
tableau uh they i three months i worked with them tried to

03:07:10.260 --> 03:07:15.440
improve they gave up they said it's not possible what i did

03:07:15.440 --> 03:07:22.340
i i i brought the timelines show like it it used to take

03:07:22.340 --> 03:07:26.260
maybe 40 hours to process to to only three four hours which

03:07:26.260 --> 03:07:29.700
they said is it's not possible so so i was able to do

03:07:29.700 --> 03:07:32.480
something which they if they said we don't have any apis

03:07:32.480 --> 03:07:36.440
there is no way to do anything okay and then once and

03:07:36.440 --> 03:07:39.860
because once i did it they said nobody has ever been able to

03:07:39.860 --> 03:07:46.600
do i was the one who was able to do uh basically i uh their

03:07:46.600 --> 03:07:50.620
servers i i modified their servers in such a way without

03:07:50.620 --> 03:07:54.740
touching their servers okay so without touching i mean

03:07:54.740 --> 03:08:00.520
without their apis so i was able to oh very very beautiful

03:08:00.520 --> 03:08:06.220
yeah yes it's not possible and and see that and then again

03:08:06.220 --> 03:08:12.220
with with with aws redshift also so so i did parallel

03:08:12.220 --> 03:08:15.120
processing on top of their massively parallel processing

03:08:15.120 --> 03:08:20.100
which they said it's not possible so

03:08:20.100 --> 03:08:24.940
yeah so this is what i did that's an amazing experience sir

03:08:24.940 --> 03:08:28.040
so i think uh just an inspiration for all of us all of us

03:08:28.040 --> 03:08:32.480
literally are like uh and yeah i think we have to go a very

03:08:32.480 --> 03:08:36.880
very long way i i don't know like many of us don't even know

03:08:36.880 --> 03:08:39.460

basically i started learning typing when i was almost 40

03:08:56.480 --> 03:09:02.900
years old okay so then i did a diploma in computer science

03:09:02.900 --> 03:09:06.520

03:10:38.880 --> 03:10:42.040
pinged you on a whatsapp all right sorry uh yeah so yeah so

03:10:42.040 --> 03:10:43.840
you're ready to go guys i'm ready to go guys yeah so i'm

03:10:43.840 --> 03:10:45.680
ready to go guys thank you uh so thank you so uh yeah like

03:10:45.680 --> 03:10:49.740
uh uh over there itself maybe by monday or tuesday so i'll

03:10:49.740 --> 03:10:53.620
allocate someone okay thank you very much tuesday yeah i'll

03:10:53.620 --> 03:10:56.580
try to locate someone from my team yeah good i appreciate

03:10:56.580 --> 03:10:59.520
your help then very much always welcome sir yeah always yeah

03:10:59.520 --> 03:11:02.420
yeah thank you very much thank you thank you yeah please

03:11:02.420 --> 03:11:04.020
share the screen okay

03:11:11.250 --> 03:11:15.910
yeah it's visible yeah so actually i was doing uh that

03:11:15.910 --> 03:11:19.630
assignment and i was so there is one cloud which i had it is

03:11:19.630 --> 03:11:23.210
related to that multimodal search when what i was doing okay

03:11:23.210 --> 03:11:27.210
so the thing is of whenever so what i did was i used so

03:11:27.210 --> 03:11:30.950
there is a new embedding called jana ai jana embedding which

03:11:30.950 --> 03:11:34.470
i used because it is a on with one modality you can do both

03:11:34.470 --> 03:11:37.290
the search because in clip you need to create two different

03:11:37.290 --> 03:11:41.330
i mean for text and image so everything was working fine my

03:11:41.330 --> 03:11:45.050
only concern is like how do i debug it because when i'm

03:11:45.050 --> 03:11:47.870
doing the search through text even it's also able to take a

03:11:47.870 --> 03:11:52.170
hindi as a language and i was able to get answers both in

03:11:52.170 --> 03:11:56.270
like an image or a text but i'm not so satisfied when i'm

03:11:56.270 --> 03:12:00.290
using image as a search option so i wanted to know sir is

03:12:00.290 --> 03:12:03.150
there a way like how i can like uh add some kind of

03:12:03.150 --> 03:12:07.910
debugging to see like exactly how is it uh matching it pi db

03:12:07.910 --> 03:12:12.990
is one of the library but jupyter notebook debugging somehow

03:12:12.990 --> 03:12:15.690
i don't like it you can do a debugging in jupyter notebook

03:12:15.690 --> 03:12:18.790
and try to put up breakpoints over here with the help of pi

03:12:18.790 --> 03:12:22.110
db python debugger but uh it will be better if you are

03:12:22.110 --> 03:12:25.050
looking for a debugging to convert this entire like copy and

03:12:25.050 --> 03:12:27.730
paste this entire code into dot pi file and then right click

03:12:27.730 --> 03:12:31.390
run in debug mode and then put a breakpoint so just just

03:12:31.390 --> 03:12:34.110
keep it inside the pi file dot pi file yeah so actually when

03:12:34.110 --> 03:12:36.850
i'm talking about debugging i'm more related to that my code

03:12:36.850 --> 03:12:39.190
everything is working fine i just need to understand like

03:12:39.190 --> 03:12:44.370
how images understanding like my data and i from the image

03:12:44.370 --> 03:12:47.770
perspective because because we come from data science so i'm

03:12:47.770 --> 03:12:50.070
more interested rather than what is what is the what is the

03:12:50.070 --> 03:12:52.210
what is the data that you are restoring so can you please

03:12:52.210 --> 03:12:54.770
show me that so i'll show you that so so these are some of

03:12:54.770 --> 03:12:57.750
the text captions and some of the images and some are

03:12:57.750 --> 03:13:01.310
similar some are different okay okay okay so so when i'm

03:13:01.310 --> 03:13:04.950
using in like so there are two things first i did was text

03:13:04.950 --> 03:13:08.550
and getting the top five forget about the search by the way

03:13:08.550 --> 03:13:12.130
so if you can show me like uh what kind of a processing pre

03:13:12.130 --> 03:13:14.210
-processing you are doing with the images and that will be

03:13:14.210 --> 03:13:18.730
better okay so so what i did was the image i got it then

03:13:18.730 --> 03:13:21.710
come to the next i'm embedding so you are trying to give

03:13:21.710 --> 03:13:25.970
input okay so text lf it will go to the image part what is

03:13:25.970 --> 03:13:28.130
the embedding model that you are using so there's a jenna

03:13:28.130 --> 03:13:30.930
yeah it's a api i can share that link with you you can have

03:13:30.930 --> 03:13:38.230
a look it's a jenna jenna yeah right yes we are g j a i'll

03:13:38.230 --> 03:13:42.170
show you this is the one okay got it yeah it's b4 because i

03:13:42.170 --> 03:13:44.430
was also doing some search so i thought that they were

03:13:44.430 --> 03:13:48.570
saying that it's better than clip no it's the most like a

03:13:48.570 --> 03:13:57.030
good like a port so i was using its v4 okay so jenna ai

03:13:57.030 --> 03:14:04.110
basically it's a queen based model so you are using jenna

03:14:04.110 --> 03:14:11.290
okay so jenna embedding v4 and let me see its documentation

03:14:12.070 --> 03:14:12.830
because

03:14:16.160 --> 03:14:18.640
it's a bit heavy so i use this api rather than like loading

03:14:18.640 --> 03:14:20.780
the topic fine fine yeah

03:14:27.620 --> 03:14:30.440
uh okay so fine let's suppose you have used a jenna then

03:14:30.440 --> 03:14:33.440
what is next so you also have also so what i did was i

03:14:33.440 --> 03:14:35.800
combined so there is an option rather than keeping it too

03:14:35.800 --> 03:14:38.780
differently you can even combine it so that's what i did so

03:14:38.780 --> 03:14:43.160
that it doesn't like uh deviate between image and text so

03:14:43.160 --> 03:14:45.640
this is what i did here in this part i also checked with

03:14:45.640 --> 03:14:47.940
jenny that has a corrected me so they are saying yes you are

03:14:47.940 --> 03:14:50.860
done absolutely fine but i'm not too sure like is it the

03:14:50.860 --> 03:14:54.840
right now the model limitation it's not able to like

03:14:54.840 --> 03:14:57.640
understand the image better and give the result or because

03:14:57.640 --> 03:15:02.100
every time that will have to check yeah so basically you are

03:15:02.100 --> 03:15:06.040
trying to convert images of a cycle person okay so i have no

03:15:06.040 --> 03:15:09.460
image which is in my data with bicycle but i have a very

03:15:09.460 --> 03:15:13.240
clear caption which is in like i'll show you back so if you

03:15:13.240 --> 03:15:18.200
see uh my it says this one uh where it is a person riding

03:15:18.200 --> 03:15:20.940
bicycle so at least it should give at least in top five

03:15:20.940 --> 03:15:24.640
right not in top three but there is no it's not a person

03:15:24.640 --> 03:15:28.680
riding a bicycle you are doing a image matching or you are

03:15:28.680 --> 03:15:32.780
doing a text matching it's an image so what i did was the

03:15:32.780 --> 03:15:35.540
way i've written my code is irrespective of a text or image

03:15:35.540 --> 03:15:38.700
it should give me the top five results so for example the

03:15:38.700 --> 03:15:41.360
text it's giving me now see can you see that when i've kept

03:15:41.360 --> 03:15:45.380
a 50 pahar so because i have an image also of a person

03:15:45.380 --> 03:15:48.440
sitting at the top of a mountain or something like that so

03:15:48.440 --> 03:15:50.520
it is also giving me those results and also there is a

03:15:50.520 --> 03:15:54.540
caption similar to that it gives me top three but that is

03:15:54.540 --> 03:15:57.140
not happening at an image level that's what i'm saying so

03:15:57.140 --> 03:15:58.620
that's what i'm saying when i'm doing the right vice versa

03:15:58.620 --> 03:16:04.520
kind of a search it is not able to understand it simple so

03:16:04.520 --> 03:16:06.980
it's image to image such you are doing or text to image that

03:16:06.980 --> 03:16:09.720
you are trying to also it's i have not i have made a such a

03:16:09.720 --> 03:16:12.440
way that it shouldn't be imperative whether it's a image or

03:16:12.440 --> 03:16:15.760
text it should be for example for a text it's taken both the

03:16:15.760 --> 03:16:19.500
things right so it should give the top five irrespective

03:16:19.500 --> 03:16:22.600
whether i have taken a text embedding or like an image

03:16:22.600 --> 03:16:25.580
embedding i've mixed them together so if you see here i did

03:16:25.580 --> 03:16:30.140
that now is the my clip so i wanted to keep a one uh

03:16:30.140 --> 03:16:33.660
database and this is the best part about the jaina because

03:16:33.660 --> 03:16:38.460
that is what it's able to solve it like it it doesn't make

03:16:38.460 --> 03:16:41.400
two different cases you can confuse them together like you

03:16:41.400 --> 03:16:46.320
can confusion them together so this is how i did that i'm

03:16:46.320 --> 03:16:51.480
just trying to check how good jaina is by the way uh in

03:16:51.480 --> 03:16:58.970
terms of models so we'll prefer to use a clip i think those

03:16:58.970 --> 03:17:02.630
models are better but as i have did my research so it says

03:17:02.630 --> 03:17:05.150
it's better than that because it's so that's how because

03:17:05.150 --> 03:17:08.290
maybe i have not checked the benchmarking for jenna by the

03:17:08.290 --> 03:17:12.390
way but yeah i i'm not aware about it because uh it's all

03:17:12.390 --> 03:17:15.010
about like a how good it is in terms of generating the

03:17:15.010 --> 03:17:19.470
vectors right so if it is not then in that case nothing can

03:17:19.470 --> 03:17:24.050
be done so built on quen fine so it's a single vector

03:17:24.050 --> 03:17:30.270
dimension okay fine and in case of calling the embeddings

03:17:30.270 --> 03:17:39.290
image input i can try to give it's a transformer based so it

03:17:39.290 --> 03:17:43.250
every model is transformed based by the way all the elements

03:17:43.250 --> 03:17:45.830
so

03:17:52.110 --> 03:17:59.070
looks fine to me i mean like uh yeah that's okay so i'm just

03:17:59.070 --> 03:18:01.650
thinking yeah maybe if you have any otherwise that's okay i

03:18:01.650 --> 03:18:04.010
can do my side because there was one more model called vista

03:18:04.010 --> 03:18:06.310
which i was going through the paper but i wasn't able to

03:18:06.310 --> 03:18:10.830
find it so codes otherwise i could have uh try using maybe a

03:18:10.830 --> 03:18:14.650
inception model okay so i think that could give you the

03:18:14.650 --> 03:18:17.230
better result in terms of understanding because it's a

03:18:17.230 --> 03:18:20.090
google's uh deep network and they're literally very good

03:18:20.090 --> 03:18:22.550
very good in terms of understanding the images yeah

03:18:22.550 --> 03:18:27.910
inception model yeah inception b3 so basically see it's all

03:18:27.910 --> 03:18:31.610
about like embedding that we are trying to generate if my

03:18:31.610 --> 03:18:37.370
embeddings are good then in that case or inception is just

03:18:37.370 --> 03:18:40.630
for image to image if you're looking for multi-model right

03:18:40.630 --> 03:18:42.230
so

03:18:49.110 --> 03:18:51.630
in case of multi-model basically

03:18:54.450 --> 03:18:55.050
even

03:18:58.280 --> 03:19:02.480
you can try to have you tried like a gemini by the way no

03:19:02.480 --> 03:19:06.020
sir no i was going more for like local based rather than

03:19:06.020 --> 03:19:10.620
those models but that is more for learning purple like i

03:19:10.620 --> 03:19:14.180
could have used them but it was more for learning that's why

03:19:14.180 --> 03:19:17.640
so gemini is one of the best i have tried gemini i have used

03:19:17.640 --> 03:19:21.020
it a lot right so now flash models i have used it a lot and

03:19:21.020 --> 03:19:24.180
it's literally good it's literally very good and you don't

03:19:24.180 --> 03:19:28.080
have to even convert something into the vector by default it

03:19:28.080 --> 03:19:31.700
will be able to process it it is literally very good so i

03:19:31.700 --> 03:19:35.100
was i was using it i loved it literally right so maybe you

03:19:35.100 --> 03:19:37.220
can try to use it because here the problem which i can see

03:19:37.220 --> 03:19:39.520
is with the accuracy maybe it is not able to understand the

03:19:39.520 --> 03:19:43.080
embeddings that That's the only, that's the only problem. So

03:19:43.080 --> 03:19:46.120
just one more thing. So I was also going, so I came across

03:19:46.120 --> 03:19:49.460
one thing called late chunking. So what is that concept? How

03:19:49.460 --> 03:19:53.080
is it different from the chunking? How we do that? Late

03:19:53.080 --> 03:19:56.760
chunking. Yeah. So actually using this embedding only, there

03:19:56.760 --> 03:19:59.160
was one option. Like it also gives a late chunking option,

03:19:59.320 --> 03:20:04.700
like which is, which it is better, not sure about it, but I

03:20:04.700 --> 03:20:07.740
can give you some ideas. So it's like that. So for example,

03:20:07.760 --> 03:20:11.680
when you give us some raw data, it creates an embedding and

03:20:11.680 --> 03:20:15.360
later it does the chunking. So basically, yes, the

03:20:15.360 --> 03:20:17.420
definition, which I'm able to see over here and quickly,

03:20:17.500 --> 03:20:20.100
which I was able to understand is like, uh, they try to

03:20:20.100 --> 03:20:22.880
convert first of all, entire dataset into the embeddings and

03:20:22.880 --> 03:20:26.040
then after converting those datasets into our embeddings. So

03:20:26.040 --> 03:20:31.060
basically they try to pass through a long-term embedding

03:20:31.060 --> 03:20:35.000
model to generate a token label vector representation. And

03:20:35.000 --> 03:20:37.060
only after that it's chunking. It's smaller segment

03:20:37.060 --> 03:20:40.420
performance just before pooling to get final check

03:20:40.420 --> 03:20:44.440
embedding. Okay. So conceptually I'm able to understand it,

03:20:44.520 --> 03:20:47.460
but what is the benefit it will give? Because I think it may

03:20:47.460 --> 03:20:50.860
consume a lot of data. So that's why I can use it. Often

03:20:50.860 --> 03:20:53.980
doing a context links between the segment, late chunking

03:20:53.980 --> 03:20:56.280
chunks, clear the token label representation that already

03:20:56.280 --> 03:21:00.180
encoded and based on the whole text result in the checking

03:21:00.180 --> 03:21:03.960
embedding that are conditional and contextual. Uh, not sure

03:21:03.960 --> 03:21:08.500
about it. Like definition wise. I'm okay. But, uh, again,

03:21:08.620 --> 03:21:12.120
performance and results. I was just thinking if you have

03:21:12.120 --> 03:21:14.980
used it, otherwise that's okay. I guess I've never used it

03:21:14.980 --> 03:21:17.540
for sure today. Today I'll explore. I'll try to explore this

03:21:17.540 --> 03:21:20.700
one. Uh, so one more thing. So can you just suggest me good,

03:21:20.840 --> 03:21:25.040
like a document passing, um, like, uh, like I have worked on

03:21:25.040 --> 03:21:28.140
docking and all, is there anything now better advanced more

03:21:28.140 --> 03:21:30.420
than that, which I can use because this is more for my

03:21:30.420 --> 03:21:34.060
office project, like I was creating some local tool for my

03:21:34.060 --> 03:21:38.260
team to use. So from that. Document document parsing for

03:21:38.260 --> 03:21:42.360
what purposes? So for example, to extract tables and all

03:21:42.360 --> 03:21:44.900
that, to create it into a machine learning, like, because

03:21:44.900 --> 03:21:47.180
see what is happening right now, we are preparing some rack

03:21:47.180 --> 03:21:51.140
for an internal, like, like team. And the thing is the

03:21:51.140 --> 03:21:53.260
people who are going to use that from finance and also they

03:21:53.260 --> 03:21:56.700
don't understand that. So basically it's going to be prepaid

03:21:56.700 --> 03:22:01.180
data for, I mean, the, for the LM to use. So, so for

03:22:01.180 --> 03:22:03.800
example, if I'm a customer, I will be sharing a lot of data.

03:22:03.880 --> 03:22:06.780
Like it would be the PPT. It would be in the phone. PDF and

03:22:06.780 --> 03:22:09.760
all this stuff. It has a lot of like OCR text and all this

03:22:09.760 --> 03:22:13.380
stuff, just want some tool for them to use it so that they

03:22:13.380 --> 03:22:16.820
can just upload that. And it converts into markdown and it

03:22:16.820 --> 03:22:19.820
understands the best one, the best one, which I can suggest

03:22:19.820 --> 03:22:22.660
to you is a Google document AI, the best one, ultimate one.

03:22:22.740 --> 03:22:25.640
So whether you have maybe a table or maybe any kind of

03:22:25.640 --> 03:22:29.080
images inside it, or any kind of, uh, you know, uh, like a

03:22:29.080 --> 03:22:31.820
split of the paragraph or maybe a layout, a different,

03:22:31.880 --> 03:22:33.640
different kind of layout into a different document, for

03:22:33.640 --> 03:22:35.780
example, a research paper. So there'll be a different,

03:22:35.820 --> 03:22:39.740
different. Yeah. But can we run it on local to go see one of

03:22:39.740 --> 03:22:42.320
the concern the team has that they don't want the lake. So

03:22:42.320 --> 03:22:45.140
that's why we want something to deploy. If you're looking

03:22:45.140 --> 03:22:47.620
for local, it is not going to be the best because if you're

03:22:47.620 --> 03:22:52.340
trying to document intelligence from SEO, that is good. But

03:22:52.340 --> 03:22:55.340
that was the concern, which is my IT team said, no, we can't

03:22:55.340 --> 03:22:57.640
use anything. Exactly. It will not be able to pass

03:22:57.640 --> 03:23:00.560
everything. I'm easily like a table kind of a structure or

03:23:00.560 --> 03:23:02.920
maybe a image and inside that if there is a caption, which

03:23:02.920 --> 03:23:06.000
has been written a majority of time on maybe a formulas. It

03:23:06.000 --> 03:23:06.740
will not be able to parse everything. It will not be able to

03:23:06.740 --> 03:23:10.680
understand. So you have to use the something which is, uh,

03:23:10.820 --> 03:23:14.020
is there something like, like I know that there's Lama

03:23:14.020 --> 03:23:16.940
power. So can we run it on local? Do you have any idea on

03:23:16.940 --> 03:23:20.620
Lama Lama Lama power? So this is again, one of them for like

03:23:20.620 --> 03:23:25.580
a new one from Lama Lama bars. Yes. So like there's a dock

03:23:25.580 --> 03:23:27.880
link, which, which I'm using as a dock link, which is also,

03:23:27.900 --> 03:23:31.720
it's like only like Lama pass. I have never used it, but

03:23:31.720 --> 03:23:34.360
yeah, Google document AI, I have used it so many times, so I

03:23:34.360 --> 03:23:37.760
can maybe tell you. Okay. Lama pass. I don't know what

03:23:37.760 --> 03:23:39.680
they're using under the hood, but I don't think that you

03:23:39.680 --> 03:23:42.420
will be able to run it inside the local. That's the thing.

03:23:42.460 --> 03:23:46.080
So I'm using right now, so all that's giving, but I was just

03:23:46.080 --> 03:23:48.120
thinking, is there anything better than that? Because

03:23:48.120 --> 03:23:51.120
they're also, you need to write a lot of coding. So Google,

03:23:51.240 --> 03:23:55.240
Google document AI, it's literally, I'm going to say no to

03:23:55.240 --> 03:24:00.060
that as your Google and all those, because you know, that

03:24:00.060 --> 03:24:04.060
data is a very critical, so they don't know. Okay. Google.

03:24:04.060 --> 03:24:07.300
Google is providing you the enough security, I believe. So

03:24:07.300 --> 03:24:09.880
why people are worried about like a security, if they're

03:24:09.880 --> 03:24:12.940
using a Google. They didn't to take a lot of permission and

03:24:12.940 --> 03:24:16.700
all anyways, I will make, I wasn't able to myself satisfied.

03:24:16.780 --> 03:24:21.520
Oh, this is safe. Right. So how could I? Okay. Anyway, sir.

03:24:21.580 --> 03:24:24.600
So just one more last thing, then I can give you to other,

03:24:24.660 --> 03:24:28.680
sir. I'm also going through your MCP of that, that, that

03:24:28.680 --> 03:24:32.180
course. So, sir, one place where I've stuck, because I don't

03:24:32.180 --> 03:24:35.120
know whether you have updated that assignment greater, that

03:24:35.120 --> 03:24:39.180
code later with the one you have trained on, like, can you

03:24:39.180 --> 03:24:41.440
see, because I've tried to copy paste exactly the same

03:24:41.440 --> 03:24:44.700
thing, but still it's giving me some error. I don't know. So

03:24:44.700 --> 03:24:47.240
I don't know. Maybe you want to revise your code or shall I

03:24:47.240 --> 03:24:50.260
maybe worse than mismatch or something? Because when I had

03:24:50.260 --> 03:24:52.360
created that one, so maybe I have installed a different

03:24:52.360 --> 03:24:55.180
version and your system, it's a different version that, that

03:24:55.180 --> 03:24:57.560
could be the major issue apart from that. I don't share that

03:24:57.560 --> 03:25:01.040
doubt in next class. If you can share that, you can share

03:25:01.040 --> 03:25:03.820
that. You can ping me in a group saying that, okay, fine. So

03:25:03.820 --> 03:25:06.440
I'm facing this issue. I'll just check that one from my

03:25:06.440 --> 03:25:08.720
side. So I already have it on GitHub so I can share it

03:25:08.720 --> 03:25:10.960
because it's giving me problem and running on render

03:25:10.960 --> 03:25:14.060
actually not here because it's not able to take both front

03:25:14.060 --> 03:25:17.400
end and back end. I don't know whether I haven't exposed the

03:25:17.400 --> 03:25:20.220
keys there. I just want to understand, do we need to expose

03:25:20.220 --> 03:25:23.580
that because you have also mentioned that you need to expose

03:25:23.580 --> 03:25:27.880
the keys in the app, the PY rather than I've kept it

03:25:27.880 --> 03:25:30.400
separately. Maybe that would be the reason. I don't know.

03:25:31.060 --> 03:25:33.800
But yeah. Even if you are trying to deploy on a render. So

03:25:33.800 --> 03:25:37.700
there is an option to put a key. It's not taking, it's

03:25:37.700 --> 03:25:40.100
taking my backend, but it's not taking my front end. Like

03:25:40.100 --> 03:25:42.820
something is happening like that because they are saying you

03:25:42.820 --> 03:25:45.540
have to upload both the files. You need to run that. So that

03:25:45.540 --> 03:25:48.480
part is a bit confusing for me. Ping me, ping me the error

03:25:48.480 --> 03:25:51.680
that you are getting. Yeah. I think it's a very small issue

03:25:51.680 --> 03:25:54.600
or maybe let's have a discussion tomorrow. We'll fix it here

03:25:54.600 --> 03:25:56.340
itself. Thank you. Thanks. Yeah.

03:25:59.160 --> 03:26:02.640
So next one is Sadiq. Please share your screen. Then Arun,

03:26:02.700 --> 03:26:04.760
you can share the screen. Okay. And in between, let me take

03:26:04.760 --> 03:26:08.060
some questions. So yeah. Prabhat, go ahead with your

03:26:08.060 --> 03:26:12.840
question, please. Yes. Hi, students. So I don't need to

03:26:12.840 --> 03:26:16.560
share my screen. Basically I have two doubts. Okay. Actually

03:26:16.560 --> 03:26:21.900
we are using like a lot of vector DV, right? So I'm just

03:26:21.900 --> 03:26:24.920
wondering in case like I am having a production grade

03:26:24.920 --> 03:26:28.660
project that I'm going to implement. So the best choice and

03:26:28.660 --> 03:26:32.720
what will the criteria to choose them? So. So. So the very

03:26:32.720 --> 03:26:36.860
first criteria for me is going to be a pricing part that

03:26:36.860 --> 03:26:39.460
what is their pricing model because vector DV wise almost

03:26:39.460 --> 03:26:42.060
everyone is giving you the same thing. They are not like a

03:26:42.060 --> 03:26:45.500
very different, I will say conceptually there is no

03:26:45.500 --> 03:26:48.600
differences as simple as that conceptually there will be

03:26:48.600 --> 03:26:50.580
very less differences that you will be able to find out.

03:26:50.640 --> 03:26:55.080
Almost everyone is giving you every kind of flexibility even

03:26:55.080 --> 03:26:58.100
comparison wise. So you will not be able to find out like a

03:26:58.100 --> 03:27:05.220
significant gap in between. So just like a go ahead with

03:27:05.220 --> 03:27:08.320
anyone, but yeah, so pricing is the very first thing that

03:27:08.320 --> 03:27:13.140
you should like check in a very first place. So for URI

03:27:13.140 --> 03:27:16.320
Avni, so what we are exactly using for the vector DV part.

03:27:16.480 --> 03:27:19.080
For URI and Avni vector DV is not required where vector DV

03:27:19.080 --> 03:27:21.120
is required because we are not storing. We don't have to

03:27:21.120 --> 03:27:23.380
store any data, right? In terms of where we have to do a

03:27:23.380 --> 03:27:28.420
semantic search for job, actually for job portal that you

03:27:28.420 --> 03:27:31.620
are able to see their vector DV was required. Okay. So we

03:27:31.620 --> 03:27:34.380
are using MongoDB for a vector DB. MongoDB is also giving

03:27:34.380 --> 03:27:37.080
you a vector MongoDB by default MongoDB is a document

03:27:37.080 --> 03:27:40.740
database, but last year, so they have also launched a vector

03:27:40.740 --> 03:27:44.740
DB concept inside a MongoDB itself. And we have been using a

03:27:44.740 --> 03:27:47.580
MongoDB for our entire stack. So we actually went with a

03:27:47.580 --> 03:27:52.560
MongoDB vector space. Got it. So, so in the, in the case of,

03:27:52.600 --> 03:27:55.240
so mostly what we are doing right now is using the free

03:27:55.240 --> 03:27:58.020
version. So my issue is when we are upgrading into the

03:27:58.020 --> 03:28:01.140
production version, so how we will like know which

03:28:01.140 --> 03:28:04.360
particular like space will be like appropriate for the

03:28:04.360 --> 03:28:08.340
particular project, for example, like maybe so that, that is

03:28:08.340 --> 03:28:11.680
about some idea that I want to ask, like how exactly you

03:28:11.680 --> 03:28:15.020
choose the tiers of the, like the vector DV or like we have

03:28:15.020 --> 03:28:18.100
to upgrade so we can give such as into the business. So,

03:28:18.140 --> 03:28:20.040
okay, fine. So you are talking about the price calculation

03:28:20.040 --> 03:28:23.540
by the way, right? Okay. Fine. So which, which instances we

03:28:23.540 --> 03:28:25.700
are supposed to use or which one we are, we are not supposed

03:28:25.700 --> 03:28:31.380
to use. Right. Yes. Okay. So just first of all, try to

03:28:31.380 --> 03:28:33.720
estimate the number of a client that, okay, fine. So number

03:28:33.720 --> 03:28:36.000
of people who is going to use your database on a daily

03:28:36.000 --> 03:28:39.140
basis. That's the first part. Second part is how much data

03:28:39.140 --> 03:28:42.200
you are going to store means how much number of a record or

03:28:42.200 --> 03:28:45.620
what is the size of the record you are going to like store

03:28:45.620 --> 03:28:50.040
over there. And then you have to basically estimate that,

03:28:50.100 --> 03:28:53.320
okay, so how much catching you are able to perform with

03:28:53.320 --> 03:28:55.480
respect to these search operation, because again, catching

03:28:55.480 --> 03:28:59.480
like plays a multiple vital role. In terms of building a

03:28:59.480 --> 03:29:01.300
real time application, which is going to decrease your

03:29:01.300 --> 03:29:04.720
number of hits on a final databases and then how many

03:29:04.720 --> 03:29:06.720
reasons you are going to solve. So whether you are building

03:29:06.720 --> 03:29:09.600
an application just for India or maybe outside India and

03:29:09.600 --> 03:29:12.420
what should be the expectation expectation of the latency.

03:29:12.740 --> 03:29:16.340
Now once you will be having all of this data, try to put

03:29:16.340 --> 03:29:19.820
those data into a chat GPT and say that, that, okay, fine.

03:29:19.940 --> 03:29:22.900
So I'm trying to spin the cluster. Now what should be the

03:29:22.900 --> 03:29:25.820
bare minimum size of the cluster on AWS or maybe on GCP or

03:29:25.820 --> 03:29:29.100
maybe on a like Azure or maybe. I'm. And which, what kind of

03:29:29.100 --> 03:29:31.780
instances I'm supposed to take, which is going to support

03:29:31.780 --> 03:29:34.820
bare minimum. These main number of users, these main number

03:29:34.820 --> 03:29:37.920
of hits on a daily basis, or maybe per second, right? Even

03:29:37.920 --> 03:29:39.760
per second, you can try to give that that's completely fine

03:29:39.760 --> 03:29:42.740
with this much number of the, this much amount of data. It

03:29:42.740 --> 03:29:45.180
will give you the full estimation. This is how we do the

03:29:45.180 --> 03:29:48.380
estimation nowadays previously we had a calc. So even we

03:29:48.380 --> 03:29:50.900
have our own tables where we try to put up all those like a

03:29:50.900 --> 03:29:53.440
data and based on that we try to do the calculation. But

03:29:53.440 --> 03:29:56.320
yeah, I believe now we have a chat GPT and chat GPT is

03:29:56.320 --> 03:29:59.320
having a global calculation. Understanding. It will be able

03:29:59.320 --> 03:30:01.720
to give you that. Okay, fine. So go with the micro T2, T1 or

03:30:01.720 --> 03:30:06.320
something like that, or maybe X large. I got it. So this is

03:30:06.320 --> 03:30:08.280
the understanding that I need. And this is my second

03:30:08.280 --> 03:30:11.700
question for the URI. So you are basically built it to using

03:30:11.700 --> 03:30:16.060
month, right? Month stack. Month stack. Month stack. Month

03:30:16.060 --> 03:30:18.680
stack. The complete stack that we are using in a Euron is a

03:30:18.680 --> 03:30:22.540
month stack. Yeah. So basically in URI, we don't need any

03:30:22.540 --> 03:30:26.560
RAG related stuff in that. Yes. How we, how we are handling

03:30:26.560 --> 03:30:27.900
the upload. Yeah. How we are handling the documents and

03:30:27.900 --> 03:30:31.580
asking question on URI. So basically we, okay. So in terms

03:30:31.580 --> 03:30:34.880
of a document upload RAG means what RAG means, you are

03:30:34.880 --> 03:30:39.000
basically storing your entire things into a vector database

03:30:39.000 --> 03:30:42.280
and then whenever someone is going to query, so then it will

03:30:42.280 --> 03:30:45.940
go inside the vector DB first, try to bring the chunks and

03:30:45.940 --> 03:30:48.960
then combine it with the query sent to LMS, right? This is

03:30:48.960 --> 03:30:51.880
what, this is what you're trying to do in general, right now

03:30:51.880 --> 03:30:55.500
in case of a document. So we are not sending it to any

03:30:55.500 --> 03:30:58.200
databases. We are trying to keep it inside the cache inside

03:30:58.200 --> 03:31:01.380
the memory itself. By the time you will, we will try to chat

03:31:01.380 --> 03:31:04.860
with that document and then we are trying to delete it. And

03:31:04.860 --> 03:31:07.260
when you are trying to fire the query, so we are just doing

03:31:07.260 --> 03:31:11.820
a semantic search over there. That's it. Okay. Got it. Okay.

03:31:11.940 --> 03:31:14.660
No storage into a vector DB. We are not using a vector DB.

03:31:15.620 --> 03:31:18.420
We are not studying because we know that that if people will

03:31:18.420 --> 03:31:21.560
keep uploading that like a document inside the vector DB, it

03:31:21.560 --> 03:31:23.620
is going to give us a lot of costs because there was a

03:31:23.620 --> 03:31:25.860
previous version of vector. The previous version of a URI

03:31:25.860 --> 03:31:29.280
and we have already done that. And that has given me a huge

03:31:29.280 --> 03:31:31.740
amount of cost in a particular month. And I think we have

03:31:31.740 --> 03:31:34.020
beared that cost for two to three months continuously. So

03:31:34.020 --> 03:31:37.060
where we were storing all the document and if you are aware

03:31:37.060 --> 03:31:39.900
about the previous version of URI, so we were even showing

03:31:39.900 --> 03:31:42.160
you on a side tab, we were even showing you the document,

03:31:42.300 --> 03:31:44.440
whatever document that you upload, right? So we were showing

03:31:44.440 --> 03:31:46.060
you that, okay, fine. So you have uploaded this document,

03:31:46.140 --> 03:31:48.960
this document, this document. Now we are not doing it

03:31:48.960 --> 03:31:51.300
because we have just removed the vector DB. It was a very,

03:31:51.340 --> 03:31:53.720
very costly operation for us in terms of storing it. Okay.

03:31:54.920 --> 03:31:57.540
Okay. Got it. Because like in my co-organization, I have to

03:31:57.540 --> 03:32:02.580
build something related to URI. But yes, I want to. So that

03:32:02.580 --> 03:32:04.360
doesn't like, doesn't mean that you have to store

03:32:04.360 --> 03:32:07.520
everything. So see, whenever you are looking for a

03:32:07.520 --> 03:32:10.460
persistence of the data for the very long time, then attach

03:32:10.460 --> 03:32:14.520
a vector DB, right? Otherwise you can directly do a semantic

03:32:14.520 --> 03:32:19.480
search with the document itself. Okay. So like when we are

03:32:19.480 --> 03:32:21.820
deleting it, for example, if they want to see the history,

03:32:21.960 --> 03:32:24.560
if I go back and want to see the history. They will not find

03:32:24.560 --> 03:32:26.820
it. Right. If you're like, we have to delete it. Yeah. So

03:32:26.820 --> 03:32:29.240
basically in 24 hours to 48 hours. So it will be removed.

03:32:29.940 --> 03:32:32.440
Okay. We have to mention that to our customer or business,

03:32:32.640 --> 03:32:35.080
this is something that we can put. Yeah. If your customer

03:32:35.080 --> 03:32:37.260
would like to persist it permanently, then persist it, store

03:32:37.260 --> 03:32:40.380
it, right? So it's not like you have to store it into a

03:32:40.380 --> 03:32:42.340
vector DB. So let's suppose they are just interested into a

03:32:42.340 --> 03:32:45.460
document, for example, in our cases. So you will be able to

03:32:45.460 --> 03:32:48.240
find a document even after a week, right? So we are not

03:32:48.240 --> 03:32:50.360
technically storing those documents into a vector database.

03:32:50.520 --> 03:32:52.960
We are actually storing those things into a S3 bucket. So it

03:32:52.960 --> 03:32:55.660
means whatever original document that you have, we are just

03:32:55.660 --> 03:32:58.320
keeping it as it is without any kind of embeddings or

03:32:58.320 --> 03:33:04.220
anything. Okay. We are doing S3 storage, simple, right? So

03:33:04.220 --> 03:33:07.640
in URI, in case of URI, even if you'll come after one week

03:33:07.640 --> 03:33:09.660
and if you'll try to search your document, you will be able

03:33:09.660 --> 03:33:13.260
to find the document. How? Not from a cache, not from a

03:33:13.260 --> 03:33:16.760
memory, right? Because we are storing your document into S3.

03:33:16.820 --> 03:33:19.240
So by the time you are going to click, it loads a document

03:33:19.240 --> 03:33:22.660
again from a S3, which is our least costliest operation. In

03:33:22.660 --> 03:33:26.880
terms of a price for us. And if we are storing your whole

03:33:26.880 --> 03:33:28.800
document, let's suppose you have uploaded a 400 page of

03:33:28.800 --> 03:33:31.240
document and if we are creating embeddings and we are

03:33:31.240 --> 03:33:34.200
storing into a vectors, just imagine how many tokens we are

03:33:34.200 --> 03:33:38.340
burning again and again. So Sudhan, so if I ask the question

03:33:38.340 --> 03:33:42.080
to the document, for example, a 400 page PDF or Node.js

03:33:42.080 --> 03:33:45.700
document I uploaded, so, and ask some questions related to

03:33:45.700 --> 03:33:49.300
from the document. So you are sending entire PDF data with

03:33:49.300 --> 03:33:51.380
the prompt to LLM to get the data. Yeah.

03:33:54.820 --> 03:33:57.540
We are not doing a checking over there because it's a, it's

03:33:57.540 --> 03:33:59.860
the costliest one and barely people will do it. Right. So,

03:33:59.860 --> 03:34:03.060
and again, it is, it is going to increase even a latency.

03:34:03.280 --> 03:34:05.460
And if you have to decrease the latency, so we have to

03:34:05.460 --> 03:34:07.840
increase the instance size. And if you are increasing the

03:34:07.840 --> 03:34:10.140
instance size in simply means that increasing the cost for

03:34:10.140 --> 03:34:13.480
us. Okay. Because I need to build something, right? This

03:34:13.480 --> 03:34:16.780
gave me a mind map for how I can design it. So because we

03:34:16.780 --> 03:34:19.400
have also building URI, but at the end of this like

03:34:19.400 --> 03:34:22.140
bootcamp, right. But I don't have that time much right now.

03:34:23.720 --> 03:34:27.520
Any, any, how I'm going to teach you how to build URI. So if

03:34:27.520 --> 03:34:30.080
we, in the previous bootcamp, we have already built URI, so

03:34:30.080 --> 03:34:32.300
I can take it. No, I have not discussed over there. Project

03:34:32.300 --> 03:34:35.320
was different here. Project is different. Okay. We got it.

03:34:35.360 --> 03:34:38.560
So first we are like discussing all the architecture, then

03:34:38.560 --> 03:34:40.400
we are going to build it. Right. Obviously step-by-step

03:34:40.400 --> 03:34:42.740
because the big system, right. So step-by-step will go, it

03:34:42.740 --> 03:34:48.980
will take time. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks. Yeah. Okay. Who

03:34:48.980 --> 03:34:50.940
is sharing a screen? I think Sarik is sharing a screen.

03:34:51.060 --> 03:34:54.060
Yeah. Sarik. What is your question? I don't know what this

03:34:54.060 --> 03:35:00.700
is coming. This has been installed. Okay. All the code. You

03:35:00.700 --> 03:35:05.080
are using Python 3.13, decrease it, downgrade it to 3.10. It

03:35:05.080 --> 03:35:07.680
will work. If you have any other kernel, which you have

03:35:07.680 --> 03:35:13.840
installed, just try to use that kernel 3.10. Just click on

03:35:13.840 --> 03:35:15.920
select another kernel. If you have any other kernel, use it.

03:35:15.980 --> 03:35:21.900
Otherwise configure one. Yeah. It's not working. Yeah. No,

03:35:21.980 --> 03:35:23.640
no, it is working. Give me a remote control.

03:35:41.340 --> 03:35:47.840
3.7, 3.10. You have right now 3.10 and let's do the

03:35:47.840 --> 03:35:49.220
installation in 3.10.

03:35:53.850 --> 03:35:56.990
Unfortunately, my electricity has been gone from my side. So

03:35:56.990 --> 03:36:01.090
I'm not able to continue the lecture. I'll cover up. Sorry.

03:36:01.150 --> 03:36:04.930
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I think your voice is not clear. It's

03:36:04.930 --> 03:36:11.270
audible now. Yeah. It's audible. Yeah. It's audible. Okay.

03:36:40.790 --> 03:36:42.190
You

03:36:50.760 --> 03:36:57.660
don't need a remote control on the side anymore. down at the

03:36:57.660 --> 03:37:04.220
bottom of the, only that has not been executed. Okay. Only

03:37:04.220 --> 03:37:06.140
that line. Right. Okay. But we have changed the kernel,

03:37:06.260 --> 03:37:09.580
right? So we have to execute it from the beginning. Yeah. So

03:37:09.580 --> 03:37:13.900
kernel kernel itself has been changed. So we can't, you

03:37:18.860 --> 03:37:23.140
know, the kernel is

03:37:23.140 --> 03:37:27.460
going to die. Sorry. Sorry. I think you're sorry. Your voice

03:37:27.460 --> 03:37:29.780
is breaking. I believe, I think it's the same for everyone.

03:37:29.860 --> 03:37:34.500
Right guys. Sorry. His voice is not clear. Yes. Yes. Yeah.

03:37:34.620 --> 03:37:36.320
So sorry. There is some issue with the voice.

03:37:49.040 --> 03:37:49.740
So, yeah,

03:37:52.780 --> 03:37:56.500
better actually. Yes. Yes. Yes. Actually maybe some, my

03:37:56.500 --> 03:37:59.160
problem is there. Okay. Yeah. No, not tell me. Sorry. Yeah.

03:37:59.220 --> 03:38:05.680
You are. Yeah. Notification was coming back. This kernel is

03:38:05.680 --> 03:38:09.860
going to die and some, some kind of, no, maybe, maybe

03:38:09.860 --> 03:38:12.680
because of overload, maybe generally is so color dye issue

03:38:12.680 --> 03:38:15.620
happens because of the memory issue. So maybe if you have a

03:38:15.620 --> 03:38:18.040
limited memory inside your system, so because of that,

03:38:18.160 --> 03:38:20.960
right. Generally that that's the only issue for a kernel

03:38:20.960 --> 03:38:24.620
dying memory is the issue, right? So the only show when you

03:38:24.620 --> 03:38:28.400
go down. Okay. Okay. Maybe by that time. So yeah, memory

03:38:28.400 --> 03:38:32.760
will be full. It is still installing the, so that is the

03:38:32.760 --> 03:38:34.480
only issue. Maybe you can try to close all the other

03:38:34.480 --> 03:38:36.520
application and then you can try to restart. It will work

03:38:36.520 --> 03:38:39.160
because there is no other issue. If Colonel died issue we

03:38:39.160 --> 03:38:41.640
are facing. Okay. Okay. Fine, sir. So, okay. Okay. Okay.

03:38:41.640 --> 03:38:41.640
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

03:38:41.640 --> 03:38:44.600
You can, you can take some other one whether that's going to

03:38:44.600 --> 03:38:49.140
get you. Yeah. Sure. So Aruna, please share your screen and

03:38:52.160 --> 03:38:56.060
let me see my screen here. Yeah. Let me see my screen now.

03:38:56.940 --> 03:38:59.460
Yes. I can see your screen. It's appearing. Yeah, now I can

03:38:59.460 --> 03:39:04.520
see. Yes. Yes. a year later having some kernel same kernel,

03:39:04.580 --> 03:39:10.100
but when I is just to reload that it is kernel to a 3.1, 2.

03:39:11.000 --> 03:39:18.940
earlier 3.1713 so i'm getting this error now collection add

03:39:18.940 --> 03:39:22.020
god and respect argument embeddings no so you have to

03:39:22.020 --> 03:39:23.940
execute from the beginning so execute it from the beginning

03:39:23.940 --> 03:39:27.400
yeah there's no issue at all this

03:39:29.410 --> 03:39:33.210
is fine now next next next so is fine so is not required

03:39:33.210 --> 03:39:38.310
yeah the next do do shift enter shift enter shift enters

03:39:38.310 --> 03:39:42.610
what hand okay and shift enter so yeah shift enter shift

03:39:42.610 --> 03:39:44.390
enter again shift

03:39:50.820 --> 03:39:55.460
enter or control enter is a shorthand by the way now it's

03:39:55.460 --> 03:39:57.800
calling the embedding yeah it's

03:40:16.490 --> 03:40:21.770
fine uh restoring the collection now execute like embeddings

03:40:21.770 --> 03:40:24.190
no no you have not executed this one embeddings one right

03:40:25.590 --> 03:40:29.810
embedding one embeddings one yeah this one yeah execute

03:40:29.810 --> 03:40:31.210
embeddings

03:40:57.360 --> 03:41:01.080
one zero element is getting you you you and this one is no

03:41:01.080 --> 03:41:05.040
just give me give me remote control yeah okay

03:41:41.450 --> 03:41:45.550
collection already exists that was the issue so just make it

03:41:45.550 --> 03:41:48.970
uh rename it collection collection name should not be

03:41:48.970 --> 03:41:53.950
duplicate okay now if i'm executing this collection uh

03:41:53.950 --> 03:42:00.330
collection one one let's suppose so fine this is done no

03:42:00.330 --> 03:42:05.950
error at all and then collection okay so we have created two

03:42:05.950 --> 03:42:19.470
two right or the

03:42:24.620 --> 03:42:42.040
previous cell

03:42:42.040 --> 03:42:45.200
please review the code code and if I the possible cause of

03:42:45.200 --> 03:42:46.840
here click here

03:43:06.900 --> 03:43:08.920
not

03:43:18.550 --> 03:43:20.450
able to send let

03:43:25.410 --> 03:43:26.790
me downgrade to

03:43:43.500 --> 03:43:47.340
this is due to kernel issue only right that yeah this is

03:43:47.340 --> 03:43:50.920
this is the kernel issue so sometime with respect to even a

03:43:50.920 --> 03:43:58.760
python version right it may give you okay actually I see

03:43:58.760 --> 03:44:02.620
with the latest version we're getting few issues so solid

03:44:02.620 --> 03:44:09.180
tech with 3.7 3.6 3.3.10 is a perfect version as of now for

03:44:09.180 --> 03:44:13.100
python for any application any application yeah yeah 3.10 is

03:44:13.100 --> 03:44:19.340
the best one subversion it is 3.10.0 3. just put 3.10 it

03:44:19.340 --> 03:44:21.720
will take the minor version automatically 3.10 is a major

03:44:21.720 --> 03:44:27.020
version name okay okay sir just 3.10 because we all are

03:44:27.020 --> 03:44:29.400
facing a lot of issues because it's not that compatible

03:44:29.400 --> 03:44:31.600
right the new library at the new version which has been

03:44:31.600 --> 03:44:34.940
released okay so it's always I advise to go ahead with 3.10

03:44:34.940 --> 03:44:41.260
okay so it should not give an issue by the way like if we

03:44:41.260 --> 03:44:48.000
are using 3.10 possible cause what is the log got

03:44:53.960 --> 03:44:56.980
unexpected keyword argument embedding that's fine that was a

03:44:56.980 --> 03:45:02.000
previous zoo error wall died exit code reason disposing

03:45:02.000 --> 03:45:05.400
kernel python.exe yeah this is a python issue

03:45:09.000 --> 03:45:13.140
so just starting the kernel fine process is given fail

03:45:13.140 --> 03:45:16.460
execution it was actually a python version if we are going

03:45:16.460 --> 03:45:18.480
to change the python version right and then let me know I

03:45:18.480 --> 03:45:20.760
don't think that you will get an error okay okay sir I'll

03:45:20.760 --> 03:45:24.660
try my idea because even in log so it is showing the let me

03:45:24.660 --> 03:45:28.540
try with one one I don't think with one one it will be fixed

03:45:28.540 --> 03:45:31.020
but yeah let me give a try my

03:45:33.930 --> 03:45:37.470
side this time kernel is fine okay that's amazing okay so

03:45:37.470 --> 03:45:40.650
someone has been it's just a python version issue and again

03:45:40.650 --> 03:45:42.650
depends upon the system as well because if system

03:45:42.650 --> 03:45:47.150
configuration is low yeah sometime sometime even restart

03:45:47.150 --> 03:45:50.570
will fix your problem this kernel issue okay yeah this is

03:45:50.570 --> 03:45:56.810
just a local issue so okay sir apart from that there is

03:45:56.810 --> 03:46:01.930
while doing the pine code pine cone okay so I was getting on

03:46:01.930 --> 03:46:06.470
that unauthorized something and so I can means your key key

03:46:06.470 --> 03:46:08.650
is having an error then yeah I have tried talking about it

03:46:08.650 --> 03:46:09.430
but it's still there and it doesn't work it's still

03:46:09.430 --> 03:46:10.190
murdering the case and and you know I can I can't find the

03:46:10.190 --> 03:46:11.990
key okay but still there it's still working and you can just

03:46:11.990 --> 03:46:13.030
try it but it's still there yeah okay I will check from my

03:46:13.030 --> 03:46:18.380
side unauthorized means you're

03:46:19.730 --> 03:46:25.890
3.10 yeah restart the kernel kernel is dead yeah yeah I

03:46:25.890 --> 03:46:31.030
should do that okay fine yeah yeah this one from pine code

03:46:31.030 --> 03:46:32.710
pine yeah this one um

03:46:36.260 --> 03:46:41.460
okay so no no no no that's the reason right you are using a

03:46:41.460 --> 03:46:44.180
url key not a pine cone key you should use a pine cone you

03:46:44.180 --> 03:46:47.120
are using a pinecon so it should be pinecon key right okay

03:46:47.120 --> 03:46:51.700
okay yeah i told you right that there is a if authorization

03:46:51.700 --> 03:46:58.300
issue is there then it's a key issue okay okay i was trying

03:46:58.300 --> 03:47:04.660
to yuri key let me log in okay

03:47:09.140 --> 03:47:12.000
so you have not logged in into the pine cone right yeah yeah

03:47:12.000 --> 03:47:16.740
because uh for this one uh i was taking the yuri key and

03:47:16.740 --> 03:47:21.400
trying so no no pinecon is a db right so you have to like

03:47:21.400 --> 03:47:24.700
okay so just fill anything yeah

03:47:29.660 --> 03:47:36.280
now click on create indexes maybe i can give test create

03:47:36.280 --> 03:47:43.280
okay sorry my bad once again i should have chosen the custom

03:47:43.280 --> 03:47:53.100
setting one five three six test one create index connect

03:47:59.340 --> 03:48:05.160
this one is fine now api key wise you can go here create the

03:48:05.160 --> 03:48:10.120
api let's suppose i'm giving name as test copy then

03:48:12.490 --> 03:48:16.750
it will start with pc now

03:48:25.070 --> 03:48:28.710
you can connect now it will not give you issue okay so our

03:48:28.710 --> 03:48:32.710
own story so this is not your index name what is your index

03:48:32.710 --> 03:48:35.190
name by the way so index name that i have created was tested

03:48:35.190 --> 03:48:39.630
yeah yeah yeah yeah so just change that test one yeah

03:48:50.410 --> 03:48:53.090
just change to test one yeah yeah i'll try yeah yeah thank

03:48:53.090 --> 03:48:57.710
you sir so i'll try for my mind and uh yeah yeah thank you

03:48:57.710 --> 03:49:02.130
thank you sir thank you thank you okay next one please narez

03:49:02.130 --> 03:49:10.400
please go to the question yeah hi yeah hi nice uh so when we

03:49:10.400 --> 03:49:14.580
use chroma db we followed uh multi two steps right first one

03:49:14.580 --> 03:49:20.580
is without a client id which means we are not connecting to

03:49:20.580 --> 03:49:24.600
a chroma db cluster or chroma db server right in local local

03:49:24.600 --> 03:49:28.060
basically we are trying to do it yeah so will it be stored

03:49:28.060 --> 03:49:31.500
in the ram or how it is so by default it will be stored

03:49:31.500 --> 03:49:33.760
inside the ram if you would like to post it inside the hard

03:49:33.760 --> 03:49:38.720
disk so again you can try to call save okay uh fine and uh

03:49:38.720 --> 03:49:42.520
my second question is uh so some of the dbs i have seen they

03:49:42.520 --> 03:49:46.440
are open source like deviant is giving uh their source code

03:49:46.440 --> 03:49:50.300
in the github right mm-hmm if we if we install them then we

03:49:50.300 --> 03:49:54.200
no need to uh you know for scaling we no need to purchase

03:49:54.200 --> 03:49:57.780
their plans is it uh how so you don't have to purchase their

03:49:57.780 --> 03:50:01.440
plans but again you will have to purchase a some platform on

03:50:01.440 --> 03:50:05.820
a cloud right yeah yeah so cloud charges i have to bear yeah

03:50:05.820 --> 03:50:09.080
you have to bear plus you have to even manage basically so

03:50:09.080 --> 03:50:11.860
you have to hire some devops guy and then you have to manage

03:50:11.860 --> 03:50:15.160
those db because at any point of a time anything can be can

03:50:15.160 --> 03:50:18.420
go for the like a toss you have to maintain a log basically

03:50:18.420 --> 03:50:21.280
for those databases that's the reason so they provide you

03:50:21.280 --> 03:50:23.200
they are selling their services so that you don't have to do

03:50:23.200 --> 03:50:26.960
anything so in your experience like uh which is which is

03:50:26.960 --> 03:50:31.180
best uh in my experience for a very very extensive use cases

03:50:31.180 --> 03:50:35.000
uh i go with the bear setup means uh we don't use the

03:50:35.000 --> 03:50:39.120
services okay okay it's better to do the installation and

03:50:39.120 --> 03:50:41.800
then do the configuration and do a manage so that you know

03:50:41.800 --> 03:50:45.020
see once you are able to like do the configuration you are

03:50:45.020 --> 03:50:48.100
able to maintain the log monitoring and everything right and

03:50:48.100 --> 03:50:51.080
if you are able to optimize the cost it will run for year on

03:50:51.080 --> 03:50:54.100
year and year on year you will keep on like saving a lot of

03:50:54.100 --> 03:50:58.340
money yeah right my third question is uh right let's say we

03:50:58.340 --> 03:51:02.340
are building a rag application right so as of now we are we

03:51:02.340 --> 03:51:05.780
are seeing one user data we are dumping it to db and we are

03:51:05.780 --> 03:51:10.000
generating the you know we are doing the similarity search

03:51:10.000 --> 03:51:13.240
you know in real time case let's say multiple users are

03:51:13.240 --> 03:51:16.160
there so everyone uses data will be private right so how do

03:51:16.160 --> 03:51:21.100
you segregate and store it like a rag no no this is not a

03:51:21.100 --> 03:51:24.580
core concept behind a rag rag simply means that that let's

03:51:24.580 --> 03:51:27.680
suppose i'm an organization right and inside my organization

03:51:27.680 --> 03:51:30.360
i have a hr policy let's suppose or maybe a financial

03:51:30.360 --> 03:51:33.980
document a lot of like a financial document i have or hr

03:51:33.980 --> 03:51:36.640
policies i have so what i will do as an organization i will

03:51:36.640 --> 03:51:41.120
try to store all of those data into my vector databases so

03:51:41.120 --> 03:51:44.520
that let's suppose you have joined a company right you have

03:51:44.520 --> 03:51:46.960
joined a company and let's suppose you talk you you have to

03:51:46.960 --> 03:51:49.220
like do some sort of a search with respect to hr policy that

03:51:49.220 --> 03:51:52.020
what is the lead policy or what is the maternity policy or

03:51:52.020 --> 03:51:54.800
what is the like some other policies which is available with

03:51:54.800 --> 03:51:58.480
respect to the hr you can as a user you can do a search and

03:51:58.480 --> 03:52:00.980
then all the document is already been stored in the vector

03:52:00.980 --> 03:52:04.020
db where company is all company has already stored based on

03:52:04.020 --> 03:52:07.800
your query it will give you the answer now then in this case

03:52:07.800 --> 03:52:12.160
then let's say you take chargivity's example ChatGPT ask you

03:52:12.160 --> 03:52:17.460
your own PDF and it refers your own PDF and give you the

03:52:17.460 --> 03:52:21.060
answers. But it's more like a summarization. See it's a more

03:52:21.060 --> 03:52:23.540
like a summarization. Let's suppose in my organization I

03:52:23.540 --> 03:52:26.520
have thousands of document. So again and again I can't

03:52:26.520 --> 03:52:29.580
upload a document to a ChatGPT right, thousand documents for

03:52:29.580 --> 03:52:34.320
every user. See maybe even now all the HR document will be

03:52:34.320 --> 03:52:37.920
available to all the employees. So basically you have to go,

03:52:38.020 --> 03:52:40.860
you have to search the document. Then inside a document you

03:52:40.860 --> 03:52:43.600
have to search that clause, whatever you are looking for,

03:52:43.660 --> 03:52:45.640
whatever is your area of interest. Let's suppose I have a

03:52:45.640 --> 03:52:47.640
thousand page of document and likewise I have 10,000

03:52:47.640 --> 03:52:50.840
documents, right. So as a, and let's suppose that document

03:52:50.840 --> 03:52:53.120
is already available because it's by default HR document

03:52:53.120 --> 03:52:56.820
will be available to me, right. If it is, if it, if I'm not

03:52:56.820 --> 03:52:59.100
privileged to access it, obviously it will be private to me,

03:52:59.160 --> 03:53:01.860
but yeah, by default HR document will be available to me. So

03:53:01.860 --> 03:53:07.300
just to make my query efficient, just to make my life like a

03:53:07.300 --> 03:53:11.220
bit relaxed. So what I will do, I'll try to store all of

03:53:11.220 --> 03:53:14.000
those document into the VectorDB and you as a user will be

03:53:14.000 --> 03:53:16.260
able to come with your query and then you can search it. In

03:53:16.260 --> 03:53:18.120
case of ChatGPT example that you are giving, right,

03:53:18.240 --> 03:53:20.540
documents are already available to you. Thousand documents

03:53:20.540 --> 03:53:23.860
with a thousand pages. So again and again, every user will

03:53:23.860 --> 03:53:26.080
try to upload those thousand document with a thousand pages

03:53:26.080 --> 03:53:32.280
on a ChatGPT every day, right. Or maybe like every time

03:53:32.280 --> 03:53:34.880
whenever you're looking for the query. So just to avoid

03:53:34.880 --> 03:53:38.000
those lengthy process and those repetitive process. Correct.

03:53:38.300 --> 03:53:40.460
So what I will do from my own side, I'll hold it inside my

03:53:40.460 --> 03:53:44.360
VectorDB and then you as a user can come and then like just

03:53:44.360 --> 03:53:49.680
chat it, chat with it. This is where the real application of

03:53:49.680 --> 03:53:56.600
RAG comes into a picture. Understood. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So

03:53:56.600 --> 03:54:00.360
yeah. Thank you. Next one is Armaan. Go ahead with a

03:54:00.360 --> 03:54:02.920
question. Amit, go ahead with a question.

03:54:07.090 --> 03:54:12.140
Yeah. Anyone? Okay. Fine guys. So if no one is having

03:54:12.140 --> 03:54:14.320
questions, so thank you so much. We're in this class and

03:54:14.320 --> 03:54:17.920
tomorrow again, we have a class, application discussions

03:54:17.920 --> 03:54:20.660
we'll be having tomorrow. With that, thank you so much

03:54:20.660 --> 03:54:23.000
everyone. Take care and see you again in an upcoming lecture

03:54:23.000 --> 03:54:25.660
tomorrow. Same time. Thank you. Thanks everyone. Thanks

03:54:25.660 --> 03:54:25.940
everyone. Take care.
