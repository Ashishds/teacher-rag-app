WEBVTT

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.900
okay so hi everyone uh good morning i think i'm audible and

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.020
visible to all of you please confirm guys if i'm audible and

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.300
visible yeah okay

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:49.430
fine so i'm audible and visible so guys in today's class

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:51.770
i'll not take much of your time so basically we'll be

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:55.830
talking about a lot of like aws services uh basically like

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:59.290
uh we'll see like what in all aws services which is

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:04.090
available in terms of doing a model access maybe a knowledge

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:08.470
base rag's agent creation and uh yeah even for a deployment

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.430
so there are a lot of services which is available and

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:13.790
generally we feel confused and again from a intro

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:16.310
perspective so i think it's important and going forward uh

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:19.310
next week so we'll be looking into a project so a project

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:22.110
section that we have so where we have to cover like a

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:26.070
multiple projects so over there we'll be using this aws

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:30.250
services so let me share my screen quickly and uh let's

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:34.790
start talking about this aws services so yesterday we were

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:38.830
talking about one of the service and we have seen that that

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:42.570
how we can try to uh basically deploy any kind of a solution

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:46.970
with our own custom uh url right or with our own custom

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:50.510
domain and over there so we have used route 53 uh

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:54.590
technically right so to map a domain and to map our

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:58.470
resources and to map basically like to create an entire end

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:01.490
-to-end flow this is what we have done so now in today's

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:04.450
class uh let's go and let's try to explore a couple of like

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:07.990
uh more services so what i will do i'll try to log in into a

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:12.830
aws console and along with me so all of you can try to you

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:17.910
know log in into a aws console now inside aws there are so

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:21.350
many services that you all will be able to find out uh very

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.390
first service i would like to show you is called as amazon

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.990
bedrock so let's go ahead and let's try to explore that

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:31.690
amazon bedrock so you can come over here you can try to

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:35.010
search for uh amazon bedrock and it is going to give you

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:40.230
this link so it's simple right so technically what amazon

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.570
bedrock is so amazon bedrock is basically a platform or you

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:47.290
can say a kind of a service uh managed service provided by

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:51.330
aws so where you will be able to access almost all the

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:54.330
models almost all the model you will be able to access all

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.830
the even latest one you will be able to access initially

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:01.470
when they have launched a very limited model but now if you

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.290
will go and check their model catalog so everything is

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:08.350
available inside amazon bedrock so you can try to consume a

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:13.010
model even from here so here on your left hand side you will

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:16.870
be able to see a multiple like options by the way so here

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:21.570
overview model catalog api key then here they are giving you

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:25.210
a playground then here giving you a inferencing here they

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:27.750
are giving you a fine tuning so you can try to do a model

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:32.350
fine tuning with your own data here itself inside a aws and

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.950
then here they are giving you a build option inside that you

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:38.810
can build agents you can build a flow you can build a

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:41.410
knowledge base you can build a guardrail you can build a

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:44.910
prompt management data automation so all of these things you

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:49.450
will be able to do it with this one but let's start with a

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.970
model catalog first and let's try to understand what and all

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:55.430
models are available inside this aws bedrock so model

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:58.490
catalog and like i said so they are giving you almost all

00:11:58.490 --> 00:11:59.910
the model nowadays so everything is available inside this

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:00.910
aws bedrock so you can see that everything is available

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:07.170
inside you know aws a bedrock so here is a provider so

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:11.450
amazon so from amazon itself we have a nova pro nova light

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:15.070
nova micro and we have a embedding model we have a titan

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:18.610
image generator model we have a titan multi-model embedding

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:22.850
and if i'll talk about anthropic so anthropic provides one

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:26.910
of the advanced models so here you will be able to find out

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:27.110
a

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.430
particular model so this is the latest one right latest one

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:39.050
and yeah so it is available over here for cloud is sonet

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.730
model so you will be able to find out one disclaimer so

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:44.930
whenever i'm going to like you know access this model if i

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:48.850
have to access this particular model so i have to fill

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:52.410
couple of details like company detail and what for what uses

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:55.190
for what purpose i'm going to use this particular model then

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:58.090
only they are going to allow me it's not true for all the

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:02.590
other model but a model it is important so it is going to

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:06.410
pop up a form open in playground if i'm going to do so it is

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:09.030
going to pop up this form so where it is asking me company

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:13.050
name company website url what industry you operate in just a

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:16.450
small disclaimer form right for a cloud is on it other model

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:19.170
if i would like to like a use so in that case they are not

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:22.450
going to ask me for that particular one i can simply call a

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:25.790
model and i can try to start chatting with these model

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:32.470
basically right and see yeah so i can come over here and

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:35.490
this is basically a playground that they have given to us so

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:38.250
i can come over here i can start chatting with this model

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:42.930
and then yeah so if this model like seems like a some of

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:46.290
some use for us so yeah we can try to utilize that

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:50.010
particular model this is how like these models are by the

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:54.470
way so almost all the models are available but you will be

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:58.350
like a surprised over here that open ai model is not

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:03.330
available over here and even a gemini model is not available

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:09.350
over here so with whatever organization aws is having a tie

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:13.970
up so only those models are available so bedrock doesn't

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:18.010
mean that that everything is available or everything will be

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:21.030
available yeah so let's suppose if i'm looking for a gemini

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:25.010
model obviously i can't come over here i can't use it so one

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:29.210
of the best model which i think they have is a anthropic

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:34.450
model because the rest of the model is like it's fine to

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:39.430
have those models but maybe like in a real time i will not

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:44.370
be using it when i'm going to solve some of my use case or

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:49.430
my industry problem so this is a place this is a point where

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:55.190
bedrock gives us or comes up with disappointment although we

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:59.450
talk a lot about in a market so we talk a lot about like you

00:14:59.450 --> 00:14:59.610
know

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:07.030
these aws bedrock services but again so this is a place

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:10.910
where it comes with the disappointment by the way right so

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.990
yeah they have they have some good model like a mistral

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:18.390
series also very good okay gpt model wise so they are not

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:22.410
giving you 4.1 or 5 models over here they are giving you

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:26.630
they have hosted basically gpt oss 120b and 20b so even we

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:30.570
have hosted that if you remember on our own gpu so these are

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:35.090
the open source model by open ai so like i said so this is

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:38.010
where it is going to disappoint you in terms of you know

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:41.790
accessing a model you can even try to filter out model by

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.510
list audio model embedding model image model multi model so

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:48.950
text image and all those models and tabular model text text

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:52.470
vision so yeah this is the catalog which is available and

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:55.090
again if something is not available over here it's not

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:58.990
available as simple as that you won't be able to use it very

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:03.610
simple now so api key so you can try to generate an api key

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:06.230
so they are giving you two option over here short term api

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:09.030
key so where you whenever you are going to generate an api

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:12.630
key that will be active for 12 hour this is a disclaimer

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:15.630
that they have already mentioned over here and then there is

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:18.310
a long term api key so again you can try to configure how

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:21.770
long you would like to access that particular api key so

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:25.010
nothing like a different over here so you have to access a

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:29.670
model you can generate the api key and simple so So you can

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:33.470
try to access it. So this is basically like a discover

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.450
section. Now coming to the next section, this is basically a

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:39.910
playground option they have given to you. So here I can just

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:44.250
try to click, I can try to, you know, like a chat, select a

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:48.330
chat over here and then I can select a model. So as per my

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.710
need, I can try to select a model over here. So deep seek,

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:56.930
anthropic, quen, any model which I want, I can try to

00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:00.530
select. But again, options are very limited, as you can see.

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:03.650
So it's not like they're giving you all the options. And

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:07.790
especially if I'll talk about the latest one. So yeah, they

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:10.730
are not giving you that particular option over here. So

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:16.170
whenever we have to use the latest one, go and check if it

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:19.270
is not available. So you won't be able to use it. So here

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:21.570
they have given you a playground kind of a thing. So where

00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:24.870
you can send a message like hi, and then you can start like,

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:28.810
you know, chatting with these people. The models inside this

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:32.390
playground interface itself, right, and then you can maybe

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:35.050
try to click on build and start building it. So similar kind

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:38.070
of a system you will be able to replicate. Here they are

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:40.990
giving you also an option for a system prompt and all the

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.950
other controls. So token length control and randomness

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:47.190
activity, temperature, top p, you can even try to, you know,

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:50.150
attach a guardrails over here. So all these options are

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:53.050
already available. But yeah, it is just a playground, by the

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:56.030
way, it is not more, nothing more than that. So this is

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:58.190
another option. So if you go to the Amazon bedrock, you will

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:00.410
be able to find out again, there is something called as

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:04.410
image playground, right. So where you can go and you can try

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:07.290
to select a model and image playground wise. So there are

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:10.970
only two models which is available over here. So one is a

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:16.090
Titan image generator G1 and yeah, so this one, image model

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:20.710
512 character. So again, this is another option, but not a

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:23.570
good one, right. For example, if you are going to compare

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:27.290
this with a Gemini, like, you know, nano banana, you can see

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:28.490
that this is a nano banana. So you will feel disappointed,

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:32.770
obviously, right. It's not a best model that they have over

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:35.730
here. And that is the reason. So somewhere I don't like

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:40.570
bedrock and like, that's our honest review from like, my

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:44.790
side as a developer that if it was providing something,

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:48.170
obviously, they should provide like each and everything in a

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:51.110
fuller scale, right, which is not available over here. There

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:53.530
is a new option they have included recently, there is

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:55.950
something called as tokenizer. So where you will be able to,

00:18:55.990 --> 00:19:00.030
you know, measure a tokenizer. Okay. So you will be able to

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:03.350
measure all the tokens. So this is where like input output

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:05.890
token, you will be able to measure it and then you will be

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:08.950
able to do a costing on top of that. So this option, again,

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:14.570
like available to all of us, then coming to the next part.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:17.250
So there is a tune part. So here you can try to build your

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:21.490
own custom model, right by using AWS interface itself,

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:27.130
right. So again, like, just just a click based like a fine

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:32.150
tune. You all will be able to do it with respect to AWS. So

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.730
you can come over here, select a model, prepare a data set,

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:37.890
maybe bring a data set from S3. And then eventually you will

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:41.490
be able to prepare or do a fine tuning of the model. And we

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:43.370
have we have already seen that right, we can do a fine

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:48.190
tuning even inside of OpenAI. OpenAI like, so similar kind

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:50.450
of a feature they have given you and you can try to come

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:52.990
over here and you can try to do a fine tuning of the model.

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:57.490
This is another option. Now. So same thing is available over

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:01.310
here. Now let's come to the build part. So here you can come

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:04.450
and you can try to build agents, agents, even multi agent

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:07.630
you can try to build that option is also given inside of AWS

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:10.610
Bedrock. There is something called a knowledge base option,

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:13.730
which is also given to all of us. So where we can try to

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:20.070
build a knowledge base as per my own need. So yeah, let me

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:22.050
show you something.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.980
Yeah. So knowledge base. So knowledge base, which is

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:29.660
available, which we can try to build agent is something that

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:32.440
we can try to build a complete end to end flow UI based

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.800
flow, I will be able to build. So let's go to the agent

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.660
part. And let me show you something over here. So a couple

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:41.940
of agents I have already created just for my like a

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:46.140
practice, right? So create agent and then I can try to give

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:50.080
any kind of a name to my agent. If I want to enable a multi

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.420
agent collaboration, I can try to enable multi agent

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.660
collaboration as well. Otherwise, I can try to create one

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.860
single agent. Meaning of an agent is exactly the same. So

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.720
it's not different at all. Whatever we have learned,

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:05.340
whatever we have studied. So it's the same philosophy, I

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.840
mean, like agent is the same definition wise for all of us.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:12.220
So I can come I can click over here, I can try to create an

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:17.020
agent. So here is my agent name, agent description, if I

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:20.940
would like to give and then basically, every agent requires

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:24.740
a model access, right? So without model agent can't do

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:28.520
anything. Okay. So here we can attach any models which is

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:32.300
like available to us basically from this particular list

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:36.040
itself. Apart from that, I can't attach any other model by

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.380
the way. So I can try to attach it. I can try to give an

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:42.900
instruction that okay, you are basically a manager or maybe

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:46.120
a scientist or whatever, right? Whatever search agent or

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.820
whatever I would like to like, you know, give an instruction

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.880
to this particular agent, I can try to give that instruction

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:56.440
and then I can start testing it over here. Simple. Right. So

00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:01.000
simple UI based agent, like you will be able to find out. So

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.620
if you would like to give a knowledge base access, so you

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:06.300
can try to attach a knowledge base as well. So maybe you can

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:10.180
try to attach a knowledge base from web scrapping or maybe

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.800
from S3 bucket where you are going to upload a document and

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:18.320
then it is like going to consider that knowledge base. So

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:22.880
that option is also available over here. And plus memory.

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:26.600
Obviously, you can try to add. And then you can try to test

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:31.100
agent here itself on your like right hand side. So just chat

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.860
and then chat with the agent and then you can test whether

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:37.800
your agent is behaving good or not. And then you can go with

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:43.200
the next step basically. Bedrock is no code platform, sir.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.880
So yes, you can say if you would like to do some sort of

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:51.340
experimentation, right, then you can come to AWS Bedrock.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:57.140
But still. As per my experience, like model access, if you

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:59.600
are just looking for a model access, that's completely fine.

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.880
So programmatically create an API key programmatically just

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.820
try to access. But yeah, they have a very, very limited

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:10.560
model, which is available on AWS Bedrock, I will not be able

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:14.540
to access all the latest model, right and even from open AI

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:18.200
or even from a Google Gemini model series, I will not be

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:22.120
able to access it. Most of the model which AWS is hosting.

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:26.320
So basically, these models are open source model, you will

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:29.440
be able to host it even on your own. And we know that right,

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.540
we have we have already seen that that how we can host any

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:36.580
of these models, majority of the model. So they have some

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:39.160
proprietary model as well. For example, they have a model

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:43.620
from Anthropic, right, Anthropic, Sonnet, Haiku, all those

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:47.720
models are available. Again, that comes with a special tie

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.340
up. So obviously, Amazon has done AWS has done those tie

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:52.740
ups. Because of that. We know that these models are

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:58.880
available, but other models are not available. And again,

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:03.980
even in the UI, so you won't be able to like, do much, by

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:08.980
the way, right. So it comes with the limitation and like if

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:11.580
I have to create an agent, right, so I can I can try to

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:14.400
create an agent even without using a Bedrock. So maybe just

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.700
by using some langchain, langgraph, or maybe crew AI, and

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.320
that will be pretty much easy for me, I will be having a lot

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:21.880
of control, I can try to host it. Okay. I will see if I can

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:25.840
do it on any of the cloud platform. So Amazon Bedrock is

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:29.820
evolving, you can say, right. So we'll see in the future. So

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:32.440
how this moves, but yeah, as of now, if I'll talk about the

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:39.980
service. So I don't think like, you know, we can we can use,

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:44.660
you know, AWS Bedrock, apart from doing experimentation and

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:47.020
like someone is going to come, let's suppose if I have to

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:49.920
teach agent to someone that we already know, right, what is

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.880
the meaning of agent. So maybe I can come over here. Okay, I

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.500
can start teaching you an agent for the very first time,

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:58.720
right, just for the first time or that, okay, come over

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:02.020
here, give a name, select a particular model, LLM model, by

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.380
the way, then give an instruction to an agent because agent

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:08.900
requires instruction to adopt a behavior, right. And then we

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.240
can try to, you know, attach a knowledge base to that

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:14.080
particular agent, attach a memory to that particular agent,

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:17.600
and then create it and then test it over here. So maybe if

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.620
I'm teaching for the very first time, if I'm trying to do an

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:22.740
experiment for the very first time, then it's a good choice.

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:27.660
But as we have already seen a lot of agents, right, so we

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:33.500
all are aware about more than, like more than anyone can

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.760
learn from here. In that situation, you will feel bored,

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:40.060
basically, that that's the whole point I'm trying to make

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:42.560
over here, you will literally feel bored. And you will say

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:45.780
that that why I'm using it, like I can go and I can try to

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:50.560
create this, maybe in a better way. But yeah, it's good to

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.760
know. Basically, if there is some service. Okay. It's

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:56.180
available in AWS, Azure and GCP, it's always good to know so

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.940
that you can do a comparison. And even in an interview, when

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.780
people are going to ask you a question that why you have not

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:05.520
used AWS Bedrock, right, at least you will be having an

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.500
answer. Or let's suppose a person is trying to do argue that

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.700
okay, I'm going to use AWS Bedrock, why you are not using

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:16.260
it, maybe you will be able to counter those arguments. Very

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:20.400
simple. Yeah. So this is where you should know and I mean,

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.900
like it just takes 10-20 minutes of time for exploration,

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:28.200
not more than that. Okay, let's explore them. So knowledge

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:32.220
base. So yeah, agent is something that we can create, we can

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:34.320
test, we can chat it, then there is something called as

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.860
flow, right. So here you can try to create a drag and drop

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:41.540
kind of a flow, create a flow, if I'm going to click, so

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.140
they're giving you a drag and drop kind of option, I believe

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:46.800
we have seen this kind of option many places, right,

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:50.160
especially I started with the init end. So where you can try

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.240
to, you know, create a node. As you can see. They have given

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.940
you a different different kind of a node, right, mostly like

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:00.280
a even AWS specific node, you will be able to find out. So

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:03.540
S3 storage node they have given you, S3 retrieval node they

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:07.260
have given you, collector node logic wise, condition you can

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:09.960
try to write, while loop you can try to write, iterator for

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:13.080
loop kind of things you will be able to write over here. So

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.280
those nodes are there, agent nodes are there. So just drag

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:19.360
and drop, create an agent node and then one by one, one by

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.960
one configure it. It's very, very simple, right. So just

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.780
drag and drop based. So even they are trying to, you know,

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:29.540
make a similar kind of a platform that we have seen with

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:32.660
respect to a crew AI, if you remember, so even crew AI have

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:35.860
a programming library. So where you can use a library and

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:39.300
create an agent and they are also trying to build a complete

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:42.620
drag and drop kind of a system or a prompter system. So

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:45.000
where it will try to create a nodes and you can try to

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.100
connect it like init end kind of approach. Even if you

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:53.880
remember open AI. I tried. I tried doing that, right. Anyone

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:58.140
who have used open AI drag and drop like an agent builder

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:06.080
after my demo in a class? Yeah. Are you able to see any

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:06.800
improvement in that?

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:14.600
Yeah. Tyler is saying open AI is useless. Exactly. That's

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.700
the point. See open AI has like a, you know, even we have

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:20.960
discussed about that right after that launch in a class

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.980
itself. And I told you even at that point of time. time that

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:28.660
we'll see in future right we'll see in future and even till

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:33.400
now if you will go and check open ai agent builder it's

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:37.640
almost same they have like you know done a lot of pr a big

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:41.160
news they have created that okay it is going to be in it and

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:44.640
killer a thousands half youtuber have created you know

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:52.260
videos on that overnight and everything is gone still n8n is

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:56.840
a king as simple as that and none of these platforms are

00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:01.440
even close to n8n right because n8n core philosophy was not

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:05.020
agent or ai its core philosophy was basically automation

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:09.220
right and in it and they are building that company since

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:13.540
last six seven year right even before this llm era i would

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:17.100
say so the core philosophy was actually automation and

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:19.940
technically we think that that is our agent builder is going

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:23.180
to help me out no it's a automation task that we are trying

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:26.320
to solve everywhere agent is not required we just need a

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:29.720
agent when it's needed when we have to take a decision

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.860
that's it mostly industry wise we'll be looking for

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:37.280
automation so you must be able to see that even crew ai is

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.740
doing like a still i'm waiting for their development i'm

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:43.120
still waiting for like a you know autogen even autogen has

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:46.100
launched the ua uh i'm still waiting for their improvement

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.820
uh even open ai the big news they have created by launching

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:53.540
our entire agent toolkit uh still i'm waiting for them to

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:56.580
like you know do some sort of enhancement and similarly you

00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:00.760
will be able to find out here inside aws so i'll not

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.620
recommend any although i'm i'm teaching it um although i'm

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:08.020
like discussing about it inside the atlas bedrock but if

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.860
you're going to ask me that do you recommend this flow

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:16.740
builder inside aws bedrock my answer is a big big no i do

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:19.560
not recommend i'm just teaching you so that you must be

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:22.820
aware about it and you can go and you can argue because

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.640
there are people out there and maybe you will meet such kind

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.800
of people in an interview as well right where they will say

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.280
okay why you are not using this what is what is the problem

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.480
with that i mean like they have not they have not used it

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.640
maybe they just heard about it somewhere right they will

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:40.820
start arguing so maybe you can do give them a counter

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:45.800
argument so for that like a prospective I think you are

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.600
supposed to be aware about it but I believe we have seen a

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:53.060
lot right we now we understand so we will be able to break

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:57.280
an argument with those people anti-gravity is cursor killer

00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:00.280
new thumbnail right now sir I mean like anti-gravity is not

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.300
even close to cursor believe me I think yesterday I have I

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:07.420
was like talking about this in some of my class we'll see in

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:10.380
a future right again we'll see everything in a future I mean

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:15.420
like who wins who loses but as of now no cursor is the best

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:20.280
I would say I'm using it I'm using a paid version of it

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:23.760
basically and that too in a max token worth $200 I'm paying

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:29.700
right so and my entire team is using it right so I have

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:32.600
given them like my entire tech team is having a paid access

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:38.060
of that right even though anti-gravity is free I'll not

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:40.140
recommend to use it PK

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.300
is saying you have used cloud equity code I feel to say PK I

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.940
have seen your code base by the way generated by cloud code

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:53.260
right so I mean like cloud is good with respect to

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:56.500
generating a code but again control is something which

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:59.040
matters a lot and I think I have already given a feedback

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:05.900
about your code base yeah so that's my take on that I mean

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.860
like something in generating a code doesn't mean that I'll

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:11.740
accept it right it should do a meaningful task for me I mean

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:16.300
like then I can accept okay so this is basically a flow

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:20.200
builder again not my recommendation I'll not recommend right

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:23.440
you are supposed to be aware about it that bedrock provides

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:28.840
it yeah but my answer is no so do not invest you know a time

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:31.220
in terms of doing a configuration because configuration wise

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:33.900
again it's a very like a simple configuration drag and drop

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:36.700
each and every node you will be able to configure like

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:39.840
attach it and then bingo your work will be done so this is

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:42.920
how this flow builder is going to work now after a flow

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:45.120
builder so you will be able to find out a number of nodes

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.340
which are in your knowledge base so knowledge base means you

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:51.420
can attach your s3 like a bucket over here you can try to

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:56.440
attach basically a bevy URL and then it will be able to you

00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:00.460
know basically it will be able to give you a answer from

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:04.180
your knowledge base or even it is having capacity to scrap

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:08.840
something from a web now to use it basically knowledge base

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:11.640
if you are trying to create so if you have a root account

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:14.520
you will not be able to create a knowledge base I don't know

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:18.220
why they have given this restriction right but let's suppose

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:21.780
if I have login through my root account in aws and if I will

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:23.840
go and if I will try to create a knowledge base let me show

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:27.980
you that part so knowledge base vector data right I am

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:32.120
permission is fine so here choose a data source type so aws

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:36.600
s3 maybe I can try to choose webcrawler yeah for now s3 is

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:39.140
fine custom Salesforce SharePoint these are the option that

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:41.160
they have given to you so webcrawler is the option which I

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:45.060
am going to choose then click on next and here name is fine

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:48.520
I will keep it default source URL so maybe I can try to give

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:52.620
you your own URL over here just go and scrap it you can add

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:56.600
nine more URLs so in total 10 URLs you can try to add which

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:59.620
it can scrap basically and then you can chat with it and it

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:04.680
will be able to give you answer then basically website

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.800
domain range fine this this this things is fine add new

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:11.120
pattern is fine now context check parsing so that's fine

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:15.760
let's click on next and then here so as we are trying to

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.780
build a knowledge base so obviously we have to attach a

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:21.620
model so again very limited option cohera and cohera for

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:24.980
embedding they are giving you so Titan text embedding v2

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:28.420
they are giving you for this one and then I can try to click

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:32.800
on next and then I can try to click on next create a

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:36.640
knowledge base and then here is the error that you will get

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:39.640
like I said I don't know why they have given this option I'm

00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:43.980
surprised basically knowledge base creation with the root

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:46.640
user is not supported so if you have logged in through a

00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:49.980
root user it's not supported by the way please sign in with

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:53.360
the IAM user or IAM role and try again so basically I have

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:56.700
to create a new user and I have to give an access to it and

00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:59.740
only that user will be able to create a knowledge base

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:03.320
that's a big pain I don't know why so let me go ahead and

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:09.500
create it so here AWS console so I'll go and I can quickly

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:12.240
go and create a user over here so

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:19.280
here I can search for IAM identity access management this is

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:22.540
the full form those who are not aware about it and I can

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:25.780
click on this user tab on my left hand side there is a user

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:29.600
and then I can try to click on create user maybe I can give

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.220
a name to this user so sudhwan is a user name let's suppose

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:39.460
click on next add attach policy directly and then I can give

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:42.880
admin access to this user right so I have just selected this

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:48.300
admin access next create a user yeah so this is a sudhwan

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.660
which has been created now let's go ahead and like you know

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:55.040
give a permission so that user will be able to log in so

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:59.040
here I can click on this user security credential so I can

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:03.420
come over here again console sign in so enable console

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:06.900
access I am just going to enable for this user so that user

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:10.080
will be able to log in with the help of this URL so enable

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:13.980
console login auto generate password so yeah so now it is

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:18.760
able to give me URL so this URL I can keep it somewhere this

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:27.320
URL I can try to keep it I am just trying to create a user

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:32.620
separate user username so I can keep it here username and

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:35.640
then like a password I can try to keep it the auto generated

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:38.340
password so anyhow even if you are going to copy this

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:40.860
password not an issue at all because I am going to delete

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:47.210
the user itself so here I can go into maybe incognito and

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:56.150
console login AWS console and let's go ahead with the sign

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:59.370
-in maybe I can I can just like the URL which I have copied

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:04.950
right from my arn so I can try to just hit that URL and

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:11.050
username so sudh1 I have created just now and password so

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:13.690
whatever password that I have created so let's go and sign

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:16.310
in so this is how I am just trying to create a user over

00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:19.330
here I have given a permission to that user and now I have

00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:22.430
logged in into so likewise you can create any user right for

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:24.590
your AWS account right account, you can give a different

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:27.870
kind of a permission. This is what we do basically, and

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:31.910
every platform is providing you by the way. So here I can go

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:39.010
and I can try to search for bedrock, amazon bedrock and so I

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:43.770
can come to knowledge base, I can click on create and then I

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:46.670
can start creating a knowledge base. Same thing, web

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:52.550
crawler, let's suppose next and then like give URL, so maybe

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:57.530
I can try to give your own URL over here, next,

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:15.800
next, select model, a limited option, then

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:20.590
create a knowledge base. Now it will allow you. So that's a

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:24.730
big pain like you can't like do it, I mean like ideally they

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:28.370
should allow to do everything from the root user. But I

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:30.870
don't know. Maybe the service is still under development, so

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:34.750
they have not released the final one. But yeah, that's that

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:37.850
was a bit surprising for me, by the way, when I was trying

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:41.730
to create a knowledge base and it was saying that you need

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:46.190
like you can't do it from the root user. I was not able to

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:48.330
understand the logic that maybe they thought about

00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:53.770
something. But yeah, maybe it's beyond my understanding. So

00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:55.990
yeah, this is the knowledge, there is a knowledge base

00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:59.710
option, right, as I said, so you can just like a like I have

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:02.690
selected a web crawler option. So I can try to give 10 URLs,

00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:05.950
you will try to scrap the data and then eventually you will

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:08.950
be able to chat with those data or maybe you can try to

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:12.890
attach S3 bucket. Like that option is also available and

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:15.970
then you can go and you can try to chat with that one. So

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:18.130
that is the option you will be able to find out into a

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:21.170
knowledge base. Now let's talk about a guard rail over here.

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:26.690
So basically, guardrail is nothing but basically a policy

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:29.170
that you can try to define. Find that your AI should not do

00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:32.450
that, not do this, something like that, right. So create a

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:36.150
guardrail and then enter a name, maybe a test description,

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:41.930
messaging for blocked prompt. So enter a message to display

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:45.050
if your guardrail blocks the user prompt. So maybe, sorry,

00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:47.330
the model cannot answer this question. So this is a default

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:51.290
one. Cross region KMS key, that's okay. Leave it default.

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:56.010
Harmful categories. So you can try to enable and yeah. So

00:39:56.010 --> 00:40:00.710
here is something that you will be able to configure. So

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:05.070
basically enable text or image, hate based, insult based,

00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:09.530
sexual, violence, misconduct. And you can try to select

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:12.850
whether you have to block or detect as simple as that. And

00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:15.830
then you can try to even select a threshold by using a drag

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:19.170
and drop. So you can try to like lower down the guardrails

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:23.150
or you can try to keep it very, very high. Your fence very,

00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:26.130
very high. So those who don't understand. The guardrail,

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:30.610
it's nothing but basically to prevent our model to give us

00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:34.050
a, give a response in any such kind of a situation. So any

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:37.590
situation which has been like, you know, listed over here,

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:41.190
right. Prompt attack. So even you can configure that part

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:45.030
prompt attack, right. So if someone is trying to do it. So

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:48.710
all this like, you know, options are available to all of

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:53.130
you. Again, going to the next over here and here. So denied

00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:56.410
topics. So you can try to add a denied. Topic basically. So

00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:59.730
what you would like to block from your side so that you can

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:04.110
also try to configure, you can also try to add a words over

00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:08.550
here. So let's suppose if in your reason, in your language

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:11.490
or whatever language that you follow, whatever culture that

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:14.970
you follow. So there are some words which you are not

00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:17.650
supposed to speak or your model is not supposed to

00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:20.390
inference, right. You can try to attach all of those words

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:24.010
over here and eventually this will become your guardrail. So

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:27.630
city of information. So here you can just come and you can

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:31.430
try to like attach each and everything, which model is not

00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:34.310
what model is not supposed to do, right. Or model is not

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:38.950
supposed to respond just by using a UI UI, right. And then

00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:42.450
once your guardrail will be created, so you can try to

00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:46.170
attach these guardrails to any of the funnel. So whenever

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:49.350
you, you are exposing something to your user base, this is

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:51.950
the meaning of the guardrail. And this meaning is again,

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:54.710
same, right. This meaning is again, same everywhere. So. So

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:58.450
whoever is providing guardrails, I think recently I have

00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:01.330
seen one article. So where I have seen that even in it and I

00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:04.310
started providing guardrails, right. So guardrail node,

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:07.330
basically that that node is also already available. So even

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:09.790
you can try to attach it over there. So when you are

00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:13.370
creating a full scale automation, maybe you can ask Dhruv in

00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:16.790
his class, right, about this one. So he will be able to talk

00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:19.770
about that more. Yesterday, I think yesterday he has since

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:22.470
yesterday he has started taking your like automation class,

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:27.350
right. So like, yeah, so guardrail, again, data automation,

00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:32.410
nothing much. So basically, you can you can just like, you

00:42:32.410 --> 00:42:36.090
know, create the entire RIG indexing pipeline or intelligent

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:39.210
document processing, media analysis, audio analysis, this is

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:41.310
something which is available. So this is all about this

00:42:41.310 --> 00:42:45.410
Amazon bedrock. Overall, I would say the kind of knowledge

00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:50.010
that all of you are holding for now, I don't think you need

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:52.970
a bedrock, right. You have a better analysis. You have a

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:55.490
better understanding, you have a better knowledge and I

00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:59.410
believe without even using a bedrock, you will be able to do

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:04.070
everything that bedrock is providing, right, everyone. Yeah,

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:10.470
yeah, so I believe you have better knowledge and I don't

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:14.170
think that any one of these things are going to surprise any

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:17.950
one of you in my class, right. So we all know that how to

00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:21.290
build. But yeah, it's good to like, you know, explore all

00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:25.090
the services which is available in a market. So that like I

00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:28.950
said. You will be able to go and argue about it if someone

00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:36.070
have initiated the discussion. And yeah, so overall, now, if

00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:39.930
I'll come to a conclusion, I will not use bedrock as simple

00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:42.930
as that. So that's my conclusion.

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:49.390
OK, so yeah, after looking into it, a lot of like, you know,

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:52.970
YouTube videos, we feel tempted that, OK, yeah, there is a

00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:55.330
service. But unless and until you are not going to.

00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:59.630
Experience it on your own, I don't think that we should make

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:03.230
a decision. So I think now we have experience about it. Now,

00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:06.110
other service I would like to discuss with all of you. So

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:11.730
there is something called as SageMaker SageMaker, mostly

00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:15.770
like people try to say it is one of the stable service, by

00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:19.030
the way. So SageMaker is not like a bedrock. So SageMaker is

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:21.690
literally one of the stable service, which all of you will

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:24.970
be able to find out. So let me show you that part. SageMaker

00:44:24.970 --> 00:44:29.330
one. It's a useful service, by the way, yeah, it's a useful

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:33.210
service, so SageMaker, it will take some time. So I have

00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:35.210
already created my SageMaker like, you know, a studio

00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:39.010
because of that, it has launched itself quickly. But in

00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:42.030
general, it is going to take some five, six minutes of time

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:46.570
to prepare this entire studio. SageMaker is again a very old

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:49.550
service, by the way. It's not a new one. It's a stable

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:56.890
offering from, you know, AWS side. Yeah. So. Here, right. So

00:44:56.890 --> 00:45:01.550
here, sir, what's the difference between those? Which one?

00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:09.280
Yeah. So basically SageMaker, they have built to create an

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:12.500
entire like a ML pipeline, machine learning pipeline. But

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:15.960
here you will be able to find out even all the latest

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:20.460
models. So LLM models also. So here inside a SageMaker, if

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:23.060
you will come. So there is a AI ML section, this section.

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:27.220
And here. So if you are going to click on models, almost all

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:30.200
the models. You will be able to find out. So open AI, view

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:34.680
10 models and yeah, so they have a whisper model. They have

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:39.340
a text, no model to display, text to text generation, clear,

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:49.980
okay. So here we have this meta model, fine, clear, image

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:53.280
wise. So again, these models, so yeah, it's almost the

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:56.060
similar kind of a model that is available inside a bedrock.

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:59.660
You will be able to find out even over here, almost similar

00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:03.200
couple of models, couple of more models. You will be able to

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:07.240
find out, but the whole idea behind the SageMaker service

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:12.120
was to enable end to end machine learning pipeline, right?

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:16.020
Not this agent things, not this LLM things that we are

00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:19.240
talking about, but yeah, so this was the whole idea behind

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:21.580
SageMaker. And like I said, so it's a very, very old

00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:24.520
service. You all will be able to find out and they have also

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:30.860
given you a visual ETL. So somewhere it's like a almost

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:34.780
equivalent. It's equivalent to a ADF Azure data factory. So

00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:37.560
there is a, like a very good service, which is available

00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:41.320
inside Azure for a big data job, right? For like a

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:44.100
scheduling a job for creating an entire pipeline, just with

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:46.800
the help of drag and drop. And that service is basically ADF

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:51.260
Azure data factory. And I talked about that. I have not just

00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:53.940
talked about that. I have seen a very, very practical demo

00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:57.920
about this ADF in my big data lectures. I believe lectures

00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:02.020
with the name big data master. Yeah. So class with the name

00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:05.560
big data masters. So basically they were trying to create a

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:08.980
competition for that. And this is where like, you know,

00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:11.460
it'll do a SageMaker comes into a picture. So where you can

00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:15.200
come and then you will be able to create a drag and drop. So

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:19.840
basically S3, then come bring over here, configure your S3,

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:25.100
then bring a new one like a, so basically ETL extract load

00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:28.380
transform kind of things. So you can like write a custom

00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:30.900
code, joins, drop columns, whatever, whatever you want. So

00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:33.340
you can just try to one by one configure each and

00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:37.320
everything. And, you know, after configuring it, you can

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:39.940
build the entire pipeline. So you can like, you know, just

00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:43.020
configure this one. So it will pick a data from here or

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:45.660
maybe data. It will try to pick from somewhere else, glue or

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:49.340
something. They have given you all the options and then you

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:52.680
can, you can try to like clean the data. You can try to

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:55.500
transform the data and then you can try to finally dump the

00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:59.100
data. You just like dump the data in some of the data

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:03.200
sources or connectors. That they have given to you. So this

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:06.060
was, like I said, this was a competition. This is coming

00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:09.940
from a competition of ADF, Azure Data Factory, right. Azure

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:12.580
Data Factory is literally very good, very powerful, very

00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:15.600
powerful than this. I will say, right, very powerful than

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:19.020
this one. Again, Azure Data Factory works within the

00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:23.380
ecosystem. So most of the services they have given to us,

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:28.100
which works within the Azure ecosystem. But again, Azure

00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:31.460
ecosystem is very much powerful. If I'll talk about a big

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:34.320
data, from a big data perspective, right. So it's very, very

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:37.320
powerful actually and it's a very stable service that you

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:42.720
will, that has been used across the industry. So here, so AI

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:45.640
model wise, so yeah, model is there. ML flow, so you will be

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:50.580
able to create the entire like a flow end to end and you can

00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:53.900
try to, you know, schedule it. Training job, that is fine.

00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:58.220
So all these things are not that amazing. So here. So here

00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:01.380
you will be able to get basically a Jupyter lab, which is

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:04.440
amazing part. So where you can just try to open up your

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:07.960
notebook and then you can start doing whatever you want.

00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:11.440
Very, very simple. Right. So basically it is going to launch

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:16.340
it on a particular like a resource like T3 medium or

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:20.020
whatever you are going to schedule and you will be able to

00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:23.240
get an access of a Jupyter notebook. And if I have an access

00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:26.360
of Jupyter notebook, I can do whatever I want. That's very,

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:29.720
very simple. Right. So this is, and I can even try to

00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:33.660
productionize it. I can try to even schedule it. So here, as

00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:41.840
you can see, so it is, yeah, ID configured successfully. Now

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:45.360
if I'll do like a one plus one, this is the amazing part. I

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:47.740
mean like inside a cloud without doing any kind of a setup,

00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:50.720
one plus one, two, right. So everything is working fine. So

00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:53.620
I will be able to get, you know, each and everything. Right.

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:56.620
I will. So I don't have to do go and do a setup. So I can

00:49:56.620 --> 00:50:00.080
write a code. I can like, you know, schedule this entire

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:02.080
things. I can connect with the databases. Each and

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:06.040
everything can be done inside a Jupyter notebook itself. If

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:09.180
I have a direct access of a Jupyter notebook within a cloud,

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:11.940
and this is where this, you know, Jupyter lab comes into a

00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:15.380
picture and even they have given you a later for a VS code

00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:18.760
option. So if required, if someone wants like a, they can

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:21.700
just try to, you know, use it basically they can try to

00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:25.360
configure it. So this is again, one of the service I would

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:29.780
say, which is available. Inside AWS for a AIML kind of a

00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:31.640
job, right. A SageMaker.

00:50:34.650 --> 00:50:37.350
Any paper stall needed. Obviously it will be needed. Right.

00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:41.310
So all this basic libraries will be available, but yeah. So

00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:44.450
see what they're doing, basically the Jupyter notebook that

00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:47.130
you're trying to launch over here. Right. So you must have

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:51.170
seen initially that it has launched it on T3 micro. T3 micro

00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:55.450
is what? EC2 instance, machine, right? So Python library

00:50:55.450 --> 00:50:57.810
will be available. A basic core Python library will be

00:50:57.810 --> 00:51:01.510
available. Right. So the way we do a pip install in our

00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:03.950
local system in the exact similar manner, you have to do a

00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:07.010
pip install even over here, nothing different. Right. So

00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:09.530
they're giving you a machine T3 micro. You can select even

00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:11.710
other machine. You can select a bigger machine as well.

00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:13.970
Right. At the time of launch and accordingly they're going

00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:18.630
to charge you. Yeah. What are the difference between those

00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:21.530
SageMaker and Bedrock? So Bedrock, basically they are trying

00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:24.970
to offer with respect to a agentic AI or you can say a

00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:29.170
generative AI. SageMaker is a old service. A very, very old

00:51:29.170 --> 00:51:32.690
service. Which was originally designed for ETL kind of a

00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:36.530
pipeline and for AIML kind of a job. You can come over here,

00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:40.270
you can try to train your machine learning models and you

00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:42.690
can try to host it. You can try to deploy it. You can try to

00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:45.370
schedule it. Right. Or maybe you can try to create a big

00:51:45.370 --> 00:51:48.570
data kind of a job. So that was the whole idea behind this

00:51:48.570 --> 00:51:52.490
SageMaker service. And then after generative AI, so they

00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:56.010
came up with another service called as AWS Bedrock. And I

00:51:56.010 --> 00:52:00.210
believe it's still evolving. Right. But still it's evolving.

00:52:03.610 --> 00:52:05.890
Can you explain a little bit more related to Azure Data

00:52:05.890 --> 00:52:08.490
Factory and SageMaker? SageMaker I think you are able to

00:52:08.490 --> 00:52:11.830
see, right? SageMaker. ADF I would say it's pretty much

00:52:11.830 --> 00:52:14.570
advanced, very, very advanced I would say. Right. And if you

00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:17.290
have to like see a practical example, maybe you can look

00:52:17.290 --> 00:52:20.310
into my big data master's lecture. Over there I have already

00:52:20.310 --> 00:52:23.890
shown, not just shown, I was not just talking about a

00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:27.790
theoretically ADF. So I have shown a lot of pipelines over

00:52:27.790 --> 00:52:32.970
there in practical. Yeah. Yeah. So that will help you out if

00:52:32.970 --> 00:52:35.470
you would like to know more about like from a big data

00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:41.460
perspective. So yeah, SageMaker is again one of the service

00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:46.040
and I believe you must be aware about it that what SageMaker

00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:48.120
actually does and then comparison between obviously

00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:53.860
SageMaker and AWS Bedrock. Now yeah, so now the another

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:56.900
service that you will be able to find out called as Kendra.

00:52:57.260 --> 00:53:01.920
So AWS Kendra. Right. Now what is this Kendra by the way? So

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:05.660
Kendra is basically designed for searching and indexing,

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:08.420
right? Searching and indexing. So let's suppose if I have a

00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:11.420
document I can try to attach. If I have like a, you know,

00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:14.840
some data I can try to attach and then I can try to do a

00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:18.200
indexing. I can try to do a search on top of that one. So

00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:20.760
let's suppose if I have a PDF inside PDF, I have a text, I

00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:24.460
have an image and other things. So basically I can try to

00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:27.220
attach it and then Kendra is going to help me out. So here

00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:30.980
if I'll go and click on like create indexes. So click on

00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:34.080
create indexes. My index name. So let's suppose if I'm

00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:37.360
giving test one as an index name, description, leave it, IIM

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:43.120
rule, leave it, create, use the existing one. Yeah. Tag,

00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:47.500
leave it. Developer edition. So see, here you will be able

00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:50.320
to understand everything in this system itself. So storage

00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:54.040
capacity up to 10,000 document in a developer edition and

00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:56.480
then enterprise edition if I'm going to choose for which is

00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:59.700
going to cost me more. Right. So here I will be able to

00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:04.940
store 10,000 to 10,000. It seems right. 10 million and then

00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:08.420
query capacity. So 4,000 query per day in this mode, they're

00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:11.980
allowing me. So 4,000 times if I'm hosting the service for

00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:15.960
my user, if I need more than in that case, maybe I can go

00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:20.240
with the enterprise edition. So to my document, I can try to

00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:22.720
query this my number of times. So this is the number of

00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:25.740
document. This is the query per day. Now access token

00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:29.520
setting, leave it, leave it next. Click on next. Click on

00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:34.800
next and create. Okay. Yeah. So it is, it is going to create

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:37.500
my indexes.

00:54:40.210 --> 00:54:44.470
So it's technically like a, like, you know, a DB for data it

00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:46.670
is trying to create. This is where Kendra comes into

00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:46.950
picture.

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:03.300
So recently we have received one project. I'll tell you one

00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:06.660
small story about Kendra from last week itself. So last week

00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:09.520
we have received one project from one of the client. So they

00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:12.780
have like a lot of colleges in India, in Hyderabad region

00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:17.840
and what they are trying to like do. So they are trying to

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:21.860
build a service. So where the student can come, come to

00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:25.560
their application, come to their app and they can try to,

00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:28.140
you know, let's suppose there is a student from ECE branch,

00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:32.000
there is a student from like a CSC branch. So obviously in

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.600
every branch, in every semester, there will be a different,

00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:36.300
different books, right? There will be different, different

00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:38.680
books. There will be different key and notes and all those

00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:41.180
things will be available. So they are trying to build an

00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:43.720
application. So where their student can come and as per the

00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:47.180
access, they will be able to search inside a document. And

00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:51.300
again, so when they are trying to do a searching, it should

00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:55.660
also try to search images, right? Image, it's metadata, it's

00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:59.580
citations, all of those things. So over there we have used

00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:04.660
Kendra. So in one of the use cases we have, we have already

00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:10.540
used like a Kendra. Yeah. So here, yeah. So my index is up

00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:13.880
basically. I can try to attach a data source. So I can try

00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:15.720
to dump all the data into my, yeah. So I can try to dump all

00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:24.620
the data into my, yeah. So I can

00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:41.080
just attach a data set and then Kendra is going to manage

00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:44.320
each and everything for me. This is what Kendra does. So I

00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:47.600
don't have to do much over here. Just dump all the data and

00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:49.880
then enjoy.

00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:59.880
What is the difference between S3 and Kendra? It's a wrong

00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:03.620
comparison. I would say. See S3 is technically a storage, a

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:06.660
pure storage, right? Yeah. So you can, you will get a drive

00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:09.580
access and then over there you can just put a data. Kendra

00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:13.100
is something which is going to process those data. So Kendra

00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:16.280
is not going to store the data, by the way, it's a service.

00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:20.800
You are going to hold a data into your bucket, which is S3,

00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:23.960
right, folder wise or whatever. And then you are going to

00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:26.920
attach to a Kendra. So Kendra is going to process those like

00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:30.480
a text or document and each and everything. And whenever you

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:33.580
are going to query those documents, so Kendra service is

00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:36.780
going to help you out. In terms of, you know, doing a

00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:37.100
search.

00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:48.520
Why don't we use S3 and chroma DB instead of S3 and chroma

00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:52.480
DB instead of Kendra? I mean, yeah, you can use it. There

00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:55.720
are hundreds of services which is available. So I think why

00:57:55.720 --> 00:58:01.520
we are not using it should not be a question. Basically, you

00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:05.620
can use it. Who is stopping you to use it, by the way, sir,

00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:13.350
how to attach whatever we built in Kendra to a UI. So yeah,

00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:15.790
programmatically you can attach it as a service that is

00:58:15.790 --> 00:58:16.190
possible.

00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:29.020
Is it like a Google file search kind of you can say files,

00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:32.660
Google file search, you can say. But yeah, so it like helps

00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:37.140
you out even search with respect to like images and your

00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:40.700
text. So this is where this Kendra comes into picture. So

00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:45.140
it's still starting. Yeah. So it's very simple, like, you

00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:48.600
know, service which you will be able to find out. So keep

00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:52.300
your data into S3 bucket. And then attach it with the Kendra

00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:55.060
and then go and start searching it. Simple.

00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:05.660
External data source to Kendra, is it possible or it has to

00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:08.440
be Amazon ecosystem data? It has to be in S3 bucket itself.

00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:12.400
They're not allowing you to like, you know, bring

00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:17.800
a data from external sources. So that's the reason in a data

00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:22.260
source you will be able to find out. So add data source. So

00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:23.740
Amazon S3 data source itself.

00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:30.400
So yeah, there are some other which is like available over

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:34.180
here. So I mean, like from Amazon itself. So Amazon RDS,

00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:41.640
MySQL, again from Amazon RDS itself, RDS itself. So there

00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:47.740
are some, but again, S3, S3, Box connector they have given

00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:51.560
you, Confluence they have given you, GitHub, Gmail. Yeah,

00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:57.940
there is some external, not some, I would say, almost all

00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:01.820
the popular one is given to you as a connector. Hmm. Web

01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:07.840
crawlers, SharePoint. So yes, apart from your S3, you can

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:13.200
bring a data from other sources as well. I haven't used it.

01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:15.240
I have just used with respect to S3, by the way,

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:28.420
MongoDB, I have a doubt, MongoDB, I think Mongo connector is

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:32.080
not available, it seems, no.

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:36.180
And even out of this connector, so a couple of connectors,

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:38.420
they have decommissioned as you can see. So you can see no

01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:44.760
longer available. Yeah. It is a simple service, connect with

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:46.860
your data source and then, so

01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:58.460
here see what it does. So insert, extract or modify document

01:00:58.460 --> 01:01:01.360
metadata and content during an ingestion. So specify a

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:05.580
metadata field name. You can try to put up your condition,

01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:08.200
enter or select the value that meets the condition and then

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:10.960
you can configure any of your Lambda function if you want

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:15.760
and then you can try to do like these operations. OCR,

01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:18.140
image, video, analytics, transcript, translation, etc. So

01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:24.240
test anytime basically. So it is actually good in terms of

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:26.820
understanding your data. So this is just one of the wrapper

01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:31.160
which has been built on top of your data set, simple. And

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:36.400
then you can get the analytics. So yeah, SageMaker is one of

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:40.340
the service, Bedrock is basically one of the service and

01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:45.320
then Kendra is a small service, SageMaker and AWS Bedrock is

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:49.320
technically a complete suit. Kendra is just a small service

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:53.040
that they have built. Along with that, so what in all

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:56.160
services that you are supposed to know from AWS, so let me

01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:01.560
give you that overview

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:05.620
as well. So there is something called as, so Kendra, fine.

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:09.560
There is something called as elastic bean stack.

01:02:14.050 --> 01:02:16.690
Yeah. There is something called elastic bean stack. So

01:02:16.690 --> 01:02:19.630
yesterday we have used EC2, right? We have used basically an

01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:23.210
EC2 instance. Where we were like, you know, trying to deploy

01:02:23.210 --> 01:02:26.370
some of our services and we have attached it with our own

01:02:26.370 --> 01:02:31.110
DNS. Likewise, so if I have to like host some sort of a

01:02:31.110 --> 01:02:34.450
application, so I can try to use one of the services called

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:39.150
as elastic bean stack. It's very, very easy by the way,

01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:44.170
right? So you have to just zip all of your code base and

01:02:44.170 --> 01:02:48.510
then you can try to simply upload it and based on like

01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:50.710
configuration. So obviously there is some little bit of

01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:53.470
configuration which is required and elastic bean stack is

01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:56.810
going to help you out to host your entire application. In

01:02:56.810 --> 01:02:59.410
some of the classes, I have also talked about this elastic

01:02:59.410 --> 01:03:01.990
bean stack in a practical manner. I'm just trying to give

01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:05.370
you an overview that okay, so what service does what? So

01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:07.890
EC2, we are already aware about it, right? We have already

01:03:07.890 --> 01:03:11.290
used it twice inside a class, I believe. So where you can

01:03:11.290 --> 01:03:14.030
launch any kind of instance of your choice of your capacity.

01:03:15.090 --> 01:03:18.130
Apart from that, so bean stack. So bean stack is again one

01:03:18.130 --> 01:03:20.390
of the service. Yeah. So which is going to help you out in

01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:24.930
terms of hosting the entire things. Now above that, there is

01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:27.770
a service called as ECS service actually. So there is

01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:30.250
something called elastic container services. So where you

01:03:30.250 --> 01:03:34.910
can try to, you know, like deploy your entire Docker

01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:40.530
container and that too on scale basically. So you have like

01:03:40.530 --> 01:03:44.130
a provision to set all those auto scaling and security

01:03:44.130 --> 01:03:46.390
checks each and everything the way we were doing it with

01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:49.530
respect to EC2 services. So this is again one of the

01:03:49.530 --> 01:03:53.510
service, a fully managed container service you will be able

01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:58.970
to find out. Now there is, this is basically a ECS container

01:03:58.970 --> 01:04:02.610
service for a Docker. There is something called as EKS. So

01:04:02.610 --> 01:04:05.610
for Kubernetes, so let's suppose if I would like to like

01:04:05.610 --> 01:04:10.610
deploy something with the help of like Kubernetes, right, if

01:04:10.610 --> 01:04:12.810
I have to manage that, which is getting a lot of popularity.

01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:17.190
So you can try to use EKS service. So there is a ECS. There

01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:20.010
is a Docker. There is a EKS. There is a elastic bean stack.

01:04:20.350 --> 01:04:24.850
There is a EC2, a raw EC2, right system, which I can take

01:04:24.850 --> 01:04:28.090
where I can try to deploy all of my services apart from

01:04:28.090 --> 01:04:32.310
that. So there is something called as basically one more

01:04:32.310 --> 01:04:40.470
service, Fargate basically, F-A-R-G-A-T. So basically if you

01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:44.030
are going to search for this Fargate over here, so basically

01:04:44.030 --> 01:04:47.210
it is going to give you a serverless compute engine. For

01:04:47.210 --> 01:04:51.610
combining ECS and EKS, the ECS container service and EKS

01:04:51.610 --> 01:04:54.550
Kubernetes services, right? So it is just going to give you

01:04:54.550 --> 01:04:57.890
that one. So this is what is called as Fargate over here. So

01:04:57.890 --> 01:05:02.950
ECS, EKS, Adelweiss, Fargate, Beanstack. So these are the

01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:06.190
application, these are the services that you can try to use

01:05:06.190 --> 01:05:10.950
to deploy any of like your web application or any Python

01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:14.130
application, any kind of a front end or any kind of a back

01:05:14.130 --> 01:05:18.750
end. Now. So. So apart from that, so let's suppose if I'm

01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:21.170
looking for something serverless. So obviously serverless

01:05:21.170 --> 01:05:24.690
wise, so I have a Lambda. So there is something called as

01:05:24.690 --> 01:05:27.550
AWS Lambda. So where you can try to deploy anything in a

01:05:27.550 --> 01:05:32.090
serverless mode. So it depends upon the request or hits

01:05:32.090 --> 01:05:35.390
basically they are going to charge you. So in a serverless

01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:38.270
mode, we have a Lambda inside AWS and there is something

01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:43.350
called as App Runner. So AWS App Runner, right? So again,

01:05:43.450 --> 01:05:46.330
this is basically a serverless services they have given to

01:05:46.330 --> 01:05:49.950
you. So there is a container based service. So where ECS,

01:05:49.970 --> 01:05:55.070
EKS, Fargate and Beanstack comes into picture. Then there is

01:05:55.070 --> 01:05:58.190
a category of a serverless, serverless in serverless

01:05:58.190 --> 01:06:00.850
category. So you will be able to see Lambda and you will be

01:06:00.850 --> 01:06:03.750
able to see App Runner. So generally people get confused,

01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:06.310
right? That which service I'm supposed to use for what kind

01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:08.390
of application. So if you are going ahead with a

01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:11.850
containerized service, in that case, go ahead with ECS, EKS,

01:06:12.090 --> 01:06:16.270
Fargate or maybe like, you know, Beanstack. And if you're,

01:06:16.270 --> 01:06:16.510
if you're looking for a serverless service, you can go ahead

01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:17.830
with EKS, Fargate If you're looking for maybe a serverless.

01:06:17.950 --> 01:06:20.430
So in that case, go ahead with the Lambda or go ahead with

01:06:20.430 --> 01:06:23.210
the App Runner. Serverless, those who don't understand what

01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:25.810
is the meaning of serverless, serverless means, so basically

01:06:25.810 --> 01:06:30.690
AWS is keeping a big, big machines, right? You are going to

01:06:30.690 --> 01:06:34.310
host your entire application on that server. And along with

01:06:34.310 --> 01:06:36.970
you, there are many people, many other people who will be

01:06:36.970 --> 01:06:40.970
hosting their application. AWS is going to charge you as per

01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:44.690
consumption, consumption of that network bandwidth and the

01:06:44.690 --> 01:06:46.750
transactions or data storage that you have. You are trying

01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:49.950
to do so that is technically a meaning of a serverless. So

01:06:49.950 --> 01:06:53.930
you are not managing a server, by the way, AWS itself is

01:06:53.930 --> 01:06:56.810
managing our servers. This is what it means. A serverless

01:06:56.810 --> 01:07:00.990
services, right, technically. So in case of like a server

01:07:00.990 --> 01:07:04.010
based, for example, all those container service. So they

01:07:04.010 --> 01:07:06.470
give us a server and we used to manage it. We used to

01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:09.170
configure it. We used to manage it. Right. The same we have

01:07:09.170 --> 01:07:12.190
done with respect to EC2 as well. Yeah. So virtual machine

01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:14.750
wise, if I'm looking for a raw machine, so in that case, I

01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:17.570
can try to go with the EC2. So yesterday we have launched

01:07:17.570 --> 01:07:21.390
EC2 and if I'll talk about EC2, so I can even go and I can

01:07:21.390 --> 01:07:24.890
try to select like any kind of instances, right. Any kind.

01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:27.410
So we have already launched this EC2 multiple times, I

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:31.810
believe. So now we are good with that. So here I can try to

01:07:31.810 --> 01:07:33.310
even go and select maybe.

01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:41.040
Yeah. So any kind of instances, a lot of like instances

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:45.860
which is already available. Right. And yeah. So a big, big

01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:50.580
instances I will be able to spin over here. And apart from

01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:53.780
that, so there is something called as LIGST, light cell. So

01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:57.180
light cell launch and manage a virtual private server. So

01:07:57.180 --> 01:08:00.020
this is again like a light cell is another server or virtual

01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:04.300
machine that they are providing you. So in total, the source

01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:07.700
wise, if I'll look into AWS services, I can divide it on

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:11.520
three layers basically. A virtual machine layer. So where

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:14.440
EC2 comes into picture, this light cell comes into picture

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:16.620
where I will get a virtual machine. Light cell means a

01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:19.200
small, small machine. You will be able to get a cheap one,

01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:20.220
which is not very expensive. It's not going to cost you

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:26.180
much. Then a serverless wise, Lambda and app runner, I will

01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:29.920
be able to get. Container services wise, ECS, EKS, Fargate

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:32.720
and Beanstack. So this is something that I will be able to

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:37.860
get. And all of these services, I can try to like use it for

01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:42.780
any application deployment in general. Right. So we can. So

01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:45.260
generally when we try to decide where we have to deploy.

01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:48.820
Right. So we always try to think about these like approach

01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:52.420
that. Okay. Are we going serverless? Are we going with the

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:55.380
container services or are we going with a virtual machine?

01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:58.440
So if I say, okay, we'll go with a virtual machine, then I

01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:00.840
will be having two options. One is a EC2 option. One is a

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:04.100
light cell option. If someone says that I will go with the

01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:07.420
container services, then ECS, EKS, Fargate and then like a

01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:10.900
Beanstack comes into picture. If someone says that, that we

01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:13.320
are going serverless in that case, Lambda and then app

01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:17.180
runner will comes into a picture. So this is how we take a

01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:20.360
decision. Right. That. Okay. So which in which mode we are

01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:22.920
going ahead with the deployment. For example, if I'll talk

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:26.520
about Euron system, right. So we are using ECS over there.

01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:30.120
So we are using a containerized service over there, ECS and

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.520
EKS like we are trying to use for a different, different

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:35.960
application. So where we have deployed this entire Euron

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:38.840
ecosystem and whatever we are building over there. Right.

01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:44.680
And we are managing this entire ECS. So hope this make sense

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.900
to all of us. Yeah. Yeah.

01:09:57.550 --> 01:09:59.790
So this is an auto scale app, which all I would need to use

01:09:59.790 --> 01:10:02.810
for a horizontal scaling. You can try to use any of these

01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:06.150
because everyone provides a scaling basically simple.

01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:16.990
So hope this comparison is like all of you are good with the

01:10:16.990 --> 01:10:19.530
comparison. And then everything revolves around the

01:10:19.530 --> 01:10:22.590
services, by the way, even in AWS, there are a lot of like a

01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:25.570
small, big services, right. For maybe sending a notification

01:10:25.570 --> 01:10:29.990
for a storage, obviously S3 again, S3 is for a raw file

01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:32.970
storage. For example, we are storing your certificates.

01:10:33.130 --> 01:10:35.770
Right. So you can go, you can click on certificates and you

01:10:35.770 --> 01:10:38.430
generate a certificates. So we are storing our certificates.

01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:41.370
For example, we are storing these thumbnails. This

01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:43.530
thumbnails is coming from somewhere. So we are storing these

01:10:43.530 --> 01:10:46.990
thumbnails again inside the S3 bucket. So whenever we are

01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:49.350
going to upload some assignments, so if I'll show you my

01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:52.490
admin panel of this entire Euron, right. So you will be able

01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:55.210
to like from our side, or maybe you can go and you can try

01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:57.950
to click on any of this. You will be able to see a S3 link,

01:10:58.070 --> 01:11:00.770
basically click on assignment and you will be able to see a

01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:04.410
S3 link. So we are storing like a assignment on S3. So this

01:11:04.410 --> 01:11:06.750
is how like a storage works. And if I'll talk about a

01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:09.570
structured data, for example, login courses and all those

01:11:09.570 --> 01:11:12.630
things. So we are trying to use basically RDS services

01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:15.950
inside that, inside this RDS, we are using Postgres. Simple.

01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:21.290
So inside RDS, almost all the database is available. And

01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:24.770
from there we are using a SQL services and all of these

01:11:24.770 --> 01:11:29.470
things we use to decide when we design the entire system for

01:11:29.470 --> 01:11:31.850
any application, any kind of application, not just for like,

01:11:31.890 --> 01:11:34.730
you know, this or that application. Okay. We use to make a

01:11:34.730 --> 01:11:39.470
decision in a very, very first place itself, uh, that what

01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:42.230
should be our approach and around that. So we build the

01:11:42.230 --> 01:11:45.430
other services, for example, caching for caching, if we have

01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:49.930
to use a Redis, then for tunneling for like a, like a CDN.

01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:50.870
So yeah.

01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:04.300
Okay. So I believe this looks fine to all of you. So if this

01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:08.600
looks fine, then, uh, I don't have anything to discuss for

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:11.180
today's class. Uh. So basically I'll rush this class, uh,

01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:16.920
uh, now and, uh, next week, right next week, I'm going to

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:20.040
start with the project by the way. Right. And, uh, when I

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:23.080
say pro I'll be starting with the project. So I will try to

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:27.240
show you a complete CI CD pipeline by using some of the

01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:29.620
services which I have discussed today, not practically

01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:32.220
theoretically, basically. So I'll try to show you an end to

01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:36.340
end CI CD pipeline that how, uh, do we create a development

01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:40.100
environment? How do we create a test environment? And how do

01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:43.200
we create a production environment? So first of all, because

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:46.900
by default, uh, in almost all the industry grade project,

01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:49.460
you will be able to find out three or four environment,

01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:53.960
right? So maybe like a dev environment and then, uh, test

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:56.580
environment, UAT environment, right? Pre-prod environment.

01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:00.260
Someone used to say, so everyone used to say, uh, call it by

01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:02.540
their own name, but yeah, there will be a multiple

01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:06.040
environment we used to create and our code will flow through

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:08.540
one environment to another environment. That is something

01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:11.660
which I'm going to discuss. Because every project, right?

01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:14.840
Generally we think that, that, uh, uh, you know, the way we

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:18.280
are creating a project in a local is a reality, but that is

01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:21.680
not actually a reality, right? Uh, actual development

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:26.420
happens in a very different manner. And the way we as a

01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:29.080
student, we, as a learner do a development is a very

01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:32.900
different, right? Uh, so, and I believe we all should be

01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:36.120
aware about it. So next class with respect to our project,

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:38.740
so I'm going to start a project basically, and with respect

01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:41.340
to project. I'm going to show you the entire CICD funnel,

01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:45.920
uh, with a multi environment, uh, plus I'm going to even

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:49.420
show you that how do we manage our credentials basically,

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:52.520
right? Because let's suppose if I'm trying to use some of

01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:56.420
the services, not some lot of services, we end up using it.

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:59.100
So how do we manage a credential? What is the service that

01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:01.500
we are going to use it, which will help me out in terms of

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:03.500
maintaining and managing the credentials and many more

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:05.900
things. So around the project, we'll, we'll start the

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:08.940
discussion from next week. Making sense guys. Everyone.

01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:29.160
So transformable, I think my

01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:41.190
students should also put up, put some effort. So you should

01:14:41.190 --> 01:14:44.570
not expect everything from your mentor, by the way, and that

01:14:44.570 --> 01:14:47.630
is called a spoon feeding. And I think we are not that

01:14:47.630 --> 01:14:48.150
young.

01:14:54.050 --> 01:14:59.650
Yeah. Need to. I'll read it to a tenant. Can I ask? Yeah.

01:14:59.690 --> 01:15:01.650
You can ask. I don't have any issue.

01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:12.500
Okay. Yeah. Okay. So you can go ahead. Akash, you can go

01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:17.400
ahead with a question. Yeah. Hi sir. Good morning. Yeah.

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:21.620
Good morning, sir. Uh, I just wanted to ask related to a

01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:25.660
tenant that, uh, if some, some organization having already a

01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:32.520
one tenant on the is your right. Hmm. Uh, we want to create

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:36.940
a one, uh, QA for the QA tenant. And for the, uh,

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:42.020
development tenant. Okay. But, uh, the root is our, the

01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:47.500
existing tenant. So how is it possible? How we can, uh,

01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:52.560
existing tenant. I'm not able to get it like create. Yeah. I

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:55.120
mean, uh, so suppose you're on is, uh, one, uh, one of the

01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:58.240
migration and you won't have, uh, uh, purchase the tenant.

01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:05.620
So like, uh, you're on.com. Okay. Okay. Okay. And now, uh,

01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:10.620
it's, uh, it's a route to a tenant or anything on this one.

01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:15.640
Now I want to create a one or not a subside level. I want to

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:19.760
create a one extra tenant, uh, which is, uh, which is for

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:23.680
the QA and for the development. Hmm. Hmm. How we can

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:26.760
purchase the, no, no, you don't have to purchase actually

01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:30.600
see any, any domain provider, basically go daddy hosting or,

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:33.300
or even like a AWS itself. So they are going to give you a

01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:36.680
route. Right. So for example, you're on dot one on top of

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:39.200
that. So let's suppose if I have, I have, I have two options

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:42.680
basically. So I can try to, you know, uh, write like X, Y, G

01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:46.840
dot you're on dot one. So basically my actual URL is or

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:50.700
actual like a domain name is you're on dot one. And then I

01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:54.260
have basically attached something before, or maybe I can try

01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:56.700
to follow the folder structure basically. So you're on dot

01:16:56.700 --> 01:17:01.020
one slash X, Y, G. So that is the option that I have. And,

01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:03.720
uh, it would both the option I can go ahead. So I can go

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:06.520
ahead with a subdomain option that is called as like a X, Y,

01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:09.300
G dot you're on dot one, or I can go ahead with a folder

01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:13.940
hierarchy option on slash basically on route. No, sir. But,

01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:18.540
uh, you are, uh, trying to, uh, explain related to a domain

01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:22.760
name, but the here and to, uh, know the structure of the, is

01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:28.280
your tenant actually, it's not a related to a domain. Azure

01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:32.900
tenant. Is there any service in Azure? No. No tenant as your

01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:38.620
tenant means, uh, we have, uh, what is, what is that? Like,

01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:42.700
I never heard about this. Any services by the way, it's,

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:49.080
it's, it's not a service. I mean, uh, some organization want

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:51.860
to get the license from the Azure. So that, that is, that is

01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:55.780
called a tenant as well. Tenant. Okay. Basically you are

01:17:55.780 --> 01:17:59.140
talking about intra ID, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:02.360

sir okay okay thank you sir okay okay okay uh six months

01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:36.250
okay okay

01:19:41.170 --> 01:19:54.370
no matter what happens yeah yeah yeah but uh but uh but uh

01:19:54.370 --> 01:19:58.530
but uh but uh When I was selected for this interview, in the

01:19:58.530 --> 01:20:02.830
last round, he only asked 30-20% of what you had read.

01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:10.870
Because I got the job early, I got the job in a good way,

01:20:10.910 --> 01:20:13.950
the structure is looking good, the hike is also looking

01:20:13.950 --> 01:20:19.210
good. Till now, no one knows how to create an agent vision

01:20:19.210 --> 01:20:28.630
like this. Very good, very good. Send me your success story

01:20:28.630 --> 01:20:32.770
after hiding your name and all those personal information.

01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:38.990
Yes, I will send it, sir. Okay, congratulations by the way.

01:20:39.590 --> 01:20:43.390
Thank you, sir. And now, for example, if I have to upskill,

01:20:43.610 --> 01:20:50.870
what skill should I learn next? Skill is nothing. Learning

01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:53.790
is not something to learn. Learning is the most fake thing

01:20:53.790 --> 01:20:57.330
and learning is the most outdated thing. You have to do it,

01:20:57.570 --> 01:21:02.710
build it, build a project, collaborate with people, make

01:21:02.710 --> 01:21:06.150
something new. That is the actual learning. People think

01:21:06.150 --> 01:21:13.730
that learning means basically studying, joining classes. In

01:21:13.730 --> 01:21:17.650
reality, it is not. Studying is only until you are a

01:21:17.650 --> 01:21:21.710
beginner. Okay, you have learned one thing, you have come to

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:25.190
know that okay, this happens. Your actual learning starts

01:21:25.190 --> 01:21:28.210
when you start doing it. Because you have to give an

01:21:28.210 --> 01:21:30.470
interview, right? You have to get a job, you have to

01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:34.610
negotiate salary. You don't just want a degree, you just

01:21:34.610 --> 01:21:38.750
have to take a degree, right? So there is no work, your

01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:43.010
learning etc. So you have learned, your learning is over,

01:21:43.150 --> 01:21:47.710
okay? So it is simple, start working on that. Start using

01:21:47.710 --> 01:21:51.150
it. And that will be the actual learning that will always be

01:21:51.150 --> 01:21:53.710
with you. And that is the learning which will help you out

01:21:53.710 --> 01:21:57.610
even in your future. Right? In your career growth. That will

01:21:57.610 --> 01:22:01.030
help you. So there is no need to learn or study more. There

01:22:01.030 --> 01:22:07.310
is more need to do. Okay. Okay? Thank you, sir. Yeah.

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:14.140
So yeah, Dinesh sir. Okay, next Aakash, you have a question.

01:22:19.010 --> 01:22:20.870
Dinesh, you have a question. Asif, you have a question.

01:22:21.890 --> 01:22:25.970
Hello, sir. I am Aakash. Yeah, Aakash. You are audible. So

01:22:25.970 --> 01:22:29.730
in AWS, you have covered a lot of services. So their

01:22:29.730 --> 01:22:31.890
details. No, we have not covered anything. We have just

01:22:31.890 --> 01:22:34.010
given an overview. Yeah, overview. So what is available in

01:22:34.010 --> 01:22:38.070
their details? So that for practice. No, no. There is no

01:22:38.070 --> 01:22:41.130
practice. We will use some of the services. Yesterday, we

01:22:41.130 --> 01:22:44.530
used EC2, right? Okay. So in the future, we will use Lambda

01:22:44.530 --> 01:22:48.050
somewhere. We will use Beanstack somewhere. That's it. Our

01:22:48.050 --> 01:22:54.970
work is done. Okay. Okay. Thank you. So yeah, so I just gave

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:57.630
an introduction but yeah. So we will use it. We are going to

01:22:57.630 --> 01:22:59.850
use it very soon, very soon. As soon as we use it, our work

01:22:59.850 --> 01:23:05.070
is done. Right. Okay. Yes. Yeah. Ganesh, Haseed, PK. Anyone,

01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:08.610
go ahead with the question. Yes, sir. So, I have a question.

01:23:08.830 --> 01:23:12.730
It is not a question. As the selection is taking place and

01:23:12.730 --> 01:23:16.370
transformation is taking place, then, this is also a little

01:23:16.370 --> 01:23:20.750
different for the rest of the people. So, there is a medium,

01:23:20.750 --> 01:23:20.830
yes. Which one is the medium.

01:23:32.350 --> 01:23:34.730
I can't force anyone right

01:23:38.970 --> 01:23:42.610
if that person is willing to give an interview because so

01:23:42.610 --> 01:23:47.630
many

01:23:47.630 --> 01:23:50.170
people not just one or two success story wise we have tens

01:23:50.170 --> 01:23:53.610
of thousands but out of those tens of thousands maybe 100

01:23:53.610 --> 01:23:56.370
people are like that who come and say okay we will give an

01:23:56.370 --> 01:24:01.210
interview I will go public somewhere shyness is one of the

01:24:01.210 --> 01:24:03.790
factors somewhere people think okay family, neighbors people

01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:08.570
around will see so you know talk about me I think you can

01:24:08.570 --> 01:24:12.950
you get it right what I am trying to say so success story

01:24:12.950 --> 01:24:16.410
not just one or two tens of thousands okay that is what we

01:24:16.410 --> 01:24:19.790
create daily but yes in front of us very few people

01:24:20.430 --> 01:24:24.570
especially if I talk about public right so again in public

01:24:24.570 --> 01:24:29.150
and I respect it everyone has their own opinion so I can't

01:24:29.150 --> 01:24:34.130
force anyone anyhow he is a part of your group you can

01:24:34.130 --> 01:24:37.510
search him you can personally connect him and if he is

01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:41.070
willing to give you answer or maybe like help you out in

01:24:41.070 --> 01:24:43.510
something I don't have any issue that is the reason we have

01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:47.390
created a group right we all will be connected for a very

01:24:47.390 --> 01:24:51.690
very long time but yeah I can't force anyone not even you so

01:24:51.690 --> 01:25:01.690
that's my take on that yeah okay yes yeah PK sir I have got

01:25:01.690 --> 01:25:04.410
the most interview questions on SageMaker and I am getting

01:25:04.410 --> 01:25:08.730
them on Databricks is there any other platform where you do

01:25:08.730 --> 01:25:13.530
ML and Gen AI things no there are a lot of platforms but

01:25:13.530 --> 01:25:17.390
SageMaker is one of the best you get full notebook access

01:25:17.390 --> 01:25:20.710
there nowadays like I don't know when SageMaker and

01:25:20.710 --> 01:25:24.310
Databricks was competing so yes both was having almost equal

01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:28.850
feature but now if I'll talk about a market size and a

01:25:28.850 --> 01:25:34.210
capacity wise Databricks is way more advanced right and even

01:25:34.210 --> 01:25:37.370
in future feature wise and even in terms of a market

01:25:37.370 --> 01:25:41.430
capitalization market cap so Databricks I would say you

01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:44.410
should focus on if you are focusing there by default

01:25:44.410 --> 01:25:47.050
SageMaker comes to you you can understand sir is there any

01:25:47.050 --> 01:25:49.550
session where Databricks is available yes there are many

01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:50.190
databases of Databricks yes there are many databases of

01:25:50.190 --> 01:25:54.290
Databricks why not my database has a big database I think I

01:25:54.290 --> 01:25:58.530
have already uploaded 19 lecture over there you can go and

01:25:58.530 --> 01:26:02.650
search it right now plus this week only there is a mentor

01:26:02.650 --> 01:26:06.950
called Vishal so we have launched a live class of Vishal let

01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:17.730
me show you that part and Vishal's let me show you so yes

01:26:20.260 --> 01:26:25.480
so basically this live classes yes one more thing guys so

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:27.820
yesterday we have published a business analyst course as

01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:30.120
well so those who will be interested they can join from 4th

01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:33.320
January mentor is going to be Sachin by the way and yes so

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:35.280
Databricks wise so this live course of Vishal has been

01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:37.960
launched which is Databricks wise and then you will go and

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:42.040
search here by doing Databricks by doing Databricks so my

01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:45.200
lectures here have not been completed yet but yes 19

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:48.660
lectures are available here in this one big data with

01:26:48.660 --> 01:26:52.120
Databricks with notebook and everything apart from that this

01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:56.760
week basically a mentor who is going to take your class so

01:26:57.420 --> 01:27:01.020
Vishal has already done a recording in Hindi and English as

01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:05.080
well so I think Vishal has done 28 lectures 28 in Hindi and

01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:08.160
28 in English we have not yet uploaded Hindi and English but

01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:11.560
yes lecture record as you can see it is already recorded so

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:16.380
from Vishal itself from Databricks basically 28 means 10

01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:20.900
more lectures will go so you will have courses in Hindi and

01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:23.160
English as well so for Databricks I think we have enough

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:26.180
means in Databricks I am also there in Databricks Vishal is

01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:27.720
also there in Hindi and English this lecture has been

01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:31.060
recorded coming Databricks we are also bringing in live mode

01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:35.260
Azure Databricks that is also already published available

01:27:35.260 --> 01:27:40.020
here so you can you can learn as much as you can so sir

01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:44.200
finally most of all now SageMaker is being used Databricks

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:45.860
is being used and better Databricks is also being used

01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:49.040
actually if you know Databricks then I think you will not

01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:52.640
need SageMaker because SageMaker will feel like very very

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:56.940
small for you believe me if you know Databricks basically so

01:27:56.940 --> 01:28:00.460
if you are asking about my opinion I will simply suggest you

01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:04.160
go with the Databricks and then sit for an hour and then

01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:09.120
explore SageMaker that's it your work will be done ok ok

01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:11.380
thank you sir Databricks is actually yes Databricks is

01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:13.840
actually very good I mean like platform wise and services

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:17.260
wise it is very very good because they have LLMs WALA access

01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:20.800
they have AIML flow as well and majorly Databricks was

01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:23.340
actually designed for ETL extract transform and load kind of

01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:28.430
operation where it is already very very good thank you sir

01:28:28.430 --> 01:28:32.250
Akash Singh Databricks and PySpark see PySpark is a library

01:28:32.250 --> 01:28:36.410
Databricks is a platform so by default Databricks give you a

01:28:36.410 --> 01:28:39.370
installation of a Spark PySpark is nothing but Pythonic

01:28:39.370 --> 01:28:42.470
Spark so you can't do a comparison basically between

01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:45.710
Databricks and PySpark Databricks platform PySpark is a open

01:28:45.710 --> 01:28:48.470
source library you can download it local and then you can do

01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:52.590
whatever you want yeah can you upload Databricks yeah my

01:28:52.590 --> 01:28:56.270
lecture of Databricks is also already uploaded and Vishal's

01:28:56.270 --> 01:29:00.030
lecture so he has like I have shown you so he has basically

01:29:00.030 --> 01:29:03.350
done 28 lecture in Hindi 28 lecture in English as you can

01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:07.050
see alright so this week I have just asked Vishal to you

01:29:07.050 --> 01:29:10.330
know put more 10 10 lectures so that it will be close to

01:29:10.330 --> 01:29:14.970
completion and then I will publish this like Hindi English

01:29:14.970 --> 01:29:19.270
both so we will be having Databricks in Hindi Databricks in

01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:21.550
English Databricks from my side Databricks in live

01:29:21.550 --> 01:29:27.090
Databricks like that Sir only Sir only one request Sir only

01:29:27.090 --> 01:29:30.150
one request if you if you take any system design if you take

01:29:30.150 --> 01:29:33.890
any small session then also it is very helpful I have

01:29:33.890 --> 01:29:38.070
attended your sessions which you have given in Euron but I

01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:41.950
am getting weak there I am failing there in interviews no if

01:29:41.950 --> 01:29:44.910
you go to system I don't have a course we haven't launched I

01:29:44.910 --> 01:29:50.830
am about to launch basically you had a URI right that was

01:29:50.830 --> 01:29:56.770
interview I think you must have seen that yes in that in

01:29:56.770 --> 01:30:00.110
that we had told design and architecture so I am planning

01:30:00.110 --> 01:30:03.690
for that that kind of a course like where machine learning

01:30:03.690 --> 01:30:07.870
architecture AI system design and then like the agentic

01:30:07.870 --> 01:30:12.390
system design just talk about it design wise so I think like

01:30:12.390 --> 01:30:16.350
this this week itself when people have initiated a

01:30:16.350 --> 01:30:19.290
discussion inside a group so I was talking to my team so

01:30:19.290 --> 01:30:22.510
they told me that January month we can do it January 3rd or

01:30:22.510 --> 01:30:25.850
4th week we can initiate because that slot is available

01:30:25.850 --> 01:30:29.950
January 1st week your this is coming business analytics

01:30:29.950 --> 01:30:32.390

big data right which is going to start from 3rd week so

01:30:40.210 --> 01:30:43.530
January 4th week slot is available for us where we are going

01:30:43.530 --> 01:30:47.710
to launch my class we will launch it in morning slot because

01:30:47.710 --> 01:30:50.810
by that time this batch will wrap up right this current

01:30:50.810 --> 01:30:55.250
going batch sir in many things the problem is that many

01:30:55.250 --> 01:30:58.610
technologies are getting obsolete like earlier we were using

01:30:58.610 --> 01:31:02.010
ML models now we are not using that now we are using help

01:31:02.010 --> 01:31:06.590
from JNI so sir that segregation I don't understand what to

01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:11.330
prepare should everyone study in ML no just work problem

01:31:11.330 --> 01:31:15.530
solved I keep on saying to our people that see there is no

01:31:15.530 --> 01:31:18.850
education in this if you know the basics then you keep on

01:31:18.850 --> 01:31:21.050
building things then only the relevancy will be there

01:31:21.050 --> 01:31:24.590
otherwise the relevancy will not be there ok that's pretty

01:31:24.590 --> 01:31:28.510
much true which some people are able to understand some

01:31:28.510 --> 01:31:32.470
people not so I am like sir in many of your sessions you

01:31:32.470 --> 01:31:39.050
said earlier we used this model now we are not using sir as

01:31:39.050 --> 01:31:42.490
a student I don't know which one we use and which one we

01:31:42.490 --> 01:31:46.890
don't use so that depends on the work look interview will be

01:31:46.890 --> 01:31:49.870
on your resume right you will write your experience the

01:31:49.870 --> 01:31:54.170
person will ask you the same question right so just to

01:31:54.170 --> 01:31:59.650
justify that work you have to work on it I think that is the

01:31:59.650 --> 01:32:03.050
only way to keep yourself relevant and justify yourself in

01:32:03.050 --> 01:32:06.370
an interview ok if you keep on studying there are many

01:32:06.370 --> 01:32:09.390
things to study and again some time it will create a lot of

01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:12.770
confusion for you and lot of like you know it brings a chaos

01:32:12.770 --> 01:32:16.130
what should we do what should we do does it happen or not

01:32:16.130 --> 01:32:21.010
like I talked about AWS bedrock today right and after

01:32:21.010 --> 01:32:24.190
looking at AWS bedrock now we all have a confidence that we

01:32:24.190 --> 01:32:30.630
should not use it that is true exactly ok because we all

01:32:30.630 --> 01:32:34.390
know right we all know that we whatever services that they

01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:39.330
are giving and without even using a bedrock kind of a

01:32:39.330 --> 01:32:43.770
services so why so I mean like that was necessary we

01:32:43.770 --> 01:32:47.090
discussed now people understood now people can go out and

01:32:47.090 --> 01:32:51.410
they can like say blindly that they don't want to use it so

01:32:51.410 --> 01:32:54.170
it happens experience comes so I will simply say keep on

01:32:54.170 --> 01:32:58.350
building things one last statement sir and I will conclude

01:32:58.350 --> 01:33:03.810
in interviews someone told me that people are used to the ML

01:33:03.810 --> 01:33:06.650
algorithms because they are very fast compared to when we

01:33:06.650 --> 01:33:09.710
are doing it with JNI it takes time it hallucinates it does

01:33:09.710 --> 01:33:14.270
not give us the appropriate results is there anything we can

01:33:14.270 --> 01:33:18.570
do to but see the significance of ML model is different for

01:33:18.570 --> 01:33:21.450
example so if I am trying to use maybe a classification

01:33:21.450 --> 01:33:24.330
model right or maybe if I am trying to use a regression

01:33:24.330 --> 01:33:29.170
model so why do you expect a similar kind of a result from

01:33:29.170 --> 01:33:32.410
LLM that LLM should do a regression for you LLM should do a

01:33:32.410 --> 01:33:35.770
classification for you or LLM should solve a time series

01:33:35.770 --> 01:33:38.970
problem for you why I don't understand the relevance because

01:33:38.970 --> 01:33:43.290
LLM has been designed for a different purpose and those

01:33:43.290 --> 01:33:46.330
machine learning models serve a different purpose hmm

01:33:48.530 --> 01:33:52.530
ok you are solving the problem of right let's suppose to

01:33:52.530 --> 01:33:55.750
solve a regression problem so I have used basically XGBoost

01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:59.030
regressor or maybe I have used basically like a decision

01:33:59.030 --> 01:34:02.230
tree regressor random forest regressor ok and you have built

01:34:02.230 --> 01:34:05.590
a model based on your data now what will you do with LLM

01:34:05.590 --> 01:34:10.870
will you ask LLM to do a regression and show me I mean like

01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:14.650
that is not even a correct approach right yes ok that's the

01:34:14.650 --> 01:34:20.030
point I mean the comparison is wrong why do we compare in

01:34:20.030 --> 01:34:24.450
that ok ML model was fast and then LLM is slow

01:34:27.710 --> 01:34:29.870
usually the business folks who does not understand

01:34:29.870 --> 01:34:32.770
technically what is happening they are used to seeing the ML

01:34:32.770 --> 01:34:36.030
models not the JNI models no then after giving such

01:34:36.030 --> 01:34:39.150
arguments the answer should also come like this give them

01:34:39.150 --> 01:34:44.410
such answer they will be quiet ok sir thank you I mean like

01:34:44.410 --> 01:34:51.430
you are doing wrong comparison right ok so fine yeah I think

01:34:52.050 --> 01:34:58.330
PK is done Yudhi yeah Yudhi hello hello sir sir actually AI

01:34:58.330 --> 01:35:02.270
wise I am also working in AI and whatever you have studied I

01:35:02.270 --> 01:35:07.510
am using it as well so there ok sir many things are now

01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:13.770
understood but struggle is done at those places sir because

01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:18.350
company expects more advanced architect level like if I give

01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:26.010
an example then Azure which is AD intra AD user user login

01:35:26.570 --> 01:35:32.230
then if I say which user has access to which confluence hmm

01:35:32.230 --> 01:35:38.310
hmm so on that user's basis everything is decided hmm so I

01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:45.490
think this this part where how user's login is done hmm and

01:35:45.490 --> 01:35:52.450
hmm what is this load balancing hmm or rate limiting hmm

01:35:52.450 --> 01:35:58.430
concept wise I know but its implementation hmm practically

01:35:58.430 --> 01:36:01.210
if you say see here if there are 100 people then you also

01:36:01.210 --> 01:36:04.910
know that 100 people will have 100 demands right practically

01:36:04.910 --> 01:36:10.050
it's not feasible to you know fulfill all of those demands

01:36:10.570 --> 01:36:14.970
so if you know then like experiment if you are stuck

01:36:14.970 --> 01:36:17.330
somewhere then you tell that you are stuck here we are not

01:36:17.330 --> 01:36:19.210
able to do give me a solution

01:36:30.890 --> 01:36:37.490
hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm

01:36:37.490 --> 01:36:46.910
hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm Yes, sir. I see this option too.

01:36:47.190 --> 01:36:50.110
And secondly, sir, in one place, those who struggle, like we

01:36:50.110 --> 01:36:54.370
make the AI model locally. Now that you have taught

01:36:54.370 --> 01:36:59.930
deployment, I am also practicing that. But in another place,

01:36:59.950 --> 01:37:02.710
where does the struggling happen, sir? Like different

01:37:02.710 --> 01:37:07.110
environments are made, dev, pre-prod, prod. We told you

01:37:07.110 --> 01:37:08.550
that, right? We are getting it done in the next class, by

01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:10.730
the way. Okay, you are getting it done. We spoke about it

01:37:10.730 --> 01:37:15.110
today, right? Yes, sir. Because the second struggle is the

01:37:15.110 --> 01:37:19.830
CICD part after this. Yes, we are getting CICD done. In that

01:37:19.830 --> 01:37:22.250
too, there are three environments, dev, UAT, and prod

01:37:22.250 --> 01:37:25.050
environment. Then how will we do credential management in

01:37:25.050 --> 01:37:27.450
that? How will your code check-in and check-out be done? How

01:37:27.450 --> 01:37:30.350
will the flow be done, basically? How will the rollback be

01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:33.390
done in it? Or what is the concept of blue-green deployment?

01:37:35.490 --> 01:37:38.410
So all these things will start from next week. I think it

01:37:38.410 --> 01:37:43.350
will also end in two weeks. Yes, sir. Then I think this part

01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:48.650
will be completed. It will remain in the pre and post, sir.

01:37:48.730 --> 01:37:51.330
But thank you for your patience. I know that many people

01:37:51.330 --> 01:37:54.890
don't know about CICD and multi-environment. I am aware

01:37:54.890 --> 01:37:58.090
about it. Everyone listens to it, but very few people have

01:37:58.090 --> 01:38:00.630
done it. And I think people should do it at least once in

01:38:00.630 --> 01:38:03.630
their life. So keeping that in mind, that I am going to

01:38:03.630 --> 01:38:06.150
discuss. That I am going to start from next week. Thanks,

01:38:06.190 --> 01:38:11.050
sir, because this is very important. I know. I know. Yes. I

01:38:11.050 --> 01:38:14.850
mean, this too, sir. We work well in AI. I mean, I will tell

01:38:14.850 --> 01:38:19.450
you a real world challenge in the company. We have done

01:38:19.450 --> 01:38:23.410
modeling and everything there. Its results are good.

01:38:23.550 --> 01:38:27.410
Recently, as I am telling you, the approach you had told me,

01:38:27.410 --> 01:38:32.090
after that, around 60% accuracy, now it has reached 90%. I

01:38:32.090 --> 01:38:37.830
have done all that work. Great. But the thing is that the

01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:40.630
pipeline with CICD has not been made yet. So it is going to

01:38:40.630 --> 01:38:43.570
be a long process. or get merge etc which someone has taken

01:38:43.570 --> 01:38:49.110
with them who is a UI guy. So, after going ahead and doing

01:38:49.110 --> 01:38:53.650
all the dependencies, the client also applauded the approach

01:38:53.650 --> 01:38:58.150
and appreciated my work. But for its final touch, it seems

01:38:58.150 --> 01:39:02.030
like in the call, they say, this is very good. Now, you do

01:39:02.030 --> 01:39:06.130
this. So, I think this final touch is a little bit the CI,

01:39:06.250 --> 01:39:09.630
CD and deployment part. We will do it in the next class. We

01:39:09.630 --> 01:39:12.070
will do it very well. We will do it in such a way that you

01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:14.570
will be satisfied for the rest of your life. That is my

01:39:14.570 --> 01:39:17.790
assurity. Right. Because I know that is a real problem. And

01:39:17.790 --> 01:39:20.090
this is everyone's problem. Right. This is everyone's

01:39:20.090 --> 01:39:23.590
problem. So, keeping that in mind, this CI, CD pipeline,

01:39:24.170 --> 01:39:26.870
multiple environment creation, because if you are making a

01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:31.490
web project, forget about this AI project, you are building

01:39:31.490 --> 01:39:33.570
an app, you are making a development project, take any

01:39:33.570 --> 01:39:37.390
project, any IT infrastructure, any IT project, where code

01:39:37.390 --> 01:39:40.530
is involved. Right. So, everywhere, this, this happens by

01:39:40.530 --> 01:39:43.030
default. AI ML is also code, right? At the end of the day,

01:39:43.030 --> 01:39:45.130
what is the AI ML? It is code only. There are models that

01:39:45.130 --> 01:39:48.070
are being hosted somewhere. I mean, like nothing different.

01:39:48.410 --> 01:39:54.030
So, and here, 99% of the people don't know, especially the

01:39:54.030 --> 01:39:58.530
new people, the people who are learning. Yes. And if that

01:39:58.530 --> 01:40:01.190
comes, then believe me, you will be having a godly kind of

01:40:01.190 --> 01:40:02.490
feeling. Like, now you can manage the entire IT

01:40:02.490 --> 01:40:05.830
infrastructure. Now you can build any software. Yes, sir.

01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:08.350
You will get that kind of feeling. So, that is why this one

01:40:08.350 --> 01:40:12.050
is very important. And I am going to start that. You have

01:40:12.050 --> 01:40:13.710
already mentioned it in the syllabus. If you look at the

01:40:13.710 --> 01:40:16.930
syllabus, the third, I think, third last section, the second

01:40:16.930 --> 01:40:20.170
last section, I have purposely mentioned the whole CICD, all

01:40:20.170 --> 01:40:22.510
that has been mentioned already. No, sir. It will be very

01:40:22.510 --> 01:40:26.010
good. Because then you will get more value. As I just told

01:40:26.010 --> 01:40:28.490
you, in the end, it seems like everyone is dependent on a

01:40:28.490 --> 01:40:31.890
third person. After that, it will be mine. Yes, so it will

01:40:31.890 --> 01:40:34.750
not happen It will not happen after that phase. Okay? Yes,

01:40:34.790 --> 01:40:37.890
sir. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Just wait for another week. It

01:40:37.890 --> 01:40:40.430
will be done. Thank you. Thanks a lot. We will talk more

01:40:40.430 --> 01:40:43.550
about work and learn. Okay, so work and learn is basically a

01:40:43.550 --> 01:40:45.770
program that we have launched. So those who would like to

01:40:45.770 --> 01:40:48.150
get a real experience, not just education, because

01:40:48.150 --> 01:40:50.170
education, anyhow, we are giving under Iran Plus

01:40:50.170 --> 01:40:53.510
subscription and everything. So they are welcome to work and

01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:55.730
learn. So where you are going to work with a team, so team

01:40:55.730 --> 01:40:57.810
is going to give you a requirement. And anyone can join,

01:40:57.850 --> 01:41:00.650
student, fresher, like a working professional. So with

01:41:00.650 --> 01:41:02.670
working professional, team is going to connect Saturday,

01:41:02.690 --> 01:41:04.710
Sunday, right? They are going to talk about requirements.

01:41:04.830 --> 01:41:08.310
They will try to, you know, work with you. There is a lot of

01:41:08.310 --> 01:41:11.110
ongoing projects. A lot of projects are there internally. So

01:41:11.110 --> 01:41:13.210
even I am building a lot. I am launching a couple of more

01:41:13.210 --> 01:41:18.110
companies. And yeah, I have like a couple of more clients.

01:41:18.350 --> 01:41:20.610
So I do teaching on Saturday, Sunday, right? Apart from

01:41:20.610 --> 01:41:23.870
that, Monday to Friday. So I used to work in my SaaS and

01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:28.050
other products, which I am like launching very soon. So

01:41:28.050 --> 01:41:33.990
yeah, I mean like you can work with our team and basically

01:41:33.990 --> 01:41:36.310
you will be able to get a real experience. That is the

01:41:36.310 --> 01:41:40.210
meaning of work and learn. Yeah. Yeah. See, please go ahead.

01:41:40.270 --> 01:41:45.070
What is your question? Yeah. So can you share this? Allow me

01:41:45.070 --> 01:41:48.150
to share the screen. Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah, you can share the

01:41:48.150 --> 01:41:51.610
screen. So promote as a panelist. Yeah. Now you can share

01:41:51.610 --> 01:41:54.850
the screen. Pradeep is saying follow business and master

01:41:54.850 --> 01:41:58.130
hybrid mode course. Can you upload any videos, sir? Hybrid.

01:41:58.410 --> 01:42:01.030
I'm like, see, even I'm struggling to, you know, record the

01:42:01.030 --> 01:42:05.910
videos because sometimes it's very like so almost all the

01:42:05.910 --> 01:42:08.910
courses I have launched in live mode also. Right. I mean,

01:42:08.950 --> 01:42:12.030
like this was the whole idea behind your own plus right that

01:42:12.810 --> 01:42:15.830
we will keep on bringing a courses. So I believe you can see

01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:19.890
now that we have a courses we have never stopped launching a

01:42:19.890 --> 01:42:24.490
courses against mentor like who is going to take a business

01:42:24.490 --> 01:42:30.470
and analytics. So I think coming week. So Sachin has also

01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:38.190
given us a lot of video Sachin. Yeah. So no, there was so

01:42:38.190 --> 01:42:44.750
many videos. I think it's not here. All the videos. Sachin W

01:42:44.750 --> 01:42:50.910
English. Yeah. So we'll upload. I think W videos are like

01:42:50.910 --> 01:42:53.670
already three, three and a half hour content is already

01:42:53.670 --> 01:42:57.330
recorded from Sachin's side. We'll upload it. But yeah, I

01:42:57.330 --> 01:43:00.270
think live class will be fun. Live class is like interacting

01:43:00.270 --> 01:43:04.090
and interactive and we can come, we can talk. Doesn't matter

01:43:04.090 --> 01:43:06.590
whether I'm taking live class or other mentors. But yeah, we

01:43:06.590 --> 01:43:09.970
all work in a similar manner. Like, yeah, please share your

01:43:09.970 --> 01:43:12.350
screen. I think you have a permission. Yeah, already share

01:43:12.350 --> 01:43:15.670
the screen. Are you able to see this? Not yet.

01:43:22.250 --> 01:43:26.510
Sir, make an LLM, Google Gemini. See, building those LLMs

01:43:26.510 --> 01:43:29.270
are not a big deal. But yeah, we need an infra basically,

01:43:29.470 --> 01:43:33.590
which is like not cheap. It's it comes with millions of

01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:33.970
expenses

01:43:37.270 --> 01:43:38.630
or a government support.

01:43:42.300 --> 01:43:45.020
So now are you able to see my screen? Yes, I can see your

01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:51.100
screen. Yeah. So I think actually I worked on bedrock quite

01:43:51.100 --> 01:43:57.680
extensively, right? So here, if you'll see this, so custom

01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:05.040
model, right? Here only to fine tune the model, it allows us

01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:09.300
to other models, but to train the model, we need to only use

01:44:09.300 --> 01:44:16.140
the Amazon which is its own model. So that's and my question

01:44:16.140 --> 01:44:22.240
is, is what is the base and Azure have the open AI or other

01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:26.620
models, right? So where they allow you to train the model,

01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:30.340
to train the model, right? So what are your suggestions to

01:44:30.340 --> 01:44:36.340
stay going AWS to train the model? Basically my suggestion

01:44:36.340 --> 01:44:39.900
always in terms of doing a fine tuning, or maybe if you are

01:44:39.900 --> 01:44:42.840
trying to do a like a fine tuning, or maybe if you are

01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:45.980
trying to train the model from the scratch, just go with

01:44:45.980 --> 01:44:48.920
your own instance, go with your own server. So if you are

01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:52.220
using AWS, just use EC2 instances or maybe take a GPU,

01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:55.960
right? Or maybe just try to use some other vendor, but

01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:58.960
always go with a custom approach, custom fine tuning or

01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:02.020
custom model building. See, even in open AI, if you will go

01:45:02.020 --> 01:45:05.120
and log in right inside their admin portal itself, they're

01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:08.640
giving you fine tuning option, go upload a JSON data in a

01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:11.700
particular format and then select a type of fine tuning that

01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:15.020
you would like to do, right? RLHF or maybe like a, you know,

01:45:15.020 --> 01:45:20.380
a full fine tuning, anything, but my advice to everyone who

01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:23.480
would like to do a fine tuning is not to follow any of this

01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:28.220
approach. Okay. So, so your suggestion is not to use the

01:45:28.220 --> 01:45:31.720
bedrock then not to use bedrock, not to use even Azure for a

01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:35.540
model, fine tuning, use just their instances means machine.

01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:41.580
Okay. So, so but when you build a model from the sketch,

01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:44.840
that I'm not saying build a model from the scratch, right?

01:45:44.980 --> 01:45:49.880
So, it's correct me is a not from the scratch. It is taking

01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:53.280
a foundation model then build exactly. Yeah. And all those

01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:55.660
best foundation models are already available in hugging face

01:45:55.660 --> 01:45:59.940
or in other repositories. Right. Okay. Even from open AI

01:45:59.940 --> 01:46:04.760
open a 20 B OSS 20 B OSS 120 B is already available. It's

01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:08.500
open source model, right? Open it even from deep seek, even

01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:11.680
from mistral, even from Lama series, you will find out all

01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:15.140
the best model available out there. Yeah. Okay. Take those

01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:17.400
models, take those financial models, model and then just

01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:20.360
spin the instances the way we have a spin, the GPUs and

01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:23.500
everything. Right. And then do a fine tuning over there.

01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:26.120
That will be the best approach and everything will be under

01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:30.360
your control. Okay. Okay. Because if you're, if you're using

01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:32.500
bedrock, right, they're giving you a limited model itself.

01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:35.620
What you will do with that? Let me like the model that they

01:46:35.620 --> 01:46:38.900
are giving you except this entropic cloud, right? None of

01:46:38.900 --> 01:46:43.280
the model is best. All these models are very, very old. So

01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:45.460
if I'm building some, yeah, so if I'm building some

01:46:45.460 --> 01:46:49.040
application today, I'm like, it doesn't make sense for me to

01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:55.200
use those models, basically, unless you will train it here

01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:59.700
or the pint unit. The thing is that even if you're going to

01:46:59.700 --> 01:47:02.400
train and fine tune it, right, you will be depends upon this

01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:06.540
AWS infrastructure, this bedrock infrastructure, you will

01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:09.980
not be able to isolate it because you model will be trained

01:47:09.980 --> 01:47:12.480
here and you will be doing inferencing. Same open AI does

01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:15.300
right. So that you know, you will end up paying to open AI

01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:18.060
now. Why, why I will do that? I will try to host it on my

01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:21.700
own infrastructure. I will be having my own control. Right.

01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:28.140
Okay. So, so, yeah. Yeah. And in case of open, um, model,

01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:31.120
which one you were suggesting either Mr. Lord, a Lama three

01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:37.120
or five. Uh, yeah. So basically try to pick and choose your

01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:40.220
task that to follow each task and which domain you are doing

01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:43.700
a training light and then go with the model selection. Try

01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:47.260
to check that, uh, which this model is, is good on Vistas

01:47:47.260 --> 01:47:50.680
because every model is not good on every task. Right. And

01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:54.400
what is the purpose of like your training? So accordingly we

01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:57.760
have to select the models blindly. We can't go blindly. I

01:47:57.760 --> 01:47:59.880
can say that, that all of these cities are actually good.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:03.300
Lama series also very, very good, very powerful, right? Open

01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:06.440
AI OSS is also very good, very powerful and engaged with the

01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:10.040
data set. Like, uh, again, Mr. Series is very good. Deep six

01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:12.540
series is very good. So all of these cities are actually

01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:16.320
very good, but yeah, so selection depends upon like how I'm

01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:18.120
going to do it. I'm going to train which model I'm going to

01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:22.420
pick, which model is very, very small, but, uh, it has been

01:48:22.420 --> 01:48:25.000
trained on a big data, right? So that, you know, I can, I

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.960
can, uh, like, uh, it is, it is going to consume less of my

01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:33.200
hardware or less of my resources. Basically. Okay. Okay.

01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:36.620
And, uh, one more question is, uh, today you mentioned that,

01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:42.900
uh, bad, um, database, right? So database in terms of, in

01:48:42.900 --> 01:48:46.160
terms of, uh, RDS, basically RDS. I was talking, oh yeah.

01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:49.540
Okay. RDS is a service. It was RDS. Yeah. Uh, no, I'm not,

01:48:49.540 --> 01:48:53.200
I'm not talking about this, um, RDS and AWS. I'm talking

01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:55.820
about the database that you mentioned. Okay. Sorry.

01:48:56.140 --> 01:48:59.680
Databricks. I was like, uh, I thought it was database. Okay.

01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:03.260
Databricks. Yeah. Databricks. So, so, if I compare, uh,

01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:07.560
because you walked on so many things, uh, if I compare, uh,

01:49:07.700 --> 01:49:11.200
for the large data sets, because the thing, uh, and all

01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:15.360
things, right. Or in memory, uh, things which, which, uh,

01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:19.500
database, a spark suppose, right. So, uh, in, in that case,

01:49:19.620 --> 01:49:22.920
you, uh, so normally better to go with the database instead

01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:26.300
of, uh, see Databricks in terms of CD data storage, I would

01:49:26.300 --> 01:49:29.800
say, uh, so database already provides a DBFS database file

01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:32.580
system, which is an internal file system. Apart from that,

01:49:32.660 --> 01:49:36.940
Databricks allows you to Mount it on any external file

01:49:36.940 --> 01:49:39.920
system. For example, on top of Azure blobs, you will be able

01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:43.260
to Mount it on top of AWS S3. Also, you will be able to

01:49:43.260 --> 01:49:45.680
Mount it. So database technically provides all three

01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:49.480
configurations. GCS like a GCP configuration, Azure and

01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:52.100
Delbus configuration. So you can try to Mount it. So if I

01:49:52.100 --> 01:49:55.160
can Mount it, it simply means that, that I have a infinite

01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:58.780
limitation in terms of like, you know, size of the data. So,

01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:03.860
and database scalable, exactly, exactly right. Uh, so by

01:50:03.860 --> 01:50:06.540
default, if you're going to use our DBFS, so again, there

01:50:06.540 --> 01:50:09.000
will be some limitation in terms of the size of the data,

01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:13.020
right. But in a paid mode, no limitation at all. Uh, again,

01:50:13.100 --> 01:50:16.160
so there is a Databricks and there is something called as a,

01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:19.080
Azure Databricks means you can go to database platform. You

01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:21.840
can launch a database. That's an option. And then from

01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:24.600
there, you will be able to attach to your cloud means

01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:27.180
basically you will be able to attach to AWS. You will be

01:50:27.180 --> 01:50:29.780
able to attach to GCP. You will be able to attach to, uh,

01:50:29.900 --> 01:50:35.800
like, uh, AWS, GCP and Azure. And inside Azure itself, you

01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:39.680
can even go and launch Azure Databricks. So by default, it

01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:45.060
uses other sources of Azure in AWS. It's not available

01:50:45.060 --> 01:50:49.360
basically. yeah, it obviously I have seen few months back

01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:53.880
that it's also support Databricks. Yeah, no, no, even now

01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:56.160
support database. This is, this is what I'm trying to say.

01:50:56.280 --> 01:50:59.640
So just log into a Databricks from there, you will be able

01:50:59.640 --> 01:51:04.080
to connect to a database account. Okay. Okay. So basically

01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:06.940
see the quick insight, right? So here documentation wise,

01:51:07.450 --> 01:51:11.220
just, just follow the last one. So database parameter, it

01:51:11.220 --> 01:51:15.040
was the below one. Yeah. Mm. The below and database

01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:17.220
parameter or something. Like that. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

01:51:17.220 --> 01:51:20.020
Basically launch a Databricks and from Databricks, just

01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:23.000
like, uh, you know, uh, configure it with AWS means mounted

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:28.000
on AWS. Hmm. So, so, so that updates does not provide us to,

01:51:28.140 --> 01:51:32.920
um, any model that we, uh, AWS or Azure did. No, they are

01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:35.440
providing actually a better model. Just do one thing, log in

01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:37.500
into database. I'll show you now itself. It's a two minute

01:51:37.500 --> 01:51:40.900
job. Data is actually providing you models as well. And, uh,

01:51:41.460 --> 01:51:44.560
their model is very, very extensive as compared to AWS. I

01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:47.380
mean, like as compared to bedrock, uh, or like a snowflake,

01:51:47.890 --> 01:51:52.480
sorry, bedrock and SageMaker. Just, just log in, just log in

01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:57.120
into Databricks, Google login. Yeah. Click on login.

01:52:01.660 --> 01:52:04.420
Yeah. Simply Google with the Google in

01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:13.540
the East end days, they have made this platform very, very

01:52:13.540 --> 01:52:16.580
powerful for personal use. Yeah. Free. Yes. Second version.

01:52:16.700 --> 01:52:23.480
Second option. Yeah. So, uh, five, six years back, I use it

01:52:23.480 --> 01:52:28.840
for one of our data, like projects in HP. So, but at that

01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:33.640
time it was horrible. Uh, so I know, I know, I know because

01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:35.760
I've been using it since the beginning itself. So I know it

01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:38.240
was horrible actually, but now it is actually very good.

01:52:38.740 --> 01:52:42.200
It's actually very powerful. So mainly industry. Now, uh,

01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:46.080
most of the people, sir, uh, walking on this side. Exactly.

01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:49.020
People have already started adopting and, uh, yeah. Majority

01:52:49.020 --> 01:52:50.480
of people have like, uh, adopted it.

01:52:55.640 --> 01:52:59.380
Yes. We'll have to, uh, somebody to somebody to start the

01:52:59.380 --> 01:53:02.360
puzzle. It will take like a couple of tickets. Uh, no, no,

01:53:02.380 --> 01:53:07.420
no, no. You have to select the rock. Okay. Three. Okay.

01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:08.420
Let's try again.

01:53:11.350 --> 01:53:13.610
Okay. One, two, three, four, five. Go to the next, next,

01:53:13.630 --> 01:53:16.830
next, select the next one. I think it's, uh, what they're

01:53:16.830 --> 01:53:19.390
saying, right? There is a five rock. No, no, no, they will

01:53:19.390 --> 01:53:22.990
fail. Select, select, select, complete the puzzle first.

01:53:24.010 --> 01:53:27.210
This one. Yeah. Select the four rocks. Okay. Next check.

01:53:27.250 --> 01:53:29.490
Next one, two, three, four. Yeah. Select, select last one.

01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:36.450
Last one. No, it is your photo. Okay. Okay. Oh, one minute.

01:53:37.230 --> 01:53:39.110
Yeah. Four logs summit.

01:53:47.490 --> 01:53:50.270
So you can, you can go and you can, you can check your free

01:53:50.270 --> 01:53:52.650
time. So they're already giving you all the models, all the

01:53:52.650 --> 01:53:55.590
elements models, like, uh, I mean like more than a bedrock

01:53:55.590 --> 01:53:58.290
and Sage maker, they're giving you now and now this is

01:53:58.290 --> 01:54:01.050
literally very good. So if you will start using it now, so

01:54:01.050 --> 01:54:04.930
you will be having a very good experience. Okay. Okay. Fine.

01:54:05.170 --> 01:54:08.990
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. Fine.

01:54:09.030 --> 01:54:11.290
Everyone. Thank you so much. Take care and see you again

01:54:11.290 --> 01:54:14.410
next last Saturday. So I believe agenda is fixed. Yes. The

01:54:14.410 --> 01:54:16.930
pipeline and project we are going to start from next week

01:54:16.930 --> 01:54:18.670
onwards. Thank you so much. Take care of everyone. Thank

01:54:18.670 --> 01:54:18.810
you.
