WEBVTT

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.880
okay so hello everyone good morning and we are going to

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.000
start a class in like next couple of minute good morning

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.280
good morning everyone okay

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.830
so it's uh 905 guys and i believe all of us have joined so

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.930
shall we start a class yeah everyone class start when a chat

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:45.250
disable please yes for sure uh good morning good morning

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.830
good morning everyone i can see all good morning messages

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.950
okay so does deep learning nlp is required for this class as

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.690
i mentioned in roadmap so if you are going ahead with a full

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.210
stack data science and then if you are coming uh like for

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.170
this generative way then obviously deep learning nlp is

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.950
required otherwise uh it's not required so we have made it

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.290
like a independent of each other uh

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.360
good morning sir a small question how uri is different from

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.880
popxlity uh so yeah popxlity is also giving you a multiple

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.860
model access and majorly popxlity is trying to solve a

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.560
google search problem and here so we are trying to give you

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.220
a multiple again llm access and we are trying to solve

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.840
almost a similar kind of a problem so that you don't have to

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.940
go anywhere for a chat or for any your any of your ai need

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:39.440
plus api access so i believe popxlity is also giving you a

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.560
five dollar of credit in terms of api access but here so you

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.580
are getting more in terms of offering is

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.430
there same thing something wrong

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.290
why to pick a phone from your own every time for everything

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:09.210
i mean like you are able to join the class i think that

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:15.170
solves your problem yeah okay so uh now guys uh let's start

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:17.770
uh so basically today i'm going to talk about a vector

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.430
database so not just today so even today and tomorrow so i'm

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:24.750
i will be talking about a vector databases plus in my last

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.150
class in my previous class so i have already discussed about

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:31.310
apis and i have given you a assignment so i am going to talk

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.250
about the assignments a kind of a challenge and i have seen

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.950
that that many people have already done that right so many

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:40.470
people were able to solve the assignments and uh yeah uh

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:43.430
many people were not able to solve the assignment and maybe

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:48.250
you have not tried maybe you have not attempted so go ahead

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.850
attempt it yeah that is going to help you out a lot believe

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.310
me that is going to help you out and you can go and ask to

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:57.390
the people who have already solved the assignment so they

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:01.310
are able to get a real real kind of a knowledge so i'll keep

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:01.350
you up to date and i will see you in the next class bye keep

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.530
on giving you assignment a lot of assignment a lot of

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:07.230
challenges and yes your responsibility is to solve it and if

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:12.760
you are not solving it then you will not be able to fill the

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.180
gap simple yeah so only behook part is remaining challenge

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.560
was awesome that's amazing yeah so solve it solve the behook

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.320
part so behook is also a kind of api so where you are

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.660
sending a post request uh at some like uh triggers basically

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.600
or whenever you are observing some sort of an event so it's

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.100
not very

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.480
different definition so yeah it's different but yes in terms

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:41.000
of a creation it's not very different fine everyone so let's

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.920
get started it's working now okay so please uh redirect from

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:52.180
here yeah so i believe live class right so i have already

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.160
updated a live class date and link inside your dashboard

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.720
there was some it is some conversation which is going inside

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.740
uh that's uh whatsapp group i believe okay okay fine not an

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:09.380
issue fine guys uh let's start so do we have to submit the

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.200
last assignment anywhere no you don't have to submit

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.340
assignments so basically uh i have asked everyone to discuss

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.760
your assignment and share your assignment with your

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.020
teammates with your batchmates basically so it's not an

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.560
assignment where you are going to submit i'm going to

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.140
evaluate because we are not in college basically we are not

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:29.020
like i keep on saying this lines right that we are not in a

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:32.120
college we are not preparing for the exam uh we are trying

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.440
to build something we are like learning all of these things

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.160
so that we can build uh develop some of the tools some of

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.600
the functionalities on our own so we'll follow the exact

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.700
same pattern so that will progress towards that particular

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:52.260
path uh now i'm going to uh disable a chat so you will be

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:56.220
able to chat with me right and after a live class obviously

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.640
i'm going to enable it yeah so that we all can chat

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:07.520
okay so now let's get started guys and like i said so today

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:13.040
i will be talking about uh vector database now so i believe

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.760
we all are aware about our databases uh we have so many

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.880
different different kind of databases in a market and we

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.660
have been using our databases in almost all the application

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.480
uh doesn't matter which application you are going to build

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:29.220
maybe a web application maybe a mobile application maybe a

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.540
ai ml kind of application you are going to build obviously

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.660
you will end up using some sort of a databases to store a

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.060
data to process a data in a step-by-step manner so

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.900
everywhere databases are required right and we have been

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:48.120
using our databases uh since a age i would say so obviously

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.760
uh the kind of a database that we are using now the kind of

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.720
a database that we were using maybe a two or three decade

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.660
back it was different obviously in terms of a scale in terms

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:01.140
of feature and functionalities but we have been using it so

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:06.300
here uh the thing is that that we are going to introduce a

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:10.820
new kind of a database in a generative AI and that database

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:16.360
is called as a vector data base so you might have heard

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:21.040
about a database called as a sequel database maybe right so

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:25.680
where my sequel or MS sequel or maybe a DB2 maybe a postgres

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.520
sequel or sequelite so all these things comes in between

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.000
right so you might have heard about a sequel database right

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.880
everyone yeah I believe we all have heard about a database

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:41.820
SQL at least yes so SQL database always try to stores a data

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.400
in a tabular format you can say right so where you will be

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.180
having a column names you will be having technically a

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.920
schema and then inside that so you try to store a data and

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.620
then it will generally go for a sequential search right so

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.800
whenever you will try to find some sort of a data one by one

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.520
one by one in a sequential search manner so it will try to

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:06.080
find out the data set from your tables basically so wherever

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.220
we had a structured data right completely structured data so

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.200
structured means a kind of a data where you can define the

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.500
schema means column name right and then accordingly you can

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.580
try to store it so this is where a SQL kind of a system

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:24.240
comes into a picture then in a later stage a no SQL no SQL

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:29.880
means not only SQL so no SQL kind of a DB became very very

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:30.000
powerful and then in a later stage no SQL kind of a DB

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:30.340
became very very powerful and then in a later stage no SQL

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:31.340
kind of a DB became very very popular so where it was

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.620
allowing you to store a popular so where it was allowing you

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:36.640
to store a data without even creating a schema in a format

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:40.640
of a document or maybe in a form of a graph or maybe in a

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.880
form of a time series so for example we have a MongoDB we

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.960
have a Cassandra we have a influx DB we have Google big

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:53.380
query table uh we have uh like a HBase by the way so key

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:59.140
value pair so we have a lot of no SQL kind a new 4J right so

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:03.720
we have a lot of no SQL kind of a databases so where we can

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.420
try to store a data in a form of a document or maybe in a

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:10.600
form of a time series maybe in a form of a graph

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.920
relationships are different different like for purposes are

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.540
different different kind of a DB has been designed ultimate

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:20.840
goal was to store a data right and make read and write

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:24.200
faster that was the ultimate goal right so that I will be

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.160
able to read a data and I will be able to write a data as

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:33.040
fast as possible depends upon the nature of the data. Now so

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:37.500
when this generative AI becoming like became popular in last

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:41.980
like a three years. So people have started thinking about a

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:47.300
new kind of a databases, new kind of a databases and they

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:51.620
have named it as a vector DB. Now what is the meaning of a

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:55.000
vector by the way, what kind of a data we will be able to

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.360
store in those vector DB, what kind of advantages I will be

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.480
able to get out of that vector DB, where we are going to use

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.660
that vector DB in a generative AI application or maybe in

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:10.000
any other application apart from generative AI. So there are

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.860
so many questions you all will get in general, right. So

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:17.820
when you will start studying about this vector database and

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:20.680
we will try to answer those questions in my today's class.

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:27.360
Yeah, fine everyone. Yep. So context is clear. What we are

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.720
going to do, yeah, I was just trying to set the context by

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:36.460
the way, fine. So there was a SQL DB, there was a no SQL

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:40.060
kind of a DB and there is a vector DB. So in case of

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:43.560
generative AI application in general, so we are going to use

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.060
a vector database. Now we'll try to explain you, we'll try

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:52.440
to explain you that how internally these vector database is

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.500
going to work. What is a meaning? What is the meaning of a

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:58.520
vector by the way? So we'll try to understand that as well.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:03.480
We are going to even do an installation later stage, maybe

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.880
in a second half of this class, we are going to do an

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:09.080
installation and after doing the installation. So we'll try

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:13.720
to convert our data set into an embedding. So where your URI

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.740
API is very much required without that, you will not be able

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:21.140
to do it. And then we'll try to store those data inside a

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:24.380
vector DB and then we'll try to do some sort of a query.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:28.480
Right. We'll try to do some sort of a query and we'll try to

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.720
understand that as per my query, what is our response I'm

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.740
receiving. So in a step by step manner, we'll try to move.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:41.260
So let's get started guys. So let me share my Scribble Inc.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.920
SCR. Yeah.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:50.150
Okay. So vector

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:03.510
DB, vector database, basically we are going to discuss. Now.

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:08.490
So. So what is vector? First of all, any idea guys, what is

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:12.150
vector? Yeah. Any idea?

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:21.380
What is the meaning of a vector by the way? So list of a

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:28.180
scalar collection, why we can't we use NOE that exist having

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:31.620
both magnitude and direction. Okay. Just give me a layman

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.980
example. I'm not looking for some fancy example. I'm not

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:37.200
looking for like, you know, kind of example, which no one

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.120
can understand. A layman example. Let me give you an

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:44.900
example. I'm like looking for to get a similarity search,

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:49.020
okay, velocity, give a number of values arrow we use in

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:55.120
math. Okay. So we are getting some amazing answer. Okay.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:17:01.060
Okay. Convert into a numerical value magnitude. A vector is

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:05.200
a simple way to store and compare information using numbers.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:11.640
Okay. Convert into a numerical value. Okay. Array, matrix,

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.780
direction and magnitude. Okay.

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:31.680
Okay, so basically, see, so in mathematics, generally, we

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.520
try to talk about a scalar entity and we talk about

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:39.100
basically a vector entity, right. So we talk about a vector

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:43.700
entity. So a scalar is nothing but a kind of a data, right,

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.620
a kind of a data, which will be having only a magnitude. For

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:52.100
example, or weightage, you can say, for example, if I'm

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.300
trying to write 10 over here, right, a simple 10, if I'm

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.980
going to write over here, so simple 10 means it's

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:02.320
representing a value, maybe a 10 numbers, so 10 unit of

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.620
something, 10 unit of a mobile phone, 10 unit of apple,

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:10.240
orange, mango, guava, whatever, right, or maybe a 10 kg it

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.400
is going to represent, maybe 10 quintal it is going to

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.600
represent, maybe a 10 meter it is going to represent, right.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:21.880
So basically, this 10 is a scalar because it is just having

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:25.920
a magnitude attached with this one. So I will be able to

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.980
when someone is saying that, okay, fine, so the weight is 10

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:33.840
kg. So I will be able to understand just that magnitude that

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.240
okay, fine. So that's that weightage, right of that value, I

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.760
will be able to understand. And then obviously, I will be

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.340
able to do a comparison. So maybe someone has like a written

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:46.320
8. So I can say that that okay, so 10 is greater than 8. And

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.960
I am just trying to do the comparison with respect to the

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:53.260
magnitude over here. And this is technically called as

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:57.880
scalar entity, a kind of entity, which is going to have just

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:02.520
a magnitude, nothing else, right, nothing else. But let's

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:07.040
suppose, right. So let's suppose I have a coordinate, right.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.140
So let's suppose I have a coordinate, let's suppose x1 and

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:15.980
y1, and if I am going to represent this coordinate as 1,1.

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:19.400
Right. If I am going to represent this particular coordinate

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:24.560
as 1,1. So can I say that, that here we have a magnitude,

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:29.180
right. So here we have a magnitude as well as we have a

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:34.220
direction, yeah. So to represent this coordinate, generally

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.880
we say, right, latitude, longitude, yeah, latitude,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.220
longitude. So you will be able to get a coordinate and the

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.700
coordinate looks something like this, let's suppose. So

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.740
here. So whenever we are trying to say that we have x1 and

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:51.400
y1 and 1,1. So 1 for x1, 1 for y1 we have over here. Then

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:56.260
you will be able to represent this entity on your 2D plane,

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.200
right, on your 2D plane. So let's suppose this is my x axis

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.640
and this is my y axis. This is my origin. So here we have 1,

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.960
here we have 2, here we have 3. Again we have 1, again we

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:10.360
have 2 and again we have 3 over here. Now if we have to

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:14.700
represent this 1,1, right. 1,1. So what is the magnitude of

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.960
x? So technically it is a 1. So till this point, right. What

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:21.080
is the magnitude of y? So basically it is a this one, this

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:25.880
much, right. So here if I am going to combine both, so this

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.920
point, right, this particular point is going to represent

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:33.580
what x1, y1, yeah, this particular point. And if I am going

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:39.540
to draw an arrow over here, so this is like a, I can simply

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:43.980
say that that, okay. This x1, y1, so in case of x1, y1, so

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:50.280
it is 1 unit far from origin on x direction and 1 unit far

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:54.840
from origin in y direction. So this is how I can call it out

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.900
in general, right, how I will be able to call it out. And

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:01.220
here, so this arrow which I am trying to draw as of now. So

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:04.820
obviously it is trying to suggest me some sort of a

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:08.900
direction with a magnitude, right. So technically. This

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:13.460
entity will become a vector entity. So wherever, we have a

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:17.160
magnitude, right, wherever we have a magnitude as well as we

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.580
have a direction. So in some direction, we are moving,

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:24.480
right? So when I have said like 1 comma 1, so you cannot

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.180
move in this direction. So you have to move only in this

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:29.980
direction because this is the direction of 1 comma 1. So you

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:34.160
have a proper direction given to you. Now this entity is

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:38.860
technically represented as a vector entity. Hi! making sense

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:43.460
guys yeah making sense so in this a 2D coordinate so we are

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:47.580
able to represent this entity as simple as that now there is

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:53.780
a possibility that we have x1 comma y1 comma z1 may be

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:59.280
something like this so 1 comma 0 comma 2 now this is going

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:04.000
to represent a 3D data right three-dimension data so I need

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.880
x-axis I need y-axis as well as I need a z-axis somewhere so

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.320
I need a z-axis if I have to represent this data in certain

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.060
plane right in a 3D plane if I have to represent this data

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:18.880
so obviously I have to consider height length and width all

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:22.120
three together in general right so then whenever like you

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.600
will look into the room where you are sitting even as of now

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:28.420
so you will we must be able to find out a height you will be

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.840
able to find out a width you will be able to find out a

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:35.040
length length so basically we all are living into a 3D space

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:39.580
we as a human being are living into a 3D space so any dot in

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:42.660
this space you will be able to represent it by using three

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:46.140
coordinates any dots right any dots and here so where I am

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.580
trying to write all of these things so this plane is

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:52.940
technically a 2D plane yeah 2D plane so where I am trying to

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:58.360
like a write each and everything now so if I have may be a

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:04.320
data set something like x1 y1 x2 y1 z1 and may be a1 yeah so

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:08.640
again this is basically a 4D data set now to represent this

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:12.960
data set in this particular manner I need a 4D plane which

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:17.280
is eventually not possible so yes I can imagine I can

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:21.260
virtually create this 4D plane but practically it is not

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:25.120
possible but yes practically it is possible to represent any

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:29.340
kind of a data in four dimension right practically it is

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:32.040
possible to represent some data. into five dimension

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:36.280
practically it is possible to represent a data into a

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:40.540
thousand dimension also right although you will not be able

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:43.940
to visualize it although you will not be able to see it but

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:47.020
yes practically it is possible to represent those kind of a

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.720
data into that many number of dimension may be into a

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.280
thousand dimension which we are going to do it today itself

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.160
so we are going to represent our data set into a 1536

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.640
dimension we will show you that we will show you that. But

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.900
the meaning of. Of technical meaning of a vector is very

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:06.480
simple so if we have a magnitude and along with that if we

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.840
have a dimension so that entity is technically called as

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:14.440
vector right that entity is technically called as vector now

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:20.320
so why we are even talking about a vector over here that is

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.040
a very first question right we are able to understand that

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:26.780
what is vector but why we are even talking about a vector.

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:31.820
So see guys. In case of generative AI right in case of

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:35.940
generative AI we will end up dealing with lots of

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:39.100
unstructured data or you can say that that we will end up

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:44.040
dealing with lots of kind of a data so where you will not be

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:47.640
able to find out any kind of a schema set right so you will

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:51.220
end up dealing with lots of sentences lots of phrases or

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:54.780
maybe such kind of a lines or maybe a prompts right so we

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:57.940
try to write a prompt just like a plain English and you will

00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:59.700
be able to use it. The beauty of generative AI is that

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:03.920
majority of application you will be able to use it or you

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:08.840
will be able to get an outcome just as a English right just

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:12.420
as a English which is technically a unstructured data set so

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:15.180
maybe you will try to give an input as an unstructured and

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:19.560
you will receive an output as an unstructured data set. Now

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:24.320
so system when I talk about this unstructured data set for

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:32.680
example if I am trying to say that. My name is. My name is S

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:37.540
U D H right so when I say this to a system system will never

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:40.240
be able to understand this English language never means

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:43.420
literally never it will be able to understand this English

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:47.580
language system understands only one two things zero and one

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:50.300
binary this is how this entire computer system has been

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:54.520
built right. So system just understand a numeric value and

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.880
again on a low level so it is just going to understand. One

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:01.280
and one and whenever we talk about a computer the computer

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.620
that we are using as of now at the end of the day it will be

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:07.620
able to do a mathematical calculation but it will never be

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:11.420
able to understand these words these alphabets even though

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:14.680
we try to give input as alphabet but again it will never be

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:17.800
able to understand so eventually it try to convert each and

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.460
everything maybe into an ASCII maybe into some different

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:24.380
representation that we are going to use it case by case and

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:27.500
it will be able to do a mathematical calculation. And as an

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:32.980
output you will be able to see the final result. Now now so

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:36.940
here like I said so in case of a generative AI majority of

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:40.760
time not majority I would say 99.9% of the time you will be

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.760
dealing with this kind of a sentences right you will be

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:47.800
dealing with this kind of a complete unstructured data. Now

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.800
so you will have to do a comparison between two data set

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:55.160
right you will have to maybe like do a lot of like a

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.540
prompting over there. Based on the prompt so you will be

00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:00.160
able to get the answer maybe you will end up doing a lot of

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.700
search operation over there so based on the similarity so it

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.960
should it should be able to give you the output. So at the

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.640
end of the day the only thing is that that we will be

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:13.340
dealing with kind of a unstructured data. Now when we are

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:18.060
dealing with unstructured data but where the similarity of

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:21.580
the data matters a lot right similarity means the connection

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:25.060
between two data set matters a lot so that system will be

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:28.100
able to give you the data. Better output or the nearest

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:31.860
output system will be able to give you so at that point of

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:36.560
time I need a kind of a evaluation I need a kind of a

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:40.220
parameter so which can help me out to give me a better and

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:42.980
better result based on the similarity between two sentences

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:47.160
for example if I have written my name is dhanshu is equals

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:51.920
to sentence number one right and then if I have written sudh

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:58.620
is my name right. So both the sentence I have phrased it in

00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:01.720
a very very different way my name is dhanshu and sudh is my

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:06.100
name so both the sentences is almost similar right but if

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:09.040
you are going to do a word to word matching so maybe it will

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:17.640
not look that similar to you. Now so apple is red sentence

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.980
number three now there is no similarity between this this

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:25.680
and the last sentence which I have written apple is red. So

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:29.560
obviously I need some evaluation. I need some parameter so

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:33.860
whenever I have to do a comparison between any of these two

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:37.940
sentences any of these two sentences I will be able to do a

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:41.380
comparison. I will be able to like a evaluate that okay fine

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:45.460
so which sentence is closer to which one right and this is

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:51.500
to do that right to do that I have to convert these entire

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:55.940
data into a numerical representation unless and until I am

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:57.900
not going to convert this data into a numerical

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:01.800
representation I will not be able to do a math I will not be

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.000
able to do a calculation and here so in one of the sentences

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.620
maybe I just have four or like a three or two words but

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:11.080
there is a possibility that I will end up getting a sentence

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:14.760
where in just one sentence I will be having a hundred two

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:18.160
hundred words and that too not equivalent so in different

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.040
different sentences I will end up getting a different

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.940
different kind of a words and that is going to create a kind

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:28.680
of a problem for me. So keeping that in a mind. We try to

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:33.240
convert this entire data set into a vector into a vector

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.880
vector means maybe into two dimension maybe into three

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.940
dimension maybe into hundred dimension maybe into a thousand

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:44.920
dimension means so in this 2D so we try to represent let's

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:48.140
suppose different different different different kind of a

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:51.680
data set now when we are able to represent this data set

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:55.040
over here so obviously I will be able to do distance

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:58.020
matching or maybe I will be able to find out that okay fine

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:02.420
so which one is far which one is near and based on that I

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:04.640
will be able to tell you that okay fine so this data is

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.800
similar to this one or that data is similar to that one but

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:11.300
yes the very first role and responsibility of mine will be

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:15.460
to represent this data into a vector space or into a

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:19.180
numerical format right into a numerical format. Now once my

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:23.260
data set is available into a vector format then go ahead do

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:26.220
the math and then you will be able to find out the final

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:31.900
result. Now on the question so when I say that try to find

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:35.340
out a similarity between two data set right try to find out

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:39.880
similarity between two data set so maybe I can try to match

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:44.240
or I can try to find out a distance so based on a distance

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:48.220
we will be able to evaluate that how far this data set is

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:51.860
from this one or maybe this data set is from this one one

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:55.640
possibility right there is other possibility that you will

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.460
be able to find out. So let us suppose I have two data set

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:01.960
right so this is one data set which I am trying to represent

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:07.720
in 2D coordinate so x1 y1 let us suppose x1 y1 and this is

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:11.520
the another data set I am trying to represent x2 y2 and

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:15.200
obviously both of this data set is technically a 2D vector.

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:19.300
There is a possibility that based on the angle right based

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:23.040
on the angle between the data I will be able to do a

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:26.320
similarity search. I will be able to do a mapping that okay.

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:31.720
So how far or how near this data set is from this one and

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:37.280
maybe I have another data set over here so again I can try

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:42.460
to maybe do a mapping between this and this or maybe this

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:46.000
and this and based on the angle I will be able to say that

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.020
okay so which one is near to which one. So this is where the

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:54.520
similarity search comes into a picture and again to find out

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:59.660
a similarity between two data. data set I need a vector I

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:03.160
need a numerical numerical value without a numerical value I

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:07.280
will not be able to do any such kind of a things we will try

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.320
to understand that how similarity search calculation is

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.840
going to happen I will show you the manual calculation as

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:16.420
well right but is this fundamentals clear to all of us guys

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.780
that what is the meaning of vector the very first

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:23.280
fundamental what we are going to do with the data set how we

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.660
are going to do it. We will talk about it. But what we are

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:26.960
going to do. What we are going to do with respect to a data

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:33.140
set is it clear and again so what is a basic definition of

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:37.180
matching between a data. So maybe with the help of angles

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:40.320
maybe with the help of distances so we are going to find out

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:44.180
basically a matching between a data how how calibration is

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:49.120
going to happen will show you yeah will show you okay. So

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.880
Chirag is saying that but we were doing kind of a similarity

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:55.140
search in RDBMS and NoSQL databases earlier as well. For

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:59.000
example a regex like operator where specifically we thought

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.120
of going. So why specifically we thought of going to the

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:08.100
vector DB. See so we have been doing a similarity search not

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:12.240
just like a now inside a vector database but even inside a

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:16.460
elastic search DB or maybe in other DBs now over there. So

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:19.720
we try to do a key value pair mapping or based on the

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:22.700
hashing. So we were trying to store our data and whenever we

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:25.720
try to do a search. So based on the index. Based on the

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.920
hazing that it will be able to find out it was trying to

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:32.460
give me a result right. And this is what it has been like a

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:35.960
we have been doing in case of a SQL in case of a NoSQL

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:40.440
databases. But here. So when I have to do a sentence to

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.960
sentence comparison right sentence to sentence comparison

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:46.240
and not just that right sentence to sentence comparison

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:50.300
means I'm not saying that I'm trying to do a word to word

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:52.640
kind of a matching. No. That is important. That's completely

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:57.940
fine right. have to take care of semantic and we have to

00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:01.940
take care of a syntactic, both means. So we have to take

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:04.940
care of even a grammar that which one is going to come

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:07.960
after, which one is going to come before, we have to even

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:11.660
take care of a punctuation and keeping all of these things

00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:16.200
in a mind, keeping all of these things in a mind, we have to

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:21.360
do a search, then your NoSQL based similarity search or SQL

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.080
based similarity search is going to fail and then you have

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:27.540
to adopt this particular approach, yes, this particular

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:30.440
approach, why, what is the reason? The reason is very

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:34.520
simple, see, so here we have a sentence, my name is

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:38.940
Sudhanshu, I have a simple and plain sentence over here, now

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:42.420
when I will try to convert the sentence into a vector

00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:48.680
representation, so it is not like I will be just using just

00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:52.560
one to one kind of a mapping that for my just give one, for

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.540
name just give one, for name just give one, just try to give

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:56.900
two, for is try to give three, for Sudh try to give four,

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.760
right, no, not in this way, what I will be doing over here,

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:05.420
so I will be using a transformer, I will be using a pre

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:08.680
-trained model which has been trained on a huge corpus,

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:12.340
which has been trained on a entire world's knowledge, right,

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.860
so which understands a grammar, which understands which will

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:18.600
come before, which will come after, technically attention

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.000
model I am talking about, a transformer based attention

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.360
model I am talking about. So, I will be using such kind of a

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.940
model, chat GPT, right, chat GPT, let us suppose a GPT based

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:30.500
model if I am going to use, so we all know that GPT is

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:34.480
having a knowledge of entire world, so it understands a

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.920
grammar, grammar means, so which one will come after, which

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:39.300
one will come before, so where we have to apply a

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.520
punctuation, so what should be the tone, each and everything

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:45.180
it understands, right, so I will be using that kind of a

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:48.740
model, so which understands all of these things and then I

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:52.380
will try to convert this entire data into its numeric. So,

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:54.320
what is a numerical representation because at the end of the

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:56.980
day when we say models, right, what is the meaning of model,

00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:00.500
technically a numerical calculation we are, we are trying to

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:04.240
do, right, when you try to send some data into a chat GPT,

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:08.500
maybe by writing a prompt, so it converts immediately those

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:11.980
data into a numerical representation and then based on

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:15.160
calculation you see the output, this is technically happens,

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:18.540
right, because system never understands your chat GPT, even

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:22.420
never understands the English word, so it try to convert it,

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:26.720
so here we will be using, right, we will be using a

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:30.520
transformer based or GPT kind of a model by which I can

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:35.840
convert those data into a vector space and then I can go

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:38.580
ahead with a similarity search or maybe I can go ahead with

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:43.380
the distance calculation, so here the main agenda was not to

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:45.820
do just a similarity search, see I could have done a

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:48.620
similarity search even in case of a MongoDB, even in case of

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:52.180
a document, right, that is possible. But how we are trying

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:56.620
to convert a data into a numerical space that matters in a

00:36:56.620 --> 00:37:01.600
first place, making sense guys, yeah, making sense,

00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:10.650
yes, yeah, so this is the important part because I need

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:14.790
someone so who can convert a data into a numerical space by

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:17.350
understanding a grammar, by understanding a punctuation, by

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:20.410
understanding semantic and syntactic meaning of the data,

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:23.630
not just maybe some sort of a one to one mapping. So, this

00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:26.270
is where. So, the major part comes into a picture with

00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:28.650
respect to a vector DB and then if we are trying to do a

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:31.490
similarity search, obviously I will be able to get the best

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:34.230
result because in terms of similarity search, we are not

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:37.050
doing very much different, right, so it is a cosine

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:39.410
similarity that we are going to find out, maybe we are going

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:42.110
to find out a Euclidean distances, maybe we are going to

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:46.030
find out a Manhattan distances, so this is something that we

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:49.590
have been doing even in my old approach, right, but the

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:51.690
things which was missing at that point of a time was

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:54.730
conversion of the data. So, what we are going to do is we

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:56.710
are going to convert the data from one state to the another

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:59.890
state, means this English, plain English state to the

00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:05.150
numerical vector state, okay, so I will come to that point,

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:07.750
right, I will come to that point, but before that, so let me

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:11.470
talk about basically a similarity search, so let us suppose,

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:15.390
right, let us suppose we have two vectors, so let us suppose

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:21.970
we have a vector D1, right, so vector D1 and its value is

00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:24.790
101. I am just talking about this. I am just considering a

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:30.430
numerical directly. We have a vector D2 and we have a value

00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:37.810
0, 1, 1, right, we have a vector D3 and we have a value, let

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:43.110
us suppose, 1, 1 and 0 and then we have, let us suppose, a

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:49.230
vector D4 and its value is technically 100, so these are the

00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:51.490
vector which has been given to me and these are the 3D

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:54.950
vector which has been given to me. Now, if anyone is going

00:38:54.950 --> 00:39:02.930
to ask me a question that how similar or how far D4 is from

00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:09.050
D1 or D4 is from D2 or D4 is from a D3, so how I will be

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:11.870
able to do a calculation, so here I can try to use something

00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:16.170
called as cosine similarity, so c o s i n e cosine

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:17.010
similarity,

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:23.500
cosine similarity. Now what cosine similarity like a says?

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:24.920
So cosine similarity says that if you have a vector D1, you

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:25.560
have a vector D2, you have The problem is that if you are

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:28.280
trying to find out some similarity between two vectors, so

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:31.640
let us suppose a vector A and a vector V, so dot product of

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:35.920
vector A and vector V divided by a magnitude of a vector A

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:40.440
into magnitude of a vector B, so this is going to give you

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:45.860
finally similarity between two of these vectors, as simple

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:48.100
as that, this is going to give you similarity between two

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:53.520
vectors, so now this one is going to yield a result 1 or may

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:58.520
be a 0. minus 1, so closer to 1, not exact 1 I would say, so

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:03.100
if your final value, if your result is closer to 1, so you

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:11.970
can say that it is highly similar, highly similar, if value

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:17.070
is closer to 0, so you can say that no similarity at all, no

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:21.760
similarity and if value is coming closer to 1, so it is

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:28.370
simply say that completely dissimilar,

00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:32.270
completely dissimilar or it is like in a complete opposite

00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:35.670
direction. So here this is the formula for a cosine

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:39.590
similarity and we know that cos theta value always fluctuate

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:43.110
between minus 1 to 1, we are already aware about it, so

00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:45.470
based on that we are going to find out a cosine similarity

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:48.430
and then again if value is coming closer to 1, highly

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:51.890
similar, value is coming closer to 0, dissimilar. And then

00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:54.730
value is coming closer to minus 1, simply say that it is a

00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:57.690
complete like going into a different direction, so it is not

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:00.810
at all similar to each other, means two vectors are not like

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:05.870
equal to each other at all. Now what is this vector? So in

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:10.550
case of generative AI or in case of my data set, it is

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:12.970
nothing but a representation of some of the sentences,

00:41:13.330 --> 00:41:15.790
right, some of the sentences, some of the word, as simple as

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:18.510
that. So how we are going to come to this particular stage,

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:21.170
we will see, like I said, so we are going to use a

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:23.370
transformer model or we are going to use kind of a model

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:26.150
which is going to give me a final vector or maybe a

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:29.570
embeddings. But here, right, so here we have a cosine

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:33.030
similarity formula. Now my question was again same. So let

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:37.390
us try to find out a similarity between D4 and D1, yeah. So

00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:40.450
let us try to find out a similarity between a D4 and a D1,

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:43.450
okay. I will be able to find out similarity between D4 and

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:53.100
D1, so here the cosine similarity D4 and D1, let us suppose.

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:57.580
So dot product of D4 and D1 divided by magnitude of D4 and

00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:02.720
magnitude of D1, right, this is the formula. So here if we

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:06.240
have to find out a dot product between D4 and D1, so simple,

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:12.860
1 into 1, 0 into 0, 0 into 1, addition of everything, right,

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:20.300
so 1 into 1 plus 0 into 0 plus 0 into 1. So 0 into 1.

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:24.660
Divided by D1. Divided by magnitude of D1, so if we have to

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:28.840
find out D4 and D1, so magnitude of D4 is what? 1 square

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:35.360
plus 0 square plus 0 square into magnitude of D1. So 1

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:38.920
square plus 0 square plus 1 square. I believe in our

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:40.840
childhood we have done this kind of a mathematics,

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:46.300
mathematical calculation a lot, right everyone, yeah. We

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:52.160
have done that, right, so many times, yeah. So the numerator

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:55.640
is going to be 1 and denominator is going to be 1 square, so

00:42:55.640 --> 00:43:01.280
it is going to be 1 into, right, so 1 square and then 1

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:05.420
square plus 1 square, so 2 is basically it will be like a 2

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:14.180
and root of 2 is 1.414. So ideally it is going to be after

00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:20.180
calculation 0.707. So this is going to give me the cosine.

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:23.400
Cosine similarity between D4 and D1. So yeah, it is coming

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:26.020
closer to 1. So I can say that that yes, there is some

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:29.000
similarity between D4 and D1. So yeah, there is a similarity

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:34.400
I can say. So 1 and 1 is same, 0 and 0 is same and the only

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.120
difference is 1 and 0. So there is some similarity, right.

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.620
And even with the help of this result, I am able to observe

00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:43.460
that there is some similarity between this D4 and D1 vector,

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:46.720
these two vectors, right. So this is how we can try to do

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:49.340
the math. This is how we can try to do a cosine similarity

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:52.080
check. Now cosine is nothing but it is just trying to do a

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.040
calculation and based on that calculation it is trying to

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.580
tell you that okay how similar these two vectors are.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:00.100
Similarly I can try to do a calculation with respect to D4

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:04.260
and D2, right, D4 and D3. Now we have a 3-dimension vector.

00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:07.140
There is a possibility that I will be having a 30-dimension

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:11.340
vector 1 comma 1 comma 0 comma 1 comma 2 comma 3 comma 4

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:15.320
comma 1 comma 4. I will be able to do a calculation, right.

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:17.920
I will be able to do a calculation. So it does not matter

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:20.360
what is the length of the vector. Right. What is the length

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.880
of the vector. I will be able to find out a cosine

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:29.380
similarity between two data set, yeah. And I will be able to

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:31.380
eventually tell you that okay fine so which one is similar

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:34.400
to which one. This is where cosine similarity comes into a

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:39.180
picture. The another one is basically Euclidean distances,

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:42.340
right. The another one is basically a Euclidean distances.

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:46.400
So again I believe we all able to, we all understand that

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.800
what is the meaning of Euclidean distances. What is the

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.300
meaning of Euclidean distances and how do we find out. So

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:53.900
Euclidean distances between two vectors are nothing but this

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:56.900
particular distance, right. This particular distances. So

00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:01.100
here we have like a D4 and D1. So like a Euclidean distance

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:06.400
between D4 and D1, Euclidean distance between D4 and D1 is

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:16.100
nothing but root of 1 minus 1 square, 0 minus 0 square plus

00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:21.940
0 minus 1. 0 minus 1. Now do the math 1 minus 1 square is 0,

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:26.980
0 minus 0 square is 0 and then 0 minus 1 so square it is

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:30.900
going to be technically 1. So this is going to give you a

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:34.600
Euclidean distances at the end of the day, simple, right. So

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:37.560
again this is going to be a parameters where I will be able

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:41.880
to measure a similarity between a data. But cosine is better

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:45.460
as cosine is going to consider an angle. So even if there

00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:48.780
will be a smaller deviation, right. Even if there will be a

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:51.720
small deviation, it will be able to capture it, right. It

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.580
will be able to capture it and it is going to give you a

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:58.260
better similarity result. So majority of the vector

00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:01.280
databases that you will be able to find out, you will see

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:05.620
that they are using a cosine similarity in a very, very

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:08.200
first place or maybe even a hybrid approach, right. Hybrid

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:10.820
approach combination of both. But yeah, majority of the

00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:14.380
databases are trying to use a cosine similarity, okay. So we

00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:16.340
are, we are now able to understand that how cosine

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:18.340
similarity calculation has been done. And again, from an

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:20.840
interview perspective, people are going to ask you a

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:23.280
question that can you please explain me a cosine similarity,

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:26.360
right. And how this calculation happens, although the

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:30.140
calculation is very simple, but yeah, so we tend to forget

00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:33.360
these information. So that is the reason. So it becomes a

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:39.800
interview question for all of us. Now so this is completely

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:42.200
fine, right. This is completely fine. We are able to

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:47.480
understand like what is vector. Then how we can do it. We

00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:50.000
can try to check these two different different vector,

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.920
whether they are similar, whether they are not similar, what

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.720
is a cosine similarity and plus we are able to recall our

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:59.600
Euclidean distances as well. Now it's time to do each and

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:02.660
everything in a practical manner, right. It's time to do

00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:05.580
each and everything in a practical manner. And like I told

00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:10.020
you, right, and like I told you, the major part is not to do

00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:13.140
this calculation, not to find out Euclidean distances, not

00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:15.360
to find out a cosine similarity. What is the major part

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:19.260
guys? Yeah. What is the major part?

00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:27.440
Find similarity. No, if we have a vector, I will be able to

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:30.840
find the similarity, right. The major part is converting

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:34.800
your data set into a vector space and what model you are

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:38.460
using, which model you are using, that matters a lot, right.

00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:42.140
That is the major part because see at the end of the day,

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:44.840
similarities check means what we are trying to do some sort

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:47.080
of a math and we are trying to like check some sort of

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:50.100
distances or maybe angle. This is what we are able to

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:53.800
understand. Now. This is not a major part. Obviously if I am

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:57.860
able to represent a data in a correct numerical format,

00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:00.860
right, correct numerical format, so there will be a

00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:03.940
similarity, right, there will be a similarity. So the major

00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:08.080
part is a data conversion and which model we are going to

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:12.020
use to do that conversion, that matters a lot. So that is

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:15.940
the reason whenever you are trying to convert your data,

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:20.300
your sentences into a numerical space, into a vector space.

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:25.020
You have to make sure that you are using a model which is

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:28.660
having a most of the knowledges or which has been trained on

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:33.080
a huge corpus on a huge amount of the database and data

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:36.360
sets, right. So now if

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:46.700
you will go to hugging phase, so hugging phase is basically

00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:49.720
a repository. So where you will be able to find out like

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:53.760
every kind of a models, right. So here, if you are going to

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:57.220
search for embeddings, you will be able to find out so many

00:48:57.220 --> 00:49:00.220
models for embedding, right. So many models for embedding,

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:03.580
you all will be able to find out not just one, not just two

00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:07.140
but maybe a thousands of models. So quen based model, 6

00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:09.880
billion, 0.6 billion parameter, quen embedding, 8 billion

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:14.280
parameter model, jinja embedding, v4, quen 3 embedding, 0.6

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:16.740
billion parameter. So quen is again one of the famous

00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:21.080
series, right. So you will be able to find out E-M-B-E-D-D-I

00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:24.920
-N-G. So you will be able to find out where

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:43.340
is embedding task by the way.

00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:49.250
Somewhere you will be able to see it or maybe go for the

00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:51.950
search, right, go for the search. So you will be able to

00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:55.010
find out not just one or two model but like I said, so you

00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:57.430
will be able to find out a thousand, thousands of model that

00:49:57.430 --> 00:50:00.350
people have trained and they have released its weight that

00:50:00.350 --> 00:50:04.530
okay, go ahead, use those model and then convert your data

00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:06.930
set into a embedding, means try to pass your English

00:50:06.930 --> 00:50:10.270
sentences and from on other end, it will try to give you the

00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:15.490
vector representation, right, vector representation, now, so

00:50:15.490 --> 00:50:19.650
here, in case of a hugging phase, right, in case of a

00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:22.510
hugging phase, you will be able to find out a best of best

00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:24.930
model, there is no doubt about it, right, there is no doubt

00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:30.450
at all. Recently they have even released chat GPT OSS 20B

00:50:30.450 --> 00:50:33.770
and 120 billion parameter for a text generation, right, so

00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:36.670
which was again one of the very, very, very, very powerful

00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:39.670
model that people have released so far and I have even shown

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:43.330
you inferencing, have you seen that guys, inferencing over a

00:50:43.330 --> 00:50:47.030
GPU? And even API creation, I have already, like I said, I

00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:48.810
have shown you inferencing over a GPU, like shown it to

00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:50.550
everyone, last week itself,

00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:59.170
yes, Ramesh Kumar is saying that not getting a calculation

00:50:59.170 --> 00:51:01.970
part, okay, well, not an issue, I will try to repeat it once

00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:06.030
again, yeah, okay, someone is saying not yet, so please try

00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:09.030
to go ahead with that, so like a GPT has open source this

00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:11.990
model and I have already created a video where I have shown

00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:14.670
you that how you can host it in a local plus how you can

00:51:14.670 --> 00:51:17.270
host it on a cloud GPU, not just that how you can create the

00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:22.110
API. Maybe in your free time. Okay. So if you have any kind

00:51:22.110 --> 00:51:25.070
of interest, you can just go ahead with that. Now here, so

00:51:25.070 --> 00:51:27.470
like I said, you will be able to find out so many embedding

00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:30.470
models. So let's try to search one of the embedding models.

00:51:30.570 --> 00:51:33.470
So I'm going to search Quen3 embedding 8 billion parameter

00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:38.190
model. Now if you will go ahead with this one and follow

00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:42.350
along, so you have to download the model from a hugging

00:51:42.350 --> 00:51:45.870
phase and then after downloading the model, so you have to

00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:49.370
basically pass your document. It is going to convert your

00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:53.010
document. Into our vector space and then you can go ahead

00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:55.790
with the similarity search. So everywhere you will be able

00:51:55.790 --> 00:52:00.270
to find out the exact same kind of a story. I can go ahead

00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:03.030
and I can try to use this model. There is no issue at all,

00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:08.510
but if I can get a better option, right? If I can get a

00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:13.850
better option, maybe I'll end up using that and keeping that

00:52:13.850 --> 00:52:16.790
in a, and maybe I don't have to like a go ahead and download

00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:20.990
the model. Right? So that better option we have given you

00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:25.930
inside a URI basically. So let me open up this, uh, yeah,

00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:29.810
signed in. So if you will go to URI API, by the way, so

00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:33.650
let's suppose if I'm going to URI API and if I'm going to a

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:38.710
code example, right? So here text embedding and similarity.

00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:43.130
So we have already given you a model access, which model

00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:46.190
access. So we have given you text embedding three small

00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:50.070
model access. Now this model is coming from whom? So this

00:52:50.070 --> 00:52:54.070
model is coming from open AI itself. And what is the total

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:58.150
context length it generates one, five, three, six. So I'll

00:52:58.150 --> 00:53:01.070
show you that. I'll show you that. Right? But this is one of

00:53:01.070 --> 00:53:04.010
the best model that you will be able to find out, which is

00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:07.290
having all the knowledge. And that was the problem, right?

00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:09.430
That was the problem that we have discussed. So the major

00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:12.310
problem is not to do a similarity search, right? Similarity

00:53:12.310 --> 00:53:14.730
search is a very simple mathematics. The major problem is to

00:53:14.730 --> 00:53:19.410
use a best of best model. Which understands a data and based

00:53:19.410 --> 00:53:24.990
on those data understandings, it converts. It converts my

00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:29.590
data into a vector or numerical space, right? So here in

00:53:29.590 --> 00:53:33.050
case of a URI API, if you are going to consume, so text

00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:36.530
embedding three small model access we have given to you. You

00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:38.550
don't have to do any kind of installation. You don't have to

00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:42.670
do any kind of a setup and directly call the APIs and bingo,

00:53:42.730 --> 00:53:46.630
right? And bingo. So we'll do it. We'll do it now itself. So

00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:50.230
we are, we are going to like, uh, do it now. So here, let's

00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:53.570
suppose I'm going to copy this API and open up your VS code

00:53:53.570 --> 00:53:56.170
guys, VS code, Google collab, whatever you want. Just try to

00:53:56.170 --> 00:53:57.530
open up anything

00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:07.800
collab, like a VS code or any Jupiter notebook. Just try to

00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:12.980
open up where you can like, uh, write the code to open

00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:17.140
folder and the D drive. Let me, okay.

00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:45.050
So I have just like, uh, created a folder now inside this.

00:54:45.050 --> 00:54:51.250
I'm going to create a test underscore vector dot I P Y N B

00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:58.090
fine. And now here, so let me attach any of the kernel and

00:54:58.090 --> 00:55:01.270
here. So I'm going to paste the same code, right? I have not

00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:03.890
done any kind of a modification. Now what this code is

00:55:03.890 --> 00:55:08.150
trying to do. So this code is trying to give you a end

00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:11.190
point. I believe now we all understand what is the meaning

00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:14.370
of a end point, right? That's the reason. So in a very first

00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:17.730
place. I talked about, uh, API because again and again, so

00:55:17.730 --> 00:55:20.570
many times we will end up using an API or maybe we'll end up

00:55:20.570 --> 00:55:23.930
building an API. So here is my end point, right here is my

00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:28.390
end point now here authorization wise. So I can try to pass

00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:31.770
a token so I can try to replace this entire static with my

00:55:31.770 --> 00:55:35.750
token. How I will be able to get my token again, very

00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:41.270
simple. So I can go to the API key, click over here and now

00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:45.570
create API key. I can give any names. I will end up creating

00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:49.030
the tokens, right? I will end up creating the tokens last

00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:52.070
class. We have done that, right? Uh, those who are new, so,

00:55:52.210 --> 00:55:56.610
um, just do it once and let me know if you have any kind of

00:55:56.610 --> 00:56:00.130
a issue. I know some of you have joined, uh, this class as a

00:56:00.130 --> 00:56:02.270
very first class that that's completely fine. So you will

00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:06.270
get familiar with all of these things. So here we have a

00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:09.750
function and we have replaced a static with the URI API key,

00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:13.750
right? Payload wise. So we are trying to use this particular

00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:17.150
model. Text embedding free is small from a open AI itself.

00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:19.370
We have hosted. So we are going to use this particular model

00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:22.870
and what is a data we are trying to pass. So we are trying

00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:26.550
to pass a weather is sunny today. So maybe I can try to pass

00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:32.570
over here. My name is, is, yeah,

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:36.990
anything I can try to pass simple, right? So anything, any

00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:39.990
kind of a data I can try to pass. Now if I'm going to hit

00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:43.770
it, if I'm going to execute it, I will be able to see some

00:56:43.770 --> 00:56:46.650
sort of output. I have executed it, right? I have executed

00:56:46.650 --> 00:56:50.670
it. Now let's try to print the embeddings. So here, this is

00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:53.870
the numerical representation. This is basically a numerical

00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:57.630
representation. It has returned. Yeah. Now what is our

00:56:57.630 --> 00:57:01.410
length of this particular vector? So maybe I can try to

00:57:01.410 --> 00:57:06.310
calculate. So length is one, five, three, six. It is already

00:57:06.310 --> 00:57:09.130
showing you as a safe. So length is basically one, five,

00:57:09.150 --> 00:57:13.030
three, six means what ever data you are going to pass, what

00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:16.390
ever data, right? What ever data doesn't matter whether you

00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:18.930
have one single word or you have a hundreds of word. Maybe

00:57:18.930 --> 00:57:22.750
you have a thousands of word in one single line, right? What

00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:26.170
ever data you are going to pass inside this model,

00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:30.850
eventually it will try to convert all of those data into a

00:57:30.850 --> 00:57:34.410
numerical values, right? Into a numerical values of length.

00:57:34.530 --> 00:57:38.730
What one, five, three, six, or in other word, I can say that

00:57:38.730 --> 00:57:42.670
dimension means it is trying to use one, five, three, six.

00:57:42.790 --> 00:57:44.970
Different, different coordinates, just like X coordinate, Y

00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:47.270
coordinate, Z coordinate. So one, five, three, six

00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:50.690
coordinate to represent one point. That one point in that

00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:57.240
space is representing a data. Is it making sense? Yes.

00:57:57.380 --> 00:57:57.860
Everyone.

00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:05.430
Yep. Share the code. Code is already available by the way

00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:08.610
guys. Code is already available here inside a code example.

00:58:08.830 --> 00:58:12.470
So if you'll click over here and come down, text embedding

00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:15.450
and similarity, you will be able to find out. So code is

00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:18.530
already available. You just have to replace your static,

00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:22.710
basically a API key and then change your sentence. So

00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:24.610
whatever sentence that you would like to pass, you can just

00:58:24.610 --> 00:58:27.710
pass those sentences and it is going to give you return as a

00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:32.630
embedding, a vector, right? So here we are able to do this

00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:35.510
conversion and this conversion simply means that, that I'm

00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:39.630
trying to represent this data, right? This data in one,

00:58:39.730 --> 00:58:43.490
five, three, six dimension. So any model, right? Any model

00:58:43.490 --> 00:58:46.870
that you are going to use in this entire world. To convert

00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:51.410
your data into its numerical representation, it will always

00:58:51.410 --> 00:58:54.610
be having a fixed dimension. It will always try to give you

00:58:54.610 --> 00:58:59.330
a return into a fixed dimension. Yes. So one, five, three,

00:58:59.390 --> 00:59:02.890
six data set point here. So yes, one, five, three, six, for

00:59:02.890 --> 00:59:09.350
example, right? So for example, if I'm trying to say, so

00:59:11.110 --> 00:59:17.310
if I'm trying to say that in this coordinate, we have this

00:59:17.310 --> 00:59:20.130
point. Now, what is the meaning of this point? Meaning of

00:59:20.130 --> 00:59:22.450
this point is we are trying to represent in a 2D coordinate,

00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:27.330
right? So meaning of this point is x1, y1, simple two values

00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:31.890
is representing this point. Similarly in a 3D space, right?

00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:35.350
In a 3D space, let's suppose we have a x coordinate, we have

00:59:35.350 --> 00:59:38.290
basically a y coordinate and we have a z coordinate and we

00:59:38.290 --> 00:59:41.770
have a point somewhere, right? Somewhere over here. What is

00:59:41.770 --> 00:59:44.330
the meaning of this point? What is the meaning of this

00:59:44.330 --> 00:59:48.950
point? So I mean this point is x, y and z, right? So this

00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:51.350
one single point is being represented by three coordinate.

00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:54.410
This is the meaning of a 3D axis, right? And this is the

00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:57.530
meaning of a 2D axis. Similarly, so when I say one, five,

00:59:57.570 --> 01:00:00.390
three, six, one, five, three, six number of vector we have,

01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:03.210
so similar, so we have basically one, five, three, six kind

01:00:03.210 --> 01:00:06.330
of a dimension which we can't visualize, right? But there is

01:00:06.330 --> 01:00:09.970
only one point, means one data in that space, so which has

01:00:09.970 --> 01:00:12.170
been represented by one, five, three, six number of a

01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:15.590
coordinate. So more dimension, more coordinate, it simply

01:00:15.590 --> 01:00:18.530
means that, that your data set is more explanatory, right?

01:00:18.550 --> 01:00:23.770
Explanatory and that too you will be able to do a search or

01:00:23.770 --> 01:00:26.430
similarity, you will be able to find out in a best possible

01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:31.650
manner, fine? So it means our text is represented in one,

01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:35.590
five, three, six, exactly, yes, yeah? Just like I'm trying

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:40.390
to like show you 2D and 3D. So here in this case it's one,

01:00:40.550 --> 01:00:44.750
five, three, six dimension and that is altogether

01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:48.830
representing one single point in that space. Okay? Are you

01:00:48.830 --> 01:00:52.710
able to imagine it guys? That's the reason why I've given

01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:57.630
you these two example, 2D and 3D. Yeah, Prashant Rai is

01:00:57.630 --> 01:01:01.090
saying no. So what is like, what you are not able to

01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:04.630
understand by the way? Are you able to understand a 2D, are

01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:07.210
you able to understand a 3D? So what is the meaning of a 2D

01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:11.670
data? What is the meaning of a 3D data? Yeah?

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:19.100
Okay. So people are trying to paste their like code and

01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:24.200
along with their own API key. And we have given you a

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:28.100
limitation with respect to the API key by the way guys. It's

01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:30.700
only one lakh token per day. So if you are going to share

01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:33.280
your API key, people will exhaust it.

01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:42.390
Yes. Archit key error data. So just look into your API key.

01:01:42.550 --> 01:01:46.410
The last one is a static. So you have copy and pasted your

01:01:46.410 --> 01:01:50.150
API key, but it's wrong. You forgot to like remove the last

01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.630
static.

01:01:56.970 --> 01:02:03.270
Yes. So. So this is like a, how easy it is. And this is what

01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:06.250
I'm trying to prove over here that when I say 1, 5, 3, 6, it

01:02:06.250 --> 01:02:08.450
doesn't matter what kind of a data I'm trying to pass

01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:11.630
ultimately the output, which I will be able to get. It's a

01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:15.750
1, 5, 3, 6 in case of this particular model. Now in case of

01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:18.270
a different, different model, our sizes are going to be

01:02:18.270 --> 01:02:21.810
different, but maybe like a 700 something, maybe a thousand

01:02:21.810 --> 01:02:26.530
something, maybe 1500 something. So open a model, which we

01:02:26.530 --> 01:02:30.230
are using inside a URI. It is going to give you a return. Of

01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:34.450
1, 5, 3, 6 and a meaning of 1, 5, 3, 6 is very simple 1, 5,

01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:38.070
3, 6 coordinates, right? Is it representing this particular

01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:40.510
data? So this is one coordinate. This is just one single

01:02:40.510 --> 01:02:43.950
dot, right? This entire data set, which it is trying to give

01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:48.750
me as an output. This is just a single dot, right? Single

01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:53.490
dot in these many dimensions, just like we have a single dot

01:02:53.490 --> 01:02:58.790
for this single dot for this one. And I know. But like. Many

01:02:58.790 --> 01:03:04.330
of us are studying this, you know, geometry and we are

01:03:04.330 --> 01:03:07.610
talking about the coordinate. But when it comes to a

01:03:07.610 --> 01:03:11.510
visualization, most of us are not able to do it. All thanks

01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:15.490
goes to our schooling system, right? Most of us, I have seen

01:03:15.490 --> 01:03:20.430
that like, which is, which is not like a outlier

01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:23.950
for me. I have seen that in all of my classes, by the way,

01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:26.710
right? So it's a very common phenomenon, which I have

01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:30.790
observed. That people struggles to, you know, visualize a 2D

01:03:30.790 --> 01:03:34.270
and a 3D and n dimension as well. And it's very difficult

01:03:34.270 --> 01:03:38.630
for most of us to understand a basic difference between a

01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:42.270
scalar and a vector. So hope that concept is clear now.

01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:48.640
Yes. Sorry. Basic doubt here. Shape 1, 5, 3, 6. You are

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:52.200
referring as a dimension. So, yeah. So if you have a vector,

01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:55.780
simple, that's the reason I told you, right? So all thanks

01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:58.380
to our schooling system. And that. That we are learning

01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:00.400
something from a childhood, but it's still, we are not able

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:03.440
to visualize it. We are not able to relate it. So see, so

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:07.140
just don't go after 1, 5, 3, 6, right? Let's just talk about

01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:10.300
a two dimension. Yes. Let's just talk about the two

01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:14.280
dimension. Now any data set, any dot, let's suppose I have

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:17.060
drawn this particular dot. This is one simple dot, right

01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:22.200
now. So what is a value of this dot, by the way, in 2D space

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:25.620
where we have a X coordinate and we have a Y coordinate. So

01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:29.120
obviously. If we have to represent this dot, I need a value

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:33.000
of X, I need a value of Y. Then only in a 2D space, I will

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.540
be able to represent. Yes. Then in a 2D space, I will be

01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:43.860
able to represent. Now, let me unshare my screen. Yeah. Now

01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:48.480
let's, let's think in this way, by the way, there is my

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:50.980
third pen. Let me find out.

01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:19.220
Not able to find out my third pen, by the way. Okay.

01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:33.740
So just, just try to think in this manner. Yes. So we have

01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:37.840
this one, we have a 2D space. So we have basically X axis

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:40.840
and we have basically Y axis. Now, anything, this is a

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:45.020
plane, right? Plane means, so maybe like a plane simply

01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:48.820
means that, that let's suppose this is the copy, right? So

01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:51.880
this is, this is trying to represent my 2D space. So any dot

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:56.440
over here, if I have to represent, so obviously I need this

01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:59.140
value and I need this value. If I have these two values,

01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:01.560
then only I will be able to represent something in a 2D

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:07.960
space. Now we all are living in a 3D space, right? And let's

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:11.700
suppose, let's suppose I have a small entity over here. For

01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:16.120
example, this entity, right? This is small, like a cap we

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:20.140
have over here into a 3D space. Now, if I'm going to ask you

01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:23.940
a question that with respect to this particular room, right?

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.720
Because this particular room is having a walls and it is

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:29.840
having a surface and it is having a ceiling. So with respect

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:34.380
to this particular room, what is a height and how, like what

01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:37.800
is the height of this particular cap? How far it is from

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:41.780
like that particular wall? So maybe our width and what is

01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:45.120
the length maybe from the another wall? So obviously to

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:49.160
represent this particular cap in this 3D space, you need all

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:51.480
of these three coordinates and altogether these three

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:54.480
coordinates are going to represent just this particular cap

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:58.300
or this particular data set, right? So similarly. This is

01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:01.720
the meaning of coordinates by the way, right everyone? So

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:05.460
that's the meaning of coordinates. So similarly 2D

01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:18.420
and then 3D. So I need three coordinates to represent it and

01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:21.700
I need two coordinates to represent this one. Now, so here

01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:24.600
we have, let's suppose four coordinates again. So four

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:27.400
coordinates you can't visualize, not even in the programming

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:30.120
languages, you will not be able to visualize it. Max to max

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:33.540
till 3D, you will be able to visualize it. But yeah. There

01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:36.820
is a possibility that fourth coordinate exists. I can use

01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:42.600
maybe X, Y, G and A to represent a four coordinate, maybe B

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:46.960
to represent a five coordinate, maybe C, X, Y, Z, X, Y, G,

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.740
A, B, C. So to represent something into a six coordinates.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.840
Now, this is what I'm trying to do over here. So I'm trying

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:58.520
to just represent this data into one, five, three, six

01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:01.740
coordinate. This is what it means. So this is one of the

01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:04.720
vector. And what is the dimension of this vector by the way?

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:08.880
So dimension of this vector is one, five, three, six. Like

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:12.040
we have 2D over here. So we have 3D over here. We have 6D

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:17.020
over here. We have one, five, three, six D over here. And

01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:20.840
eventually it is representing in that space because even in

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:24.080
this 2D space, in this 2D space, this two coordinates are

01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:27.240
representing only one point. In 3D space, this three

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:29.580
coordinates are representing only one point, only one dot,

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:34.200
right? In six dimensional space, the six values are going to

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:37.880
represent only one dot. In one, five, three, six dimensional

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:41.700
space, this entire one is going to represent only one dot,

01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:44.180
only one. Yes.

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:52.740
So shape is one of this. How many coordinates we have to

01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:54.840
choose in case? So what is the reason of choosing one, five,

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:58.220
three, six? See, one, five, three, six is a model output

01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:02.100
dimension. So whenever we talk about a generative AI, so we

01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:04.980
always talk about a context length. Now, what is the meaning

01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:07.980
of context length? By the way, the kind of output, the

01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:11.080
length of the output it will be able to give me, or maybe a

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:15.060
length of the input it will be able to take. Yes. Because

01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:18.640
whatever model you are going to create, eventually it's

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:21.940
going to be a neural network, right? It's a neurons. And

01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:24.820
although there is a transform architecture, but eventually

01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:28.180
it is going to be a neuron, right? In a neuron. So every

01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:32.460
model will be having a constant, right? Constant input

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:35.440
dimension. And every model will be having a constant output.

01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:38.360
So we say that, that, okay, fine. So the recent model with

01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:44.320
GPT has released, they have 128K of context, 1,28,000 of a

01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:47.640
context length means that is the output it will be able to

01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:51.560
yield in one single go, right? For one single input. So it

01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:54.300
will be able to give me that kind of, or maybe 4K of

01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:58.660
context, maybe 8K of context, right? So similarly for

01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:01.740
embedding models, so whatever, whoever has built this

01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:05.440
particular model, so they try to set that. Okay, fine. So

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:08.120
this is going to give you this much of output. So 1, 5, 3, 6

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.780
as an output. You will be able to find out a model which is

01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:13.460
going to give you maybe just as a 700 dimension, right?

01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:16.640
Maybe just as a 1,028 dimension as an output.

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:27.640
Okay. So now moving ahead, let me, so here now we are able

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:31.640
to understand that how with the help of URI API, right? How

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:35.180
with the help of URI API, I can try to pass any kind of a

01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:37.940
data, right? I can try to pass any kind of a data. And

01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:41.580
eventually I will be able to generate the embeddings. Yeah.

01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:44.740
Eventually I will be able to generate the embeddings. Now

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:49.200
coming back to the hugging phase, right? So here, like I

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:51.860
said, even inside a hugging phase, you will be able to find

01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:55.420
out not just one model, but a thousands of model. Yeah.

01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:58.480
Thousands of model you will be able to find out and you can

01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:02.680
try to use even these models, right? Even, even try to use

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:07.540
these models to perform this embedding operation. And here,

01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:11.560
so text embedding, QEN3 embedding, 0.6 billion parameter

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:13.880
model if you are going to use. So this is the size of the

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:16.380
model, 0.6 billion parameter model. This is what it means.

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:19.360
Layer inside this model means transformer layer is basically

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:23.500
28, a stacked layer and sequence length is 32K, right?

01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:28.920
Embedding dimension is 1,024. The model that we are using,

01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:32.760
so what is the dimension? 1,536, right? So what is the

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:35.420
dimension this model is going to give you in terms of

01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:38.900
embedding? 1,024. So whatever model that you are going to

01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:42.400
use in this entire world, all of these models comes with the

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:45.660
specification. Simple. All this specification people are

01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:48.580
going to mention. Doesn't matter. You are going to use it

01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:52.000
like from where, but yeah, so embedding dimension is 1,024.

01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:56.160
Now, similarly, QEN3 series embedding 4B, if you are going

01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:01.040
to use, so what is the embedding dimension? 2,560. So the

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:04.020
final output it is going to give you in our cases, 1,536,

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:07.400
right? So if you are going to use QEN3 embedding 4B

01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:11.020
parameter model, this one is the final dimension. If you are

01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:14.000
going to use QEN3 embedding 8B parameter, so it is going to

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.520
give you embedding dimension is equals to 4096. So inside a

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:21.040
QEN series, you will be able to find out these three model.

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:24.640
Now let's suppose if I have to use one of these models, so I

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:27.300
can just try to click and they are going to give you a

01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:31.400
sample code as well. So here this is the very simple like a

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:34.420
code. So where you are going to call a sample code. You are

01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:35.960
going to create a sentence transformer and then you are

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:38.000
going to create an object of sentence transform by passing

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.620
this model name or whatever model that you are going to use.

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:45.040
And then you are going to pass your data. So it is going to

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:50.960
take your data and then it is going to encode it. So maybe I

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:55.140
can try to copy this one and then directly I can try to use

01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:58.700
this one like when I can try to use any of these models. So

01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:02.760
let's remove everything. I don't anyhow. These like things

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:07.780
are commented. Maybe I will remove a query as well. It is

01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:15.560
not required. Document. Fine. I am going to use it. Okay. So

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:17.280
I have removed and

01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:22.640
I am not looking for a similarity search by the way. I am

01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:25.680
looking for just a document embedding. Fine. Document

01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:27.820
embedding is something which I am looking for. So I have

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:30.680
removed everything guys. I have removed all the code by the

01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:34.440
way and let's try to execute it. So first of all. It will

01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:37.600
try to download those models and once it will be able to

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:41.160
download it. I am just trying to call model dot encode and I

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:44.100
am trying to pass my documents. This particular documents I

01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:48.420
am trying to pass means my data. Right. Means my data. So

01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:49.460
let's see.

01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:59.960
There is a issue I believe in terms of library

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:08.930
installation. So let me handle that part. And it's a 8

01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:15.090
billion parameter model. Maybe

01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:26.930
I can try to use the smallest one.

01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:34.760
Yeah. Quen 3 embedding. 0.6. I think this is the name of the

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:44.000
model. Let me copy this one. So this is the. This is the

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.360
smallest model. Right. 6.6 billion parameter model.

01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:56.640
Okay. So it's technically a library issue. Let me fix that

01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:58.780
part. In terms of installation. It

01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:12.110
had a kernel. So where I have done those installation.

01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:17.660
No module name. Sentence transformer. Okay. Okay.

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:34.380
I'm just trying to show you guys that how we are going to

01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:37.980
use some of the open source model, which is widely available

01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:42.320
to all of us. And if I can try to use one, then you will be

01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:44.940
able to use other thousands of model as well. And on a

01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:47.780
hugging face, they always give you a sample code. Again,

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:50.260
sample code is nothing. Every time you will be able to find

01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:52.100
out that they're trying to call a sentence transformer.

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:55.480
They're trying to pass the model name, which will be given

01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:58.860
eventually inside a hugging face itself. So you just have to

01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:01.920
copy this name all the time. Right. You just have to copy

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:05.480
this model name and then hit the hugging face. So what it

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:08.400
will do, it will try to download everything. It will try to

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:10.980
download each and everything, and then it will try to, you

01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:14.320
know, uh, do the inferencing with those models. So it turns

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:19.420
out when my installation is done now, yeah, now I believe

01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:24.800
it's working. So it is trying to download the model and then

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:30.650
it will try to perform this operation in my local. Okay. So

01:16:30.650 --> 01:16:37.730
enable for repo. But HF. X. E. Well, link falling back to a

01:16:37.730 --> 01:16:44.840
regular HTTP download. Okay. It's a warning. So let's just

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:45.740
wait for some time guys.

01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:54.810
And in between, so even you can try this out. So I've just

01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:59.330
pinged you a code inside your chat. And before that, so you

01:16:59.330 --> 01:17:02.490
have to do this installation, otherwise it is going to give

01:17:02.490 --> 01:17:08.650
you an error. Okay. So everything, uh, I believe was able to

01:17:08.650 --> 01:17:11.690
run successfully. Now. If I'm going to call my document

01:17:11.690 --> 01:17:14.850
embedding. So it has returned me to embeddings, right?

01:17:14.970 --> 01:17:18.110
Because I had two sentences, one, and then we have a comma

01:17:18.110 --> 01:17:21.450
and we have this other sentence. First sentence was very,

01:17:21.510 --> 01:17:24.110
very long. Second sentence was, uh, sorry, first sentence

01:17:24.110 --> 01:17:26.850
was very, very like a small and second sentence was too much

01:17:26.850 --> 01:17:29.510
long. You can try to write your own sentence as well. But

01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:32.610
for both of the sentences, it is going to give me the

01:17:32.610 --> 01:17:35.350
similar dimension. I can even try to check what is the

01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:40.470
dimension. So maybe document embedding of zero. So let's try

01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:44.570
to extract the very first one. So zero. And then this is the

01:17:44.570 --> 01:17:48.570
first one and I can try to check a length of it. So what is

01:17:48.570 --> 01:17:52.590
the length of this one? And length is one zero two four,

01:17:52.710 --> 01:17:55.830
right? One zero two four. Now, if you will go over here and

01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:59.210
documentation, this is what they have mentioned, right? That

01:17:59.210 --> 01:18:02.090
Quinn three embedding, uh, 0.6 million parameter model. So

01:18:02.090 --> 01:18:04.430
this is going to give you embedding dimension means our

01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:07.810
vector dimension is one zero two four. And, uh, yeah. I'm

01:18:07.810 --> 01:18:11.070
able to get one zero two four. As simple as that. So I'm

01:18:11.070 --> 01:18:15.130
able to use even, uh, open source model, a model, which is

01:18:15.130 --> 01:18:18.990
like widely available over a hugging phase without even an

01:18:18.990 --> 01:18:22.610
API, right? But yeah, the thing is that they download a

01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:25.830
model in your local system. So if model size will keep on

01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:28.890
increasing every time you will have to download those big

01:18:28.890 --> 01:18:32.170
models and then you have to do an inferencing, or maybe you

01:18:32.170 --> 01:18:35.150
have to host the same model on your cloud infrastructure

01:18:35.150 --> 01:18:39.090
somewhere. So that without even using a UD API. Let's

01:18:39.090 --> 01:18:41.850
suppose some of you will not try to use a UD API. That's

01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:44.950
okay. That's completely fine without even using a UD API.

01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:49.330
Like I have like, uh, I'm able to convert my data into a

01:18:49.330 --> 01:18:54.790
vector space. You can do it. Is it making sense? Yes, guys.

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:04.180
Yeah. Fine. So how we are able to convert our data set into

01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:09.920
a numerical space into a vector space by using a UD API part

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:12.940
number one. And without using a UD API. So let's suppose UD

01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:16.060
API is not available to me. No issue at all. It's completely

01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:20.420
fine, right? So I have a tons of model available outside. I

01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:23.380
can try to use those models and I can try to convert my data

01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:27.480
set into a vector space. And this is something that we all

01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:31.100
can try to do it. I believe code is available. So this is a

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:36.160
code which I have pinged to all of you. Yeah. So again, I

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:39.060
have pinged you this code guys, by the way, and you can try

01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:41.460
this out, but before that. So you have to do this

01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:45.320
installation pip install transformer, otherwise it is not

01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:50.320
going to work for you. Okay. So both of the things we are

01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:55.440
able to do it. So conversion of this data is done as per our

01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:58.740
discussion. So we are now able to convert, we are now into a

01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:01.340
situation. So where we can try to convert our data set into

01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:04.300
this kind of a structure, this kind of a structure, right? A

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:08.020
vector space in which we will be able to convert it. Now

01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:11.620
coming to a cosine similarity. Yeah. Now coming to a cosine

01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:17.140
similarity. So how we will be able to prove that, okay, so

01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:20.880
we have multiple sentences and what is a similarity between

01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:24.600
those two sentences in a practical manner, yeah, in a

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:28.200
practical manner. So how we will be able to understand it.

01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:32.400
So to do that, let me like create some buildups over here.

01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:35.800
Yeah. Let me like create some sort of a buildup over here.

01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:38.720
So let's suppose I'm going to use this model. I will try to

01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:41.320
show you with URI API. I'll try to show you even with this

01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:46.580
one. So let's suppose we have this, this one, right? I'm

01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:49.300
going to delete the sentences. I'm going to write my own

01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:53.880
sentences over here. So my very first sentence is, my name

01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:58.000
is Sudhanshu and I'm a software engineer. This is my very

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:04.740
first sentence. Now the second sentence is Sudhanshu is my

01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:09.660
name and I'm a software engineer. Fine. Fine. So my first

01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:15.640
sentence is apple is red, fine, and it is a fruit. Banana is

01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:18.560
yellow and it is a fruit. Some random sentences I'm trying

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:26.340
to write over here. Now Sudhanshu is giving

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:34.970
a class for gen AI and going to start class

01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:43.630
for gen AI interview. Fine. Interview preparation. Okay. So

01:21:43.630 --> 01:21:49.090
this is another sentence that I have and okay. So these are

01:21:49.090 --> 01:21:51.130
the multiple sentences. So sentence number one, sentence

01:21:51.130 --> 01:21:52.930
number two, sentence number three, sentence number four,

01:21:52.970 --> 01:21:56.270
sentence number five. So in the total I have taken five

01:21:56.270 --> 01:22:00.310
sentences. Okay. That's cool. Now I'll try to pass all of

01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:03.070
these five sentences inside this one, inside this particular

01:22:03.070 --> 01:22:07.010
model. So it is going to give me five vector. Yes, it is

01:22:07.010 --> 01:22:09.730
going to give me five vector just like this one. So I'm just

01:22:09.730 --> 01:22:12.630
trying to correlate my theory with my practical. So just

01:22:12.630 --> 01:22:15.890
like D one, D two, D three, D four, we had, we had a vector

01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:19.230
for that one, right? So here I have written four, five

01:22:19.230 --> 01:22:22.250
sentences and for five sentences. Now if I'll go and check,

01:22:22.410 --> 01:22:26.610
so I have five vector, simple one, two, three, four, five,

01:22:26.730 --> 01:22:30.230
simple five vector dimension is one, zero, two, four. I'm

01:22:30.230 --> 01:22:32.390
trying to use a quen three model, 0.6 billion parameter

01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:35.590
model, right? So we had basically, we have basically five

01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:37.870
vector, vector number one, vector number two, we have vector

01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:39.770
number three, we have vector number four, we have vector

01:22:39.770 --> 01:22:43.990
number five, we have. Now I have to check, right? Now I have

01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:47.710
to check. So vector number one or technically zeroth index

01:22:47.710 --> 01:22:52.070
vector, this one is representing this sentence. The second

01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:55.530
one is representing this sentence. The third one is

01:22:55.530 --> 01:22:58.830
representing this sentence. The fourth one is representing

01:22:58.830 --> 01:23:01.370
this and fifth one is representing this sentences, right?

01:23:01.410 --> 01:23:04.830
Whatever sentences that we have taken. Now I have to check

01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:09.250
that what is a similarity? Yeah. What is a similarity? Yeah.

01:23:10.590 --> 01:23:12.410
What is a similarity? Number one and sentence number two

01:23:12.410 --> 01:23:15.730
means I have to check what is a similarity between this and

01:23:15.730 --> 01:23:19.230
this. What is a similarity between this sentence or maybe

01:23:19.230 --> 01:23:22.930
apple is red and it is a fruit. Yeah. What is a similarity

01:23:22.930 --> 01:23:25.730
between this and maybe this one? Yeah. What is the

01:23:25.730 --> 01:23:28.310
similarity between maybe this and this one? So we have to

01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:31.330
check. I can try to use maybe a Euclidean distances or I can

01:23:31.330 --> 01:23:34.730
try to use maybe a cosine similarity. Is it making sense to

01:23:34.730 --> 01:23:37.750
all of us guys? So shall we go ahead and do a cosine

01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:42.510
similarity? Yes. Shall we go ahead and do a cosine

01:23:42.510 --> 01:23:43.830
similarity between these two vectors?

01:23:47.190 --> 01:23:50.130
Yes everyone. So till this point I think we are clear,

01:23:50.210 --> 01:23:50.350
right?

01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:03.640
Yeah. We are clear. And we also know what is the mathematics

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:06.280
behind a cosine similarity. So dot product of two vector

01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:09.140
divided by magnitude, multiplication of magnitude,

01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:13.960
magnitude. And this is going to give you a technically a

01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:17.220
cosine similarity between two vector. Okay. So I have

01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:20.220
decided, I have decided that I will try to check what is a

01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:23.100
similarity between sentence number one. Okay. And sentence

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:26.800
number two, right? Because in terms of English, it looks

01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:29.380
like that there is a lot of similarity. But we'll, we'll try

01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:31.360
to check even mathematically that what is the difference

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:35.720
between like these two vector that we have. Yeah. These two

01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:40.500
vector that we have. So to find out this cosine similarity,

01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:44.260
right, to find out this cosine similarity. So we can try to

01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:49.320
use our direct library. So there is a library called as. So

01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:55.480
from, from a skill learn. Dot matrix pair wise, you will be

01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:58.180
able to find out a direct function as a cosine similarity.

01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:02.820
Yeah. If you would like to use this one, use it. If you

01:25:02.820 --> 01:25:06.360
don't want to use this function, we know the mathematics. So

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:09.760
manually try to calculate a dot product of vectors, two

01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:14.160
vectors divided by magnitude of one vector into magnitude of

01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:17.460
a second vector. So in either way you can try to go, that's

01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:20.080
completely fine. But yeah. So inside a Python, inside a

01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:23.060
cyclical library. There's a. There's a function which they

01:25:23.060 --> 01:25:25.640
have already given to you and you can, you can try to, you

01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:28.820
know, pass the embeddings and you will be able to find out

01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:35.480
the cosine similarity. Fine. Everyone. Yeah. So in which way

01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:37.900
we should follow guys. So shall we follow a manual way or

01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:38.980
shall we use the formula?

01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:47.360
Yes. Okay. Skill and formula manual. People are saying like,

01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:53.280
okay, fine. So let's, let's go manual then manual is even

01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:56.120
very easy. Believe me. I'll show it to you. Right. Manual.

01:25:56.200 --> 01:26:02.040
So from numpy, uh, numpy, uh, import, uh, basically, uh,

01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:05.000
there is a dot. So in a numerator, we have a dot product,

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:08.820
right? So vector a dot vector B. So you can try to import a

01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:12.040
dot, which is going to build my numerator. And then if I

01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:15.660
have to build my denominator, right. So I, I have to like,

01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:22.040
uh, do a normalization, uh, this one, this one and this one,

01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:24.480
right. And then do the multiplication. So this is called as

01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:27.120
normalization. Finding the magnitude is called as norm. So

01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:31.580
normalization. So here, uh, we can try to import a library.

01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:41.860
So numpy, N U M P Y, numpy, and then finish and then import

01:26:41.860 --> 01:26:46.680
norm. So now let's try to choose a vector, right? So

01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:50.820
sentence one sentence one is what this one, this one is my

01:26:50.820 --> 01:26:54.620
sentence one, right? So from document embedding, from

01:26:54.620 --> 01:26:59.220
document embedding, try to get zeroth element. Right? This,

01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:02.340
this vector, this is my sentence one. And then I have a

01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:05.460
sentence to send us to is this by the way, okay, not an

01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:09.100
issue. So let's try to build our sentence to where variable

01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:12.640
sentence to sentence to is nothing but document embedding

01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:15.200
one. Now I have to find out that what is the similarity

01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:17.880
between sentence one and sentence to fine with the help of

01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:20.660
course and similarity. We know the formula. So formula for

01:27:20.660 --> 01:27:24.720
course and similarity is daughter awful light dot off in a

01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:28.020
numerator sentence one and sentence two. Okay. Right?

01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:32.420
Sentence one sentence two divided by normalization, right?

01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:36.140
Normalization of sentence one into sentence to execute. Now

01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:40.880
what is a similarity? Similarity is 0.96. What does the

01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:44.740
meaning of 0.96 by the way guys, it is closer to one. It is

01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:46.980
closer to one simply means that that there is a high

01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:51.000
similarity, right? There is a high similarity making sense

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:55.100
guys. Yes, everyone. And I think this was my expectation by

01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:58.360
the way. That was my expectation, right? I was expecting the

01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:02.840
same thing. Now they'll do a similarity check between this

01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:05.640
sentence and does number one that I have and my sentence

01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:09.760
number three apple is red and it is a fruit and this one. So

01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:12.040
let's see. So what is the similarity? It is going to give it

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:14.520
to me. So this is my sentence. Number three, right? Sentence

01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:18.620
number three is available at 0 1 2. So fine. Sentence number

01:28:18.620 --> 01:28:23.580
three sentence number three variable I'm going to create and

01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:30.820
it's 0 1 2. Apple is red and it is a fruit. Okay. Fine. This

01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:35.120
is my sentence number three. Now let's try to find out this

01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:42.680
one between sentence number zero and the second one and here

01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:47.540
zero. I'm going to give. Yeah, sorry. I have written

01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:51.020
sentence number one, right? My bad. So sentence number one

01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:56.980
and sentence number three, not two. So sentence one and

01:28:56.980 --> 01:28:58.320
three, one

01:29:00.370 --> 01:29:05.710
and three. Oh, what happened? Sentence number three. I think

01:29:05.710 --> 01:29:10.850
I have not executed. Okay. So now the cosine similarity

01:29:10.850 --> 01:29:13.910
between sentence number one and sentence number three is

01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:19.330
very less 0.38. Yeah. 0.38. So closer to zero. Closer to

01:29:19.330 --> 01:29:22.830
zero means it's orthogonal. Orthogonal means 19 degree

01:29:22.830 --> 01:29:25.950
perpendicular to each other. So in a mathematical term, it's

01:29:25.950 --> 01:29:28.830
basically orthogonal. Orthogonal simply means that two

01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:31.310
vectors are perpendicular to each other. Right? This is how

01:29:31.310 --> 01:29:33.950
we try to represent perpendicular, right? Orthogonal to each

01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:39.350
other. And it looks like, yeah, that's a valid point. Right?

01:29:39.390 --> 01:29:39.630
Everyone.

01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:43.580
Yeah.

01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:51.000
That's a valid point. Right? So we are able to even check

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.620
what is the similarity between sentence number one and

01:29:53.620 --> 01:29:56.740
sentence number three. My sentence number one was my name is

01:29:56.740 --> 01:29:59.160
Anshu and I'm a software engineer. My sentence number three

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:04.220
was apple is red and it is a fruit by the way. Yeah. Maybe I

01:30:04.220 --> 01:30:07.220
can do a comparison between like three and four. Simple.

01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:13.980
Right? Three and four. So here sentence number four is

01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:20.880
equals to, let's say this. Yeah. And then same thing dot

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:24.820
product sentence number three and four. Right? So sentence

01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:27.460
number three, four, three,

01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:31.120
four.

01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:38.590
Yeah. So sentence number three and four comparison, apple is

01:30:38.590 --> 01:30:41.210
red and it is a fruit and the banana is yellow and it is a

01:30:41.210 --> 01:30:43.070
fruit. So there is a similarity. It is a fruit. It is a

01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:47.030
fruit. And there are like some differences. So it is giving

01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:50.750
me like a good result, good score. So 0.78 kind of a score

01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:54.010
it is able to give it to me. So this is how I'm able to

01:30:54.010 --> 01:30:58.750
convert my data into a vector space. Now I'm able to do even

01:30:58.750 --> 01:31:04.090
a similarity check. Yes. Now, if I'm going to use a UD API,

01:31:04.270 --> 01:31:07.410
let's suppose technically I will end up getting a vector.

01:31:07.770 --> 01:31:11.390
Right? I will end up getting a vector. Once I have a vector.

01:31:11.390 --> 01:31:16.190
Once my data set is available in this form. Right? I will do

01:31:16.190 --> 01:31:20.330
the math to check how similar this data set is with respect

01:31:20.330 --> 01:31:23.870
to all the other data set. Right? With respect to all the

01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:29.110
other data set as simple as that. And so this is something

01:31:29.110 --> 01:31:32.430
which we are going to use not just today, not just tomorrow,

01:31:32.950 --> 01:31:36.090
almost going forward in every classes. So whenever we will

01:31:36.090 --> 01:31:39.690
be trying to like a study Lang chain, Lama index, Lang

01:31:39.690 --> 01:31:43.050
graph, crew AI, wherever we will be doing a doing a tool

01:31:43.050 --> 01:31:47.170
calling or maybe we'll be end up doing maybe like a agent

01:31:47.170 --> 01:31:51.790
building, right? Every time or maybe RIG application. So

01:31:51.790 --> 01:31:57.930
every time we are going to use somehow this technique to

01:31:57.930 --> 01:32:01.290
convert my data into a vector space and then process it.

01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:12.180
Yes. Everyone making sense result is different in my

01:32:12.180 --> 01:32:15.760
machine. So yes. The result is not going to be exact. Same.

01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:19.700
Point to point. Same reason is very simple. You are trying

01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:23.600
to use a generative model, right? Whether you are using

01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:27.000
Quinn or whether you are using a URI API open through a

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:30.560
small model, right? You are using a generative model.

01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:33.900
Generative model gives me a different result and gives you a

01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:35.540
different result. Obviously there will be a similarity

01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:39.400
between my and you if we are using a same model. But what do

01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:41.680
I want? It is not going to be same. It's just like you are

01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:44.280
asking some question to a chat GPT and same question I have

01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:46.700
asked to chat GPT. Or maybe you are asking the same question

01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:49.420
twice, thrice or five times. Every time it is not going to

01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:52.900
give you a similar answer, right? Because it's a generative

01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:53.220
model.

01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:03.000
Getting my point that why you will get a different number

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.620
and why I'm getting a different number.

01:33:11.310 --> 01:33:13.890
So one question regarding the conversion of text to a

01:33:13.890 --> 01:33:16.410
vector. What happening in a background? I know we are using

01:33:16.410 --> 01:33:19.070
a pre-trained model and it uses a transformer with N layers.

01:33:19.390 --> 01:33:22.950
But do we have to know about that if you are aware about

01:33:22.950 --> 01:33:26.290
architecture of transformer? It's well and good. Because

01:33:26.290 --> 01:33:29.710
there is a chances that people are going to ask you. Now

01:33:29.710 --> 01:33:32.750
your next question will be how and where I will be able to

01:33:32.750 --> 01:33:36.430
learn the entire transformer architecture. So if you will go

01:33:36.430 --> 01:33:39.830
to my previous generative NLP class, right, so you will be

01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:43.290
able to find out that I have explained the complete research

01:33:43.290 --> 01:33:47.150
paper called as attention is all you need. Over there, a

01:33:47.150 --> 01:33:49.790
transformer architecture, a multi-headed transformer

01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:53.250
architecture layer by layer I have already explained. So

01:33:53.250 --> 01:33:56.830
maybe that it will be a good reference. Point for all of

01:33:56.830 --> 01:33:58.710
you. So we are in detail. Everything has been explained.

01:34:01.550 --> 01:34:04.570
Not able to run in a local. We have to switch to the. I

01:34:04.570 --> 01:34:07.050
think you can run in a local or collab. Anything is fine. I

01:34:07.050 --> 01:34:09.650
just need a Jupyter notebook and installation. Right. So it

01:34:09.650 --> 01:34:11.530
doesn't matter whether you are running in local or you are

01:34:11.530 --> 01:34:19.030
running in a collab like. Okay. Can you repeat why we are

01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:21.890
getting a different vector? Think in this way. If I'm going

01:34:21.890 --> 01:34:25.050
to ask a question to a chat GPT and if you are going to ask

01:34:25.050 --> 01:34:29.170
a same question, no changes at all. Right. So do you think

01:34:29.170 --> 01:34:31.410
that we both are going to get the same result? Yes. Same

01:34:31.410 --> 01:34:35.630
answer. Or if you are going to ask a same question twice to

01:34:35.630 --> 01:34:38.050
a chat GPT in a different, different interface, just open up

01:34:38.050 --> 01:34:40.510
a different interface and then try to ask the same question.

01:34:40.850 --> 01:34:43.470
So do you think that it is going to give you the same

01:34:43.470 --> 01:34:47.670
answer? No. Reason is very simple. It's that's the reason

01:34:47.670 --> 01:34:49.690
it's called a generative, right? Generative model.

01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:54.670
Generative means every time based on the weights between the

01:34:54.670 --> 01:34:57.330
model, it is going to generate, produce a new kind of a

01:34:57.330 --> 01:35:02.140
data. So that is the reason you will end up getting a

01:35:02.140 --> 01:35:04.340
different answer. I will end up getting a different answer

01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:07.140
similarly. So the model that you are using over here, the

01:35:07.140 --> 01:35:10.060
embedding model, it's also a generative model, right? It is

01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:13.100
trying to take sentences as an input, English sentence as an

01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:15.620
input, and then it is trying to generate its respective

01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:16.360
embeddings.

01:35:23.250 --> 01:35:26.130
Fine. Everyone. I think we are good now.

01:35:42.820 --> 01:35:47.000
Yeah. Okay. So till this point it's completely fine, right?

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:51.160
But what was the major agenda for this week by the way? What

01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:54.120
was the agenda? We are trying to talk about like a vector.

01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:56.260
We are talking about the embeddings. Now we know what is a

01:35:56.260 --> 01:35:59.940
vector, what is a embeddings and how we can check the

01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:02.660
similarity between two data set. So all this low level

01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:07.220
concepts are clear. What is the main agenda of this class? A

01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:11.780
vector database, right? A vector database. So what vector

01:36:11.780 --> 01:36:16.510
database will do by the way? What vector database will do?

01:36:16.710 --> 01:36:22.510
Yeah. We are going to store this data. Simple. The data that

01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:26.790
we are able to produce this data. The highlighted one. So in

01:36:26.790 --> 01:36:30.450
case of a SQL system, we try to create a tables, right? And

01:36:30.450 --> 01:36:33.530
in case of in tables, we try to insert the data. In case of

01:36:33.530 --> 01:36:36.630
NoSQL document, technically a JSON format, you can say that

01:36:36.630 --> 01:36:39.110
is called as document key value pair, right? We try to store

01:36:39.110 --> 01:36:42.670
it inside a NoSQL databases. In case of a vector database,

01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:47.550
we are going to store this one, this data. And then when we

01:36:47.550 --> 01:36:50.850
are going to search, right, when we are going to search, so

01:36:50.850 --> 01:36:55.010
let's suppose I'm trying to search that. Okay. So let's

01:36:55.010 --> 01:36:57.150
suppose I have already stored this data. Yeah. I have

01:36:57.150 --> 01:37:00.130
already stored this data and then I have this particular

01:37:00.130 --> 01:37:04.010
data set I'm able to store, right? Now I have a query

01:37:04.010 --> 01:37:07.810
vector. Let's suppose I have a query and a query says that I

01:37:07.810 --> 01:37:12.050
have a query vector. Query says that, that who is Sudhanshu,

01:37:12.270 --> 01:37:17.190
right? This is my query. Yeah. So based on the query, I have

01:37:17.190 --> 01:37:22.290
to pull a data from where, from a vector DB. This is the

01:37:22.290 --> 01:37:23.810
data. This is the data which I have stored inside the vector

01:37:23.810 --> 01:37:28.630
DB, right? So how based on the query, I will be able to pull

01:37:28.630 --> 01:37:34.040
the data, cosine similarity, right? So what I will do, I

01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:38.680
will try to convert even this query. So this data, let's

01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:42.840
imagine this data is available in my vector DB. Yes. This

01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:45.900
data set is available in my vector databases. Okay. That's

01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:50.920
cool. This was my raw data set. Now user has fired a query.

01:37:51.060 --> 01:37:54.980
Yeah. User has wired a query. So whenever user has fired,

01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:57.300
this is the query and based on the query, you have to

01:37:57.300 --> 01:38:00.580
extract a relevant output, a relevant answer, which is

01:38:00.580 --> 01:38:03.480
available inside your vector DB, which is already available

01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:06.900
inside your vector DB. So here, first of all, we'll try to

01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:11.320
convert my query into a embeddings by using a exact same

01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:15.580
method, right? By using the exact same method, I will try to

01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:19.960
convert my query, not this document, I will try to convert

01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:24.780
my query. Q. Okay. So I will try to convert my query into a

01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:29.840
embeddings. Fine. Query underscore EMBD. Let's suppose I'm

01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:35.620
writing a variable. So I will try to convert my query into a

01:38:35.620 --> 01:38:39.580
embedding. So for my query, this is my embedding. This is my

01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:43.000
embedding. So now I have an embedding available for a query.

01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:48.900
Yes. And then I have so many documents out there. I have so

01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:52.060
many documents out there. Yeah. I have so many documents out

01:38:52.060 --> 01:38:55.600
there. Yeah. Now, means all of this data set is available

01:38:55.600 --> 01:39:00.460
inside my database. So what I will do, so with respect to

01:39:00.460 --> 01:39:03.720
this query, with respect to this query, this embeddings of

01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:07.320
the query, I will try to check with first, with second, with

01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:13.200
third, with fourth, with fifth. Fine. I'll try to check the

01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:15.960
distance, a similarity with first, second, third, fourth,

01:39:16.140 --> 01:39:18.900
fifth. I'll try to check a similarity with all of it, right?

01:39:19.260 --> 01:39:23.040
And whichever is going to give me more similarity. Okay.

01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:25.780
That is going to be my answer. So that is going to be the

01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:30.000
answer of that particular query. Simple, right? So here we

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:35.200
have a embedding now. So distance one, let's suppose I'm

01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:37.560
going to create. So distance one means like a query

01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:40.900
embedding and then a sentence one, right? So what is the

01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:45.620
distance between like these two? Then distance two, let's

01:39:45.620 --> 01:39:48.700
suppose if I'm going to create, so with sentence two, so

01:39:48.700 --> 01:39:53.740
distance two, distance three. Let's suppose I'm going to

01:39:53.740 --> 01:39:58.740
create. So query embedding and this one, then distance four

01:39:58.740 --> 01:40:03.180
with a fourth sentence I'm going to calculate. So fine with

01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:05.600
four sentence, we have five, right? But that's fine. So one,

01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:08.660
two, three, four with all of this four, I'm able to

01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:11.420
calculate the distance. Now let's try to print a distance,

01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:16.100
right? So maybe try to print a distance one altogether,

01:40:17.710 --> 01:40:21.860
distance two,

01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:28.680
three and four. Right? So distance one is this, distance two

01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:31.800
is this, distance three is this, distance four is this. Now

01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:36.300
give me the answer guys. I had a query. I had a query. What

01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:41.140
was my query? My query was who is Sudhanshu? Yep. My query

01:40:41.140 --> 01:40:44.020
was what? My query is who is Sudhanshu? That was my query,

01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:48.480
right? Now which sentence is going to be the top answer for

01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:53.120
my query? Yeah. Which sentence is going to be top answer for

01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:53.560
my query?

01:40:58.390 --> 01:41:01.290
Distance two but use 500. I'm using just four. I think we

01:41:01.290 --> 01:41:04.630
all understand that part, right? So like leave it. So as per

01:41:04.630 --> 01:41:08.590
this one, which sentence is going to be the answer of my

01:41:08.590 --> 01:41:14.070
query? I think we all know the answer, right? This is having

01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:17.630
a most similarity, closer to one, right? Closer to one. So

01:41:17.630 --> 01:41:21.790
this one and this is the distance for distance two, right?

01:41:21.830 --> 01:41:24.710
With sentence two. And what was the sentence two by the way?

01:41:24.770 --> 01:41:27.470
Sentence two was Sudhanshu is my name and I'm a software

01:41:27.470 --> 01:41:32.130
engineer. Yeah. So this is closer. This is closer to the

01:41:32.130 --> 01:41:35.590
query sentence that we have called as who is Sudhanshu. Now

01:41:35.590 --> 01:41:39.090
this is how, and this is where we are going to use a DB. So

01:41:39.090 --> 01:41:41.490
we are storing our embeddings into a databases. So whenever

01:41:41.490 --> 01:41:44.670
there will be a query, user is going to fire our query. It

01:41:44.670 --> 01:41:47.570
will go and we'll try to check that, okay, which one is

01:41:47.570 --> 01:41:49.850
similar and it is going to eventually give the answer.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.440
Is it making sense to all of us guys?

01:41:57.700 --> 01:42:03.610
Yeah. Is it making sense? Okay. Now. So this is something

01:42:03.610 --> 01:42:06.930
which will internally happen inside our DB again and again

01:42:06.930 --> 01:42:09.490
and again. So whenever you are going to fire a query, you

01:42:09.490 --> 01:42:12.530
are going to store the data. So again, now let's come to the

01:42:12.530 --> 01:42:16.750
use case wise. So what will be the real time use cases? So

01:42:16.750 --> 01:42:20.230
for example, all of you are working in a company, right? Or

01:42:20.230 --> 01:42:23.450
maybe you are a student and you are trying to prepare a

01:42:23.450 --> 01:42:28.450
notes. Yes. So basically all of you are a student and you

01:42:28.450 --> 01:42:30.730
are trying to prepare a notes or maybe you are working in a

01:42:30.730 --> 01:42:34.350
company. Let's suppose. Let's suppose and you have a lot of

01:42:34.350 --> 01:42:37.410
HR document, lot of finance document or maybe project

01:42:37.410 --> 01:42:40.830
document, right? We all used to keep a lot of documents

01:42:40.830 --> 01:42:45.370
while studying, while working every time. Now I wanted to

01:42:45.370 --> 01:42:50.830
create a database, right? So where I can store all of those

01:42:50.830 --> 01:42:54.130
documents, whatever data is there inside the document and

01:42:54.130 --> 01:42:58.110
then I would like to build a chat interface. So where it

01:42:58.110 --> 01:43:01.350
should answer or it should give me always an answer. Based

01:43:01.350 --> 01:43:04.950
on the existing knowledge base, not based on the global

01:43:04.950 --> 01:43:07.990
answer. So I'm not looking for some direct answer from a

01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:11.870
chat GPT. What I'm expecting over here is that, that you

01:43:11.870 --> 01:43:16.710
should give me an answer from my data. Yeah, my data because

01:43:16.710 --> 01:43:19.290
chat GPT will not be having or any other AI model will not

01:43:19.290 --> 01:43:22.450
be having any idea about the private data, right? Your

01:43:22.450 --> 01:43:24.990
private data. So what is going inside your finances? What is

01:43:24.990 --> 01:43:27.570
going inside your HR department? What kind of a notes that

01:43:27.570 --> 01:43:30.370
you have taken? Chat GPT will not be having those ideas,

01:43:30.490 --> 01:43:37.350
right? And you need an answer from that, yeah, you need an

01:43:37.350 --> 01:43:41.190
answer in that format. No issue. Convert all of read all of

01:43:41.190 --> 01:43:44.090
your PDFs or document or whatever you have, right? Convert

01:43:44.090 --> 01:43:48.230
each and everything into a embeddings, a story into a vector

01:43:48.230 --> 01:43:53.630
DV and in a chat interface, whenever I'm going to chat, it

01:43:53.630 --> 01:43:57.030
is going to do a similarity search and then it will try to

01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:59.050
bring a data set for me.

01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:08.510
Making sense guys? Yes. Yes. A lot of use cases, right?

01:44:08.530 --> 01:44:11.250
Everywhere you guys can go and use it and that is something

01:44:11.250 --> 01:44:13.990
that we will be building in a class. But yeah, I believe

01:44:13.990 --> 01:44:17.290
fundamentals are clear because that is important building

01:44:17.290 --> 01:44:19.630
wise. We can build everything in a 15 minute. That's not an

01:44:19.630 --> 01:44:22.590
issue at all. But yeah, if fundamentals are not clear, all

01:44:22.590 --> 01:44:26.330
of you are going to struggle going forward. So I believe now

01:44:26.330 --> 01:44:26.690
it's done.

01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:35.180
Yes. So that was the whole idea now. So once we are able to,

01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:37.360
now we are able to understand the fundamentals. Yeah. Just

01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:42.180
the fundamentals. Right? So tomorrow what I will do, so I'll

01:44:42.180 --> 01:44:46.060
try to introduce some of the vector databases like Facebook,

01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:49.140
AI similarity search, one vector database, chroma DB,

01:44:49.300 --> 01:44:53.580
another vector database, pine cone, another vector database,

01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:57.540
wave yet another vector database. So I'll try to introduce

01:44:57.540 --> 01:45:00.440
all of these vector databases. Some of these vector

01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:03.820
databases you will be able to install in your local. Some of

01:45:03.820 --> 01:45:07.020
these vector databases are already giving you a cloud

01:45:07.020 --> 01:45:09.300
interface. So you don't have to do any kind of a local

01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:12.380
system installation. So just go ahead and store all of those

01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:15.400
data there itself after converting into the embeddings.

01:45:15.540 --> 01:45:19.340
Yeah. Nowadays, even Mongo DB have started giving you a

01:45:19.340 --> 01:45:21.960
vector. So nowadays almost every vendor, right? Every

01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:25.040
database provider are like giving you a vector database

01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:27.820
facilities. But these are some of the famous one, Facebook,

01:45:27.860 --> 01:45:30.600
AI similarity search, and then pine cone, chroma DB, wave

01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:34.580
yet quadrant. Right. And that is the reason. So I have

01:45:34.580 --> 01:45:37.720
mentioned those vector databases inside your database. So

01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:40.360
let us learn how

01:45:43.630 --> 01:45:46.730
to use a Google collab. Please give one a small class. I

01:45:46.730 --> 01:45:50.450
mean like, do we need a class to use a Google collab? I'm

01:45:50.450 --> 01:45:53.310
not expecting this guys. Like I don't think that I'm

01:45:53.310 --> 01:45:56.070
teaching someone from a class 11, 12, or maybe eight class

01:45:56.070 --> 01:46:00.190
student. See, I will like Google collab, right? Go to

01:46:00.190 --> 01:46:03.210
Google. You are, you are able to ask a question, but you are

01:46:03.210 --> 01:46:05.970
not able to ask the same thing to a chat GPT, right? You're

01:46:05.970 --> 01:46:10.250
not able to ask same question to a URI. Simple. Google, C-O

01:46:10.250 --> 01:46:14.910
-L-A-B. I mean like there is no, and if you think that your

01:46:14.910 --> 01:46:18.250
mentor should give this kind of answer to you, believe me,

01:46:18.250 --> 01:46:21.510
you are not moving anywhere. Not even after one year. So

01:46:21.510 --> 01:46:24.730
simple search, Google collab, click now use it. I mean like,

01:46:24.730 --> 01:46:27.030
is this a rocket science? Do I need to take a class on that?

01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:32.330
I mean like that is your expectation from me. Like now

01:46:32.330 --> 01:46:35.030
Google collab is up. Write a code now. Start writing a code.

01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:43.580
No, you don't have to go to YouTube or somewhere. And then

01:46:43.580 --> 01:46:47.120
like, you know, ask a question or, well, because for

01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:49.640
everything you don't need a class, right? At least for using

01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:51.840
Google collab, who needs a class for using Google collab?

01:46:56.650 --> 01:46:58.950
Based on today's discussion, what are the topic like

01:46:58.950 --> 01:47:00.910
transformer we need to refer to improve our understanding?

01:47:01.130 --> 01:47:04.550
See, if you have to do a deep, if you have to get into a

01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:06.470
deep understanding, literally a very, very deep

01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:11.730
understanding of a transformer, then here, let me show it to

01:47:11.730 --> 01:47:16.430
you. And again, I'm recording one more video. So maybe you

01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:21.250
can wait for like a couple of days. For my new series of the

01:47:21.250 --> 01:47:24.990
transformer. And if you would like to like a known now. So I

01:47:24.990 --> 01:47:30.150
have already explained that, uh, generative AI with NLP,

01:47:30.270 --> 01:47:31.290
yeah,

01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:41.520
this one, and I can take a fine tuning. So here, if you will

01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:46.180
go, this was my previous, like a live classes to AI, the SQL

01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:52.800
power memory in an application vector embedding. Yeah. So

01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:56.680
GPT practical format. Before this. Uh, transformer,

01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:59.680
transformer and GRU. So this is the place. So where I have

01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:03.760
taken the full length lecture of, I think two hour and I

01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:07.600
have explained each and everything in terms of like a theory

01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:11.580
and then right after it practical also how to build a GPT

01:48:11.580 --> 01:48:15.740
from the scratch means how to train your own model without

01:48:15.740 --> 01:48:18.480
using any previous model that that's also I have discussed

01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:19.620
is

01:48:24.610 --> 01:48:27.570
a does UDAP allow a tool access. I wanted to enable the tool

01:48:27.570 --> 01:48:30.850
functionality to build a genetic AI. Yeah. Like how open a

01:48:30.850 --> 01:48:33.250
provide. Yeah. It, it provides actually a tool access by the

01:48:33.250 --> 01:48:37.090
way. And we have already released the SDK for that. Do we

01:48:37.090 --> 01:48:39.830
need to learn a prompt writing? Nothing. Just, just come to

01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:44.830
the class and, uh, we'll be taken care of everything. Okay.

01:48:45.130 --> 01:48:48.730
So this is it guys. So this is it from my today's class, by

01:48:48.730 --> 01:48:51.010
the way, uh, tomorrow, I think I have already set the

01:48:51.010 --> 01:48:53.830
agenda. So based on the same fundamental that I have

01:48:53.830 --> 01:48:56.370
discussed today, so tomorrow I'm going to show you an

01:48:56.370 --> 01:48:59.650
example with respect to, uh, Facebook AI similarity search.

01:48:59.670 --> 01:49:00.070
I have already set the agenda. Uh, uh, and I want you to

01:49:00.070 --> 01:49:00.070
know that basically what it has done is we've set up a code

01:49:00.070 --> 01:49:02.070
that It is based on, uh, Pincol Bay via because those

01:49:02.070 --> 01:49:04.990
implementations are not at all tough. It's a one single line

01:49:04.990 --> 01:49:08.290
of a code and you will be able to store any kind of a data,

01:49:08.410 --> 01:49:11.270
right? And then eventually you will be able to do any kind

01:49:11.270 --> 01:49:14.490
of, uh, queries as well. If you are able to understand

01:49:14.490 --> 01:49:17.250
everything from today's class, right, then it will be very,

01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:19.750
very, very, very easy if you're not able to understand. So

01:49:19.750 --> 01:49:23.330
please go through a lecture once again and, uh, yeah, come

01:49:23.330 --> 01:49:26.010
to the tomorrow's class so that we will be able to cover our

01:49:26.010 --> 01:49:30.030
vector data basis. Like I said so some of the installation

01:49:30.030 --> 01:49:33.190
we are going to do in our local system and some of those

01:49:33.190 --> 01:49:37.350
vector databases we will end up using from a like a cloud

01:49:37.350 --> 01:49:41.150
provider basically and it's free. So they are giving you

01:49:41.150 --> 01:49:43.950
like a free access so no need to like you know attach a card

01:49:43.950 --> 01:49:47.070
just do a login and I'll show it to you I'll show it to you

01:49:47.070 --> 01:49:49.910
that particular part so that our vector databases will be

01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:53.050
clear and then going forward in every classes we will end up

01:49:53.050 --> 01:49:56.130
using a vector database for most of the application. So

01:49:56.130 --> 01:49:58.670
that's a class for tomorrow that's an agenda that's a topic

01:49:58.670 --> 01:50:01.510
for tomorrow I have already made an announcement last week

01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:06.970
itself so I am on leave for next week 23rd and 24th so there

01:50:06.970 --> 01:50:10.830
is no class last week I have made an announcement today I am

01:50:10.830 --> 01:50:12.850
making an announcement once again tomorrow once again I'll

01:50:12.850 --> 01:50:15.670
make an announcement and even I'll ping you in a even I have

01:50:15.670 --> 01:50:18.290
pinged in a group last week but I'll ping you once again

01:50:18.290 --> 01:50:21.190
right so it's my planned leave and I'm telling you

01:50:21.190 --> 01:50:24.510
beforehand 14 days before I have already told you again I'm

01:50:24.510 --> 01:50:27.510
giving you a reminder. That I am on leave for next week so

01:50:27.510 --> 01:50:30.430
if you are planning something so you can just go ahead you

01:50:30.430 --> 01:50:35.080
will not miss the class yeah assignment there is no

01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:38.060
assignment for today I'm just waiting for all of you to

01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:40.600
complete a challenges which I have given you last week

01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:42.980
itself that challenges are already available inside your

01:50:42.980 --> 01:50:45.380
dashboard I have also pinged you those challenges inside

01:50:45.380 --> 01:50:48.680
your group so first complete that one tomorrow I'll give you

01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:51.220
the challenge once again once I'll end up discussing our

01:50:51.220 --> 01:50:54.140
vector DB so I have a lot of challenges a small small mini

01:50:54.140 --> 01:50:58.100
project you can say. The mini project has challenges and

01:50:58.100 --> 01:50:59.380
yeah I

01:51:01.970 --> 01:51:05.210
enjoyed today's class thank you. Okay so hope all of you are

01:51:05.210 --> 01:51:07.370
able to understand class was not boring all of you are able

01:51:07.370 --> 01:51:11.570
to enjoy and learn yes everyone yeah now one more thing I

01:51:11.570 --> 01:51:15.450
would like to highlight over here that I think we all are

01:51:15.450 --> 01:51:19.730
aware about Avani so try to use Avani at least once try to

01:51:19.730 --> 01:51:22.850
give a mock interview so I was talking to many students in

01:51:22.850 --> 01:51:27.950
one-to-one mode and what I was able to find out. That. That.

01:51:28.050 --> 01:51:32.990
People. Are. even feeling sigh they are like a feeling

01:51:32.990 --> 01:51:37.950
hesitated to even talk to a machine believe me that that's

01:51:37.950 --> 01:51:41.630
my like a experience with most of you like not most of you

01:51:41.630 --> 01:51:45.010
so I had like I keep on discussing a lot like things with

01:51:45.010 --> 01:51:48.070
all of you right maybe in a group and maybe as an individual

01:51:48.070 --> 01:51:52.010
and this is what I was able to figure out so try to use

01:51:52.010 --> 01:51:55.270
Avani at least try to give one to round of a mock interview

01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:59.950
so that you will be able to understand that what you should

01:51:59.950 --> 01:52:04.410
do and what you should not write so that is you will be able

01:52:04.410 --> 01:52:07.770
to get a real-time feeling and real-time feedback by the way

01:52:07.770 --> 01:52:11.290
and believe me Avani is giving you much better feedback as

01:52:11.290 --> 01:52:13.190
compared to any human being who is going to take your

01:52:13.190 --> 01:52:16.450
interview right it is even able to ask you a follow-up

01:52:16.450 --> 01:52:19.550
questions so not just act like a direct question no even

01:52:19.550 --> 01:52:22.210
follow-up question it is able to ask you even it is asking

01:52:22.210 --> 01:52:27.110
you to do a coding right so So, and some of my students has

01:52:27.110 --> 01:52:30.210
given me a feedback and even they have cracked the interview

01:52:30.210 --> 01:52:32.490
last week itself, right? So, they said that, okay, it's

01:52:32.490 --> 01:52:37.030
literally amazing, right? I felt more confident. So, after

01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:41.430
like going through Avni, that's part number one. Part number

01:52:41.430 --> 01:52:44.810
two, right? So, obviously, you have to create a resume. So,

01:52:44.830 --> 01:52:47.070
resume AI is already available. You can go ahead and you can

01:52:47.070 --> 01:52:50.870
try to use it. Apart from that, so I'm going to start, once

01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:53.390
I will be back from my leave, which is like two days of

01:52:53.390 --> 01:52:56.990
Saturday, Sunday leave I'm taking. So, after that, so from

01:52:56.990 --> 01:53:01.910
25th of August, we are going to start this interview batch.

01:53:02.750 --> 01:53:05.510
So, I believe most of you have a Euron Plus and with Euron

01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:07.890
Plus, we don't have to go and buy anything. It's completely

01:53:07.890 --> 01:53:11.810
fine. So, try to come to this class, even though if you

01:53:11.810 --> 01:53:14.630
don't have understanding about the whole system or whole

01:53:14.630 --> 01:53:18.230
generative AI, it's completely fine. It will at least try to

01:53:18.230 --> 01:53:22.230
like give you some sort of, you know, a memory. So, where

01:53:22.230 --> 01:53:24.490
you will be. You will be able to like retain maybe 10%, but

01:53:24.490 --> 01:53:27.550
that's okay. But try to join this class if you have a time.

01:53:27.710 --> 01:53:29.570
If you don't have a time, so maybe you can go through a

01:53:29.570 --> 01:53:33.010
recording. But yeah, try to join this class as much as you

01:53:33.010 --> 01:53:37.150
can. Here, expectation is very much clear. I'm not going to

01:53:37.150 --> 01:53:39.410
discuss anything from the scratch the way I'm discussing in

01:53:39.410 --> 01:53:42.410
this class because agenda for this interview batch is

01:53:42.410 --> 01:53:44.730
different. Agenda for this batch is completely different,

01:53:44.850 --> 01:53:47.650
right? So, in my regular batches, I do discuss everything

01:53:47.650 --> 01:53:52.190
from a scratch, fundamentals. But in case of interview, it

01:53:52.190 --> 01:53:55.330
will just go. So, I'll be talking about a storytelling. I'll

01:53:55.330 --> 01:53:58.170
be talking about a resumes. I will be talking about a back

01:53:58.170 --> 01:54:00.290
-to-back question and answer, question, answer, question,

01:54:00.350 --> 01:54:02.910
answer, question, answer on a variety of the topic. And

01:54:02.910 --> 01:54:05.930
believe me, even last time I have taken a generative AI

01:54:05.930 --> 01:54:07.930
interview bootcamp, I think three or four months back,

01:54:08.050 --> 01:54:10.690
interview bootcamp. And many people was able to make a

01:54:10.690 --> 01:54:14.570
transition since then. And even from this batch, same thing

01:54:14.570 --> 01:54:17.430
is going to happen. Yeah, same thing is going to happen.

01:54:17.930 --> 01:54:21.850
Apart from that, so there is another live batches, which we

01:54:21.850 --> 01:54:26.270
have announced. So far, and that is Python with DSA. Now,

01:54:26.330 --> 01:54:30.210
this batch, I'm not taking this batch. So, there is a very

01:54:30.210 --> 01:54:34.250
good mentor called as Ram Indra, Ram. And he's from an NIT

01:54:34.250 --> 01:54:38.490
background. He has cracked a Google. He is going to join

01:54:38.490 --> 01:54:42.410
Google in a month of September. By the way, as of now, he's

01:54:42.410 --> 01:54:45.050
working as a lead in a Wakefit. I believe we all know the

01:54:45.050 --> 01:54:48.570
company, Wakefit, basically. So, he's working as a lead over

01:54:48.570 --> 01:54:52.970
there and he's joining Google next month. Before 14. And

01:54:52.970 --> 01:54:56.370
then he is like a starting a batch with us. So, if you would

01:54:56.370 --> 01:54:59.170
like to learn something from a scratch, something from a

01:54:59.170 --> 01:55:02.670
basic, because he's going to like take everything like a

01:55:02.670 --> 01:55:06.450
Python and DSA from a very, very, very, very scratch. So,

01:55:06.550 --> 01:55:08.830
you can join this particular batch as well. So, with Euron,

01:55:08.910 --> 01:55:11.250
that's the advantage of Euron Plus, that you don't have to

01:55:11.250 --> 01:55:15.310
go and, you know, buy things again and again and again. But

01:55:15.310 --> 01:55:18.530
yeah, try to join as many classes as possible. And there is

01:55:18.530 --> 01:55:21.110
no overlap. There is no overlap between this class at least

01:55:21.110 --> 01:55:24.890
and that class. So. So, it's up to you. So, that's our

01:55:24.890 --> 01:55:27.450
announcement, guys. So, if anyone is interested, you can let

01:55:27.450 --> 01:55:29.550
them know. Or maybe if you are interested, you can try to

01:55:29.550 --> 01:55:33.330
join. I'll just simply recommend one thing to our students

01:55:33.330 --> 01:55:38.290
or maybe to a professional that try to spend as much time as

01:55:38.290 --> 01:55:42.770
possible on your Saturday to Sunday with learning. Because

01:55:42.770 --> 01:55:45.670
believe me, that is going to give you a lot of benefit in

01:55:45.670 --> 01:55:48.690
next six months of time. If you're not doing it, then it's

01:55:48.690 --> 01:55:55.550
OK. It's up to you. Yeah. OK. OK. So, I'm done with today's

01:55:55.550 --> 01:55:59.150
class, guys. I'll try to start doubt clearing. So, now those

01:55:59.150 --> 01:56:02.470
who's not having any kind of a doubt, they can drop. Yeah.

01:56:02.650 --> 01:56:05.850
They can drop from this class. Those who's having a doubts.

01:56:06.010 --> 01:56:09.670
So, I think we have a raise hand option. We all know the

01:56:09.670 --> 01:56:13.930
drill. Yeah. Let me lower all the hand first. OK. So, I've

01:56:13.930 --> 01:56:17.530
lowered all the hands. Now, raise the hand. And yeah. So,

01:56:17.590 --> 01:56:21.210
those who would like to share their screen, even you can try

01:56:21.210 --> 01:56:23.510
to ping me that I would like to share my screen. So, I will.

01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:27.050
I will make you as a panelist. And those who would like to

01:56:27.050 --> 01:56:32.460
just ask a doubt, then ask a doubt. Any plan to upload a

01:56:32.460 --> 01:56:35.080
video in a master series? I'm doing it. That's running slow

01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:39.760
because it's like consuming a lot of my time and I have a

01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:42.200
limited bandwidth. So, I'm doing it in all the batches

01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:45.680
almost. Even last week, I have uploaded couple of like a big

01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:49.480
data lectures, Spark architecture, Kafka architecture, and

01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:52.900
this one, a cloud era setup in a local machine.

01:56:57.970 --> 01:57:00.070
DSA is required. It's required for generative AI. See,

01:57:00.150 --> 01:57:02.330
irrespective of generative AI, data science, machine

01:57:02.330 --> 01:57:06.090
learning, if you are targeting a product-based company, it's

01:57:06.090 --> 01:57:09.030
required. If you are not targeting a product-based company,

01:57:09.270 --> 01:57:13.930
it's not required. So, DSA is required for all kind of a

01:57:13.930 --> 01:57:16.470
job. Even if you are going to join as a front-end developer,

01:57:16.710 --> 01:57:19.970
back-end developer, cyber security expert in a product-based

01:57:19.970 --> 01:57:24.330
companies, there couple of round will go. You will have to

01:57:24.330 --> 01:57:28.310
go through a DSA. As simple as that. It doesn't matter which

01:57:28.310 --> 01:57:33.300
profile. While you are targeting. How we can join a live

01:57:33.300 --> 01:57:35.300
class of generative AI interview bootcamp? The way you have

01:57:35.300 --> 01:57:38.120
joined this class. So, over there, you will be able to find

01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:40.900
the link and then click on the link at that particular time.

01:57:40.980 --> 01:57:43.760
Timing is already mentioned. Days are already mentioned. As

01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:46.000
simple as that. For 10 plus years of experience, DSA is

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:49.140
required. Product-based companies, even if you have a 15, 20

01:57:49.140 --> 01:57:52.240
years of experience, they are asking a DSA. Believe me, they

01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:54.260
are asking, they are taking one round of interview. If

01:57:54.260 --> 01:57:57.280
you're targeting those premium, super, super premium product

01:57:57.280 --> 01:58:00.600
-based companies because they consider DSA as a filtration

01:58:00.600 --> 01:58:05.700
criteria. Very simple. So that depends upon your target.

01:58:05.940 --> 01:58:07.780
Doesn't matter. You have 10 year experience, 15 year

01:58:07.780 --> 01:58:10.140
experience, or maybe you are having a 20 year experience or

01:58:10.140 --> 01:58:15.840
you are a fresher, right? Company wise. But sequel also a

01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:18.060
sequel. Yeah, obviously, if you're applying for a data

01:58:18.060 --> 01:58:20.220
science, big data and all those things, sequel will be

01:58:20.220 --> 01:58:22.160
mandatory, right? By the way, I

01:58:24.270 --> 01:58:26.410
have my sequel lecture. So those who would like to go

01:58:26.410 --> 01:58:28.610
through a sequel lecture, go through it. I have recorded it

01:58:28.610 --> 01:58:34.910
in a very like a neat and clean way. Okay, so do without

01:58:34.910 --> 01:58:37.950
paying all the courses boot camp. Additionally, yeah,

01:58:38.010 --> 01:58:42.470
basically that is the meaning of a do pro your own user. Uh,

01:58:42.650 --> 01:58:47.090
yes, plus basically plus we have plus, uh, so we use plus

01:58:47.090 --> 01:58:50.030
words. So yes, this is what our meaning of plus is.

01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:58.460
Seven, one hour sequel video is there. Yeah. So I do teach

01:58:58.460 --> 01:59:02.780
everything in a seven to 10. Um, I think, I think there are

01:59:02.780 --> 01:59:06.160
like a more than that. Uh, I believe 10 hours. Okay. Of

01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:08.580
videos I have uploaded just for sequel, so you can go

01:59:08.580 --> 01:59:13.620
through it in detail. Okay. Fine guys, starting a question

01:59:13.620 --> 01:59:16.480
answering now. And, uh, Mukesh is saying that he would like

01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:18.300
to share the screen. Fine Mukesh, go ahead, share the

01:59:18.300 --> 01:59:20.820
screen. I'm promoting as a panelist. Anyone else guys who

01:59:20.820 --> 01:59:23.480
would like to share the screen? Anyone else?

01:59:26.250 --> 01:59:28.110
Computer vision lecture. Yeah. So many lectures are actually

01:59:28.110 --> 01:59:31.170
pending, so I'm just trying to complete it. Hopefully we'll

01:59:31.170 --> 01:59:34.610
do it, but yeah, we'll do it. That is for sure. It is taking

01:59:34.610 --> 01:59:36.530
time. So that's a different context.

01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:43.680
Can you provide a PI spark interview question? I think. I

01:59:43.680 --> 01:59:46.700
already have that, uh, somewhere. Maybe personally we'll

01:59:46.700 --> 01:59:49.280
give it to you. So I have that PI spark question with me.

01:59:50.740 --> 01:59:53.460
Oh, okay. All right. What are your experience? What is the

01:59:53.460 --> 01:59:55.700
scope of this course? See, it doesn't matter whether you are

01:59:55.700 --> 01:59:57.640
coming from a .NET or some other development. If you are

01:59:57.640 --> 01:59:59.580
getting into a gen AI, obviously there is a chance. There's

01:59:59.580 --> 02:00:01.840
a possibility and there is a market, so you are welcome.

02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:05.600
Okay. Mukesh, please share the screen. Uh, I think you have

02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:09.340
that, uh, access and in between. So let's take a doubt from,

02:00:09.400 --> 02:00:13.560
uh, Krishna first, uh, then from Avinash, then from Puspa,

02:00:13.780 --> 02:00:19.120
then from Karthik, then from Nares. Yeah. So one by one, uh,

02:00:19.140 --> 02:00:21.240
Mukesh, first of all, let me resolve your doubt. Yeah.

02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:26.240
You're sharing the screen because I think you are on mute.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.800
Yeah. Uh, I'm your devil, sir. Yeah. You are devil Mukesh.

02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:37.740
Yes. Yeah. So I try to, uh, uh, transformers to install, but

02:00:37.740 --> 02:00:41.000
I'm getting some error saying that I'm not matching this.

02:00:41.940 --> 02:00:46.020
Your Python version is 3.13. Try to use Python 3.10 with 3

02:00:46.020 --> 02:00:49.060
.13. It's unstable. It's the latest release of Python,

02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:53.160
right? So most of the, like a transformers or TensorFlow or

02:00:53.160 --> 02:00:56.120
PyTorch installation will not work and give you an issue. So

02:00:56.120 --> 02:01:00.300
better to go ahead with 3.10. Okay. So I need to reinstall

02:01:00.300 --> 02:01:04.880
or I need to, uh, create a new environment, just simple,

02:01:04.940 --> 02:01:06.900
create a new environment. Do you know how to create a new

02:01:06.900 --> 02:01:11.600
environment? Uh, no, sir. Okay. Let me give me the screen

02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:19.320
access. I'll do it. Sure. Yeah. So I. Screen access. Hmm.

02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:21.900
Okay. I can access your system now.

02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:35.780
Kunda is not recognized. Okay, fine. So I'm going to use a

02:01:35.780 --> 02:01:41.700
Python then. Python environments of Python 3.10. Let's

02:01:41.700 --> 02:01:50.100
suppose M V E N V and environment name is, uh, test. Let's

02:01:50.100 --> 02:01:51.540
suppose this

02:01:54.520 --> 02:01:58.250
is not recognized.

02:02:23.770 --> 02:02:30.890
Command is correct. Uh, why, uh, Python V and B power cell.

02:02:32.250 --> 02:02:34.150
Hmm. That's correct. I

02:02:57.770 --> 02:03:07.070
10 3.1, 0 M V E N V test. I am 3.1. Zero is not recognized

02:03:07.070 --> 02:03:09.330
as a, okay.

02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:29.900
I think I have one, I have one. Well, son, it's a 3.1,

02:03:30.020 --> 02:03:31.640
three. So fine.

02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:38.880
Let's do one thing. Let me download Python 3.1, zero. So how

02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:49.790
you find 3.1, zero. I have fun. M V E N V test was real by

02:03:49.790 --> 02:03:55.550
then quite found 3.1, zero.

02:05:05.420 --> 02:05:08.280
Yeah. Konda installation. If someone has done, right. So it

02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:11.220
will be always better. It's will be, uh, generally I use a

02:05:11.220 --> 02:05:13.780
Konda. So even in my recording, you have seen that. I'm

02:05:13.780 --> 02:05:16.920
using a Konda, but, uh, Konda is not installed. I have all

02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:20.000
the check in a very first place. So I have to find out the

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:23.200
alternative, but yeah, if you're going to install Konda,

02:05:23.320 --> 02:05:28.940
right, so it will always be easy. So Konda create hyphen and

02:05:28.940 --> 02:05:32.900
environment name done. Okay. Uh,

02:05:35.720 --> 02:05:37.720
install now, even

02:05:40.370 --> 02:05:42.830
we have a UV package manager, so we can install it with

02:05:42.830 --> 02:05:44.510
that. But yeah, let me try this approach.

02:05:47.410 --> 02:05:50.670
So two words and we'll be, uh, working right. Like no need

02:05:50.670 --> 02:05:52.830
to. I mean, you can, you can, yeah, you can, you can switch,

02:05:52.990 --> 02:05:58.800
uh, uh, between like these two versions. Okay. If you have a

02:05:58.800 --> 02:06:02.780
Konda, then it will be like a better package manager. So you

02:06:02.780 --> 02:06:05.960
can try to keep even hundreds of us and that's cool. I'm

02:06:05.960 --> 02:06:08.180
like, even with this, you can keep a hundreds of like a

02:06:08.180 --> 02:06:11.360
versions, but in terms of managing things, uh, Konda will be

02:06:11.360 --> 02:06:13.020
easier in

02:06:17.500 --> 02:06:20.900
between. So let's go ahead with some question. Uh, yeah.

02:06:20.920 --> 02:06:25.300
Christina, please go with the question. Yeah. Good morning,

02:06:25.340 --> 02:06:29.680
sir. Yeah. Good morning. So. Uh, on a higher level, can you

02:06:29.680 --> 02:06:33.000
just explain how a sentence is getting converted into a

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:36.360
vector? Just how you love, how the, how the sentence is

02:06:36.360 --> 02:06:39.820
getting converted into the vector sentence is getting

02:06:39.820 --> 02:06:47.080
converted into our vector. Okay. So fine. Let me share my

02:06:47.080 --> 02:06:48.740
screen just

02:07:12.130 --> 02:07:12.510
a minute.

02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:53.040
Okay. I'm sharing my screen to answer. Krishna was a

02:07:53.040 --> 02:07:57.320
quotient. So. So just, I

02:08:03.500 --> 02:08:06.580
believe my screen is visible, right? Krishna. Yes, it is.

02:08:06.680 --> 02:08:09.040
Yeah. So basically I'm showing you one interface. So which

02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:11.940
has been used for explaining the transformer, right? So

02:08:11.940 --> 02:08:14.900
where we are going to give our data, as you can see from one

02:08:14.900 --> 02:08:18.220
end, right. And then internally, so we are having our

02:08:18.220 --> 02:08:21.160
vectors. So as you can see over here, so we have our vectors

02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:23.900
of like a certain dimension. So vector simply means the

02:08:23.900 --> 02:08:26.440
vector that we have discussed today, right. We could discuss

02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:29.100
today, but yeah, there is a concept called as KQV concept

02:08:29.100 --> 02:08:31.420
inside a transformer. And if you would like to know more

02:08:31.420 --> 02:08:33.720
about it, so maybe the lecture, which I have referred to

02:08:33.720 --> 02:08:37.480
you, my own lecture. So over there, I have done that, but

02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:40.660
your question was to like a, how it is trying to give me the

02:08:40.660 --> 02:08:44.260
embeddings at the end of the day and how it is trying to

02:08:44.260 --> 02:08:47.740
learn. So inside this entire architecture, as you can see,

02:08:47.780 --> 02:08:50.240
there are multiple layers. So there are multiple layers

02:08:50.240 --> 02:08:54.360
means that 12 layers as of this architecture, right. And if

02:08:54.360 --> 02:08:57.540
I'll talk about a GPT initial one, so there was 96 layers in

02:08:57.540 --> 02:09:01.420
total. So here, my data. I will go through all of these

02:09:01.420 --> 02:09:04.560
layer in a backup propagation. It is trying to learn each

02:09:04.560 --> 02:09:09.680
and everything. And then somewhere on this output part,

02:09:09.860 --> 02:09:13.440
somewhere on this output part. So it is going to generate

02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:17.160
some of the data. So maybe it is trying to generate a

02:09:17.160 --> 02:09:20.180
visualize with a percentage accuracy of this one, then this

02:09:20.180 --> 02:09:24.920
one, then this one now. So before that, right, so right

02:09:24.920 --> 02:09:27.980
before generating this particular data set, so when it will

02:09:27.980 --> 02:09:30.740
go through, when your input. So let's suppose I have

02:09:30.740 --> 02:09:34.860
written, my name is Sudhanshu. So when this entire input

02:09:34.860 --> 02:09:39.400
will go through this entire transformer architecture, so it

02:09:39.400 --> 02:09:42.880
will try to use our weight or attention layer that we have

02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:46.280
over here. Technically, it's a neural network. And then in

02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:49.440
between, it is just going to give me the numerical

02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:53.900
computation or based on the KQV. So key value and this query

02:09:53.900 --> 02:09:56.400
vector. So it is going to give me the numerical value and

02:09:56.400 --> 02:09:58.900
which is going to happen in between. This is how I'm used to

02:09:58.900 --> 02:10:02.940
get a embedding. Embeddings, basically. That makes sense.

02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:07.320
And one more thing is, I mean, you mentioned that we have

02:10:07.320 --> 02:10:12.200
few models with the different sizes, right? So how can we

02:10:12.200 --> 02:10:14.460
say that the higher dimension model is having higher

02:10:14.460 --> 02:10:18.420
accuracy? No, we can't say in that way. So I would rather

02:10:18.420 --> 02:10:21.640
prefer to say that that higher context window models will be

02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:25.560
having a higher accuracy means. So the model, if model is

02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:28.740
able to understand more lengthy sentences and it will be

02:10:28.740 --> 02:10:31.900
able to generate. More output on the on terms of a lengthy

02:10:31.900 --> 02:10:35.020
sentences, I'll say it is better. So, for example, so I'll

02:10:35.020 --> 02:10:38.520
always say that that a model context window size 128K will

02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:42.340
always be better as compared to 4K window. Yeah, so I'll

02:10:42.340 --> 02:10:45.240
rather prefer to use that particular model. And that is the

02:10:45.240 --> 02:10:47.560
reason. So when I was trying to show you even a hugging

02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:49.980
face, right? So when I was trying to show you a hugging

02:10:49.980 --> 02:10:52.440
face, so here they have given you the sequence length. That

02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:54.860
sequence length is 32K, sequence length is 32K, sequence

02:10:54.860 --> 02:10:59.060
length is 32K. So almost these models are like a same

02:10:59.060 --> 02:11:01.460
interval. In terms of generating the output of the sequence,

02:11:01.640 --> 02:11:05.080
although layers was different, layers was different. So the

02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:08.400
number of parameters has changed and then in between. So

02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:12.440
they have changed the dimension of the neurons, which was

02:11:12.440 --> 02:11:15.660
generating the embedding for the equivalent data set. But

02:11:15.660 --> 02:11:19.340
I'll rather go ahead with this one. Yeah, but but we can say

02:11:19.340 --> 02:11:24.700
that the 8B version is more accurate or more preferable than

02:11:24.700 --> 02:11:29.060
the 0.6B. Because number of learnable parameter is more. But

02:11:29.060 --> 02:11:32.800
again, so that is never guarantee going to give you a

02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:36.400
guarantee that it is going to be the best model. Now, these

02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:39.280
are the global model which people have released and they

02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:43.500
have made sure that when I'm trying to train this model. So

02:11:43.500 --> 02:11:47.720
I have given enough epoch. I have basically given enough

02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:51.780
data or you can say a context to this particular model. But

02:11:51.780 --> 02:11:54.460
let's suppose if user like me and you are trying to train

02:11:54.460 --> 02:11:57.860
and I have created a model of maybe 8B parameter and then

02:11:57.860 --> 02:12:01.720
4B. There is a possibility that your 4B will outperform my

02:12:01.720 --> 02:12:07.160
8B. Yeah, the reason is very simple again. So let's suppose

02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:10.880
I have I'm trying to run through the 8B, but maybe my data

02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:13.000
is not sufficient. Maybe I have not gone through the epochs.

02:12:13.100 --> 02:12:15.460
Maybe I have not done the fine tuning of the parameters

02:12:15.460 --> 02:12:18.880
right in case of 8B. And there is a possibility that I have

02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:21.500
done the same thing in my 4B. So I have done a better fine

02:12:21.500 --> 02:12:23.840
tuning means better parameter optimization. I have done over

02:12:23.840 --> 02:12:26.140
here better data set. I have chosen over here better

02:12:26.140 --> 02:12:28.400
formatted and structure and relevant data set. I have chosen

02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:31.580
over here. So there is a possibility. So in general, I can't

02:12:31.580 --> 02:12:35.240
say that that if your model parameter is more, your model is

02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:38.900
great. No, that is that is not an argument because model

02:12:38.900 --> 02:12:42.600
parameter always depends upon my architecture. So there is a

02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:46.920
possibility that I have created this neural network. Right.

02:12:47.060 --> 02:12:50.640
And basically you have created this neural network and maybe

02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:54.220
your neural network size is bigger. Right. Size is bigger.

02:12:54.320 --> 02:12:58.080
So in an ideal case, this neural network will be. Having

02:12:58.080 --> 02:13:02.180
more parameter as compared to this neural network. Right. So

02:13:02.180 --> 02:13:04.640
this is the this is the meaning of this parameter. This is

02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:07.120
the meaning of this 4B and 8B. There is a possibility that

02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:10.800
your model is having bigger in size means more number of

02:13:10.800 --> 02:13:15.040
parameter means more number of ways to update. And my model

02:13:15.040 --> 02:13:18.320
is having a less. That doesn't mean that that my model will

02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:21.360
be worse than your model will be best. So number of

02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:26.200
parameter is not a criteria to define a model is good or

02:13:26.200 --> 02:13:28.580
model is bad. There are different criteria. Yeah, because

02:13:28.580 --> 02:13:31.680
number of parameter is what just these connections. Right.

02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:36.160
Yeah, yeah, just this way it's so so is it the same with the

02:13:36.160 --> 02:13:40.640
GPT 20 billion and 1.2 billion also GPT 20 billion and 1.2

02:13:40.640 --> 02:13:44.500
like I said so when you are training a model so 120 billion

02:13:44.500 --> 02:13:47.640
means this context the context which I'm talking about.

02:13:47.720 --> 02:13:50.140
Right. Let's suppose this is my 20 billion and this is my

02:13:50.140 --> 02:13:53.600
120 billion means more number of weights, more number of

02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:57.020
parameter and you will be able to justify that your 120

02:13:57.020 --> 02:14:00.740
billion. Parameter model is working bill night only in one

02:14:00.740 --> 02:14:04.800
situation. So if you have trained your model in a well

02:14:04.800 --> 02:14:07.740
manner, if you have given enough amount of the data, if you

02:14:07.740 --> 02:14:11.020
have given enough epoch because if you are trying to give

02:14:11.020 --> 02:14:13.280
enough or a huge amount of the data and if you're running

02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:16.760
for a multiple or many epochs, maybe more than this

02:14:16.760 --> 02:14:20.500
particular model, then you are investing a lot on a GPU. So

02:14:20.500 --> 02:14:23.060
if you have done that, then only you can say that my 120 is

02:14:23.060 --> 02:14:26.840
better than 20 billion. Otherwise, I will not be able to say

02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:30.340
that same. I think with the shorty. Okay, so one last

02:14:30.340 --> 02:14:35.160
question. So suppose let's say I have an 10 documents. Okay,

02:14:35.340 --> 02:14:40.480
one document and 10 lines. Suppose if I'm using the text

02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:43.740
embedding model, the basic 0.6, which is having one or two

02:14:43.740 --> 02:14:49.320
for embedding size and 8 billion, which is having 4096. It

02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:53.080
does that mean that my one document one sentence is getting

02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:58.780
mapped to 1024 parameters? And when finding the similarity

02:14:58.780 --> 02:15:05.060
it is you know finding i mean comparing got your question so

02:15:05.060 --> 02:15:07.240
you are saying that that you are trying to use basically

02:15:07.240 --> 02:15:10.020
this model to do a like a conversion at the time of query

02:15:10.020 --> 02:15:13.540
maybe you will try to use some different model and then you

02:15:13.540 --> 02:15:15.920
will try to so basically you are trying to do a apple to

02:15:15.920 --> 02:15:19.680
orange comparison which is not preferable at all what if i

02:15:19.680 --> 02:15:23.880
am doing in the same model i mean suppose let's say 0.6 0.6

02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:28.520
and 8b 8b i am doing so 0.6 0.6 8b 8b you are doing then it

02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:31.400
is a justified one right because see every model has learned

02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:34.300
learned means what so every model is trying to like uh

02:15:34.300 --> 02:15:37.520
establish a relationship between what will come before what

02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:39.780
will come after and accordingly it is generating your

02:15:39.780 --> 02:15:42.080
embeddings right means it is understanding your sentence

02:15:42.080 --> 02:15:45.840
your text by the way right so if you are using 6b and 6b

02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:48.080
comparison and if you are using 8b and 8b comparison then

02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:51.540
it's completely fine okay makes sense thank you but

02:15:51.540 --> 02:15:54.500
otherwise like you can't go ahead and use like a 6b and 8b

02:15:54.500 --> 02:15:57.380
you can't do the comparison because that will be like apple

02:15:57.380 --> 02:15:59.600
to orange comparison which is which you will not be able to

02:15:59.600 --> 02:16:03.640
justify the output understood sir by the way can you share

02:16:03.640 --> 02:16:07.420
that transformer visualizer this one the visualizer which i

02:16:07.420 --> 02:16:11.640
have shown you yeah technically this visualizer will not be

02:16:11.640 --> 02:16:16.700
able to give you a clear understanding okay okay let me

02:16:16.700 --> 02:16:18.900
complete so yeah this visualizer is not going to give you a

02:16:18.900 --> 02:16:22.520
clear understanding if you are new to a transformer so it

02:16:22.520 --> 02:16:24.840
will be able to i'm going to share this link don't worry

02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:28.900
yeah so link is available but uh just go through my lecture

02:16:28.900 --> 02:16:31.520
once yeah i'm going through it there is there is something

02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:33.800
called as k there is something called as q there is

02:16:33.800 --> 02:16:36.340
something called as b there is something called as multi

02:16:36.340 --> 02:16:38.360
-header attention there is something called as positional

02:16:38.360 --> 02:16:42.120
encoding when you we try to insert a data inside this one so

02:16:42.120 --> 02:16:44.800
unless and until you are not going to understand all of

02:16:44.800 --> 02:16:48.120
these things in a sequence right and unless you are not

02:16:48.120 --> 02:16:50.000
clear with a multi-header attention so that's it which has

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.140
been shown over here right that it is trying to form the

02:16:52.140 --> 02:16:55.680
multi-header attention and then mlp layer on top of this it

02:16:55.680 --> 02:16:57.940
will be very difficult once you will be able to understand

02:16:57.940 --> 02:17:00.580
that part from the lecture and then if you come here believe

02:17:00.580 --> 02:17:03.660
me in a one thought you will be able to understand okay next

02:17:03.660 --> 02:17:08.620
thanks that's it yeah so okay so i think uh mckay's was

02:17:08.620 --> 02:17:14.440
sharing his screen yeah yeah please share your screen yeah

02:17:18.370 --> 02:17:19.370
okay

02:17:21.580 --> 02:17:26.840
so sorry to repair or modify um anything like add remove

02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:29.480
individual features yeah anything

02:17:31.620 --> 02:17:34.300
anything is fine okay yeah

02:17:36.670 --> 02:17:37.450
yeah

02:17:43.050 --> 02:17:49.710
so i think it's installed now you can try to open up your 3

02:17:58.540 --> 02:18:04.520
.13 python 1.0 3

02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:30.800
.10 hyphen m v e and v test now it's able to identify so

02:18:35.370 --> 02:18:38.110
what your environment has been created now if i have to like

02:18:38.110 --> 02:18:41.790
activate this virtual environment so there must be a folder

02:18:41.790 --> 02:18:47.830
called as test so i can just try to activate this virtual

02:18:47.830 --> 02:18:48.490
environment

02:18:53.480 --> 02:19:02.150
so test and then less inside this we have a scripts so

02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:08.730
inside that we have activate so scri scripts slash activate

02:19:08.730 --> 02:19:14.170
okay so this has been activated now so you have to like you

02:19:14.170 --> 02:19:19.690
have already created this python 3.10 test environment so in

02:19:19.690 --> 02:19:22.970
your jupyter notebook i'm not able to see the above part

02:19:23.950 --> 02:19:27.250
okay let me remove this one yeah remove one second

02:19:32.030 --> 02:19:36.810
yeah and let it down yeah so python i can select a different

02:19:36.810 --> 02:19:37.210
kernel

02:19:40.060 --> 02:19:44.300
so test this is visible right python 3.10 so now this has

02:19:44.300 --> 02:19:47.880
been attached and let's suppose if i'm installing

02:19:47.880 --> 02:19:51.220
transformer so

02:19:56.180 --> 02:19:56.740
okay

02:20:14.370 --> 02:20:16.850
so in between uh we can go with the question yeah ranjit

02:20:16.850 --> 02:20:20.370
what is your question by the way yeah i have a couple of

02:20:20.370 --> 02:20:26.470
questions one is that i have the issue with your platform

02:20:26.470 --> 02:20:30.710
what happens is that when i try to join it asks me to

02:20:30.710 --> 02:20:35.510
register again so this was very confusing no no register

02:20:35.510 --> 02:20:38.390
means that is a zoom link right so in a zoom link i think it

02:20:38.390 --> 02:20:41.690
is asking you to enter the name and email id something like

02:20:41.690 --> 02:20:46.730
that just a basic information it takes uh but it has uh i'm

02:20:46.730 --> 02:20:50.430
already there means why does it ask again every time you

02:20:50.430 --> 02:20:53.790
want to join it uh i think we'll have to change some setting

02:20:53.790 --> 02:20:56.170
in a zoom that is not our platform setting that is a zoom

02:20:56.170 --> 02:20:58.710
setting so we'll we'll have to like uh we'll have to like a

02:20:58.730 --> 02:21:03.430
change that one so does everybody have this issue or i am

02:21:03.430 --> 02:21:06.250
the only one no no i think everyone everyone will see the

02:21:06.250 --> 02:21:08.510
same thing exact same thing the window that you are able to

02:21:08.510 --> 02:21:12.190
see right uh it's same for every one of us okay another

02:21:12.190 --> 02:21:17.730
question that i have is api keys i try to create today but

02:21:17.730 --> 02:21:22.410
it it then let me and it says no api keys when i click that

02:21:22.410 --> 02:21:26.710
button it doesn't do anything so i never had this issue

02:21:26.710 --> 02:21:30.970
before because i used to in in your last lecture i mean not

02:21:30.970 --> 02:21:36.690
last lecture means last okay means i i had no problem never

02:21:36.690 --> 02:21:40.050
but now i am not able to create so can you see what's why

02:21:40.050 --> 02:21:42.610
yeah sure so please please share this i don't i don't think

02:21:42.610 --> 02:21:44.910
that this should be the issue because i am able to do it so

02:21:44.910 --> 02:21:48.250
it's same for you yeah yeah i also had never issued but now

02:21:48.250 --> 02:21:52.530
i have okay so how do i share my machine yeah so i'm

02:21:52.530 --> 02:21:54.250
promoting as a panelist you will be able to share your

02:21:54.250 --> 02:22:00.190
machine yeah join us yeah exactly join as a panelist so

02:22:00.190 --> 02:22:04.770
ranjit sorry uh mukesh right so mukesh transformer people

02:22:04.770 --> 02:22:08.950
transformer and uh uh you are using people something however

02:22:08.950 --> 02:22:12.630
fine you should be considering this this this this okay so

02:22:12.630 --> 02:22:14.250
could not find the version that certified the requirement

02:22:14.250 --> 02:22:17.770
transformer for was on this one okay not an issue so you are

02:22:17.770 --> 02:22:22.890
so i think sentence transformer was the one right library uh

02:22:22.890 --> 02:22:25.990
yeah yeah it's already done sentence time this one yeah

02:22:25.990 --> 02:22:29.410
request also i had i don't know why it is coming no request

02:22:29.410 --> 02:22:32.250
will be available by default so you have to change api key

02:22:32.250 --> 02:22:37.950
over here yeah okay so already generated okay so if you can

02:22:37.950 --> 02:22:42.390
copy and paste there hold on a second oh

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:58.640
it's not yeah copy the key and let me uh okay i'm doing it

02:22:58.640 --> 02:23:03.620
leave it leave it okay yeah i'm doing it so here copy and

02:23:03.620 --> 02:23:07.520
paste and then hit simple no module name required request

02:23:07.520 --> 02:23:11.460
okay so in this uh jupiter one it is not able to find out

02:23:11.460 --> 02:23:15.440
the request not an issue so yeah it's okay uh okay for this

02:23:15.440 --> 02:23:18.380
version i didn't install yeah so this is the new kernel that

02:23:18.380 --> 02:23:21.940
i've selected yes correctly fine and also number you also

02:23:21.940 --> 02:23:29.600
required i think okay so we'll do numpy as well so a new m

02:23:29.600 --> 02:23:31.100
pui execute

02:23:34.100 --> 02:23:34.620
just

02:23:39.950 --> 02:23:40.370
,

02:23:58.380 --> 02:24:05.130
numpy is done and now so executed it will be done yeah it's

02:24:05.130 --> 02:24:08.770
working so here is your embedding mckays that you are able

02:24:08.770 --> 02:24:10.930
to get yeah fine

02:24:13.140 --> 02:24:15.440
i think okay so you are on mute yes

02:24:18.480 --> 02:24:21.380
i got it yeah thank you got it yeah okay Yeah. So you can

02:24:21.380 --> 02:24:23.920
answer the screen. Yeah. I think I can see your screen. So

02:24:23.920 --> 02:24:26.420
can you please give me a control of your screen? I'll do it

02:24:26.420 --> 02:24:34.640
quickly. Uh, let me release the control form. Okay. Um,

02:24:36.140 --> 02:24:37.160
okay.

02:24:53.330 --> 02:24:59.500
So just click on this create API key. Yeah. So it didn't let

02:24:59.500 --> 02:25:04.520
me do anything. Yeah. Give any name. Oh, name here. Yeah.

02:25:04.620 --> 02:25:07.620
Any name, anything test to X, Y, G, whatever. Yeah. Click on

02:25:07.620 --> 02:25:10.880
create. Oh, done.

02:25:12.920 --> 02:25:18.560
This is your key. Copy it. Use it. But I mean, did we used

02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:24.420
to do like this before also? Oh yeah. Even till last week it

02:25:24.420 --> 02:25:26.560
was same. Like I think we have changed our system two months

02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:29.560
back since last month it was like we have not changed it.

02:25:29.580 --> 02:25:32.960
This system at least. Yeah. Because I have not used your key

02:25:32.960 --> 02:25:35.940
in the last two months before I used to do, but it was.

02:25:36.080 --> 02:25:39.840
Before that interface was different. So before that we were

02:25:39.840 --> 02:25:42.900
not giving an option to create API key. So by default, when

02:25:42.900 --> 02:25:46.620
you will log in, there was a API key and what we have done.

02:25:46.680 --> 02:25:48.940
So we have done a little bit of modification, just like any

02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:52.000
international platform does it right. That you can. So

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:55.420
before that there was no option to deactivate or delete your

02:25:55.420 --> 02:25:58.520
API key. Now you have a delete and deactivate let's suppose

02:25:58.520 --> 02:26:01.500
by mistake, you have shared the API key, right? So now you

02:26:01.500 --> 02:26:04.520
can go and delete it. See there is a delete option. Okay. It

02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:06.640
makes sense now. Thank you very much. Very much for the

02:26:06.640 --> 02:26:13.660
explanation. Now I have another question is this question is

02:26:13.660 --> 02:26:16.860
on a vision language model. Remember you said that you

02:26:16.860 --> 02:26:21.100
remind you, I said that, that I have asked my team to, you

02:26:21.100 --> 02:26:25.540
know, uh, uh, like, uh, given access of one of the vision,

02:26:25.560 --> 02:26:27.760
uh, vision model, but I think they have not done the

02:26:27.760 --> 02:26:32.320
implementation so far. Could you remind them? Yeah. So I'll

02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:34.500
just ask my team once again, let's see when they do it.

02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:36.060
Yeah. Okay. Another question. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

02:26:36.060 --> 02:26:36.340
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, and I, uh, another question

02:26:36.340 --> 02:26:36.720
now you yesterday. In other words, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

02:26:36.720 --> 02:26:39.060
Another question I have is, uh, suppose if I have to

02:26:39.060 --> 02:26:44.300
generate a financial report? Okay. And, uh, and I want that

02:26:44.300 --> 02:26:48.080
that financial report will be consistent, I generate or

02:26:48.080 --> 02:26:55.780
describes a financial data. So, so they LLM Yeah. Models

02:26:55.780 --> 02:27:00.680
during the day will generate, uh, like the will be, it will

02:27:00.680 --> 02:27:03.040
be a hundred percent consistent every time, but there will

02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:06.040
be some problem in that. Perole I mean in the real world,

02:27:06.040 --> 02:27:10.360
values of finance i mean uh i don't think so if you are

02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:14.600
giving your real data and if you are using a best model and

02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:17.080
if you are keeping your temperature low right there is an

02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:18.720
option called a temperature right if you're keeping your

02:27:18.720 --> 02:27:21.860
temperature zero for example temperature zero so will it be

02:27:21.860 --> 02:27:25.780
consistent let's suppose point one right so in that case yes

02:27:25.780 --> 02:27:30.520
you can say that there will be a very less chance of doing a

02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:33.560
hallucination very less chance i can't i can't say that no

02:27:33.560 --> 02:27:35.880
one can say that with the hundred percent accuracy that it

02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:40.220
won't right but i think 99.9 accuracy is more than enough in

02:27:40.220 --> 02:27:42.340
terms of numbers right if you're feeding a numbers believe

02:27:42.340 --> 02:27:45.580
me it will be always correct it will be always correct yeah

02:27:45.580 --> 02:27:49.660
because because in banking or in financial they cannot take

02:27:49.660 --> 02:27:55.420
chance of even 0.1 that i agree see uh so it will do a

02:27:55.420 --> 02:27:59.560
hallucination when you try to give a prompt and then you try

02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:03.140
to ask them to generate something see hallucination again

02:28:03.140 --> 02:28:05.860
it's not like every time in every cases it is going to do a

02:28:05.860 --> 02:28:09.220
hallucination hallucination will happen when you are going

02:28:09.220 --> 02:28:11.880
for a generation few sort prompt or maybe just a prompt

02:28:11.880 --> 02:28:15.800
right where you are trying to like ask and then system is

02:28:15.800 --> 02:28:18.500
generating from the scratch let's suppose i'm doing rag this

02:28:18.500 --> 02:28:20.900
is where rag comes into picture right so let's suppose i'm

02:28:20.900 --> 02:28:24.140
doing rag i have my financial document and uh what i want

02:28:24.140 --> 02:28:27.960
that okay so i will use the llms but i will try to use my

02:28:27.960 --> 02:28:31.200
own vector db so where i have stored my original data so in

02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:34.140
that situation it will never hallucinate the reason is again

02:28:34.140 --> 02:28:38.260
very simple because before hitting the llms right so it goes

02:28:38.260 --> 02:28:41.220
to a rag based on your query it try to extract the data

02:28:41.220 --> 02:28:44.260
right and then that data will go to the lm just for the

02:28:44.260 --> 02:28:48.560
reformating purpose yeah not for generation purpose right so

02:28:48.560 --> 02:28:50.940
there is there is a difference right so reformating and a

02:28:50.940 --> 02:28:53.660
generation so if you are going at the rag approach and then

02:28:53.660 --> 02:28:56.260
if you are asking your like a system to give you an answer

02:28:56.260 --> 02:28:59.980
it is going to be 100 accurate because it is not even asking

02:28:59.980 --> 02:29:02.560
your lm to generate there is no chance of generating because

02:29:02.560 --> 02:29:03.140
it is not even asking your lm to generate of hallucination

02:29:03.140 --> 02:29:06.640
so you can't even like you can keep temperature anything

02:29:06.640 --> 02:29:11.320
that that is completely fine okay okay so another question i

02:29:11.320 --> 02:29:21.340
have is suppose i want to scrap data from duck scanner okay

02:29:21.340 --> 02:29:25.840
so i tried i tried similar to twitter twitter i was able no

02:29:25.840 --> 02:29:32.720
issue okay but when i try with the back scanner it will it

02:29:32.720 --> 02:29:37.560
gives up so do you have any idea can you give me any kind of

02:29:38.840 --> 02:29:43.140
some way of handling that scanner that scanner you know it

02:29:43.140 --> 02:29:48.480
is a cryptos data and and it and it moves very very fast for

02:29:48.480 --> 02:29:54.300
for example i want to know in one hour last one hour how

02:29:54.300 --> 02:30:01.200
many uh tokens have attained 400 percent in five minutes

02:30:01.200 --> 02:30:06.880
okay so that's my uh question okay so if you have to develop

02:30:06.880 --> 02:30:11.320
some program how would you develop it maybe just give me

02:30:11.320 --> 02:30:16.300
some kind of idea so that i can get the data and i can scrap

02:30:16.300 --> 02:30:21.940
what i need the information so scrapping wise we have been

02:30:21.940 --> 02:30:26.960
using a file basically and uh yeah it was working well apart

02:30:26.960 --> 02:30:30.640
from that so even my was using couple of more uh you know

02:30:30.640 --> 02:30:36.460
scrapping uh apis uh nowadays to scrap some of the data but

02:30:36.460 --> 02:30:40.040
none of those scrappers was like 100 perfect i would say

02:30:40.040 --> 02:30:43.960
like in every cases there was like a lot of cases where none

02:30:43.960 --> 02:30:46.660
of them was working and we were looking for the alternative

02:30:46.660 --> 02:30:50.560
so scraping wise i don't think that you can rely on any of

02:30:50.560 --> 02:30:52.580
the scrapper which is available in the market 100 percent

02:30:52.580 --> 02:30:56.760
but have you tried a duck scanner or you're talking about

02:30:56.760 --> 02:31:00.640
journalists a crypto i heard about that but i have never

02:31:00.640 --> 02:31:06.840
tried that so so you're talking about yeah i have already

02:31:06.840 --> 02:31:11.760
tried but uh like uh not much i would say maybe i'll have to

02:31:11.760 --> 02:31:16.260
re-explore once again do you think it will be possible for

02:31:16.260 --> 02:31:20.240
you to explore it uh give me some idea possible wise yeah

02:31:20.240 --> 02:31:22.800
maybe i can ask some of my team members to do the

02:31:22.800 --> 02:31:25.100
exploration and what is the possibility of fetching a data

02:31:25.100 --> 02:31:29.420
from here because uh crypto reading so i think it should be

02:31:29.420 --> 02:31:33.780
possible i don't see a challenges over here and i don't

02:31:33.780 --> 02:31:36.620
think that they have blocked any of their like uh ports uh

02:31:37.270 --> 02:31:40.420
basically in terms of scrapping the data yeah no because

02:31:40.420 --> 02:31:45.140
they have the apis right they use the apis and that is not

02:31:45.140 --> 02:31:50.220
an issue so if they have a api then why we need a strapping

02:31:50.220 --> 02:31:56.500
then call the api but somehow i was not successful in

02:31:56.500 --> 02:32:00.640
getting the data i mean i was able to basically log in okay

02:32:00.640 --> 02:32:06.840
but then after that uh i used him in chat gpt and i believe

02:32:06.840 --> 02:32:12.040
i tried maybe you rona so but uh but i couldn't get there i

02:32:12.040 --> 02:32:15.200
mean if you can give me some kind of maybe your team can

02:32:15.200 --> 02:32:18.240
help me a little better let me check the api it's api

02:32:18.240 --> 02:32:20.620
endpoint i'm just checking it so i'm able to actually call

02:32:20.620 --> 02:32:23.520
the people whether you are okay fine so

02:32:25.360 --> 02:32:28.320
those next i'm

02:32:30.340 --> 02:32:34.280
just checking the api part because if if they end point they

02:32:34.280 --> 02:32:36.860
have released it then there is no issue at all so typically

02:32:36.860 --> 02:32:41.520
any request per minute you can send okay they have official

02:32:41.520 --> 02:32:47.800
apis so what did you type now i'm giving you i'm giving you

02:32:47.800 --> 02:32:48.180
that okay

02:33:22.780 --> 02:33:26.260
i'm just checking its api endpoint so okay give me some time

02:33:26.260 --> 02:33:28.060
yeah sure

02:36:53.160 --> 02:36:57.100
looking for a pairs right over there uh token pairs you are

02:36:57.100 --> 02:37:02.840
looking for yes yeah yeah the pairs that are increasing in

02:37:02.840 --> 02:37:06.400
certain amount of time okay so the latest one you were

02:37:06.400 --> 02:37:11.260
looking for i am yes i'm able to get something by hitting

02:37:11.260 --> 02:37:17.860
its api so really so this was the output that you were

02:37:17.860 --> 02:37:25.120
looking for the highlighted one uh how do i see that what

02:37:25.120 --> 02:37:27.900
you're trying to show me okay is it not visible okay let me

02:37:27.900 --> 02:37:32.480
share my screen once again so i'm sharing my screen i think

02:37:32.480 --> 02:37:37.680
you can see it on my screen um i'm not able to see anything

02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:41.140
yet okay maybe you can stop sharing your screen then only

02:37:41.140 --> 02:37:45.560
you can see it okay stop sharing okay now you can see my

02:37:45.560 --> 02:37:50.960
screen yes now you can see where is the result do you see

02:37:50.960 --> 02:37:54.020
something here oh

02:37:59.210 --> 02:38:01.830
so basically this is the chain and this is the pair that it

02:38:01.830 --> 02:38:05.210
is returning then again chain solana and then so chain

02:38:05.210 --> 02:38:08.710
osmosis and then pair so again chain osmosis and then pair

02:38:08.710 --> 02:38:12.590
it is trying to uh like uh yeah but it is not showing what

02:38:12.590 --> 02:38:17.110
is the current rate and what it no that i can that i can

02:38:17.110 --> 02:38:20.390
pull so i mean like this is oh this is something that i can

02:38:20.390 --> 02:38:24.530
i can uh get it right so uh that is also possible to pull it

02:38:24.790 --> 02:38:29.010
okay okay okay now i understand yeah simple matter of thing

02:38:29.010 --> 02:38:31.790
is that if atpi is returning something then i can get it as

02:38:31.790 --> 02:38:36.550
simple as that can you put that code here on the chat and

02:38:36.550 --> 02:38:41.450
let me see and try and then move from there if i have some

02:38:41.450 --> 02:38:45.670
problem then i uh maybe next time we can talk yeah so i'm

02:38:45.670 --> 02:38:48.710
just like a pinging this entire file itself into your uh

02:38:48.710 --> 02:38:54.510
generatively group so you can download it yeah i i'm just

02:38:54.790 --> 02:38:57.770
move dot url i don't know why it is appending not url so i

02:38:57.770 --> 02:39:02.050
have just been a group itself okay just just remove that you

02:39:02.050 --> 02:39:07.370
will part dot pi only dot pi okay yeah yeah so i will be

02:39:07.370 --> 02:39:12.210
able to then carry on from here yeah okay but i haven't yet

02:39:12.210 --> 02:39:15.310
seen okay there is another question not a question but

02:39:15.310 --> 02:39:18.270
information that these days i am talking with the government

02:39:18.270 --> 02:39:25.030
of china for their national uh programs to to fund my

02:39:25.030 --> 02:39:30.290
company so on on generative ai so i believe we are moving it

02:39:30.290 --> 02:39:34.610
to the high gear so we'll know what comes out of this oh

02:39:34.610 --> 02:39:40.610
let's see that's for the information okay yeah so so about

02:39:40.610 --> 02:39:45.350
the code where do i see the code with you so basically uh

02:39:45.350 --> 02:39:48.190
yeah open up into a vs code remove the url part you will see

02:39:48.190 --> 02:39:54.070
as a python file yes code oh open up in any code editor not

02:39:54.070 --> 02:39:59.210
a vs code only in any code editor just open it up and uh you

02:39:59.210 --> 02:40:01.750
can see it let me see

02:40:05.820 --> 02:40:13.100
okay yeah okay i open this but i'm not sure what are you let

02:40:13.100 --> 02:40:16.820
me let me bring up yeah now code is available inside of jet

02:40:19.150 --> 02:40:21.130
assalamu alaikum sir sir

02:40:45.130 --> 02:40:51.550
i know sentences sleevis 1536 okay

02:40:54.130 --> 02:40:59.510
okay okay okay So here you have multiple sentences, so by

02:40:59.510 --> 02:41:02.890
default when you are passing in it, then with the help of

02:41:02.890 --> 02:41:05.450
comma, it is understanding that this sentence is different

02:41:05.450 --> 02:41:08.910
and this sentence is different. So your first question was,

02:41:08.950 --> 02:41:11.970
I believe, how it will differentiate between sentences. So

02:41:11.970 --> 02:41:14.230
for this particular model, which is taking this output,

02:41:14.530 --> 02:41:17.410
there is a comma in the differentiator sentence that this is

02:41:17.410 --> 02:41:18.850
a different sentence, this is different, this is different,

02:41:18.850 --> 02:41:21.810
this is different. Now, for example, if we are putting it in

02:41:21.810 --> 02:41:24.030
URI, if we are putting it in this one, then we have given

02:41:24.030 --> 02:41:27.190
you a function. This function is considering, let's suppose,

02:41:27.270 --> 02:41:31.730
that only one input. So if you have multiple sentences, like

02:41:31.730 --> 02:41:36.330
this one, list of sentences, then what will you do? You will

02:41:36.330 --> 02:41:39.750
run it in the loop, in the for loop basically. For I in this

02:41:39.750 --> 02:41:42.450
entire document, for example, if I have to write this

02:41:42.450 --> 02:41:47.310
document through URI, then what will we do here? I have the

02:41:47.310 --> 02:41:49.530
getImaging function here. And I have the getImaging function

02:41:49.530 --> 02:41:51.050
here. And let's suppose that the getImaging function takes

02:41:51.050 --> 02:41:55.250
your data. Someone takes the text here as an input. So here

02:41:55.250 --> 02:41:59.030
we need the document one. So we will write the code here for

02:41:59.030 --> 02:42:03.750
I in and then document. Document embedding. What is document

02:42:03.750 --> 02:42:07.170
embedding? So in document embedding, I have data. Sorry,

02:42:07.290 --> 02:42:10.010
there was data in the document, right? So I have data in

02:42:10.010 --> 02:42:16.570
this. So here we will write. I have this. Let's make one

02:42:16.570 --> 02:42:20.810
fresh. Let's make one fresh. So here we will write for I in

02:42:20.810 --> 02:42:25.490
documents. So what will it do? One by one, one by one, it

02:42:25.490 --> 02:42:27.890
will take it. First it will remove this, then it will remove

02:42:27.890 --> 02:42:29.970
this, then this, then this, then this. And where will we

02:42:29.970 --> 02:42:32.410
pass this? We will do it in this. We will call the generate

02:42:32.410 --> 02:42:34.250
embedding function. Because I know that the generate

02:42:34.250 --> 02:42:37.110
embedding function takes one data. So first we will pass I

02:42:37.110 --> 02:42:40.130
is equal to this. Then we will pass this. Then we will pass

02:42:40.130 --> 02:42:43.810
this. Then we will pass this. And in this way, we will find

02:42:43.810 --> 02:42:48.790
out its generate embedding. It is saying, not defined. So I

02:42:48.790 --> 02:42:52.550
think once again, execute it, and it will be defined. Sir,

02:42:52.570 --> 02:42:58.630
my question is coming. My question is coming. Second

02:42:58.630 --> 02:43:02.850
question is also coming. OK. So do you understand that this

02:43:02.850 --> 02:43:05.330
has been differentiated from here? One minute. I am showing

02:43:05.330 --> 02:43:08.170
you that you are coming to the second question. Now your

02:43:08.170 --> 02:43:12.410
question was that, OK, it generated five here. Right? Now,

02:43:12.570 --> 02:43:15.630
in a reverse calculation, how will he know? How will we know

02:43:15.630 --> 02:43:16.330
the meaning of this sentence?

02:43:20.150 --> 02:43:25.870
How will we know the meaning of this sentence? Because we

02:43:25.870 --> 02:43:29.090
have the entire book. We have to give each sentence by

02:43:29.090 --> 02:43:33.010
ourselves. There is no such thing that tells us that this is

02:43:33.010 --> 02:43:40.650
the meaning of this sentence. Yes, exactly. For example, if

02:43:40.650 --> 02:43:45.110
I have a book. If you read the data of the entire book in

02:43:45.110 --> 02:43:47.390
the book, it is possible that you consider one paragraph as

02:43:47.390 --> 02:43:51.790
one document. Or consider one page or one chapter as one

02:43:51.790 --> 02:43:55.410
document. So when you read the PDF in Python programming,

02:43:55.650 --> 02:44:00.350
you will define what the length of one sentence should be.

02:44:00.350 --> 02:44:02.390
Its length should be such a character, its length should be

02:44:02.390 --> 02:44:06.250
such a word that you are going to define. Now, the model

02:44:06.250 --> 02:44:06.690
does not care about the length of the sentence character.

02:44:08.950 --> 02:44:11.510
Because the model gives the output. The model gives the

02:44:11.510 --> 02:44:14.450
output. The model gives the output 1536. As simple as that.

02:44:14.550 --> 02:44:18.090
The output of the model is always. Let's suppose that we

02:44:18.090 --> 02:44:21.950
have put a sentence of 2000 words here. The model will

02:44:21.950 --> 02:44:25.590
always generate its output in 1536. That is, it will try to

02:44:25.590 --> 02:44:29.930
represent it in the same dimension. Because we have to do

02:44:29.930 --> 02:44:34.370
comparison there. We have to do matching there. So this will

02:44:34.370 --> 02:44:36.390
be generated. And then you will do the comparison.

02:44:39.100 --> 02:44:44.280
Any other question? Yeah. So, student question has come out.

02:44:44.280 --> 02:44:46.120
Yes. I mean, check this one first. Because we don't have a

02:44:46.120 --> 02:44:48.760
tool that defines sentences to find the sentence. Structure

02:44:48.760 --> 02:44:53.000
semantics. Sometimes, you must define it for you which is

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:59.020
our sentence. So, what do mean? What? For example, how did

02:44:59.020 --> 02:45:03.920
you do this? Please tell me what you are doing? See here. We

02:45:03.920 --> 02:45:06.540
have a book ofidade for example. For example, 9th book. Now

02:45:06.540 --> 02:45:12.180
we want to ask GPT about 9th book.

02:45:15.320 --> 02:45:20.920
Now we have to make its body first. Now we will not give it

02:45:20.920 --> 02:45:23.960
full data at once. Because it will not have this much

02:45:23.960 --> 02:45:28.680
length. For example, its length is 32k.

02:45:30.540 --> 02:45:36.540
Now we will either make a chunk of 32k or we will use a

02:45:36.540 --> 02:45:38.860
technique that it will understand that I will take this much

02:45:38.860 --> 02:45:42.460
chunk. This is a type of data. I will take this much chunk

02:45:42.460 --> 02:45:46.960
myself and I will make embedding from this chunk. After

02:45:46.960 --> 02:45:51.440
embedding, how will it understand this data? Your simple

02:45:51.440 --> 02:45:54.000
question was that I have 9th book or I have any book

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.060
available. And we have to ask the question from that 9th

02:45:56.060 --> 02:45:58.660
book and the answer should come from that book. That is your

02:45:58.660 --> 02:46:01.100
simple question. This is your problem statement, right? Yes,

02:46:01.160 --> 02:46:06.100
sir. This is your problem statement, right? Okay. Now we

02:46:06.100 --> 02:46:09.240
will give you the code. It is already available to us. We

02:46:09.240 --> 02:46:11.440
have already studied it. We will tell you the process of

02:46:11.440 --> 02:46:17.200
this. I have this 9th book. Can you see my screen? Now I

02:46:17.200 --> 02:46:19.980
have multiple chapters in this book. It means that there are

02:46:19.980 --> 02:46:23.840
multiple pages and I have data available in each page. What

02:46:23.840 --> 02:46:26.780
we do is that we write Python code here. Okay. We will read

02:46:26.780 --> 02:46:29.800
this entire book page by page, page by page, page by page

02:46:29.800 --> 02:46:32.760
here. Okay. Page by page. Raw data. Simple. We will read the

02:46:32.760 --> 02:46:36.200
raw data that is available. Whether it is a PDF, a Word

02:46:36.200 --> 02:46:38.780
document or a text document. We will read from there. Now as

02:46:38.780 --> 02:46:42.380
soon as we read this data here. So let's suppose that we

02:46:42.380 --> 02:46:46.620
want one paragraph here to be one sentence. That is, we

02:46:46.620 --> 02:46:48.740
convert it as an embedding. Or we make an embedding of a

02:46:48.740 --> 02:46:53.640
whole page of length may be 1536 or may be 1028. Whatever it

02:46:53.640 --> 02:46:57.580
is. Right. So we made an embedding of 1536 here. So this

02:46:57.580 --> 02:47:00.260
will be made. Okay. By reading one by one. Now we will store

02:47:00.260 --> 02:47:03.760
all this embedding in our database. Only then will the

02:47:03.760 --> 02:47:07.080
database be useful. We will store it in the database. Okay.

02:47:07.080 --> 02:47:11.480
In the database. So this is your process. You have done this

02:47:11.480 --> 02:47:13.980
whole process to the book. Okay. Your entire book has been

02:47:13.980 --> 02:47:17.440
processed. Now when you will ask a question. Okay. You will

02:47:17.440 --> 02:47:22.840
ask a query. Okay. Explain me like a Newton's principle. Or

02:47:22.840 --> 02:47:25.240
explain me the Archimedes principle. Basically or may be a

02:47:25.240 --> 02:47:28.820
Newton's rule from this particular book. So what will it do?

02:47:29.200 --> 02:47:34.160
Already all my books are converted in embeddings. Okay. All

02:47:34.160 --> 02:47:37.040
my books are converted in embeddings. So whenever you will

02:47:37.040 --> 02:47:41.920
ask a query from here. So it will search that what is the

02:47:41.920 --> 02:47:45.100
nearest embedding related to your query. That is, what is

02:47:45.100 --> 02:47:49.820
the paragraph or what is the page that you have stored that

02:47:49.820 --> 02:47:53.180
matches this query. For example, you have asked tell me

02:47:53.180 --> 02:47:55.960
about Newton's principle. So what is the paragraph in which

02:47:55.960 --> 02:47:58.580
Newton's principle is mentioned. Or you have said tell me

02:47:58.580 --> 02:48:01.980
about Newton's first principle or first rule. Okay. So it

02:48:01.980 --> 02:48:05.960
will see that okay. What is the embedding in which the first

02:48:05.960 --> 02:48:08.520
rule is mentioned and it will give you the return. So this

02:48:08.520 --> 02:48:11.500
is how you will solve the problem. Now coming to the next

02:48:11.500 --> 02:48:15.680
step. So already we have done this project many times in our

02:48:15.680 --> 02:48:18.520
class. So you can also get the code without waiting right

02:48:18.520 --> 02:48:22.120
now. So let me show you that. Did you understand this? Is

02:48:22.120 --> 02:48:22.800
there any confusion in this?

02:48:25.820 --> 02:48:28.620
No, sir. I understood. That is, it can also pick up more

02:48:28.620 --> 02:48:31.980
than one embedding. That is, two embeddings, three

02:48:31.980 --> 02:48:35.740
embeddings. Tomorrow we will teach you. Tomorrow we will

02:48:35.740 --> 02:48:41.300
teach you another thing. When we introduce vector db, then a

02:48:41.300 --> 02:48:45.340
parameter k comes in it. We call it top k. Okay. We call it

02:48:45.340 --> 02:48:48.140
top k. So let's suppose that if we put top k is equal to 3.

02:48:48.440 --> 02:48:55.180
So what will it do? It will return you top 3. Because as we

02:48:55.180 --> 02:48:59.960
told you in today's class, for example, we come to today's

02:48:59.960 --> 02:49:04.820
example, which we have already proved. Okay. Now here we did

02:49:04.820 --> 02:49:08.500
the comparison with how much? With 4. Right. With 4. Now

02:49:08.500 --> 02:49:10.840
which was the top? It was this one. So you said that this

02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:12.520
will be the answer. Let's suppose that we will say no. Give

02:49:12.520 --> 02:49:15.220
me the top 3. Which sentence will you give me? Give me the

02:49:15.220 --> 02:49:18.820
top 3 sentences that match my query. So which one will you

02:49:18.820 --> 02:49:20.680
give? This will be the first matching. This will be the

02:49:20.680 --> 02:49:21.940
second matching. This will be the third matching. And what

02:49:21.940 --> 02:49:23.180
will be the third top? This will be the third matching.

02:49:23.180 --> 02:49:27.870
Right. If we tell you, according to today's class

02:49:27.870 --> 02:49:31.510
discussion. Then it will generate its language. Exactly.

02:49:31.510 --> 02:49:34.710
Then it will generate the answer. No, it is not generating

02:49:34.710 --> 02:49:38.710
anything. It is the same thing. You do this technically. I

02:49:38.710 --> 02:49:41.050
mean, if you see it by calculation, then it is exactly the

02:49:41.050 --> 02:49:43.630
same calculation. Nothing is happening differently. When you

02:49:43.630 --> 02:49:47.530
say top k in it, then what will it do? You give this. Give

02:49:47.530 --> 02:49:49.570
this. Top first. This happened. This happened in the second

02:49:49.570 --> 02:49:50.750
rank. This happened in the third rank.

02:49:53.850 --> 02:49:55.250
Right. So, this is the first ranking. Now this will be the

02:49:55.250 --> 02:49:57.770
third. This will go to the language model and it will

02:49:57.770 --> 02:49:59.450
generate our answer. Why will it go to the language model?

02:49:59.970 --> 02:50:02.090
No, we won't go to the language model. Where the language

02:50:02.090 --> 02:50:05.610
model is going? See, this is my vector that was stored in

02:50:05.610 --> 02:50:08.030
the database. This is my vector, which we are matching this

02:50:08.030 --> 02:50:10.270
over here. Where is it matching? This is matching through

02:50:10.270 --> 02:50:13.410
vector. There is no need to go to the language model here.

02:50:14.710 --> 02:50:16.270
In the language model, we will send in the language model.

02:50:16.270 --> 02:50:19.730
No, from here it will come out. From here when it will come

02:50:19.730 --> 02:50:23.270
out, then we send in the language model. Not for generation.

02:50:23.370 --> 02:50:26.650
For formatting. let's suppose that there is a broken

02:50:26.650 --> 02:50:31.270
embedding sentence because when you were converting to

02:50:31.270 --> 02:50:35.170
embedding then it is possible that there will be a break in

02:50:35.170 --> 02:50:36.930
a sentence and after that your sentence will be cut you

02:50:36.930 --> 02:50:41.470
would have sent a sentence of 100 so when it will come back

02:50:41.470 --> 02:50:43.670
with embedding then the meaning of the sentence will remain

02:50:43.670 --> 02:50:45.730
the same which you have stored and it is possible that it is

02:50:45.730 --> 02:50:49.410
incomplete not human readable so what we do is whatever the

02:50:49.410 --> 02:50:51.770
output is let's say the top one came here now what we will

02:50:51.770 --> 02:50:56.410
do is we will send it to LLM we will send it to LLM and what

02:50:56.410 --> 02:50:59.650
will LLM do? it will format it and give it to us which will

02:50:59.650 --> 02:51:04.310
be more human readable and we call this concept R.A.G

02:51:06.310 --> 02:51:12.430
retrieval augmented generation means it will modify this and

02:51:12.430 --> 02:51:16.370
make it good and paste it to us exactly whatever the output

02:51:16.370 --> 02:51:19.230
is what is the output? you said top one right so the output

02:51:19.230 --> 02:51:22.130
by default whatever it will give you it will give you the

02:51:22.130 --> 02:51:27.470
top one now we will send it to LLM and we will send it to

02:51:27.470 --> 02:51:30.550
LLM and we will say rephrase it ok so what it will do it

02:51:30.550 --> 02:51:33.770
will make a better sentence so that human wise I will like

02:51:33.770 --> 02:51:36.690
to read it and I will like the complete sentence even though

02:51:36.690 --> 02:51:41.550
we have already got broken ok so here LLM comes and that is

02:51:41.550 --> 02:51:47.410
and because it already knows embeddings that what is the

02:51:47.410 --> 02:51:50.190
embedding of this sentence LLM already knows it already

02:51:50.190 --> 02:51:53.190
knows you are not just storing embeddings tomorrow we will

02:51:53.190 --> 02:51:56.830
show you that you also store this and against this you also

02:51:56.830 --> 02:51:58.950
store the embedding of this sentence means you also store

02:51:58.950 --> 02:52:03.750
this this too ok so if you are taking out this embedding

02:52:03.750 --> 02:52:05.910
then I know that this embedding belongs to this I already

02:52:05.910 --> 02:52:09.410
know ok because the data was mine we only stored it so I

02:52:09.410 --> 02:52:11.710
already know that this embedding belongs to this sentence

02:52:12.140 --> 02:52:14.010
the second one belongs to this the third one belongs to this

02:52:14.010 --> 02:52:18.670
so that I already know exactly ok so if you want to read it

02:52:18.670 --> 02:52:22.250
quickly then you do one thing we have recorded it very well

02:52:22.250 --> 02:52:25.550
we have done the whole project you can do it today only we

02:52:25.550 --> 02:52:30.790
will show you ok now that one first of all we have discussed

02:52:30.790 --> 02:52:33.450
it in live also many times and second we have just released

02:52:33.450 --> 02:52:37.570
a fresh of RAG after mastering RAG in self-paced this badge

02:52:37.570 --> 02:52:41.010
has been completed this was not a badge this was a recording

02:52:41.010 --> 02:52:44.750
basically ok so if you come here in the project so medi

02:52:44.750 --> 02:52:47.970
chatbot pro so what we are doing here in medi that we are

02:52:47.970 --> 02:52:50.690
taking the pdf record of 5-6 patients means the medical

02:52:50.690 --> 02:52:54.190
history we are taking it here of 5-6 patients and basically

02:52:54.190 --> 02:52:58.190
we are putting it in the vector database and its theme is of

02:52:58.190 --> 02:53:00.910
medi chatbot pro that you let's suppose that you are a

02:53:00.910 --> 02:53:04.730
doctor ok and you have lakhs of patients so obviously you

02:53:04.730 --> 02:53:07.250
will search everyone in the database from his name from this

02:53:07.250 --> 02:53:11.130
to that what is better that you have a bot type who knows

02:53:11.130 --> 02:53:14.610
everything ok you say that xyg patient is tell details about

02:53:14.610 --> 02:53:18.250
him tell some summary of him or what was his disease what

02:53:18.250 --> 02:53:21.330
was his past history he is telling everything himself so

02:53:21.330 --> 02:53:26.930
this one ok and then this is also curl website and this is

02:53:26.930 --> 02:53:31.710
csv rag master yes so rag master apart from this there are

02:53:31.710 --> 02:53:34.870
many more batches means you will get a lot of projects for

02:53:34.870 --> 02:53:39.470
this means a lot of variety we have shown you only one

02:53:39.470 --> 02:53:42.810
already available so you can do it today if you don't want

02:53:42.810 --> 02:53:47.070
to wait for your batch if you see my syllabus in your batch

02:53:47.070 --> 02:53:51.630
we have put rag so you can do it here you will come here

02:53:51.630 --> 02:53:57.250
langchain langgraph crew after that here fine tuning rag is

02:53:57.250 --> 02:54:01.790
available can you see so connecting embedding with the

02:54:01.790 --> 02:54:06.850
vector database sample so if you want to do it now then do

02:54:06.850 --> 02:54:09.890
it now otherwise wait for your lecture ok

02:54:11.880 --> 02:54:15.980
question please in our lecture everything is there yes means

02:54:15.980 --> 02:54:20.340
many people are coming so that is also option quick or then

02:54:20.340 --> 02:54:26.200
normal ok pushpa please go ahead with your question yeah

02:54:26.200 --> 02:54:31.300
good morning sir I do not have a question related to today's

02:54:31.300 --> 02:54:37.420
class but this is related to the ML modeling which I am

02:54:37.420 --> 02:54:42.560
doing for time series forecasting ok using ARIMA and SARIMA

02:54:42.560 --> 02:54:48.020
but the data is huge and I have to create multiple models

02:54:48.560 --> 02:54:54.440
per like items and all so it has to create multiple models

02:54:54.440 --> 02:54:59.380
but it is taking lot of time to complete entire come up with

02:54:59.380 --> 02:55:02.460
entire model run that on GPU ma'am then run that on GPU it

02:55:02.460 --> 02:55:08.240
will optimize the time if ok go ahead with go ahead with

02:55:08.240 --> 02:55:12.660
H100 kind of a GPU H100 A1 and it is not that costly like it

02:55:12.660 --> 02:55:15.720
will cost you like 2 dollar 3 dollar rupees for 1 hour 2

02:55:15.720 --> 02:55:19.080
hour actually that I am I am doing it for some of the

02:55:19.080 --> 02:55:23.100
company but that GPU availability is not there in the local

02:55:23.100 --> 02:55:27.160
system what they have provided in local in local ma'am it

02:55:27.160 --> 02:55:30.000
will not be available obviously you can't expect a GPU like

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:34.000
heavy GPU like 24 GB 48 GB is fine but you can't expect like

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:37.060
a 80 GB GPU or H100 A1 in local it will always be available

02:55:37.060 --> 02:55:39.980
on a cloud platform so you can just go ahead with the GPU

02:55:40.300 --> 02:55:43.220
and launch the notebook over there within 2 minute you will

02:55:43.220 --> 02:55:47.000
be able to launch it and run it over there if it is taking

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:50.780
lot of time in training it will be reduced immediately ok

02:55:50.780 --> 02:55:56.120
one more doubt I have is like can I like train the models

02:55:56.120 --> 02:56:01.940
like like providing the inputs in chunks like for 1 year for

02:56:01.940 --> 02:56:06.000
next 2 year can I retrain the same model and it has to

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:09.940
consider the previous whatever it has trained is it possible

02:56:09.940 --> 02:56:13.160
that is called as fine tuning ma'am that is possible it is

02:56:13.160 --> 02:56:17.930
called as technically fine tuning ok you mean to say like

02:56:17.930 --> 02:56:22.010
for example I am using one arima model and I am giving the

02:56:22.850 --> 02:56:27.870
training it to for 1 year data then I want the same model to

02:56:27.870 --> 02:56:33.950
be trained on next year data so will that overrate the

02:56:33.950 --> 02:56:37.870
previous trained whatever it has got trained see I will tell

02:56:37.870 --> 02:56:40.050
you the fundamentals of model see what is the meaning of

02:56:40.050 --> 02:56:42.450
fundamentals of model fundamentals of model means the

02:56:42.450 --> 02:56:45.610
weights right let's suppose I am talking about Y is equal to

02:56:47.030 --> 02:56:52.150
MX plus C basically arima arima and sarima is technically an

02:56:52.150 --> 02:56:54.950
extension of linear model itself right linear model itself

02:56:54.950 --> 02:57:00.050
with like some sort of like you can say like lag lag of the

02:57:00.050 --> 02:57:02.190
data or maybe some sort of interval of the data but

02:57:02.190 --> 02:57:05.430
technically it is a linear model now what is the meaning of

02:57:05.430 --> 02:57:08.230
any models so there will be a relationship who is going to

02:57:08.230 --> 02:57:11.150
define the relationship are parameters right for example in

02:57:11.150 --> 02:57:15.110
Y is equal to MX plus C so M and C is the parameter yes M

02:57:15.110 --> 02:57:17.450
and C is the parameter similar parameter you will be able to

02:57:17.450 --> 02:57:20.710
find out in every model doesn't matter some machine learning

02:57:20.710 --> 02:57:24.050
or deep learning so when you are saying that I have an

02:57:24.050 --> 02:57:27.150
existing model it simply means that there is a fixed value

02:57:27.150 --> 02:57:31.450
of M and C that you are able to reach out correct then only

02:57:31.450 --> 02:57:34.050
you say that I have trained the model right means you are

02:57:34.050 --> 02:57:37.030
able to reach out to some relation right some relation so

02:57:37.030 --> 02:57:39.950
some relation between your X and Y with the help of correct

02:57:39.950 --> 02:57:43.750
these parameters now you are saying that you have a new data

02:57:43.750 --> 02:57:48.190
right and you yes try to extend a same model on that data

02:57:48.670 --> 02:57:52.490
right correct now what should be the approach extract the

02:57:52.490 --> 02:57:55.570
previous weight this value of M and C which you can print

02:57:55.570 --> 02:57:58.330
right if you have a model if you have trained the model so

02:57:58.330 --> 02:58:00.050
you will be able to extract the value of the parameter

02:58:00.050 --> 02:58:03.970
trainable parameter right yes now set that trainable

02:58:03.970 --> 02:58:04.250
parameter

02:58:07.390 --> 02:58:10.330
ok which is called as parameter initialization or in case of

02:58:10.330 --> 02:58:13.450
a deep learning we say weight initialization so there is a

02:58:13.450 --> 02:58:17.370
concept where we can start a weight from a random right

02:58:17.370 --> 02:58:19.190
let's suppose I don't have any idea so obviously I will

02:58:19.190 --> 02:58:21.590
start from the random and there is something called as we

02:58:21.590 --> 02:58:23.650
can start a weight initialization from a particular

02:58:23.650 --> 02:58:26.530
parameter because at that it is a matrix right so I can

02:58:26.530 --> 02:58:30.870
initialize it ok yeah so initializing this time initializing

02:58:30.870 --> 02:58:33.850
means what you are trying to reference take a reference from

02:58:33.850 --> 02:58:35.350
the previous model which you have already built so

02:58:35.350 --> 02:58:38.490
technically it is possible and that is called as fine tuning

02:58:39.170 --> 02:58:45.490
ok ok thanks ok so next question raise please go ahead with

02:58:45.490 --> 02:58:52.070
your question then yeah yeah hi Sudhanshu yeah thank you for

02:58:52.070 --> 02:58:57.730
the lecture it was so good I have a basic question like see

02:58:57.730 --> 02:59:01.290
we have seen lot of embedding models are available in

02:59:01.290 --> 02:59:05.550
hugging face right and you are also mentioned openai is also

02:59:05.550 --> 02:59:11.110
giving some models text small 002ada something hmm hmm right

02:59:11.110 --> 02:59:16.510
so basically on what basis I should select a embedding model

02:59:16.510 --> 02:59:19.850
based on the benchmark basically so let's suppose if I am

02:59:19.850 --> 02:59:23.670
trying to like use jpt versus a quen right let's suppose I

02:59:23.670 --> 02:59:27.670
was using quen now if you will see the benchmark jpt versus

02:59:27.670 --> 02:59:31.430
quen is the benchmarking obviously jpt model is been trained

02:59:31.430 --> 02:59:35.070
on more amount of the data for more epoch accuracy is very

02:59:35.070 --> 02:59:37.630
very high so technically I will go ahead with the jpt model

02:59:37.630 --> 02:59:41.270
not with the quen so basically you are claiming that it is

02:59:41.270 --> 02:59:45.270
not based on dimension size because no not based on

02:59:45.270 --> 02:59:48.170
dimension size not at all not at all so see there could be a

02:59:48.170 --> 02:59:51.290
model see dimension means what dimension means my network

02:59:51.290 --> 02:59:53.830
architecture in my network architecture if I have defined

02:59:53.830 --> 02:59:57.930
that my outer layer output layer is going to be 10 not 10 is

02:59:57.930 --> 03:00:01.030
dimension if you have defined that output layer is going to

03:00:01.030 --> 03:00:04.330
be 1000 then 1000 is dimension but that doesn't mean that

03:00:04.330 --> 03:00:08.570
that those 10 or 1000 right those 10 or 1000 will be better

03:00:08.570 --> 03:00:11.330
or worse as compared to each other because that depends upon

03:00:11.330 --> 03:00:13.810
what that depends upon the middle layer right the weights

03:00:13.810 --> 03:00:17.190
that you have in between the hidden layers yeah understood

03:00:17.190 --> 03:00:20.310
so output layer I can define 10 I can define 1000 I can

03:00:20.310 --> 03:00:26.870
define even 10000 but that doesn't mean that I can define

03:00:26.870 --> 03:00:30.510
anything got it and next question Sudhanshu regarding

03:00:32.530 --> 03:00:36.630
regarding so once we converting into embeddings we are

03:00:36.630 --> 03:00:40.030
storing into DB basically so you mentioned different

03:00:40.030 --> 03:00:44.750
databases like chromaDB fiasis several DBs are available in

03:00:44.750 --> 03:00:50.290
the market so now when coming to retrieval part so user

03:00:50.290 --> 03:00:55.130
query will be converting into embedding first correct then

03:00:55.130 --> 03:00:57.890
user query will be yes user query will be converting into

03:00:57.890 --> 03:01:02.390
embedding first yes then it will find the similarity search

03:01:02.390 --> 03:01:06.010
and it will get whatever top you mentioned 3 or 5 or 10

03:01:06.010 --> 03:01:11.990
whatever you mentioned it will get so so it will perform you

03:01:11.990 --> 03:01:16.050
know this calculation with every vector present in the

03:01:16.050 --> 03:01:19.350
database exactly yeah so as of now it is going to perform

03:01:19.350 --> 03:01:21.850
this calculation with every vector available into a

03:01:21.850 --> 03:01:25.790
databases there is an optimization so where i can go ahead

03:01:25.790 --> 03:01:28.590
with more indexing more hashing which is called as hybrid

03:01:28.590 --> 03:01:32.290
approach so which will at least try to reduce a search by

03:01:32.290 --> 03:01:36.250
certain volume but ideally speaking it is going to do a

03:01:36.250 --> 03:01:40.990
calculation with all okay so in that case why do i need i

03:01:40.990 --> 03:01:44.330
why do i need to use a quadrant or external database because

03:01:44.330 --> 03:01:48.030
i can store my data into text i retrieve and i do the same

03:01:48.030 --> 03:01:52.230
same calculations and i can make it is it possible exactly

03:01:52.230 --> 03:01:55.770
this is what facebook as similarity search is going to do or

03:01:55.770 --> 03:01:57.830
even let's suppose you are not using a facebook similarity

03:01:57.830 --> 03:02:00.350
search right so today we were able to find out the

03:02:00.350 --> 03:02:05.510
similarity yeah so i don't need a database correct see even

03:02:05.510 --> 03:02:07.830
today i was able to find the similarity right and have i

03:02:07.830 --> 03:02:10.670
used any kind of a database no it was a principle python

03:02:10.670 --> 03:02:13.690
code right but yeah in case of a databases in case of that

03:02:13.690 --> 03:02:17.710
packages they have optimized it little bit okay they have

03:02:17.710 --> 03:02:19.870
optimized it for example if i talk about quadrant right so

03:02:19.870 --> 03:02:22.950
they are giving you a self-hosted service let's me and you

03:02:22.950 --> 03:02:24.890
are talking about these embeddings and all those things

03:02:24.890 --> 03:02:27.110
right but let's suppose there is a guy who is not aware

03:02:27.110 --> 03:02:32.390
about anything he just need a database okay for example my

03:02:32.390 --> 03:02:34.910
team right my development team so they they don't understand

03:02:34.910 --> 03:02:38.690
ai actually right we were building a job system now in job

03:02:38.690 --> 03:02:41.330
system so we were trying to scrap a 50 000 job on a daily

03:02:41.330 --> 03:02:44.390
basis and from other side so user is going to ask for

03:02:44.390 --> 03:02:46.690
example you are the user so you will go and ask machine

03:02:46.690 --> 03:02:48.890
learning data science and then you will try to put some

03:02:48.890 --> 03:02:51.830
condition part-time full-time and then maybe you will try to

03:02:51.830 --> 03:02:54.490
put some information as a country or something right so i

03:02:54.490 --> 03:02:58.250
have 50 000 jobs and then there is a query that you are

03:02:58.250 --> 03:03:02.830
sending right for my jobs now my team was not aware about

03:03:02.830 --> 03:03:05.550
all this similarity search and all these embeddings and

03:03:05.550 --> 03:03:09.090
vector right they just understand that i need a db where

03:03:09.090 --> 03:03:11.930
i'll bring i'll scrap all the job i'll keep it inside the db

03:03:11.930 --> 03:03:15.290
this isn't this on that part right and from a user side so

03:03:15.290 --> 03:03:17.630
user will send a query so i'll try to search and i'll try to

03:03:17.630 --> 03:03:19.150
give you the results so they were looking for a best

03:03:19.150 --> 03:03:22.430
possible db so which can do a better mission matching based

03:03:22.430 --> 03:03:26.250
on the context understood they have used a vector db so

03:03:26.250 --> 03:03:28.790
that's the reason these databases are available the services

03:03:28.790 --> 03:03:30.910
because at the end of the day it's a piece of code which is

03:03:30.910 --> 03:03:33.710
running in a back-end right whether you are going to use it

03:03:33.710 --> 03:03:37.410
on a cloud or maybe in a local installation so for those

03:03:37.410 --> 03:03:40.310
kind of people these things are required people like me and

03:03:40.310 --> 03:03:43.090
you if you don't want to use any databases i'm like it's

03:03:43.090 --> 03:03:47.350
fine we have not used it today itself and one more question

03:03:47.350 --> 03:03:51.230
is on so how do you handle duplicate values in this case

03:03:51.750 --> 03:03:55.390
does it follow indexes like traditional databases users no

03:03:55.390 --> 03:03:59.110
not at all not at all so how do you how do you if i if i

03:03:59.110 --> 03:04:03.350
same document i upload it two times so how do i you know how

03:04:03.350 --> 03:04:05.810
do i handle these duplicates in that case so based on the

03:04:05.810 --> 03:04:08.550
similarity such again so based on the mapping whether this

03:04:08.550 --> 03:04:11.910
is available or not so if it is coming as 100 percent right

03:04:11.910 --> 03:04:14.430
100 for most of the record it simply means that those

03:04:14.430 --> 03:04:16.430
records are already available those contexts are already

03:04:16.430 --> 03:04:20.050
available inside your db okay so either i should ignore that

03:04:20.050 --> 03:04:22.850
or i should delete and insert the first exactly so you can

03:04:22.850 --> 03:04:25.010
then you can write a condition if condition that okay fine

03:04:25.010 --> 03:04:27.830
so if similarity is going to be absolute one in that case

03:04:27.830 --> 03:04:33.690
remove it okay fine and last question regarding the avni i

03:04:33.690 --> 03:04:38.230
have given interview in avni last week okay so it is not a

03:04:38.230 --> 03:04:40.950
question basically i want to give the feedback regarding the

03:04:40.950 --> 03:04:46.690
system uh so uh and i i guess in fourth a fourth round of

03:04:46.690 --> 03:04:49.430
interview i don't know what is the reason suddenly it got

03:04:49.430 --> 03:04:51.890
stuck because it gets stuck because it gets stuck i don't

03:04:51.890 --> 03:04:51.890
know because i don't know what to do so the third one is the

03:04:51.890 --> 03:04:52.210
ability to your system is able to answer whatever i'm

03:04:52.210 --> 03:04:55.370
speaking it is not able to you know answer me back okay

03:04:55.370 --> 03:04:58.330
there's multiple possibility one is your system internet

03:04:58.330 --> 03:05:00.570
another one is your like a processing speed because

03:05:00.570 --> 03:05:03.490
everything is processing in a client side so technically on

03:05:03.490 --> 03:05:07.490
your system side uh third possibility could be a problem

03:05:07.490 --> 03:05:11.270
with uh api interfacing with avni but again that depends

03:05:11.270 --> 03:05:13.650
upon the internet because a real-time conversation so we are

03:05:13.650 --> 03:05:16.470
sending a packet back to back to our system so where we are

03:05:16.470 --> 03:05:20.810
doing a inferencing right so if there is a packet loss then

03:05:20.810 --> 03:05:24.330
avni will not be able to understand so it requires a good

03:05:24.330 --> 03:05:27.670
internet we are trying to optimize it more and more right so

03:05:27.670 --> 03:05:30.010
that it will be able to work even with the very less

03:05:30.010 --> 03:05:32.650
internet or even it will be able to handle some packet

03:05:32.650 --> 03:05:37.030
losses in between uh but yeah so that could be a possible

03:05:37.030 --> 03:05:40.790
reason for that yeah i understood that so in that case when

03:05:40.790 --> 03:05:44.250
i do uh end end interview right at least you should evaluate

03:05:44.250 --> 03:05:48.090
till that time what is happened and should show me the score

03:05:48.090 --> 03:05:51.990
right but when i do end end session because system is not

03:05:51.990 --> 03:05:56.350
responding so it it directly deleted uh one interview from

03:05:56.350 --> 03:06:00.410
from my account and it is not showing me any result so

03:06:00.410 --> 03:06:02.930
actually i have asked my team to you know show a result

03:06:02.930 --> 03:06:04.370
around you know show a result around around because i have

03:06:04.370 --> 03:06:06.930
received this problem because anyone is reading over the

03:06:06.930 --> 03:06:10.270
internet might have the problem they may face the problem so

03:06:10.270 --> 03:06:13.390
round by round that okay fine so store basically take one

03:06:13.390 --> 03:06:16.230
down do the check pointing then again take one another round

03:06:16.230 --> 03:06:19.050
do a check pointing so based on round or maybe based on the

03:06:19.050 --> 03:06:22.710
time so every five minute do the check pointing and one more

03:06:22.710 --> 03:06:27.690
yeah and one more suggestion so when avani is asking the

03:06:27.690 --> 03:06:31.050
question i can able to open another tabs and see so is it

03:06:31.050 --> 03:06:34.130
possible to disable those options yeah i mean like it's a

03:06:34.130 --> 03:06:37.850
practice one right so we are like uh even building

03:06:37.850 --> 03:06:40.830
internally and we are planning to uh release something for

03:06:40.830 --> 03:06:44.670
the companies uh this same product so that company will be

03:06:44.670 --> 03:06:46.890
able to use this system and many companies are already using

03:06:46.890 --> 03:06:51.690
it so even i have this yeah so my student i many students

03:06:51.690 --> 03:06:54.950
they have given an interview in recent days and no none of

03:06:54.950 --> 03:06:57.070
the human being has taken their interview how many kind of a

03:06:57.070 --> 03:07:00.010
system has taken their interview so we are also trying to

03:07:00.010 --> 03:07:02.630
like a commercialize it so that we can earn some sort of a

03:07:02.630 --> 03:07:03.370
salary so that we can earn some sort of a revenue out of it

03:07:03.370 --> 03:07:06.610
uh in that one we'll give all those options all those

03:07:06.610 --> 03:07:09.230
security features like uh you can't share the screen it will

03:07:09.230 --> 03:07:13.630
be completely proctored by the way okay and last suggestion

03:07:13.630 --> 03:07:17.050
would be if i want to skip any round i think that option

03:07:17.050 --> 03:07:20.790
should be there because if i uh if i am doing a let's say i

03:07:20.790 --> 03:07:23.670
am not interested in dsa round because i didn't prepare it

03:07:23.670 --> 03:07:26.970
so basically when i am using first time no i don't know uh

03:07:26.970 --> 03:07:30.390
these many rounds will be there i had a 10 20 minutes of

03:07:30.390 --> 03:07:35.130
free time i don't have an option to skip this round yeah

03:07:35.130 --> 03:07:37.890
intentionally we have not given that that is fine that can

03:07:37.890 --> 03:07:41.170
be done easily from our side not a big feature at all but

03:07:41.170 --> 03:07:43.610
initially we have not given that so that see you are going

03:07:43.610 --> 03:07:45.810
to a mock-up right so when you are going through a mock-up

03:07:45.810 --> 03:07:50.230
our intention is was to create a system which will force you

03:07:50.230 --> 03:07:54.390
to see everything at least so put put these things in your

03:07:54.390 --> 03:07:59.170
mind that no this is required many times when we give you a

03:07:59.170 --> 03:08:01.990
feature right that no you can skip this round this round

03:08:01.990 --> 03:08:04.210
this round maybe you will not even look into that and you

03:08:04.210 --> 03:08:07.090
will click on the button now when you are going through some

03:08:07.090 --> 03:08:10.350
friction so at least you will see a question because you

03:08:10.350 --> 03:08:13.370
will be able to go to the next round how by by saying that

03:08:13.370 --> 03:08:15.510
okay go to the next go to the next go to the next if you can

03:08:15.510 --> 03:08:18.210
say these things to avani so avani will keep on going to the

03:08:18.210 --> 03:08:21.230
next next next question and we'll finish the round right but

03:08:21.230 --> 03:08:24.830
in that process uh you go through all those questions you at

03:08:24.830 --> 03:08:28.550
least see those questions for five seconds right and we have

03:08:28.550 --> 03:08:31.290
created this one for a mock-up not for taking a real-time

03:08:31.290 --> 03:08:35.690
companies interview but not in a real situation for a mock

03:08:35.690 --> 03:08:40.730
-up so i wanted to force my student that okay see everything

03:08:40.730 --> 03:08:44.370
doesn't matter whether you are able to answer it or you are

03:08:44.370 --> 03:08:47.170
not able to answer it that's okay but see everything at

03:08:47.170 --> 03:08:50.110
least somewhere it will be in your mind and when it will be

03:08:50.110 --> 03:08:52.730
in your mind you will go through it before going for the

03:08:52.730 --> 03:08:56.390
interview or maybe while doing a preparation yeah i got it

03:08:56.390 --> 03:08:58.770
got it so thank you so much yeah rest of the things so like

03:08:58.770 --> 03:09:02.310
uh i i'm like i have already asked my team to do the

03:09:02.310 --> 03:09:05.050
implementation so i think uh couple of more features they

03:09:05.050 --> 03:09:08.830
will release uh for avani in uh like some days yeah thank

03:09:08.830 --> 03:09:11.470
you so much thank you yeah thanks thanks take care okay uh

03:09:11.470 --> 03:09:16.230
next one arman go ahead then avinash go ahead anyone can go

03:09:16.230 --> 03:09:20.510
ahead yeah good afternoon sir yes yeah so my first question

03:09:20.510 --> 03:09:24.850
is that you showed the embedding regarding to tests so this

03:09:24.850 --> 03:09:28.030
can be done with images too this can be done to our images

03:09:28.030 --> 03:09:32.110
too yes this was similar kind of pattern will follow because

03:09:32.110 --> 03:09:35.450
because images are a numpy array by the way in terms of a

03:09:35.450 --> 03:09:38.190
system right it's just a matrix images are nothing but it's

03:09:38.190 --> 03:09:43.950
a matrices but you can do this kind of embeddings with

03:09:43.950 --> 03:09:46.890
respect to the images and then you can try to find a

03:09:46.890 --> 03:09:52.650
similarity search but it will be like a not a good approach

03:09:52.650 --> 03:09:56.590
so for image we have already like multiple different

03:09:56.590 --> 03:10:00.730
different approaches to do a similarity search okay so so my

03:10:00.730 --> 03:10:05.190
next question is as you said we will store each and every

03:10:05.190 --> 03:10:09.670
text into embeddings into our database so in storing the

03:10:09.670 --> 03:10:12.510
database it will not perform any kind of operations like

03:10:12.510 --> 03:10:17.570
similarity or something when we put the user query yeah so

03:10:17.570 --> 03:10:19.930
similarity will be done when you write a query right then

03:10:19.930 --> 03:10:22.050
you will try to go ahead with the matching when you are

03:10:22.050 --> 03:10:24.250
trying to store it then it will just convert into embedding

03:10:24.250 --> 03:10:34.290
store the data simple okay answer by any chance so in any of

03:10:34.290 --> 03:10:38.250
the uh forces or project we are creating the system like

03:10:38.250 --> 03:10:42.010
that maybe a part of it not the whole system sorry sorry

03:10:42.010 --> 03:10:46.370
sorry can you please repeat once again as you told about

03:10:46.370 --> 03:10:49.710
ovni in the previous question so is there any course or

03:10:49.710 --> 03:10:52.310
something in your own present that we are creating system

03:10:52.310 --> 03:10:56.270
like avni by ourselves uh in your this particular courses i

03:10:56.270 --> 03:11:00.350
have mentioned yuri see uh uh and that too like uh you know

03:11:00.350 --> 03:11:03.050
after having a lot of discussion with my team and everyone i

03:11:03.050 --> 03:11:07.030
was able to mention uri system at least in this one uh

03:11:07.030 --> 03:11:10.430
because it's not difficult for us to deliver especially for

03:11:10.430 --> 03:11:12.830
me it's not difficult to deliver the project i can come i

03:11:12.830 --> 03:11:16.410
can like deliver this project but i have seen that that

03:11:16.410 --> 03:11:19.630
expectation of the students are to you know write a code

03:11:19.630 --> 03:11:23.410
line by line now for project like ovani project like uri

03:11:23.410 --> 03:11:26.790
where we have like a one lakh 1.5 lakh two lakh line of a

03:11:26.790 --> 03:11:33.250
code a thousands of module it is not possible right even it

03:11:33.250 --> 03:11:35.610
took like a month and month of time not just one or two

03:11:35.610 --> 03:11:38.170
months it took a multiple month of time multiple team member

03:11:38.170 --> 03:11:41.210
to create that project and generally when we come to the

03:11:41.210 --> 03:11:44.390
class right so that is the expectation and with that

03:11:44.390 --> 03:11:47.230
expectation obviously can't discuss those kind of project

03:11:47.230 --> 03:11:50.910
but yeah don't worry i have already included yuri so yuri

03:11:50.910 --> 03:11:53.590
will be discussed that is a very very good project a very

03:11:53.590 --> 03:11:57.490
heavy one by the way it's again it's not a easy project for

03:11:57.490 --> 03:12:00.950
any one of us and that will give you a lot means literally a

03:12:00.950 --> 03:12:03.950
lot of idea and that too in real real time we are not like

03:12:03.950 --> 03:12:07.250
saying a real time for the sake of saying real no in a real

03:12:07.250 --> 03:12:09.950
real time because all of you are using it right so all of

03:12:09.950 --> 03:12:12.830
you are using it yuri on a regular daily basis thousands of

03:12:12.830 --> 03:12:15.190
people are using it on daily basis so that is something that

03:12:15.190 --> 03:12:19.250
will create on a scale till domain binding till hosting

03:12:19.250 --> 03:12:23.190
domain binding everything till like a cdn and everything cdn

03:12:23.190 --> 03:12:27.570
catching with memory context everything if i want to

03:12:31.970 --> 03:12:35.530
sorry sorry sorry i think your voice is low sir if i want to

03:12:35.530 --> 03:12:39.150
explore the code by myself so is there any possibility to do

03:12:39.150 --> 03:12:42.930
that we have not released it so hope you understand if you

03:12:42.930 --> 03:12:47.530
release everything then again not good for company okay okay

03:12:47.530 --> 03:12:52.690
yeah it's not in a favor favor of company at least okay so

03:12:52.690 --> 03:12:55.670
so maybe is there any possibility to create a part of that

03:12:55.670 --> 03:12:58.830
for example i upload my document and then i'm having a real

03:12:58.830 --> 03:13:01.470
-time conversation related to that particular document only

03:13:01.470 --> 03:13:04.350
that is possible yeah that is possible if we are able to

03:13:04.350 --> 03:13:06.590
create it why it is not possible we have done that right

03:13:08.910 --> 03:13:11.550
practically it's possible because it's live we had to be

03:13:11.550 --> 03:13:16.070
able to do it so we can do it again another time like thank

03:13:16.070 --> 03:13:21.090
you okay okay so next is please go ahead with the question

03:13:22.230 --> 03:13:26.470
hello am i audible yeah i think you are able yeah sir my

03:13:26.470 --> 03:13:27.550
question is that are you able to create a part of that

03:13:27.550 --> 03:13:27.550
document only so is there any possibility to create a part

03:13:27.550 --> 03:13:31.050
of that document only How much amount of fast API is

03:13:31.050 --> 03:13:36.210
important for this generative AI course? See fast API is not

03:13:36.210 --> 03:13:38.310
important for generative AI or data science or anything

03:13:38.310 --> 03:13:42.130
wherever you are building a real time system, right wherever

03:13:42.130 --> 03:13:45.090
you are building a real time system. In every real time

03:13:45.090 --> 03:13:47.150
system there will be a front end, there will be a back end,

03:13:47.250 --> 03:13:49.590
there will be a middle layer. Very simple. Yes sir. Whether

03:13:49.590 --> 03:13:52.070
you are building some application in generative AI or

03:13:52.070 --> 03:13:54.910
machine learning or in big data or maybe a bit development

03:13:54.910 --> 03:13:58.190
or maybe a blockchain anywhere, these three components will

03:13:58.190 --> 03:14:02.670
come into a picture by default in any project. Now obviously

03:14:02.670 --> 03:14:06.310
when we talk about a back end, so you are going to write a

03:14:06.310 --> 03:14:08.210
function, back end is what? Function, right? Set of function

03:14:08.210 --> 03:14:10.270
you are going to write, so which will communicate with the

03:14:10.270 --> 03:14:13.970
databases, other services and all those things. Now you have

03:14:13.970 --> 03:14:17.410
to expose it to a front end or maybe to a middle layer you

03:14:17.410 --> 03:14:20.770
have to bind it. API is required. It doesn't matter whether

03:14:20.770 --> 03:14:23.210
fast API, flask or maybe in a node you are writing an API,

03:14:23.210 --> 03:14:26.950
but API will be required. And maybe you are supposed to

03:14:26.950 --> 03:14:29.490
expose your system to the outer world, to the entire world

03:14:29.490 --> 03:14:31.890
so that entire world will be able to use your function. So

03:14:31.890 --> 03:14:35.730
again API will be required, right? So API is something which

03:14:35.730 --> 03:14:41.230
is a core part of any development, any development. So if

03:14:41.230 --> 03:14:43.950
you are going into a development, you are supposed to be

03:14:43.950 --> 03:14:47.630
aware about it. And if you are aware about a fast API or any

03:14:47.630 --> 03:14:50.670
framework in an API, believe me if you are going to touch

03:14:50.670 --> 03:14:54.330
even a node.js. With no time you will be able to understand

03:14:54.330 --> 03:14:57.050
node.js. No need to like explore a node.js from a zero,

03:14:57.210 --> 03:15:01.410
right? Because concept of API is not going to change, only

03:15:01.410 --> 03:15:06.030
syntaxes and languages are going to change. So I always

03:15:06.030 --> 03:15:10.830
suggest that learn it. At least one framework, then you can

03:15:10.830 --> 03:15:15.170
replicate into a 10 easily without even my help or anyone's

03:15:15.170 --> 03:15:20.370
else help. Sir, right now I am working as a python dev

03:15:20.370 --> 03:15:24.850
developer. And primarily I am working on a fast API. And I

03:15:24.850 --> 03:15:31.240
have an experience. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. You are

03:15:31.240 --> 03:15:32.980
already aware about API then. If you are working as a python

03:15:32.980 --> 03:15:35.860
developer, then there is no question to be asked there. No,

03:15:35.900 --> 03:15:39.780
no. I am just asking that how much amount of fast API is

03:15:39.780 --> 03:15:43.160
required in a generated API course. Okay. So it's required

03:15:43.160 --> 03:15:46.020
for all the development, irrespective of generated API or

03:15:46.020 --> 03:15:48.920
whatever you are doing. Okay, sir. Thanks. Thanks, sir.

03:15:49.060 --> 03:15:51.620
Yeah. Avinash, go ahead please.

03:15:54.400 --> 03:15:57.800
Yeah. So thank you so much, sir, for today's lecture. Thank

03:15:57.800 --> 03:16:02.320
you. So, sir, my doubts are, most of the doubts are solved

03:16:02.320 --> 03:16:06.380
by asking other person's doubts. Okay. But my doubt is

03:16:06.380 --> 03:16:10.860
regarding transformers, as you teach a transformer topic

03:16:10.860 --> 03:16:15.940
today. Not in detail. So should I watch the whole lecture

03:16:15.940 --> 03:16:19.020
series, which you mentioned, generated API with panel piece?

03:16:19.260 --> 03:16:22.900
Or should I watch only a particular lecture? No, no. For

03:16:22.900 --> 03:16:25.980
now, just focus on one. Okay. See, I, so there are, there

03:16:25.980 --> 03:16:28.020
are some people who is having a requirement of, you know,

03:16:28.040 --> 03:16:30.980
doing things in a fast track. Obviously for that, like we

03:16:30.980 --> 03:16:34.820
have offerings available on your own platform, but as a

03:16:34.820 --> 03:16:38.340
regular learner or as a, you know, a first time learner, I

03:16:38.340 --> 03:16:42.880
will always suggest to all of you that first do one, then

03:16:42.880 --> 03:16:43.900
second, then third.

03:16:46.610 --> 03:16:52.030
Yes, sir. Got it, sir. Yeah. And my second doubt is

03:16:52.030 --> 03:16:55.930
regarding, sir, I watch your SQL course, is it 10 hours

03:16:55.930 --> 03:16:59.530
course? So I want to practice more. So which platform is

03:16:59.530 --> 03:17:03.010
best for me? Nothing. Just, just, just, just do that much

03:17:03.010 --> 03:17:05.830
and start building the application. See, you're not supposed

03:17:05.830 --> 03:17:07.910
to practice, like keep on practicing things again and again

03:17:07.910 --> 03:17:10.770
and again. Even SQL interview questions, you will be able to

03:17:10.770 --> 03:17:13.410
find out as a book on your own platform and you already have

03:17:13.410 --> 03:17:16.050
access of that. So just try to download that book and

03:17:16.050 --> 03:17:18.190
practice all those questions. So whatever question that we

03:17:18.190 --> 03:17:21.410
have. And believe me, this is more, it's more than enough.

03:17:21.510 --> 03:17:24.150
Literally, it's more than enough. Plus even inside your

03:17:24.150 --> 03:17:27.410
batches, I have already given the assignment, right? Solve

03:17:27.410 --> 03:17:30.010
those assignment again, more than enough. So no need to

03:17:30.010 --> 03:17:31.950
explore here and there, and then start using it in

03:17:31.950 --> 03:17:35.670
application. Simple. Because I am a researcher and I am

03:17:35.670 --> 03:17:38.470
currently applying for data and listening to these questions

03:17:38.470 --> 03:17:41.670
and that's why I am asking for questions. Some people ask

03:17:41.670 --> 03:17:45.830
SQL questions. No, no, it's fine. It's fine. It's fine. So

03:17:45.830 --> 03:17:48.990
just, just like follow that approach. Yeah. Solve the

03:17:48.990 --> 03:17:51.830
assignments and solve like a book question we have given to

03:17:51.830 --> 03:17:53.470
you. And that question is coming from the company. So

03:17:53.470 --> 03:17:56.290
company-wide question is already mentioned inside a SQL

03:17:56.290 --> 03:18:00.430
book. That was shared by one of my students, one of my

03:18:00.430 --> 03:18:03.630
experienced students, by the way. So I have like maintained

03:18:03.630 --> 03:18:07.810
a book out of it. And apart from that, nothing is required.

03:18:08.030 --> 03:18:10.490
Start using an application. We should not keep on learning

03:18:10.490 --> 03:18:14.250
things. Like I have seen people who keep on solving a DSA

03:18:14.250 --> 03:18:19.590
question on lead code, 10,000 questions, 1000 questions. I'm

03:18:19.590 --> 03:18:23.370
like, why? Go and build something that will give you more

03:18:23.370 --> 03:18:28.390
values. And that's one. I just recently used it. It was

03:18:28.390 --> 03:18:33.670
awesome. But there is a limit for monthly limit. Can you

03:18:33.670 --> 03:18:38.650
increase up to five? Okay. Abni you are saying, right? Yes.

03:18:38.670 --> 03:18:41.330
Yes. Yeah. Even I'm planning to like increase the limit. So

03:18:41.330 --> 03:18:44.430
two or five basically. So we are, we are just observing

03:18:44.430 --> 03:18:47.310
because it's a real time conversational system, right? So we

03:18:47.310 --> 03:18:50.030
are getting a lot of like a hit on our server. So we are

03:18:50.030 --> 03:18:53.270
just like, and we are affordable, right? But servers,

03:18:53.270 --> 03:18:56.670
servers are not affordable. So we have to pay our bills for

03:18:56.670 --> 03:19:00.010
AWS anyhow. We have to pay our bills for like a tech stack

03:19:00.010 --> 03:19:04.630
and APIs that we are using anyhow. So we, we are like in a

03:19:04.630 --> 03:19:09.990
process of doing a math that, okay, how much we will be able

03:19:09.990 --> 03:19:13.850
to, you know, invest more in this one because we have to go

03:19:13.850 --> 03:19:16.950
for a long time. Right. It's not like I have started Avni

03:19:16.950 --> 03:19:19.510
today and then tomorrow I will have to close it Avni at

03:19:19.510 --> 03:19:24.610
least. So we are doing a math as we are affordable. So that

03:19:24.610 --> 03:19:27.930
is a, one of the good thing, but again, one of the bad thing

03:19:27.930 --> 03:19:31.350
as well for us, at least that we are not having much of

03:19:31.350 --> 03:19:35.550
runway. So we're just doing a math once that math will be

03:19:35.550 --> 03:19:38.150
done. And if that math is going to give me a positive

03:19:38.150 --> 03:19:42.530
result, I just have to change one word in a backend from

03:19:42.530 --> 03:19:48.950
three to five. That's it. Yes. So changes is not major, but

03:19:48.950 --> 03:19:54.030
yeah, that we are just like, you know, stuck into that

03:19:54.030 --> 03:19:59.790
mathematics part. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Okay. Okay. So next

03:19:59.790 --> 03:20:03.070
one, Uday please go ahead and yeah, Mukesh you, Manish,

03:20:03.070 --> 03:20:05.170
sorry, Manish, you can share the screen Manish, you have

03:20:05.170 --> 03:20:08.310
permission. Yes. In between. So Uday please go ahead with

03:20:08.310 --> 03:20:08.610
the question.

03:20:14.740 --> 03:20:18.020
Yeah. Sir, is it visible? Yeah. Manish said it's visible.

03:20:18.260 --> 03:20:18.760
Yes. But this is where your agenda is going to be showing.

03:20:18.760 --> 03:20:22.880
Sir actually I had doubt this occurred command from actually

03:20:22.880 --> 03:20:29.960
have this сделать image generation looks fine. Okay. I'll

03:20:29.960 --> 03:20:32.480
paste here don't,

03:20:33.980 --> 03:20:36.780
don't paste here. So it persönlich line by line. So just do

03:20:36.780 --> 03:20:42.080
one thing. Are clicking on this down triangle beside. Down

03:20:42.080 --> 03:20:46.800
triangle, beside this plus option. So it is trying to take

03:20:46.800 --> 03:20:49.140
it like a one by one, just, just click on this down triangle

03:20:49.140 --> 03:20:51.500
beside this command prompt. Right? So we have another tab

03:20:51.500 --> 03:20:55.860
option. Click on that. No, no, no. Click on that. Tab, tab,

03:20:55.920 --> 03:20:59.100
tab in the command prompt itself, just up, up like above.

03:20:59.980 --> 03:21:04.140
Okay. Give me, give me, click over there and then from

03:21:04.140 --> 03:21:07.980
there, open up PowerShell, now

03:21:10.160 --> 03:21:17.070
paste it here. Here also it's best way to try to paste it.

03:21:18.190 --> 03:21:22.010
Is it pasting line by line? No it's pasting in one. Yeah.

03:21:22.090 --> 03:21:26.370
It's pasting in one. No. Again, line by line. So give me a

03:21:26.370 --> 03:21:31.150
remote control. I'll try. You have a WSL, right? So it's not

03:21:31.150 --> 03:21:36.090
showing when we want to, by the way, I have a question too.

03:21:36.170 --> 03:21:41.750
Yes, Uday. Let's come to your question. Cloud shell is fine.

03:21:44.670 --> 03:21:48.830
Cloud shell is fine. You don't have a Ubuntu interface? No

03:21:48.830 --> 03:21:53.790
sir. No sir. In Ubuntu, so you will not face this problem.

03:21:54.870 --> 03:21:59.570
You have to install a WSL in Windows then for that, do you

03:21:59.570 --> 03:22:03.170
want to run an application? Windows PowerShell, default,

03:22:03.250 --> 03:22:07.690
default. Okay. No, you don't have a Ubuntu. Just install WSL

03:22:07.690 --> 03:22:09.210
and then you will be able to do a curl.

03:22:12.400 --> 03:22:18.280
Okay. Otherwise, like just use a curl from some other

03:22:18.280 --> 03:22:21.400
terminal, but not here. So you don't have any option for

03:22:21.400 --> 03:22:25.940
that. Okay. Should I download Ubuntu? Yeah, you can download

03:22:25.940 --> 03:22:29.840
a WSL actually. So see, I'll show you my system. So I am

03:22:29.840 --> 03:22:32.140
using a Windows machine itself, right? If you can stop

03:22:32.140 --> 03:22:36.020
sharing your system, let me share my screen.

03:22:40.980 --> 03:22:43.400
Yeah. So I believe my screen is visible, right? Yeah. Yeah.

03:22:43.400 --> 03:22:47.840
So see, if I'm going to open up a command prompt, right? So

03:22:47.840 --> 03:22:53.900
I used to get basically this option, this one, Ubuntu. Okay.

03:22:54.000 --> 03:22:57.680
Right. Ubuntu. So if I'm into this Ubuntu interface, if I'm

03:22:57.680 --> 03:23:00.460
going to copy and paste this curl command, it will not give

03:23:00.460 --> 03:23:03.380
me like a issue. It will try to paste it as a single line.

03:23:03.600 --> 03:23:07.300
Second option that you have is basically just go to a curl

03:23:07.300 --> 03:23:09.520
command. It's not like you will not be able to execute it

03:23:09.520 --> 03:23:12.900
now. You can execute it even now. The only thing is that you

03:23:12.900 --> 03:23:16.140
have to change a little bit. Let me show you that. So UDAPI

03:23:16.140 --> 03:23:21.980
and then maybe a code example, not this one, SDK, AI

03:23:21.980 --> 03:23:26.060
framework, available models, endpoints. So let's suppose I'm

03:23:26.060 --> 03:23:28.960
using this curl or image generation you have been using,

03:23:29.040 --> 03:23:32.940
right? Yeah. Yeah. This is the curl which I'm using. Maybe I

03:23:32.940 --> 03:23:41.340
can try to open up my notebook and next, then this one. And

03:23:41.340 --> 03:23:44.800
just make it as a single line. It's a multiple line, right?

03:23:45.160 --> 03:23:48.300
So just remove slash slash slash, which is representing

03:23:48.300 --> 03:23:54.920
multiple lines. Now copy it. It became single line and then

03:23:54.920 --> 03:23:58.880
paste it in a command prompt itself. See paste anyway. It's

03:23:58.880 --> 03:24:04.940
a single line. I'm sorry. So I have to convert more. This

03:24:04.940 --> 03:24:10.680
will become bit lengthy, but that's okay. Okay. Mainly in

03:24:10.680 --> 03:24:13.760
single line command prompt will work, right? Yeah. Single

03:24:13.760 --> 03:24:15.800
line command prompt, I'll show it to you now itself. So

03:24:15.800 --> 03:24:18.580
command prompt will always work in a single line, in a

03:24:18.580 --> 03:24:22.760
multiple line. So basically it is not able to understand

03:24:22.760 --> 03:24:26.540
slash and slash and slash basically, which is, which means

03:24:26.540 --> 03:24:30.740
new line, whereas you're like a Ubuntu terminal. So it will

03:24:30.740 --> 03:24:32.900
be able to understand even your Mac will not give you an

03:24:32.900 --> 03:24:37.700
issue. So now this is my single line. Now if I'm going to

03:24:37.700 --> 03:24:40.800
copy and paste. I have to. I have to like use my API token

03:24:40.800 --> 03:24:47.740
by the way. So let me use my API token, create new, create.

03:24:50.360 --> 03:24:52.560
Yeah. So my

03:24:56.560 --> 03:25:00.060
API token, control V.

03:25:02.900 --> 03:25:07.200
Now it became the single line, pasted. Okay. So then what

03:25:07.200 --> 03:25:10.440
was the issue? Pasted, single line. Now see, I'll get the

03:25:10.440 --> 03:25:17.000
output. Yeah. So success, something like this. And could not

03:25:17.000 --> 03:25:22.620
resolve black forest lab. Maybe I have made some mistake in

03:25:22.620 --> 03:25:24.800
terms of converting it to a single line, but that's okay.

03:25:25.180 --> 03:25:30.680
Right. Response is URL black forest lab. It is telling me

03:25:30.680 --> 03:25:40.210
influx and it's into single, a beautiful sunset over the

03:25:40.210 --> 03:25:42.310
mountain triple

03:25:45.580 --> 03:25:52.240
quote. It will. So this is if you are going to send the hit

03:25:52.240 --> 03:25:55.900
in this way. So if your command is correct, it will be able

03:25:55.900 --> 03:25:57.360
to give you the output as simple as that.

03:26:05.830 --> 03:26:10.590
So there is a issue. Let me rectify this

03:26:16.510 --> 03:26:16.810
one.

03:26:53.070 --> 03:27:00.250
Now it is what happened on the match closed braces. Okay.

03:27:00.970 --> 03:27:01.870
Again, issue.

03:27:15.080 --> 03:27:21.060
Ah. So. Success is equals to false. So

03:27:32.960 --> 03:27:39.740
error message, unexpected token in Jason. Okay. 500. And so

03:27:39.740 --> 03:27:43.300
I'm able to fit the API, but it's giving me 500.

03:27:58.120 --> 03:28:01.460
So it's better to have this one because here it will never

03:28:01.460 --> 03:28:04.700
give you an issue. So here you will always like a, try to do

03:28:04.700 --> 03:28:07.180
a copy and paste the way you are like a sending a command.

03:28:07.920 --> 03:28:12.060
Okay. So even in PowerShell also takes singular. Yeah. So

03:28:12.060 --> 03:28:17.780
that's

03:28:17.780 --> 03:28:22.900
a problem. Okay. Okay. I got the output. See, I think I got

03:28:22.900 --> 03:28:25.760
the output API together. Yeah. I got the image based on this

03:28:25.760 --> 03:28:30.020
one. So now, and to convert this one into a single line, you

03:28:30.020 --> 03:28:32.760
don't have to do much. You have a URI, right? Yeah. Yeah.

03:28:32.960 --> 03:28:37.100
Copy and paste everything into URI. Okay. Thank you. And

03:28:37.100 --> 03:28:40.480
see, I'm able to create the image. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So

03:28:40.480 --> 03:28:43.440
even inside this PowerShell, sorry, command prompt or

03:28:43.440 --> 03:28:46.600
PowerShell, I'm able to like get my output, but the

03:28:46.600 --> 03:28:49.480
condition is single line. If I have to convert something

03:28:49.480 --> 03:28:52.480
into a single line, I have a URI, I'll just copy and paste

03:28:52.480 --> 03:28:54.900
my curl and say that, okay, convert that into a single line

03:28:54.900 --> 03:28:59.900
and done. It's better to download Ubuntu, right? It's better

03:28:59.900 --> 03:29:02.880
actually like to keep Ubuntu even interface into your

03:29:02.880 --> 03:29:06.480
windows and windows is giving you this option now. So better

03:29:06.480 --> 03:29:09.960
to have it. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Would I

03:29:09.960 --> 03:29:10.620
please go to the question?

03:29:13.960 --> 03:29:18.600
Yeah. Hello there. I'm audible. Yeah. Side. Please go over

03:29:18.600 --> 03:29:18.860
the question.

03:29:22.480 --> 03:29:25.660
Yeah. Side. Please go ahead. Yeah. So we have today, we have

03:29:25.660 --> 03:29:28.700
created, like we have used the embedding models from the

03:29:28.700 --> 03:29:32.100
open source and then we have used the sentence transformers.

03:29:32.240 --> 03:29:34.660
So I would like to understand support. We I'm going to

03:29:34.660 --> 03:29:39.500
create a one kind of like, sorry, you can repeat once again,

03:29:39.620 --> 03:29:42.860
my question is that we have used that. We have used some

03:29:42.860 --> 03:29:45.380
open AI models for the embeddings, right? Yes. Yes. True.

03:29:45.520 --> 03:29:49.820
Then we have used that a sentence transformers. Okay. So I

03:29:49.820 --> 03:29:51.880
would like to understand the relationship between both

03:29:51.880 --> 03:29:55.940
suppose my next question would be basically Transformer.

03:29:55.940 --> 03:29:58.580
Actually we have used, see, we have used actually two things

03:29:58.580 --> 03:30:02.340
today. One is a URI API. So URI API was trying to provide

03:30:02.340 --> 03:30:05.900
you a open AI model access, simple, right? And we were able

03:30:05.900 --> 03:30:08.640
to convert into a, like embeddings with the help of APIs,

03:30:08.760 --> 03:30:12.480
which is already hosted. The second approach was. I have

03:30:12.480 --> 03:30:17.100
downloaded a model from a hugging face. And over there. So

03:30:17.100 --> 03:30:19.280
to download those models from a hugging face. So I have

03:30:19.280 --> 03:30:21.860
installed a library and that was actually a sentence

03:30:21.860 --> 03:30:26.160
transformer. So in one of the approach, I think my screen is

03:30:26.160 --> 03:30:30.000
visible, right? Right here. I'm downloading this model in my

03:30:30.000 --> 03:30:33.120
system from hugging face. So it's basically a public model,

03:30:33.260 --> 03:30:36.360
which is open source model. I'm just using it right now.

03:30:36.500 --> 03:30:40.720
There is no API and it is not live now here. So anyone can

03:30:40.720 --> 03:30:42.540
use it from this entire world. Without even doing a

03:30:42.540 --> 03:30:46.420
downloads. So it's a different, different approach, but

03:30:46.420 --> 03:30:49.380
yeah, ultimately I'm trying to do the embeddings. Okay. So

03:30:49.380 --> 03:30:52.380
embedding. So suppose, uh, no, I, if I come to that real

03:30:52.380 --> 03:30:56.460
time, real time, like I suppose I have a, like a book or

03:30:56.460 --> 03:30:59.340
some, some kind of like a PDF, I have multiple PDFs. So

03:30:59.340 --> 03:31:02.180
first I need to do the embeddings, right? Yes. You have to

03:31:02.180 --> 03:31:04.920
do the embeddings. See after that embeddings, basically what

03:31:04.920 --> 03:31:07.420
we have to do, basically that that has become like a, when

03:31:07.420 --> 03:31:09.580
we call it embeddings, nothing is going to be like a vector

03:31:09.580 --> 03:31:13.400
database for simple. Well, you have to do a embeddings and

03:31:13.400 --> 03:31:15.540
as an output of the embedding, you will be able to get this

03:31:15.540 --> 03:31:17.940
vector, right? Correct. You will be able to get this numbers

03:31:17.940 --> 03:31:21.080
technically, right? And then you are going to store this one

03:31:21.080 --> 03:31:25.380
into a databases. Correct. The way we try to store any

03:31:25.380 --> 03:31:28.000
record, right? For example, if I have an employee record or

03:31:28.000 --> 03:31:30.780
if I have a hospital record, so somewhere in a database, we

03:31:30.780 --> 03:31:33.080
are storing it so that everyone will be able to access it.

03:31:33.140 --> 03:31:35.160
Everyone will be able to run the query on top of that one.

03:31:35.240 --> 03:31:38.240
Right. So similarly, this is my data. Let's suppose this

03:31:38.240 --> 03:31:40.460
data I'm generating from a books, right? I'm processing

03:31:40.460 --> 03:31:43.400
maybe 10,000 books. And maybe like a millions of pages

03:31:43.400 --> 03:31:45.900
inside the books. So this is the data which I'm generating

03:31:45.900 --> 03:31:48.820
and then like a storing into a DB. Now once data is

03:31:48.820 --> 03:31:52.020
available into a DB, then I'll send a query. So when I send

03:31:52.020 --> 03:31:55.680
a query, like even in a SQL, if you are aware about SQL, so

03:31:55.680 --> 03:31:58.940
we write a query, right? We write a SQL query. Yeah. And the

03:31:58.940 --> 03:32:02.940
SQL query is having its own provision to do a search one by

03:32:02.940 --> 03:32:04.960
one. It will try to do the record matching and then finally

03:32:04.960 --> 03:32:07.040
it will be able to give the result or maybe based on the

03:32:07.040 --> 03:32:13.040
partition, it is going to search the record. Yeah. Okay. So

03:32:13.040 --> 03:32:19.220
my question is basically that, so for creating a vector

03:32:19.220 --> 03:32:22.740
database, we need one embedding models. Correct? Yeah. To

03:32:22.740 --> 03:32:25.500
store, you need embedding models and there are many vector

03:32:25.500 --> 03:32:28.380
databases which I'll show you tomorrow. They are even giving

03:32:28.380 --> 03:32:31.980
you embedding models inside their own vector data interface,

03:32:32.140 --> 03:32:35.920
but they will charge you for that. Okay. So suppose then

03:32:35.920 --> 03:32:39.620
again that if I say in terms of that when I do the searching

03:32:39.620 --> 03:32:43.260
and like I wanted to ask some query, it will go and search

03:32:43.260 --> 03:32:45.900
from the vector database and it will send it to the real

03:32:45.900 --> 03:32:49.300
time LLM models like ChartGPT and all those, correct? If you

03:32:49.300 --> 03:32:51.800
are building RAG application, if you are not building RAG

03:32:51.800 --> 03:32:54.460
application, if you are just doing a query search, so it

03:32:54.460 --> 03:32:58.560
will search and give you the result. Simple. Okay. Sending a

03:32:58.560 --> 03:33:01.620
LLMs is not important by the way. I mean like it's not

03:33:01.620 --> 03:33:04.380
mandatory. So it depends upon my cases. Let's suppose if I'm

03:33:04.380 --> 03:33:07.420
trying to build a RAG kind of a case, so where it should

03:33:07.420 --> 03:33:10.800
send a query and then do the analysis. Do some like a four

03:33:10.800 --> 03:33:14.060
more tasks on top of this, rephrase it, refine it and then

03:33:14.060 --> 03:33:17.600
give me the output. Okay, fine. I can send the data to the

03:33:17.600 --> 03:33:21.260
LLMs, which we do into RAG if I don't want that, right? I'm

03:33:21.260 --> 03:33:23.880
just looking for the raw output. Okay. That's cool. Like I

03:33:23.880 --> 03:33:26.320
will not send to the LLMs. LLM is not required in that case.

03:33:26.580 --> 03:33:29.220
Okay. You mean to see if I need the data. Suppose I have a,

03:33:29.220 --> 03:33:34.600
I have a basically a library or basically I have a kind of a

03:33:34.600 --> 03:33:37.260
SharePoint data. SharePoint data. SharePoint data. Where I

03:33:37.260 --> 03:33:41.220
have most of like my designs or my documents are stored in

03:33:41.220 --> 03:33:45.600
one place, like on my OneDrive. Exactly. I can, I can do

03:33:45.600 --> 03:33:51.100
that basically embeddings. So for the embeddings, I can use

03:33:51.100 --> 03:33:53.800
some OpenAI models or some other models I can use for the

03:33:53.800 --> 03:33:56.200
embeddings. If I need a raw data, it will give me the raw

03:33:56.200 --> 03:33:59.600
data. I don't need to go with that RAG-based model. If I

03:33:59.600 --> 03:34:02.380
need that something to be summarized, something to be more

03:34:02.380 --> 03:34:06.360
like. Yeah. So maybe if you're asking, like if you're

03:34:06.360 --> 03:34:08.200
asking. Yeah. Maybe you have a medical record, right? You

03:34:08.200 --> 03:34:11.520
have stored a medical record now. So if you are looking for

03:34:11.520 --> 03:34:14.360
a medical record of yours, so like a, give me a medical

03:34:14.360 --> 03:34:17.020
record of basically Sahid. Okay. It will go, it will check.

03:34:17.100 --> 03:34:19.280
There are like hundreds of medical record, but Sahid's

03:34:19.280 --> 03:34:21.280
medical record, it will try to identify and it will try to

03:34:21.280 --> 03:34:24.440
like extract it. Now your medical report is maybe a hundred

03:34:24.440 --> 03:34:28.080
page long. Right? So then you can send those data to whom?

03:34:28.140 --> 03:34:31.380
To LLM. Say that. Okay, fine. Summarize it. Now, if doctor

03:34:31.380 --> 03:34:34.380
would like to give you maybe a suggestion, right? So it will

03:34:34.380 --> 03:34:36.540
try to fetch your medical record and send it to the LLM.

03:34:36.540 --> 03:34:38.440
Saying that. Okay, fine. Give some suggestion for this

03:34:38.440 --> 03:34:42.340
particular cure or this disease, that disease, simple. So it

03:34:42.340 --> 03:34:45.940
will be able to do it in that way. So in short, if I say

03:34:45.940 --> 03:34:49.300
that creating a rack based application, I may need two

03:34:49.300 --> 03:34:52.980
models, right? One is the LLM and one is the embeddings.

03:34:53.180 --> 03:34:56.040
Embedding models. So for those, basically I have to pay the

03:34:56.040 --> 03:34:59.380
charges for both of the models. Yes. Yes. And plus the

03:34:59.380 --> 03:35:03.960
storage, vector database storage as well. And plus if you

03:35:03.960 --> 03:35:06.500
are hosting it, then for hosting again charge. So nothing is

03:35:06.500 --> 03:35:08.920
done. Nothing is coming as free. Nothing is coming as free.

03:35:09.020 --> 03:35:12.300
Nothing at all. So see the resume system, you must have seen

03:35:12.300 --> 03:35:15.280
resume AI, right? That we have built. Now resume works in

03:35:15.280 --> 03:35:18.440
three ways. So one, you can upload the resume, any kind of a

03:35:18.440 --> 03:35:21.700
resume, maybe like your resume is completely scrapped, but

03:35:21.700 --> 03:35:25.140
like there's, there's no line length indentation, anything.

03:35:25.440 --> 03:35:28.360
It will be able to rephrase it. Part number one. Part number

03:35:28.360 --> 03:35:31.560
two, you can upload a resume along with that upload a JD. So

03:35:31.560 --> 03:35:33.520
it will understand your resume. It will understand your JD.

03:35:33.620 --> 03:35:36.100
It will create it. Part number three. So you can try to

03:35:36.100 --> 03:35:39.560
create a resume from the scratch, right? So whenever you're

03:35:39.560 --> 03:35:42.020
trying to upload your resume, we are, we are calling LMS in

03:35:42.020 --> 03:35:47.550
the backend. Yeah. Makes sense. So basically that for the

03:35:47.550 --> 03:35:50.830
vector database, like a Chrome DB and stuff like for the

03:35:50.830 --> 03:35:53.650
Facebook also, we have to pay those like for those also, we

03:35:53.650 --> 03:35:57.490
need an API keys. Facebook, Facebook, AI similarity search.

03:35:57.490 --> 03:36:00.410
You just install it. It's an open source databases. You can

03:36:00.410 --> 03:36:03.990
install it, but you will install it in a local, but let's

03:36:03.990 --> 03:36:06.250
suppose if you are building an application. If you're like

03:36:06.250 --> 03:36:09.910
making an application global, then you have to host even

03:36:09.910 --> 03:36:13.190
that database over there. Right? See, my SQL is free. My

03:36:13.190 --> 03:36:15.070
SQL, you can download it. You can practice it in local

03:36:15.070 --> 03:36:19.450
system. Right. Agree. Yeah. But, but if you have to build a

03:36:19.450 --> 03:36:22.710
real time application, industry grade application, then same

03:36:22.710 --> 03:36:26.530
my SQL, either you go take a EC2 instances, host it over

03:36:26.530 --> 03:36:29.970
there and then do the query. Right. Otherwise you can try to

03:36:29.970 --> 03:36:32.890
take some of the, you know, cloud instances, which they are

03:36:32.890 --> 03:36:36.250
managing. It means managed DB. You are going to consider. So

03:36:36.250 --> 03:36:38.850
anyhow, either you are going to host it or you are going to

03:36:38.850 --> 03:36:41.810
take someone else hosted machine. You will pay if you're

03:36:41.810 --> 03:36:44.530
going real time. So Facebook has similarity search and

03:36:44.530 --> 03:36:47.290
chroma DB. You can do a local installation, which we'll do

03:36:47.290 --> 03:36:51.690
tomorrow. Right. Yeah. For quadrant and pine cone, they have

03:36:51.690 --> 03:36:54.170
already given you a, you know, interface and the cloud and

03:36:54.170 --> 03:36:56.050
they have already given you a free credits as well without

03:36:56.050 --> 03:36:58.470
adding card that, okay, come for the experimentation because

03:36:58.470 --> 03:37:02.110
they know if you are going to like it, you will pay it. One

03:37:02.110 --> 03:37:05.610
more follow up question. Nothing. See some of the, like, I

03:37:05.610 --> 03:37:07.630
have heard about it. I'm not sure about it. You'd be able

03:37:07.630 --> 03:37:10.370
to, you'd be, you'd be the world first, like best person to

03:37:10.370 --> 03:37:12.930
give me the answer. Suppose I'm creating a rag based

03:37:12.930 --> 03:37:15.850
application. I can, I got the information that I need all

03:37:15.850 --> 03:37:19.730
these models, all the databases, but, but if I go with using

03:37:19.730 --> 03:37:23.790
some kind of like directly, we are not using, and it's a

03:37:23.790 --> 03:37:26.410
company we are not using directly that open area hosted

03:37:26.410 --> 03:37:28.470
somewhere. What we are doing that either we are going with

03:37:28.470 --> 03:37:32.510
that AWS or we normally go with a Jewel. Right. Mm-hmm. So I

03:37:32.510 --> 03:37:35.730
believe that all the completed rag, but I just need to

03:37:35.730 --> 03:37:38.910
connect my, my work space or like a, we can say the

03:37:38.910 --> 03:37:43.310
SharePoint or some of the library, it will automatically do

03:37:43.310 --> 03:37:46.570
the vectorization embeddings. Plus it may give me that like

03:37:46.570 --> 03:37:49.290
a user interface or something. Not automatically. So no

03:37:49.290 --> 03:37:52.230
system is available as of now, but you have to do the

03:37:52.230 --> 03:37:54.890
mapping that, okay, fine. This is my drive where my data

03:37:54.890 --> 03:37:57.170
will come. And then you have to provision basically one of

03:37:57.170 --> 03:38:00.110
the vector DB on any of this cloud platform. So you have to

03:38:00.110 --> 03:38:02.310
write a middleware script that, okay, fine. Read a file from

03:38:02.310 --> 03:38:05.650
here, convert that into this embedding again, inside Amazon

03:38:05.650 --> 03:38:08.090
bedrock and all those other services, they are giving you a

03:38:08.090 --> 03:38:12.390
inbuilt model, but very high, literally see wherever they

03:38:12.390 --> 03:38:16.810
are making your life easy. You are going to pay more, right?

03:38:16.910 --> 03:38:19.130
But ultimately it will do the same thing, right? So let's

03:38:19.130 --> 03:38:21.890
suppose you are using URI or maybe you have hosted because

03:38:21.890 --> 03:38:25.110
database storage is going to be one time task. Let's suppose

03:38:25.110 --> 03:38:27.510
I have millions of books, right? I have millions of books.

03:38:27.610 --> 03:38:30.010
And for all of those millions of books, I have to process it

03:38:30.010 --> 03:38:32.530
and I have to convert that into an embedding. So what will

03:38:32.530 --> 03:38:35.030
my preferred approach? My preferred approach is to download

03:38:35.030 --> 03:38:38.870
some big open source model, right? Convert that into an

03:38:38.870 --> 03:38:41.350
embedding so that I can at least save those like a

03:38:41.350 --> 03:38:44.810
conversion for converting millions of pages and books into

03:38:44.810 --> 03:38:47.990
an embeddings from a cloud, right? And then dump those

03:38:47.990 --> 03:38:50.930
embedding because it's a one time job, right? See query is

03:38:50.930 --> 03:38:53.010
not going to be one time job. So for query anyhow, you have

03:38:53.010 --> 03:38:56.010
to store the data and pay for it because query depends upon

03:38:56.010 --> 03:39:00.970
your traction, right? Customer basically. But embedding. So

03:39:00.970 --> 03:39:04.890
which is a one time job. I can make it a bit cheaper. Yeah.

03:39:04.990 --> 03:39:08.950
No, no. I wanted to talk to you more on this because see the

03:39:08.950 --> 03:39:11.850
one thing is which I'm really a little interested that

03:39:11.850 --> 03:39:16.110
because in our project or our company, okay, every we

03:39:16.110 --> 03:39:19.610
normally on that like a safe agile mode, that's fine. But

03:39:19.610 --> 03:39:23.010
every release in a year we are going to have a two releases

03:39:23.010 --> 03:39:26.810
and each release may having like a more than 60, 70, 80 or

03:39:26.810 --> 03:39:29.750
we can say more than a hundred documents. So every six

03:39:29.750 --> 03:39:32.530
months. Hmm. I have to compile that I have to get the

03:39:32.530 --> 03:39:35.930
embeddings. So suppose I created till, so the suggestion

03:39:35.930 --> 03:39:40.030
would be from you that, okay, till January I did the compile

03:39:40.030 --> 03:39:42.990
my all the data after the January and again I have to

03:39:42.990 --> 03:39:46.130
recompile the data and embed all those models. Generally we

03:39:46.130 --> 03:39:48.770
try to schedule it. So run the crown job, maybe use some

03:39:48.770 --> 03:39:51.170
scheduler like an airflow or something. Right. There are

03:39:51.170 --> 03:39:53.990
like hundreds of scheduler which is available. So or maybe

03:39:53.990 --> 03:39:56.950
into a data base itself there is a task scheduler, right? So

03:39:56.950 --> 03:39:59.290
that script you have to run it in every one month or every

03:39:59.290 --> 03:40:00.910
six months after checking So you are taking some conditions.

03:40:01.010 --> 03:40:03.090
So just go ahead, schedule your time, date and all those

03:40:03.090 --> 03:40:05.610
things and frequency that, okay, run every week, run every

03:40:05.610 --> 03:40:08.850
month. Your job is done. The system will send all those data

03:40:08.850 --> 03:40:11.010
automatically. You don't have to worry about anything. Just

03:40:11.010 --> 03:40:14.090
I need to do that like a chatbot kind of things to do this

03:40:14.090 --> 03:40:17.550
one time job, not even a chatbot one time task scheduling.

03:40:17.770 --> 03:40:20.450
Why do we need even a chatbot? No, no, because once the data

03:40:20.450 --> 03:40:22.750
is available in the vector, then easily I can do that like a

03:40:22.750 --> 03:40:27.290
prompts or like, and we can say the message to get the data.

03:40:27.430 --> 03:40:29.850
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Got it. Nice information, sir.

03:40:29.870 --> 03:40:33.870
Thank you so much. Okay. Thank you so much. Okay. Yeah.

03:40:33.930 --> 03:40:34.850
Please go to the question.

03:40:40.520 --> 03:40:43.380
I'm available to you. Aruna, please go to the question.

03:40:43.540 --> 03:40:46.980
Naresh, please go to the question. Now I can see only four.

03:40:47.060 --> 03:40:52.400
Hi, sir. Arun here. Please go ahead. Hi, sir. Today is the

03:40:52.400 --> 03:40:58.040
first class here. And I understood the vector things very

03:40:58.040 --> 03:41:02.100
well. Okay. And I just wanted to know. The whatever the

03:41:02.100 --> 03:41:07.140
previous classes already done since second of August. So I

03:41:07.140 --> 03:41:11.320
need to go through the selectors, right? And do the. It's

03:41:11.320 --> 03:41:13.840
fine. First week was an induction session. So you can just

03:41:13.840 --> 03:41:16.420
keep that part first and second, like a second and third,

03:41:16.500 --> 03:41:18.860
the lecture that I've taken, right? Yeah. You can just keep

03:41:18.860 --> 03:41:22.020
that part. Just go through the lecture that I have given to

03:41:22.020 --> 03:41:25.340
this class in last week, last two lecture with, because that

03:41:25.340 --> 03:41:28.660
is important where I have talked about a fast API and then I

03:41:28.660 --> 03:41:31.380
have given a challenges to my class. So just last one week,

03:41:31.480 --> 03:41:34.860
no need to go through the first one. It's fine. If you have

03:41:34.860 --> 03:41:38.080
like gone through the entire platform, so induction is done.

03:41:38.600 --> 03:41:44.000
Yeah. Okay. One more thing. As I'm working at a Selenium

03:41:44.000 --> 03:41:50.600
automation site. So it's JNI will help in that to give more

03:41:50.600 --> 03:41:54.760
advantage on that. I mean, Selenium automation side.

03:41:55.980 --> 03:42:00.600
Obviously a lot. Because. Like JNI can do a better

03:42:00.600 --> 03:42:03.220
automation as compared to Selenium as far as my knowledge.

03:42:03.500 --> 03:42:10.360
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, so here we'll cover all the, I

03:42:10.360 --> 03:42:14.820
mean, tools and technologies. So post that we'll have some

03:42:14.820 --> 03:42:23.380
Selenium, Selenium related, any, any, what do you call, demo

03:42:23.380 --> 03:42:28.960
kind of will happen? No. I'm not. I'm not going to, maybe

03:42:28.960 --> 03:42:31.240
you can bring some application and then show it to me or

03:42:31.240 --> 03:42:34.060
maybe discuss, but specifically, I'm not going to talk about

03:42:34.060 --> 03:42:37.000
that because in this way, you know, I'll end up getting a

03:42:37.000 --> 03:42:40.600
lot of demand saying that from cybersecurity do is from

03:42:40.600 --> 03:42:43.080
blockchain. Let's do it. I mean, you know, that, that will

03:42:43.080 --> 03:42:46.340
be endless. Okay. Okay. Okay. Don't worry if you're, if

03:42:46.340 --> 03:42:48.220
you're bringing something and if you're asking me to

03:42:48.220 --> 03:42:51.000
discuss, I don't have any issue. I will be happy to discuss.

03:42:51.200 --> 03:42:54.200
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you so much, sir. Yeah. Thanks.

03:42:54.200 --> 03:42:55.600
Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks.

03:42:55.600 --> 03:42:58.800
Thanks. Okay. Next one, please. Anyone guys, like, I think I

03:42:58.800 --> 03:43:01.960
can see only four hands. Yeah. Hello, sir. Yeah. Go ahead,

03:43:02.000 --> 03:43:05.400
please. So this is Prashant. So Prashant tell me. So

03:43:05.400 --> 03:43:08.480
basically, sir, I have facing some issue when you run your,

03:43:08.500 --> 03:43:12.160
like. Do you want to do a screen share? Yes, I want to do a

03:43:12.160 --> 03:43:16.560
screen share. Okay. In between, so Armaan, Raneves, Ranjit,

03:43:16.600 --> 03:43:21.350
Uday, anyone? Armaan, this side. Sir, I want to ask. Yeah.

03:43:21.350 --> 03:43:23.710
So, for every time when we use the embedding model, it will

03:43:23.710 --> 03:43:26.470
use the quotient similarity to search for the query and get

03:43:26.470 --> 03:43:29.370
the output. For searching. So no, not every time. So

03:43:29.370 --> 03:43:32.270
depends, see, it's not depends upon the embedding. It

03:43:32.270 --> 03:43:33.670
depends upon the DB actually.

03:43:36.630 --> 03:43:39.130
Embedding is simply converting, you're using a model and

03:43:39.130 --> 03:43:41.690
then you're transferring the data, right? So this similarity

03:43:41.690 --> 03:43:44.370
search will happen when, when there is a data in my database

03:43:44.370 --> 03:43:47.990
and then you are sending a query. So basically to match two

03:43:47.990 --> 03:43:50.550
embeddings, I'm going to use some technique over there. So

03:43:50.550 --> 03:43:53.310
that is where like a cosine similarity or this Manhattan

03:43:53.310 --> 03:43:56.150
distances or Euclidean distances, all these things comes

03:43:56.150 --> 03:43:59.270
into a picture. So the model will already know that what

03:43:59.270 --> 03:44:02.870
technique I have to use? No, my model will be aware about

03:44:02.870 --> 03:44:04.710
it. There is no relationship with the model, right? Model

03:44:04.710 --> 03:44:08.210
only knows that how to convert your textual information into

03:44:08.210 --> 03:44:11.870
a numerical information. That is the only role of model. So

03:44:11.870 --> 03:44:13.810
that we have to decide what the technique is. Yeah,

03:44:13.810 --> 03:44:16.930
basically, yes. Like my model will decide that how you are

03:44:16.930 --> 03:44:19.350
doing a similarity search or how you are comparing the data.

03:44:20.450 --> 03:44:22.670
The model's responsibility is to take an input as your

03:44:22.670 --> 03:44:25.690
textual information, give you output as a vector. That's it.

03:44:26.090 --> 03:44:33.370
Numerical. Got it, right? Yeah. Okay. Next one, please.

03:44:35.680 --> 03:44:38.440
Yeah. I think you're sharing a screen. Yeah. I can see a

03:44:38.440 --> 03:44:41.840
screen. I don't know if there is an error in this. I don't

03:44:41.840 --> 03:44:42.080
know if there is an error.

03:44:45.360 --> 03:44:50.140
Can you give me screen access once? One minute. Let's see.

03:44:50.260 --> 03:44:58.400
Let's take screen access. Okay. No paint. No, I think screen

03:44:58.400 --> 03:45:02.000
access. You think you joined with VIF, right? Yeah, I joined

03:45:02.000 --> 03:45:03.640
with VIF. Yeah, that's why you can't take screen access.

03:45:04.200 --> 03:45:06.420
Actually, you have to join with it next time. I mean, by

03:45:06.420 --> 03:45:09.280
downloading the Zoom app. Okay, fine. What's the issue here?

03:45:09.700 --> 03:45:12.100
There's an issue with data. Here in embedding, data zero,

03:45:12.240 --> 03:45:17.000
this and that. Go up, go up, go up, go up. There shouldn't

03:45:17.000 --> 03:45:19.740
be an issue here. The data is also fine here. Sudhanshu

03:45:19.740 --> 03:45:23.280
authorization key. The stars are there. Sudhanshu

03:45:23.280 --> 03:45:27.800
authorization key. Yeah. Yes. See, look up. This was copied

03:45:27.800 --> 03:45:31.080
from here. No, bro. You don't have to copy from there. Just

03:45:31.080 --> 03:45:34.720
go back. Go back to your API key. From here. Yes. Will you

03:45:34.720 --> 03:45:37.780
generate it again? No, no, no. When it is generated from

03:45:37.780 --> 03:45:40.400
there, the copy option will come. The star means that it has

03:45:40.400 --> 03:45:43.080
been hidden. So, you have to create again. Every time you

03:45:43.080 --> 03:45:44.880
have to create a new one. Yes. Every time you have to create

03:45:44.880 --> 03:45:47.660
a new one. Or you can keep the copy here. Okay. The security

03:45:47.660 --> 03:45:48.420
has also been given to them.

03:45:59.520 --> 03:46:03.420
And sir, in this embedding, there was one more doubt. That

03:46:03.420 --> 03:46:03.600
is, if you want to create a new one, you have to create a

03:46:03.600 --> 03:46:05.240
new one. What is the code? Here you have to change it. Yes.

03:46:05.240 --> 03:46:05.960
You have to change it completely. You have to change from

03:46:05.960 --> 03:46:11.060
URI to error space. From whole URI, yes. Remove this.

03:46:15.000 --> 03:46:21.000
Right now, yes, it will run. It is done. Point it again,

03:46:21.060 --> 03:46:24.480
your embedding. And one more thing. In this, when we were

03:46:24.480 --> 03:46:27.400
importing yellow model from the sentence, I was getting some

03:46:27.400 --> 03:46:29.800
errors in it. There was no error in it. Already one person

03:46:29.800 --> 03:46:31.820
has been solved. The version of your Python is showing

03:46:31.820 --> 03:46:35.420
there. Python version is 3.13. Python version is 3.14. 3.10

03:46:35.420 --> 03:46:39.600
because this sentence transform gives an error in 3.13, it

03:46:39.600 --> 03:46:43.120
should be 3.10, is it new or not? So for the environment,

03:46:43.440 --> 03:46:47.720
you had said something to the server, what is the clear

03:46:47.720 --> 03:46:50.800
answer? Nothing, nothing, Python environment creation or

03:46:50.800 --> 03:46:52.860
conda create hyphen n environment creation, Python

03:46:52.860 --> 03:46:56.700
environment. We have told you many times, many times. Okay,

03:46:56.800 --> 03:47:00.240
we will tell you again tomorrow. You are telling a kernel,

03:47:00.560 --> 03:47:02.500
okay, there is no issue with the environment, it will have

03:47:02.500 --> 03:47:05.240
to be lowered, version 1. No, no, nothing, select another

03:47:05.240 --> 03:47:07.200
kernel, click here, let's see if there is any environment or

03:47:07.200 --> 03:47:10.440
not, it will not happen, it is not. Python environment,

03:47:10.620 --> 03:47:15.260
click on that, Python environment, no, there is no one, no,

03:47:15.280 --> 03:47:18.820
you will have to create. Okay, there is 3.11, you try 3.11,

03:47:19.080 --> 03:47:22.340
base, yes, try it, okay, conda is also in you, then it will

03:47:22.340 --> 03:47:26.360
be done immediately. So let's run it again. Yes, you do it

03:47:26.360 --> 03:47:29.900
again. No, it is there. No, first run the installation, the

03:47:29.900 --> 03:47:33.900
pip one. Okay, let's install pip first. No, it hasn't

03:47:33.900 --> 03:47:36.220
changed yet, it hasn't been selected yet, your python looks

03:47:36.220 --> 03:47:41.240
like 3.13. From here, the environment is from here. Hmm,

03:47:41.240 --> 03:47:42.840
select another kernel.

03:47:54.050 --> 03:47:57.090
So, sir, after selecting the environment, the code written

03:47:57.090 --> 03:47:59.170
again and again, you will have to go and do it in it, right?

03:47:59.390 --> 03:48:01.930
I mean, basically in the same version, in the same

03:48:01.930 --> 03:48:05.450
environment, everything is installed. So that's why you have

03:48:05.450 --> 03:48:07.410
the option to give a name, right? That you write the name of

03:48:07.410 --> 03:48:11.530
the environment. Okay. So if I select this environment, then

03:48:11.530 --> 03:48:14.210
the same code will run on it again, which is written, right?

03:48:14.370 --> 03:48:16.930
Hmm, hmm, hmm. Now do one thing, download it from your zoom

03:48:16.930 --> 03:48:20.770
app, sign up quickly, we are here. Okay, we take screen

03:48:20.770 --> 03:48:24.290
access and set the environment immediately. It took two

03:48:24.290 --> 03:48:27.390
minutes to do it, okay? Okay, sir. Sir, I wanted to ask one

03:48:27.390 --> 03:48:32.610
more thing. In today's lecture, regarding the position, sir,

03:48:32.610 --> 03:48:34.690
exactly what you were telling, I don't understand. As you

03:48:34.690 --> 03:48:41.330
told 5067. So in that 4D axis, in that particular data, at

03:48:41.330 --> 03:48:45.450
which position will it represent? What is its position? As

03:48:45.450 --> 03:48:50.870
we just wrote 1 comma 2. So 1 comma 2 basically presents the

03:48:50.870 --> 03:48:53.650
position in 2D. That this is a point. The position of this

03:48:53.650 --> 03:48:54.850
point is this much from the x axis and this much from the 2

03:48:54.850 --> 03:48:58.210
axis. Hmm. Now when we were hitting it at the last time, we

03:48:58.210 --> 03:49:00.410
were generating some numbers, right? That the length of this

03:49:00.410 --> 03:49:03.710
is 5067. So this is basically. 1 by 36. Yes. So that is the

03:49:03.710 --> 03:49:05.530
coordinate. That is the coordinate. That is the dimension.

03:49:05.830 --> 03:49:09.410
Means that whole data which was your English sentence, it is

03:49:09.410 --> 03:49:12.650
representing that. Means it has a numerical equivalent. It

03:49:12.650 --> 03:49:14.810
is a semi-data. When we were saying my name is Utanshu

03:49:14.810 --> 03:49:16.690
Kumar. So it is a semi-data. My name is Utanshu Kumar. But

03:49:16.690 --> 03:49:17.510
it is available in numeric value.

03:49:21.200 --> 03:49:23.920
The computer does not understand the text. Okay, it will

03:49:23.920 --> 03:49:26.940
understand. No problem. It will understand. Wait. Just wait

03:49:26.940 --> 03:49:28.520
for a couple of more classes. I don't understand a little

03:49:28.520 --> 03:49:30.280
bit. Understood. Understood. There is a problem in

03:49:30.280 --> 03:49:34.040
fundamentals. Understood. Okay. There is no issue. I

03:49:34.040 --> 03:49:38.020
understood so much that it is representing the point. What

03:49:38.020 --> 03:49:39.840
does that point mean? What does that point mean? Point means

03:49:39.840 --> 03:49:42.600
that it is data. It is a sentence basically. Sentence.

03:49:44.020 --> 03:49:47.380
Sentence has a position, right? No. Not position. Not

03:49:47.380 --> 03:49:51.040
position. Sentence only. If we said there that my name is

03:49:51.040 --> 03:49:54.160
Utanshu Kumar. That sentence happened. Right. Yes. Now we

03:49:54.160 --> 03:49:56.840
have converted that to numerical representation. The data

03:49:56.840 --> 03:49:59.420
you were getting. The numerical vector. Okay. Yes. In the

03:49:59.420 --> 03:50:01.700
vector. Yes. So what is that vector? The vector is my name

03:50:01.700 --> 03:50:05.480
is Utanshu Kumar. Yes. Yes. Okay. So that vector has the

03:50:05.480 --> 03:50:12.220
length. Now if you represent that vector in that number of

03:50:12.220 --> 03:50:17.560
dimension then it is a dot. Yes. Whatever 2D or 3D is what

03:50:17.560 --> 03:50:22.380
it is. It is a dot. Yes. If we talk about this pen tip.

03:50:23.020 --> 03:50:26.080
Okay. So there will be a coordinate of it. 3D coordinate. X

03:50:26.080 --> 03:50:28.900
coordinate. Y coordinate. Z coordinate. Right. But this

03:50:28.900 --> 03:50:32.200
represent is representing a small point. Right. So even

03:50:32.200 --> 03:50:35.440
there, the vector, whether its length or dimension is 1000

03:50:35.440 --> 03:50:38.700
or 2000, it depends on which model we are taking there, but

03:50:38.700 --> 03:50:41.880
it represents a point and what does that point mean? My name

03:50:41.880 --> 03:50:46.900
is Anshu Kumar. Okay, and here, as you were telling some

03:50:46.900 --> 03:50:51.440
models in embedding that this is the length of 0.6 pb, it is

03:50:51.440 --> 03:50:56.140
generating 1067, so if the number of text will increase on

03:50:56.140 --> 03:50:59.480
it, then it will depend on me whether to go to 0.6 pb or 8

03:50:59.480 --> 03:51:03.120
pb. No, no, no, if the number of text is 10000 and the model

03:51:03.120 --> 03:51:06.980
output is giving you 1000, then also it means the same.

03:51:07.060 --> 03:51:11.160
Basically, the text of 10000 words, when you are finally

03:51:11.160 --> 03:51:13.680
embedding it, then you are showing its dimension to it in

03:51:13.680 --> 03:51:18.620
1000. Okay, so that means, if I increase the number of text,

03:51:18.820 --> 03:51:21.740
then there is no problem with that. I mean, which one is

03:51:21.740 --> 03:51:27.920
1024, it is not the number of words, right? No, no, not the

03:51:27.920 --> 03:51:30.260
number of words, you are representing it in a separate unit,

03:51:30.780 --> 03:51:33.900
right? Okay, if you are representing it in a separate unit,

03:51:33.900 --> 03:51:39.260
then the matter does not matter there. I did not understand

03:51:39.260 --> 03:51:42.820
the same parameter that was there. I mean, is it exactly the

03:51:42.820 --> 03:51:45.600
same? No, basically, that is the output of the model. Every

03:51:45.600 --> 03:51:49.140
model has its own length, right? So that is the output of

03:51:49.140 --> 03:51:51.900
that model. But again, your sentence, whether it is big or

03:51:51.900 --> 03:51:54.460
small, does not matter. Whatever sentence you put, put a

03:51:54.460 --> 03:51:57.060
whole book in it, it will always keep the same length for

03:51:57.060 --> 03:52:02.380
that one unit. I mean, you are putting a book or whatever

03:52:02.380 --> 03:52:04.540
you are putting in the model, right? And the capacity of the

03:52:04.540 --> 03:52:06.120
model is to generate that much words or to give that much

03:52:06.120 --> 03:52:10.360
embedding size. So it will try to maintain that. Okay. I

03:52:10.360 --> 03:52:13.160
mean, I think it is its length. So it is fine. It is not the

03:52:13.160 --> 03:52:15.780
length, basically. It is the output of the model. So it will

03:52:15.780 --> 03:52:19.440
always be constant, right? Okay, I will have to understand

03:52:19.440 --> 03:52:23.460
this. I still do not know this. And the best thing will be

03:52:23.460 --> 03:52:25.540
that you do one thing. Okay. Start with my deep learning.

03:52:26.760 --> 03:52:30.760
Okay. You need the basic class of neural network. But now I

03:52:30.760 --> 03:52:32.740
have started a little bit in Python. I am completely

03:52:32.740 --> 03:52:35.900
different in technology. Take your time. We are not saying

03:52:35.900 --> 03:52:38.580
right now. Do it from today. But this whole thing will be

03:52:38.580 --> 03:52:41.620
very clear. It will be very clear when you start from there.

03:52:41.620 --> 03:52:45.660
Because as they are breaking things here, the same things

03:52:45.660 --> 03:52:48.200
have been broken there. Because you just told the

03:52:48.200 --> 03:52:52.020
prerequisite. He is only doing Python in my class. And after

03:52:52.020 --> 03:52:55.360
that, he will write on this. Look, after teaching Python,

03:52:55.360 --> 03:52:58.420
you can move forward without telling all this. Just using

03:52:58.420 --> 03:53:01.260
method and function. But in the class, they always want that

03:53:01.260 --> 03:53:04.720
no. Go a little depth. The ground level is being explained.

03:53:05.080 --> 03:53:06.980
So that's why we are explaining. Otherwise, there was no

03:53:06.980 --> 03:53:13.500
need. Okay. Exactly. Let's call embedding. Python function.

03:53:13.660 --> 03:53:18.880
Now it's done. No, now I understand. Thank you, sir. That's

03:53:18.880 --> 03:53:22.520
how you are explaining. Okay. Okay. Okay. Vector, I

03:53:22.520 --> 03:53:26.920
mentioned he has to look into. Yes, sir. That's true. Uday,

03:53:27.000 --> 03:53:31.920
your question. Yes. Please go ahead. Yeah. Yeah. So, this

03:53:31.920 --> 03:53:35.100
vectors. How do you handle, you know, multiple languages?

03:53:35.240 --> 03:53:38.980
Let's say, my vector is in. Yes. Yes. So, let's say, my

03:53:38.980 --> 03:53:40.940
vector is in Hindi language and if user asked the English

03:53:40.940 --> 03:53:43.800
question. That doesn't depends upon me. Actually, that

03:53:43.800 --> 03:53:45.940
depends upon the model inferencing. So, let's suppose my

03:53:45.940 --> 03:53:48.360
model understands my model has been trained on a

03:53:48.360 --> 03:53:51.280
multilingual data. Right. For example, chat GPT. So,

03:53:51.300 --> 03:53:53.120
obviously, it's a multilingual model. It can understand

03:53:53.120 --> 03:53:57.100
multiple languages. Right. So, whenever you try to send any

03:53:57.100 --> 03:54:00.540
kind of data, raw data, I would say. So, first of all, you

03:54:00.540 --> 03:54:02.820
try to identify that. Okay. Fine. So, which language it is.

03:54:02.900 --> 03:54:06.100
And that is possible with the help of a small one word of

03:54:06.100 --> 03:54:08.640
NLP library. So, it will be able to identify the languages.

03:54:08.780 --> 03:54:12.740
Now, accordingly, it will try to switch. No. But in the case

03:54:12.740 --> 03:54:15.420
of embeddings and similarities, such how it works across

03:54:15.420 --> 03:54:20.020
languages. See, by default, let's suppose my model has been

03:54:20.020 --> 03:54:22.640
trained on only on English and I'm trying to pass something

03:54:22.640 --> 03:54:26.740
in Hindi, it will be able to give me embeddings. But it will

03:54:26.740 --> 03:54:30.840
be a bad one. Okay. Because see, best embedding means what?

03:54:30.980 --> 03:54:32.760
Best embedding doesn't mean that I'm just looking for

03:54:32.760 --> 03:54:36.480
number. Best embedding simply means that, that as per my

03:54:36.480 --> 03:54:40.380
data set, I have to select a particular model, which has

03:54:40.380 --> 03:54:43.860
been trained on similar data, so that it will be able to

03:54:43.860 --> 03:54:46.400
understand the syntactic, semantic, grammatical, each and

03:54:46.400 --> 03:54:49.940
everything. Right. Otherwise, see, if I don't have to even

03:54:49.940 --> 03:54:53.620
go and use an embedding to convert some data into a

03:54:53.620 --> 03:54:58.420
numerical space, I can use a TF-IDF. Yeah. Right. I can use

03:54:58.420 --> 03:55:00.840
a TF-IDF. No need to train the model. No need to use the

03:55:00.840 --> 03:55:03.460
transformer. But again, we know that the TF-IDF never

03:55:03.460 --> 03:55:05.540
understand the semantic syntactic, right. It never

03:55:05.540 --> 03:55:07.460
understands the grammatical understanding. It just

03:55:07.460 --> 03:55:10.780
understand the frequency of occurrences. Into the data. So

03:55:10.780 --> 03:55:14.840
the purpose of building a embedding is very simple. A kind

03:55:14.840 --> 03:55:19.620
of a, like a, I have to use a model which understands my

03:55:19.620 --> 03:55:24.500
type of the data in a better way. Got it. Otherwise you will

03:55:24.500 --> 03:55:27.600
end up generating embeddings and then in a search, it will

03:55:27.600 --> 03:55:32.080
crash. Yeah. Got it. Got it. Yeah. Thanks. Thank you. Yeah.

03:55:32.780 --> 03:55:36.540
Okay. Next one, please. Uday, I think you have pinged me. I

03:55:36.540 --> 03:55:40.460
just sent you a request, but the relevance is very low. I

03:55:40.460 --> 03:55:44.740
will search on the basis of the keyboard. I will do the

03:55:44.740 --> 03:55:50.580
elastic. Uday, you unmute yourself. I think you have an

03:55:50.580 --> 03:55:50.760
option.

03:55:54.440 --> 03:55:57.380
Armaan, you have a question? Yeah. Armaan. Yeah. Armaan.

03:55:57.420 --> 03:56:00.860
Please go ahead. Sir, I am getting the 3-point version

03:56:00.860 --> 03:56:03.720
error. I have created the environment also with the version.

03:56:03.760 --> 03:56:06.280
Can you fix that, please? Yeah. Sure. Sure. Share the

03:56:06.280 --> 03:56:08.400
screen. I'll check. Okay. So, I am getting the 3-point

03:56:08.400 --> 03:56:08.400
version error.

03:56:14.620 --> 03:56:17.400
Ganesh is telling me could you please add the last

03:56:17.400 --> 03:56:19.860
assignment on a resource section Ganesh it's already added

03:56:19.860 --> 03:56:23.000
last week itself so last week class I have already added it

03:56:23.000 --> 03:56:28.320
I remember it's there sir can I share now yeah you can share

03:56:28.320 --> 03:56:28.640
please

03:56:38.320 --> 03:56:43.240
yes it is visible let me take a screen control okay so I

03:56:43.240 --> 03:56:46.560
have requested if you can give me control what is the issue

03:56:46.560 --> 03:56:50.320
that you are facing so running itself with the requires okay

03:56:50.320 --> 03:56:53.940
require IP and kernel package right execute it and then it

03:56:53.940 --> 03:56:58.920
will install automatically no module name request so pip

03:56:58.920 --> 03:57:05.380
install INS T-A-L-L R-E-Q-U E-S-T-S execute

03:57:11.060 --> 03:57:21.600
in pip P-I-P INS T-A-L-L R-E-Q-U R-E-Q-U E-S T-S yeah

03:57:21.600 --> 03:57:22.380
spelling is fine

03:57:25.820 --> 03:57:27.580
you're using python itself right

03:57:48.380 --> 03:57:50.720
hmm it's done no

03:57:56.000 --> 03:57:58.860
model and numpy okay fine okay

03:58:21.700 --> 03:58:24.200
so this one is also done hmm

03:58:28.030 --> 03:58:32.230
hmm fine everything is working now you can check your

03:58:32.230 --> 03:58:33.790
embeddings this

03:58:38.530 --> 03:58:43.190
is the embedding right for this data so yeah everything is

03:58:43.190 --> 03:58:46.870
working now so one more thing it is a follow-up session that

03:58:46.870 --> 03:58:50.350
you just explained to the regarding the vector spaces so

03:58:50.350 --> 03:58:54.570
let's say I have I have two sentences sentence b so both of

03:58:54.570 --> 03:58:58.570
them when we bring in vector inside 153C dimension and

03:58:58.950 --> 03:59:03.630
whenever the user sends the query it will try to find a

03:59:03.630 --> 03:59:06.590
similarity between there too the query will be also in their

03:59:06.590 --> 03:59:09.410
dimension we write yeah so first of all whenever you're

03:59:09.410 --> 03:59:12.370
sending a query so you have to use the same embedding models

03:59:12.370 --> 03:59:16.550
to convert query because textual information and to our

03:59:16.550 --> 03:59:19.550
numerical information it will not be able to do a comparison

03:59:19.550 --> 03:59:22.870
right So it should be available into numeric to numeric. So

03:59:22.870 --> 03:59:25.990
query, put it into the embedding models. You will get the

03:59:25.990 --> 03:59:29.750
vector and then vector to vector match. You do it. So it is

03:59:29.750 --> 03:59:32.490
like the same concept that we use in linear regression and

03:59:32.490 --> 03:59:36.910
we found the best fit line. So then no linear regression is

03:59:36.910 --> 03:59:41.270
a different concept as a concept where we go online. No, no,

03:59:41.270 --> 03:59:43.790
no, not at all. So in case of a linear relations, generally

03:59:43.790 --> 03:59:47.870
we try to like a back propagate with M and a value of C by

03:59:47.870 --> 03:59:53.170
the way. It is not at all same, not even close also can you

03:59:53.170 --> 03:59:57.430
go on the vector where you copy the model 23 something I

03:59:57.430 --> 03:59:58.490
want to understand one thing.

03:59:58.490 --> 04:00:04.250
ok. So, let me open up your system itself, I will do it in

04:00:04.250 --> 04:00:11.150
your system hugging face go here and

04:00:13.680 --> 04:00:15.760
go to the model embed

04:00:18.860 --> 04:00:23.780
coin 3 right. Yes sir. Yeah. So, here is the one tell me

04:00:23.780 --> 04:00:29.880
now. So, this is about thisparameters type. So, you told

04:00:29.880 --> 04:00:34.420
that the context length is the that can be input also that

04:00:34.420 --> 04:00:37.680
what we are giving and the length what we are expecting from

04:00:37.680 --> 04:00:41.280
modern sequence length that they are described it is for

04:00:41.280 --> 04:00:44.880
output one or the input one combined. So, output one in

04:00:44.880 --> 04:00:47.480
general people try to give it to you that okay. So, this

04:00:47.480 --> 04:00:50.960
will be able to do this much of inferencing generally for

04:00:50.960 --> 04:00:53.360
some of the model they try to give you input context length

04:00:53.360 --> 04:00:55.720
as well as output condition both that okay fine. So, this is

04:00:55.720 --> 04:00:58.800
the maximum context you can try to pass to my model and this

04:00:58.800 --> 04:01:00.760
is the maximum which I will be able to give you as an

04:01:00.760 --> 04:01:04.860
output. So, let's say if the model has a 4k context right

04:01:04.860 --> 04:01:08.560
and I passed 8k input length. So, the model will convert

04:01:08.560 --> 04:01:12.160
that 8k into the 4k. No, it will break it down into chunks.

04:01:13.260 --> 04:01:16.620
But the length will be in the output that will be related to

04:01:16.620 --> 04:01:20.620
4k only. If a model output is 4k then it will be 4k but

04:01:20.620 --> 04:01:23.400
generally when we try to deploy the model. So, we try to

04:01:23.400 --> 04:01:27.300
follow the concept of streaming over there right. So, 4k and

04:01:27.300 --> 04:01:29.400
then 4k and then 4k. So, it will keep on generating the

04:01:29.400 --> 04:01:29.840
output. So, it will keep on generating the output. So, in

04:01:29.840 --> 04:01:32.820
this way we feel like model context is high but technically

04:01:32.820 --> 04:01:38.750
it's a 4k output which I am getting. So, the streaming part

04:01:38.750 --> 04:01:42.370
is a bit controllable. Sorry. The streaming part is

04:01:42.370 --> 04:01:45.850
controllable. Okay. See, let's suppose you are looking for

04:01:45.850 --> 04:01:49.050
8k context right and but model is giving you 4k. So, it will

04:01:49.050 --> 04:01:51.990
give you 4k twice simple but I will try to configure that

04:01:51.990 --> 04:01:54.410
interface in such a way that you will feel like it's giving

04:01:54.410 --> 04:01:58.130
me 8k but technically it's giving me 4k. So, regardless of

04:01:58.130 --> 04:02:03.210
the input we pass we can expect the output. If you are

04:02:03.210 --> 04:02:05.530
configuring it depends upon the configuration but originally

04:02:05.530 --> 04:02:11.350
model is giving you 4k. Okay. And sir one more thing with

04:02:11.350 --> 04:02:15.010
higher the embed dimension and embedding dimension higher

04:02:15.010 --> 04:02:19.110
the accuracy is that something? No, not at all. So, yeah you

04:02:19.110 --> 04:02:22.210
will be able to get a more space but it depends upon a

04:02:22.210 --> 04:02:24.270
training of the model as well that which model you are using

04:02:24.270 --> 04:02:29.590
and what is you know the total like a data which is like

04:02:29.590 --> 04:02:33.210
been used to train that particular model. It depends more on

04:02:33.210 --> 04:02:37.190
that side less on higher dimension. Yes, dimension plays a

04:02:37.190 --> 04:02:41.050
role. So, if I am using more dimension means I am trying to

04:02:41.050 --> 04:02:44.710
do more explanation about the data. My data I am just trying

04:02:44.710 --> 04:02:47.550
to create the embeddings but this embedding is more

04:02:47.550 --> 04:02:50.490
explanatory if it is more explanatory. So, when I will try

04:02:50.490 --> 04:02:53.150
to do a similarity search it will be able to work in a

04:02:53.150 --> 04:02:56.250
better way right. It will be able to do a more accurate

04:02:56.250 --> 04:03:01.150
similarity search operation that is true but first all data

04:03:01.150 --> 04:03:06.610
by the way. In that way like how we train how we practice

04:03:06.610 --> 04:03:08.830
ourselves the more on the particular tag then we get

04:03:08.830 --> 04:03:11.990
familiar that in that particular way we can expect from the

04:03:11.990 --> 04:03:16.090
model also that the number of at times we train the model

04:03:16.090 --> 04:03:19.730
then we can expect a particular output in that. Exactly,

04:03:19.730 --> 04:03:23.270
exactly. Higher dimension plays an important role plays a

04:03:23.270 --> 04:03:25.410
significant role and it will give you the better output

04:03:25.410 --> 04:03:29.210
higher and higher if you are using a dimension but if

04:03:29.210 --> 04:03:31.270
someone is going to ask you to do a similarity search you

04:03:31.270 --> 04:03:33.870
will immediately get into a so instead of giving a direct

04:03:33.870 --> 04:03:36.470
answer right like you have asked me a question that higher

04:03:36.470 --> 04:03:38.750
dimension will give me more accurate result in terms of

04:03:38.750 --> 04:03:40.770
similarity search. So, instead of giving you the straight

04:03:40.770 --> 04:03:45.070
answer I will try to give answer in this way. So, same thing

04:03:45.070 --> 04:03:46.030
you should do in an interview.

04:03:50.950 --> 04:03:55.930
So, depending on the embedding dimension. So, let's say we

04:03:55.930 --> 04:04:02.470
have a huge amount of data and we are. decide that we can

04:04:02.470 --> 04:04:06.330
choose higher dimension. No, no. So, basically see I will

04:04:06.330 --> 04:04:08.630
not decide based on the higher dimension lower dimension. I

04:04:08.630 --> 04:04:12.490
will decide based on the model knowledge basically. My first

04:04:12.490 --> 04:04:15.870
criteria will always be a knowledge of the model right not

04:04:15.870 --> 04:04:18.530
on a higher lower dimension. I will try to take I am okay

04:04:18.530 --> 04:04:20.730
with thousand dimension because that is more than enough to

04:04:20.730 --> 04:04:25.030
represent any data right and that too on a wider space. So,

04:04:25.130 --> 04:04:27.510
that is more than enough for me but yeah I will go after the

04:04:27.510 --> 04:04:33.830
model. Okay. If it is like a two year old model I will not

04:04:33.830 --> 04:04:36.170
use it right because I know that the knowledge of the model

04:04:36.170 --> 04:04:42.370
is very less. So, the end point will be like the how my data

04:04:42.370 --> 04:04:45.690
is getting converted into vector accurately by model which

04:04:45.690 --> 04:04:49.050
is a perfect thing. See every model will be able to convert

04:04:49.050 --> 04:04:52.010
your data because every model can understand but it's more

04:04:52.010 --> 04:04:55.870
about the relation. You are using transformer model to

04:04:55.870 --> 04:04:58.690
convert something into embedding but with relation

04:04:58.690 --> 04:05:02.390
understanding. Right. So, more knowledge of a model will be

04:05:02.390 --> 04:05:05.350
able to build a better relation and less hallucination.

04:05:05.650 --> 04:05:08.410
Right otherwise I can I could have used a TF-IDF itself

04:05:08.410 --> 04:05:12.750
right. I could have used one hot encoding itself to convert

04:05:12.750 --> 04:05:17.350
my data into a numeric value. One hot encoding TF-IDF all

04:05:17.350 --> 04:05:20.290
these approaches are already there right. We try to study it

04:05:20.290 --> 04:05:23.170
from machine learning classes or stats classes itself. That

04:05:23.170 --> 04:05:25.570
okay fine so TF-IDF and convert any kind of a textual

04:05:25.570 --> 04:05:28.470
information into a numerical information. But I know I can

04:05:28.470 --> 04:05:30.890
do it but it is not going to work well for me because I am

04:05:30.890 --> 04:05:32.130
not sure. I'm not catching a relationship between the

04:05:32.130 --> 04:05:36.170
textual information. Yeah. What to vector again, what to

04:05:36.170 --> 04:05:38.630
vector is the next step. So some Rakesh is saying what to

04:05:38.630 --> 04:05:41.030
vector, what to vector is again, a small neural network

04:05:41.030 --> 04:05:45.090
night, at least better than TF IDF and other old approaches

04:05:45.090 --> 04:05:50.010
by the way, but it's still like a, I'm not going to give you

04:05:50.010 --> 04:05:55.490
a benefit. As you said, we can configure the modern context

04:05:55.490 --> 04:05:58.710
lens as per our requirements. So you got to figure out the

04:05:58.710 --> 04:06:01.430
model context length. Once model has been trained, you can

04:06:01.430 --> 04:06:04.450
do it while training the model, while creating a model

04:06:04.450 --> 04:06:08.970
architecture, uh, at that point of time, after that, you can

04:06:08.970 --> 04:06:12.590
try to configure it as a streaming that, okay, fine. So do

04:06:12.590 --> 04:06:15.870
one loop, then another loop, then third loop in this way,

04:06:15.950 --> 04:06:20.710
you can configure it. So this code and similarity distance

04:06:20.710 --> 04:06:25.010
and management systems, when the distance, the full distance

04:06:25.010 --> 04:06:28.330
look around and Manhattan. And the code on similarity that

04:06:28.330 --> 04:06:32.350
is used to compare the data. Similarity itself is a

04:06:32.350 --> 04:06:34.810
distance. Metrics are different. This is a metric set in

04:06:34.810 --> 04:06:36.970
itself. It's not a collision. It's not a Manhattan. Both are

04:06:36.970 --> 04:06:40.630
different. The three, the three distance that we have that

04:06:40.630 --> 04:06:46.930
we have deciding that, which will give me the actual output

04:06:46.930 --> 04:06:49.770
when this comes into the picture, no, it depends upon the

04:06:49.770 --> 04:06:51.910
database. Some database provide you all three options so

04:06:51.910 --> 04:06:53.990
that whenever you are sending a query, you can pass that as

04:06:53.990 --> 04:06:57.050
a parameter that use this. This is a metric says, and some

04:06:57.050 --> 04:06:59.610
databases don't even provide you those like inputs. They

04:06:59.610 --> 04:07:01.530
just use it. Co-sign by the way, or maybe hybrid.

04:07:04.570 --> 04:07:07.230
You have a control to pass as a parameter with some

04:07:07.230 --> 04:07:11.110
databases. So with FAI SS, so they are giving you that, but

04:07:11.110 --> 04:07:16.550
some will not give you that also will depend on model. Not

04:07:16.550 --> 04:07:21.530
like they have wide will depend upon the model conversion of

04:07:21.530 --> 04:07:25.070
the data only depends upon the model similarity comparison.

04:07:25.490 --> 04:07:29.750
How it is going to depend on the model. Never. I have two

04:07:29.750 --> 04:07:33.030
vector, right? I have two coordinates. I'm doing the

04:07:33.030 --> 04:07:36.450
comparison. So how model is coming into a picture model will

04:07:36.450 --> 04:07:38.650
come into a picture only till creating this two vector, two

04:07:38.650 --> 04:07:46.410
points in any dimension. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Fine. Then I

04:07:46.410 --> 04:07:49.610
think we are done with all the questions. There is no

04:07:49.610 --> 04:07:53.150
question left for me. Uh, so with that, thank you so much,

04:07:53.210 --> 04:07:55.690
everyone. Take care. See you again, uh, tomorrow, same time,

04:07:55.730 --> 04:07:59.370
9 PM, sorry, 9 AM. I see. So take care of your own. Thank

04:07:59.370 --> 04:07:59.530
you.
