WEBVTT

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.600
Okay, everyone. So good morning. I think I'm audible and

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.420
visible to all of you. So we are going to start a class in

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.080
next two, three minutes. Yeah, so it's 9.03. So maybe by 9

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.000
.05, 9.06. So we are going to start with the class. So till

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.560
then, just wait. I'm looking at your chat. So good morning,

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.780
everyone. And happy Sunday to all of you. Okay, so we'll

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.720
start in two to three minutes. So let other people join and

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.400
then we will start with the discussion. Okay,

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.440
so everyone, good morning once again. So I think we are

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.880
ready, right guys? Everyone? Yeah, shall we start with the

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:08.520
class? Yes? Okay, fine. So yesterday we were talking about

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.160
an API. So those who have not joined my yesterday's class,

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.320
so you can try to go through a lecture. So lectures are

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.720
already available inside your dashboard. Materials are

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.660
already available. Assignment is also available for my

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.040
yesterday's class. So anyone, anyone who have missed my

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.880
yesterday's class, so please go through that. So I will be

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.100
doing a particular lecture. And yeah, so you all are welcome

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.900
in terms of asking any kind of a question with respect to

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.740
even a previous of previous of previous class. I don't have

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.700
any kind of issues. So feel free to ask me a question in a

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.720
doubt clearing section, which is going to happen after this

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.200
live classes. I believe we all know the rituals, right? So

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.200
we all know how do we conduct the classes. So two hour I'm

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.120
going to discuss and two hour we all are going to discuss,

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.120
right? So yesterday guys, I was talking about, basically, an

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:00.480
API and hopefully most of us are able to understand the core

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.360
philosophy, a core logic behind an API that what technically

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.800
a meaning of an API is, and like how API is going to work,

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.340
how with the help of fast API framework, we can try to

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:19.560
create an API, a get API and a post API. Plus, we were able

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.800
to even test it with respect to a call with respect to a

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.700
browser and with respect to a post. And so we have used

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.300
postman, we were able to test it, we have used browser, we

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:33.240
were able to test it and we have used basically a curl

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.720
command and we were able to test our API not today. So what

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.900
we are going to do. So today we are going to extend a same

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:45.240
lecture and there are two more method, a popular one, one is

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.780
a put method, which has been used for update option. And

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.780
another one is a delete method, which has been used to

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.840
delete a data. So we are going to talk about those two

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:59.260
methods. And after that, what we are going to do, so we are

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:04.080
going to productionize. We are going to deploy the API. So

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.400
yesterday we were running each and everything in a local

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.840
host. And then with the help of this ng-rock, so we have

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.260
basically done a port forwarding. So whatever is running in

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.180
my local host, let's forward it to some other port, which is

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.840
a global one on HTTPS. This is something that we have done

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.740
with respect to ng-rock. But today, what we can do, we can

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:27.500
try to do a deployment over a cloud, a backend deployment,

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.460
right, a backend deployment. We can try to do over the cloud

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.020
and then back to back, back to back. We are going to test

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.540
it. So it's not going to be very different. So we were using

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:39.160
a local host and call and port number in a similar manner. I

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.980
will be able to get an URL because now we understand that

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.120
what is a technically meaning of API is so meaning of API is

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.140
very simple. Like this URL is helping me out to reach out to

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.900
the particular system. And then route is helping me out to

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.640
go to the particular method, which is running in a

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.760
particular system. This is what we understand as a layman in

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.800
terms of API. So this is something that we are going to do

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.440
it guys. And then I'm going to introduce testing of URI API

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.200
as well. So we have so many models and we have already

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.400
exposed that models with the help of APIs. So we have a text

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.120
to speech model. We have an image generation model. We have

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.820
a chat completion model. We have a streaming model with us.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.280
We have an embedding model with us and like it's a complete

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.740
model base. You will be able to find out or you can say a

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.200
complete model store that we have already created and all of

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.080
these models are available to all of us 24 by 7, which we

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.060
are going to use it. So today I'm going to show you even

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:41.200
those testing but I believe now you will be able to do it

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.380
but still it's my responsibility to show you that how URI

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:48.220
API ecosystem you will be able to access because again from

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.260
next class onwards, we will start using those API ecosystem

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.200
because in a next class, so let's suppose if I'm going to

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:58.780
talk about a vector database. So where Farsi pinecone chroma

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:02.220
DB Baviot quadrant all of these things comes into a picture.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.240
So at that point of time, we will start using a embedding

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.140
APIs. We'll talk about that in the next class. But yeah, in

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.980
today's class, I believe agenda is clear. Right guys,

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:16.490
everyone. Yeah, agenda is clear for today's class. What we

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:19.270
are going to discuss what we are going to do. Yep. Okay

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:22.470
guys, fine. So open up your laptop, open up your system and

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:26.690
let's get started. Fine. And in case of any kind of a

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:30.370
question, feel free to ask me a question like a now or maybe

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:34.430
like after the class, it's completely okay with me. I don't

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.770
have any kind of a issue in terms of solving your problems.

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:43.190
I missed yesterday's class, not an issue at all. If you have

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:46.410
missed yesterday's class, it's completely okay. Recordings

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:49.110
are already available. So you can feel free to go through a

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:53.010
recording and ask me a doubt. And you can ask me a doubt

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:55.910
guys from any of these classes like even from the previous

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.830
classes. You can ask me a doubt. I don't have any issue

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:00.530
because I know some of you will go through a lecture. Some

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:03.710
of you will go through a recording maybe in a later stage.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:06.330
So obviously when you will go through a recording, then you

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:11.010
will be having a doubts and just ask. So, okay, let me those

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:15.070
who have joined for the very first time. So guys, this is

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:19.310
your batch technically and this is a place from where you

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:23.810
will be able to join your lectures, right? And here is a

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:26.650
second August lecture. Then third August lecture. Then this

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.490
is the studies lecture and today's lecture will be available

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:34.490
after completion of this entire session, maybe like by

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:36.910
evening by evening. It will be available not before evening

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:39.910
because it takes time for us to, you know, process the video

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:43.610
and then upload the video and all of these resources. So

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:46.110
whatever I have discussed in a class, all of these resources

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:49.530
are already available. So whether it's a code or maybe it's

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:52.630
something which I have written on my scribble ink, right or

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:56.670
so anything, anything. Which I discuss, I keep on uploading

00:11:56.670 --> 00:12:00.030
all of those resources inside your dashboard so that at any

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:02.670
point of a time you will be able to go through it and you

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.710
will be able to download and you will be able to use it and

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:08.190
everything will be in a single place as simple as that.

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:14.550
Okay, so that's just a recap of this lecture. Now open up

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:19.830
your VS code guys. Yeah, open up your VS code and let's

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:23.770
start creating some of the API. So file open folder.

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:31.990
And here, so baby, I can try to create a folder called as

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:35.950
API, API underscore testing.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.660
Okay, so just create a folder just like we have created a

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.700
folder studies, right? So yesterday we did the same thing,

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:53.680
exact same thing. So here we can try to create a file called

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:59.760
as testing dot pi file. Okay, so let's create one testing

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.400
dot pi file. And now let's start writing a code for put and

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:07.380
for delete. So would I continue with this if I have missed

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:10.640
the studies class? Yeah, I believe you should, but it will

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.600
be better if you can like, you know, go through the previous

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.440
lecture because lectures will be dependent, right? Because

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.900
whatever I have discussed in my studies class, obviously

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:23.300
I'll be using those things even in my like a today's class.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:30.270
So fine guys, let's

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:36.400
start a coding. So today, as I told you that, we are going

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.220
to talk about basically put and delete, right? So put and

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.280
delete is another method. You all will be able to find out

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:46.020
put means basically update operation. So let's suppose we

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:50.060
have a data, we have a record and I would like to like

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:54.300
update those records. So in that case, I can try to send a

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:59.280
request as a put request. And second option is, so let's

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.620
suppose if I have to basically delete some of the record. So

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:07.160
in that case, I will try to send a delete request as simple

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:11.340
as that. So put means update, delete means delete. And I

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.940
believe we all understand meaning of get and like a post

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.040
basically. So get means getting a data in general. But yeah,

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:22.060
the difference between get and post is, so you will be able

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:27.480
to send a get request with open data or everyone will be

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.940
able to see a data. Post means you are sending some of the

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:34.400
data in a body as simple as that. Okay. So now here, so let

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:41.040
me try to do a import. So from fast API, import fast API.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:45.380
This is something that we have to do. And then from

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:52.260
Pydentic, P-Y-D-N-T-I-C, Pydentic. So import base model. So

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
we are trying to import two things over here guys. So one is

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:59.820
a fast API and another one is a Pydentic. Why we are using a

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:01.920
Pydentic? So I believe we all are aware about this

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.480
particular things. Let me ping you this in a chat. These two

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.720
imports. So now it's available in your chat as well. So here

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.240
we are trying to use a Pydentic because Pydentic will be

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.600
used for a data validation. So whenever we are sending a

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:18.360
data, it will try to validate it with the help of Pydentic

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.720
class. So this is a nomenclature. This is something that we

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:25.980
try to follow inside a fast API. And nowadays it's very

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.320
normal. Nowadays it's very normal in all Pythonic framework.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.220
So whenever you will go through even a langchain or Lama

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:35.440
index or even a crew AI, so which is going to help you out

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:39.100
in terms of creating an agent. Almost everyone is following

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.780
a Pydentic. Almost everyone is following Pydentic. So going

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.780
forward also, we will be able to see such kind of things a

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:49.960
lot. A lot means literally a lot. So here for a data

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.900
validation, we are going to use it. Means whatever data type

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.740
that you are going to define or whatever ranges of data you

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.280
will be able to define. So Pydentic will be able to validate

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:03.760
beforehand. Now, so we are able to import these two things.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.920
Now let's try to create a variable of fast API. So that's

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.820
cool. We have done that. This is nothing but variable or you

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:14.360
can say object of fast API class. We are able to create,

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:18.040
which is going to help me out to expose anything as an API

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:22.640
to anyone. Okay. Now, so I'm going to talk about, first of

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.100
all, a put method, right? Put means update. Put means update

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.360
basically. So what we are going to do? We are going to

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.740
update by the way. So we need some sort of a data, right? So

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.860
if we have to update something, obviously I need a data.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:40.880
Unless and only I don't have a data, what I'm going to

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.920
update. So there is a possibility that data is available

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.400
into a database, right? Maybe data is available in some of

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:52.000
the file system, or maybe I can try to create a data over

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.880
here itself. So let's suppose I'm creating a user DB, just a

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.860
dummy data I'm going to create over here. So let's do in

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:04.180
this way. So user DB and here. So I have a record. So maybe

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:11.080
I have user ID one and for that. So maybe I have a name. So

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:17.020
maybe I have a name over here and name is equals to, let's

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:22.520
suppose Sudhanshu fine. And age is mine. Age is not like 20,

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:26.560
but yeah, let's keep it 30. So a Sudhanshu, a name

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.760
Sudhanshu, age is 30. Fine. Then there is a second user and

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:36.340
I'm going to keep it as a second user. And let's suppose

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:44.020
second user name is Amarendra. And again, name is not

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:47.020
Amarendra. So this one fine.

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:55.330
Age is this. Now the third user, I can try to pick Mustafa.

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:59.510
I can see his name in a chat. So

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.040
name is basically Mustafa.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.840
Fine. So these are the record which I have created. So let's

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.440
suppose these are the sample record that we have taken.

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:18.320
Yeah, the other sample record that we have taken over here

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:22.580
and we will try to update these records. Yes, we will try to

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:25.320
update this record. So as you can see, these records are

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.440
nothing. It's just a in a dictionary format. I'm trying to

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.640
hold a data in a key and value format. I'm trying to hold a

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:35.580
data simple, right? So we have basically a key. Let's

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:38.940
suppose this is the ID and then this is a value. This entire

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.480
dictionary is a value now inside this dictionary. Again, we

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.800
have a key and a value key and a value pair. So this style,

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:48.980
I'm trying to keep a data over here. Maybe you must be

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:51.580
having a dictionary inside a dictionary inside a dictionary.

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:54.900
Depends, right? Depends. So it's up to you how you are

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.360
keeping your data, how you are holding your data. So you

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.220
will be having a complete control over to it. But yeah, I'm

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:04.060
just going to take this very, very simple, a sample data and

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:08.500
maybe I'll try to update this data with the help of this put

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:11.020
request, right? With the help of this put request, I'll try

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:16.940
to update the data. Fine. Why you did not use a copilot for

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:20.840
auto completion? I'll use it. Don't worry. So in the future,

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:25.240
I'll use it. I think it's you guys are very, very new with

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.700
respect to like, you know, copilot and code auto completion.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:32.160
So if I'll start using it, I can do a coding in 30 seconds,

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.020
but with the same speed, you will not be able to understand.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:40.120
So we'll try to, you know, uh, spend some time together so

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.640
that we will be able to learn the basics. And once we'll be

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.020
able to learn the basic, believe me in a project, I'm not

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.120
going to write a line by line code because it will be a 10

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.780
,000 line of a project, right? Then obviously I will be

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:57.860
using a complete AI. Fine. So initially I'll go slow. Don't

00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:02.440
worry. Uh, because I know like, uh, uh, unless and until we

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.180
don't, we are not coming on the same page, it will be very

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:09.240
difficult for us to, you know, uh, grasp a concept. Fine.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.400
Yeah. So this is like, this is the style I used to follow in

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.520
all the classes. So nothing new. You will get used to it

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:22.360
very soon. Okay. So here I'm able to create a data, right?

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.740
For some of you, I know it will, it will look, look boring

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.860
because you will say that, okay, so in two hours, so we are

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:32.120
like, you know, covering a very small amount of a concept.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.780
That's okay because going forward. So we are going to pick

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:36.300
up the pace.

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:51.480
Okay. Now. So here we have a user data, right? Use the data

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.320
that we have already created. Now we have to update this

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.680
data. So obviously to update this data, I'm going to use a

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.960
put method. Yeah. I'm going to use basically a put method.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.340
Uh, so obviously I'm going to like, uh, create a function

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:07.460
and that function will update my data. And that function,

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:10.900
I'm going to eventually open it up as an API, because this

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.180
is the meaning of API. This is something that we understand

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:17.540
as an API, right? So we are going to create a function over

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:21.180
here. So let's suppose I'm going to write down that def, uh,

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.800
user, uh,

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:29.820
user, underscore update. So maybe this is a function which

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:34.580
I'm going to create. And, uh, again, so when I'm trying to

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:37.660
update a user, right? Whenever I'm trying to update the

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:41.520
user, so obviously I have to pass a value that which user I

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.840
would like to update. Maybe user number one, maybe user

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.720
number two, maybe user number three, right? So I have to

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.900
pass those values that, okay, so user number one, I would

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.340
like to update user number two. I would like to update. And

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:56.560
then I have to pass our updated data as well. Both. Yes,

00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:01.100
both. So here as a parameter, I can say that that, okay, so

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:05.060
I'm going to pass user ID as a integer, let's suppose. And

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:10.560
then I'm going to pass a user data now. So as fast API is

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.780
going to follow up, I didn't take by intake means via our

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:17.820
identity class. You have to route a data. So before this,

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:21.000
before this, before writing this particular function, so you

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
have to create a class, let's suppose so that it will be

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.420
able to take a data. It will be able to do a data

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:29.940
validation. So I have a class class called as user. You can

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.840
try to give any other name and then I'm trying to inherit a

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.380
base model so that it will be able to, to get all the

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:38.240
property of the base model class up. Identity class, right?

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.800
So here we have a user and inside this user. So let's

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:46.220
suppose we have a name and name should be available as a

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.720
string. And then we have a age and age should be available

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.860
as a integer. So we have basically a name, right? We have

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:55.880
basically a name and we have age. We have name. We have age.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.860
Only these two data that we have, right? So we are looking

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:02.440
for a validation only for these two data set. Very simple.

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:06.680
Okay. So here I have created this particular function. I'm

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.440
trying to create this function update function, right? What

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:13.080
update function will do? So it needs user ID means which ID

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.760
I have to update and then against that I need this data.

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:19.580
Yeah, I need this data. Then only I will be able to update,

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.240
right? Let's suppose if I'm trying to update ID number two,

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.560
so I need a data that okay, fine. So what is the new data?

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:28.140
This is the old data, right? This is the old data. So what

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.280
will be the new data for user ID two? So that data also I

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.820
have to pass. Now that data I can try to pass via pidentic

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:38.160
class. Very simple, right? Via pidentic class I can try to

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:42.380
pass this particular data. So user, so user is like user

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:45.520
data is coming from where? So my pidentic class, capital U

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:48.480
that I have created. This pidentic class means validate it,

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.520
pass it. Simple. And this pidentic class is taking what?

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:55.160
Name and age. And this name and age. Yes, this name and age

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:59.220
is required inside my data set. As simple as that. Okay. So

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:03.080
here, uh, we will try to pass an ID that which one to update

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:07.800
and then the equivalent data set for that particular ID. Now

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:11.960
here inside this, we can try to keep a check. We can write

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.940
maybe if kind of a statement that if user ID exists, do

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:20.560
this. If user ID doesn't exist, do that. Simple, right? So

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:25.060
here we can try to write that if user ID user ID in the user

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:30.000
DB, this data set, if user ID is in user DB, then try to,

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:35.420
basically update a user DB for that particular user ID with

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:38.180
this data. Whatever data that you are getting means we are

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:40.660
getting a data from here, right? So we are trying to extract

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:44.680
those data and against that ID we are going to update it and

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.280
then return your message that, okay, so I have updated like

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:52.860
a user updated successfully and maybe you can try to return

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:55.300
whatever message you want. So we are returning a message

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:58.260
that user updated successfully with this particular data

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:01.260
with this particular, like a user ID with this particular

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:04.560
user ID. So it has been updated. So this is something that

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.080
we are trying to do. Hope this makes sense to all of us,

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:11.860
right? So based on this particular condition, if this is not

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:14.620
going to happen, right? If this is not going to happen, so

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.900
maybe you can try to write a else statement or maybe you can

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:22.140
try to write just a parallel return over here that do this.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:27.220
So else return a message user not found. So whatever user ID

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:30.560
that you are trying to enter, that user doesn't even exist.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:34.080
And if user doesn't exist, what I will do, I should not

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:37.780
append any new data, right? I should always update it. So

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:41.480
this is a very simple and plain function. So which is going

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:45.280
to update my data set, right? This is going to update my

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:49.700
data set. Now I have to expose this function, right? I have

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.240
to expose this function so that from any programming

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:55.640
language from any other framework, you all will be able to

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:59.500
access it. And I think we know the drill. Over here, right?

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:05.600
So how I will be able to expose? Yes, guys. Yes, I believe

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.260
we all understand, right? We all know how we can expose it.

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:11.360
So this is the simple function which is going to work here

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:14.780
in this program, right? But let's suppose I have to make it

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.440
like I expose to the entire world, not to the world as of

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.120
now. Let's suppose like two other program in my local

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:23.260
system. Let's suppose if I have to expose, I think we all

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:26.060
know the game, right? This is the meaning of API that we

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:29.300
were trying to understand since yesterday's class. Yeah. So

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:35.580
simple call. What app app is what app is my variable of fast

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:42.520
API, right? Okay. So call app and app dot app dot. What I

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:46.540
should call. I should call put this time because I'm trying

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.880
to create this function for what I'm trying to create this

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:52.800
function to update the user. Yeah. To update the user. So

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:56.600
I'm going to call app dot put as simple as that, right? App

00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:00.440
dot put. Okay, that's cool. So app dot put. I'm going to

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.600
call so that I will be able to update the user. And now I

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:07.400
would like to create a route means at this location, you

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.960
will be able to access this particular function, the user

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.460
update function which I have written. So that depends upon

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:16.740
me. I can like give any kind of a route that I want. No one

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.160
is going to stop me that don't use this route. Don't use

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:22.820
that route. It's completely up to me what route I'm going to

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:26.460
give, right? What route I'm going to give. So simple here.

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:30.700
What I will do. I'll just write maybe like a user underscore

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:38.140
DB Slash data Slash. Maybe a V1 Slash update something like

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:41.700
this. I have given about means when you will try to go

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:45.960
through this route, then only you will be able to update. I

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.280
believe we all know that this philosophy, right? Right guys,

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:48.560
everyone.

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:56.020
Yeah, so I can I can try to give whatever out that I want as

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:59.360
simple as that. So here I have given this many this much of

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:02.820
lengthy routes. You can try to give even bit more lengthier

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:06.580
or maybe bit shorter. That's completely fine, right? So user

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:10.860
DB data Slash update and then when you are using a put,

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:15.400
right? So when you are using a put, you have to pass what

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:19.820
you have to pass basically user ID. So maybe you can try to

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:24.360
parameterize it over here saying that that okay, so I will

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:28.060
try to do a update for this route. This particular user ID.

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:33.860
So user ID. So here in a route itself, I'm sending this data

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:37.820
that okay, you can send a you can append a user ID over here

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:40.980
as a parameter. So this is nothing but as a parameter so

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:43.960
that it will be able to understand that okay, which record I

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:47.460
have to update which record we have to update and as a data,

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:52.180
right as a data. So in a route itself, I'll try to send that

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:55.480
which record we have to update as a parameter and then as a

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.540
data. I'm supposed to send this data name and age.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:02.220
Technically this information I have to send against the user

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:05.680
ID, right? So that it will be able to get those data and

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:08.620
then it will be able to update it. It will be able to update

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:12.020
it against that particular ID which I'm sending fine against

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:16.040
that particular ID I'm sending. So here I'll try to send a

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:20.480
data inside my body. As simple as that. I'll try to send a

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:25.660
data inside my body. So this is like a core philosophy.

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:29.400
Behind a put that okay, update this one and route whatever

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.720
you want. Just give that particular route as simple as that.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:36.320
Okay, so save it and let's try to run it. So how we are

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:40.080
going to run by the way guys. So we are going to run by UV

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:44.340
corn, right? UV corn. What is my file name? My file name is

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:49.400
testing. So testing only testing, right? So my file name is

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:54.340
testing by the way, colon app and hyphen hyphen. I'm going

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:57.260
to give reload. Reload so that you know, it will be able to

00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:00.920
reload itself. It will not ask unnecessarily for me whenever

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:04.820
I'm going to make any kind of changes so that that's only

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:07.900
like a reason. I'm giving a reload. Otherwise you can even

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:11.040
skip it. That's completely fine, but it will not be able to

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.680
make the changes when you are going to make a changes like

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:18.020
immediately. So in a API will not reflected. So find hit

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:22.540
enter if everything is going to work. So it is going to give

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.900
you like waiting for an application. Startup application.

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:28.480
Startup completed. Let me bring you this code so that you

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:33.120
can test it along with me. So tested guys quickly. Sir,

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.900
explain 9 number 23. What is there inside line number 23?

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:40.620
See, it's a dictionary. So here from this class, I'm going

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:44.240
to pass name and a. So technically this kind of a data will

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.760
come, right? This kind of a data will come and it's a

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.940
dictionary operation, which I'm trying to do. So user DB

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:53.500
user ID, right? So against this user ID, I'm trying to pass

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:56.480
some data. For example, let me let me show you this example

00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:03.460
here. So new file testing or maybe like a demo dot IP YNB.

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:07.340
Let me create this file. So those who are like not clear

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:10.960
with this one. So here I'm showing you one example

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.640
dictionary example. So let's suppose I have created a

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.100
dictionary over here, right? I've created a dictionary over

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:20.840
here. Now inside this dictionary, I have basically name is

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:27.140
equals to something like this. Yeah. Now, so if I have to

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:31.320
update basically this a name, right? If I have to update

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.880
basically a name, so what I will do, I'll try to access

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:38.520
dictionary with name first of all, right? And then instead

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:43.360
of Alice, so I can write SU DH. Yeah. So I'm trying to

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:47.100
access a key and then against that, I'm trying to change its

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:50.020
value, right? I'm trying to access a key and against that,

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:52.140
I'm trying to change the value. Now if you will see your

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:55.860
dictionary, so now it's not Alice, now it's basically SU DH.

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:59.820
So basically I have done what? I have done an update. I have

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:02.660
done what? I have done a update operation. Same thing,

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:07.160
right? Same thing. So user ID. So this is my key. Let's

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:10.160
suppose one is a user ID. So from this particular

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:13.700
dictionary, user DB, user underscore DB, I'm trying to pass

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:17.060
a new data from where I'm getting a new data. I'm getting a

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:20.340
new data by validating after validating it with the

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:29.960
pidentel. Now I'm

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:38.880
calling this到了fer, so it is validating

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:43.320
after validating. Okay, found.GB

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:55.420
is harem. more time, line number 21, this one. So this

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:57.960
function is nothing like this function is trying to take a

00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:02.640
two input. One is a user ID as per my data again. So this is

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.040
not like hard and fast that you should always pass this one.

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:07.460
You should always pass based on what you are trying to

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:10.000
update. So what I'm trying to update, so first of all, I'm

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.200
trying to update a use like this particular record, right?

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:16.680
Let's suppose I'm updating this record. Now how you will be

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:20.760
able to update? First of all, you have to go to a key, this

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:23.560
one, and then against that only you will be able to update.

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:25.980
Let's suppose you have to change my name, Sudhanshu. Maybe

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:28.240
you are not liking this particular name called as Sudhanshu.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.680
You would like to replace Sudhanshu with someone else,

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:34.420
right? So to reach out to Sudhanshu, you have to reach out

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:38.540
to first of all name, right? Yeah, name. And then against

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:41.980
this name, you have to change this one. Against this

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:44.320
particular name, you have to change this one. So first of

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.500
all, you will reach out to this. Then from there you will be

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:49.240
able to reach out to this. For example, right, for example,

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:52.100
if I'm going to take this data itself, right? This data

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:56.000
itself. Let's suppose if I have to update this record, yeah?

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:58.720
I have to update this record. How I will be able to update?

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:03.280
So basically I will try to call user DB dictionary, right?

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:06.700
If I have to update this record, so user DB dictionary. So

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:10.120
let's suppose I have to update record number one, yeah?

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:13.420
Record number one. So user DB one, it is going to give me

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:16.480
what? User DB one is going to give me this one, this data,

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:20.680
right? Now, so I have to update it. So how I can update it?

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:24.920
Nothing. Equal to and replace it with the new data. So name

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:29.560
is equals to, name is equals to maybe instead of Sudhanshu,

00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:36.890
so let's write like Kumar over here, yeah, K-U-M-A-R and

00:34:36.890 --> 00:34:39.850
then age is equal to something. So fine. Update is done,

00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:44.890
right? User DB. Update is done. Simple. So previously it was

00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:49.130
Sudhanshu. Now it became name is equal to Kumar. As simple

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:54.250
as that. If I have to go into a first record and into

00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:58.090
basically a name, how I can go into the name? Simple again.

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:02.670
Name. So it will be able to fit just a name. So I believe we

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:04.670
all know this kind of operation and that's the reason why

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:08.730
I've asked you. Please go through my lectures because in

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:11.330
very, very detailed, very, very depth I have discussed each

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:14.490
and everything and you need a fundamentals. You need a

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:18.110
fundamentals or basic of Python. So those who are not aware

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:20.610
about it. Even I have asked you last time, last class, last

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:23.370
Saturday, Sunday, and again, I'm asking you spend this

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:27.310
entire week at least 45 minute to one hour per day. And

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:29.730
believe me, you will be comfortable by next Saturday itself

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:34.950
in Python, right? Because this small, small things will keep

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:38.690
on hurting you. Not today, even tomorrow and even in the

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:41.930
future, right? If you are not going to revise it and it just

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:44.830
a one time game and whenever you're going through my

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:48.330
lectures, please don't take a note. I'm not teaching. I'm

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:49.930
not teaching someone to like, you know, pass the exam

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:53.870
whenever you're going through my lectures, especially coded

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:57.370
parallelly, right? Open up your laptop, maybe to a screen

00:35:57.370 --> 00:36:01.230
and then do it in parallel. This is the best way to learn

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:04.310
and believe me in that way, you will not have to spend a

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:09.510
time like again on the same topic. Fine guys, cool. I think

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:11.590
we are able to understand those who have had a confusion

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:14.690
with respect to this update. I believe this confusion is

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:17.010
like a, uh, not there, right?

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:22.020
Yes. Everyone.

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:31.260
Okay. So some of you are getting an error, so I can see that

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:34.540
in a chat and uh, there should be way to see all the end

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:38.000
points added in a different file. What is the question by

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.820
the way? Okay, fine. So here we have basically this, uh,

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:46.900
like, uh, we have basically this, uh, entire function and we

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:50.440
have exposed it, right? We have exposed it. So if you will

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:54.500
go and check, so my app is running where? So my app or my

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:58.780
API is running at local host 8,000. Okay. That's fine. If I

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:01.540
have to access it and if I have to make some sort of update

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:06.440
or if I have to test it, so simply I can go to my, uh, local

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:13.980
host 8,000 port number. So 8,000 port number and uh, yeah,

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:17.660
so detail not found. That's completely fine. I can do slash

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:22.840
DOCS so that it can open up a fast swagger API, fast API

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:27.400
provides swagger API. And as you can see that there is a put

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:32.620
request, which is visible to me in a swagger API slash DOCS,

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.700
right? Are you able to get it guys? Everyone?

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:43.940
Yes. We all are able to get it right now to execute it. It's

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:48.900
the same command guys, UV corn space, whatever file name

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:51.120
that you have given. In my case, I have given my file name

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:55.480
is equal to testing. So file name, call an app, app will be

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:58.760
a static and then hit enter. If you are going to give hyphen

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:02.860
hyphen reload, it simply means that that in a runtime, if

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:06.020
you are going to make any changes here, light, it will be

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:08.180
reflected automatically. It will try to refresh it

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:10.920
automatically. That's the only meaning. Yeah, nothing much.

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:16.980
So we are able to see for me, it's showing get, so it's

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:19.980
showing get, it simply means that you have not given a put

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:22.360
over here. You have given a get over here. That's the only

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:27.860
reason it's showing you get. Yeah. So here, change it. Okay.

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:32.420
So now if we have to test this, uh, you know, uh, API, so

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:35.900
maybe I can click on, try this out. Yeah. Try this out. And

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:40.340
here, so we can try to pass maybe a user ID. So here user ID

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:43.700
is equal to, let's suppose one I'm going to pass. Yeah. User

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:47.420
ID is equal to one. I'm going to pass and name value and age

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:51.260
value. I have to pass as a data. Fine. So user ID is equals

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:54.580
to one. I'm going to pass. And uh, let's suppose name is

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:59.180
equal to name. Name is equals to, I'm going to pass K-U-M-A

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:03.640
-R, K-U-M-A-R, right? And age is equals to, let's suppose 40

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:06.400
is something which I'm going to pass. And then if I'm going

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:10.880
to call execute, right? If I'm going to call execute now, if

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:14.720
I'll come over here, so it's a 200 request, put 200, right?

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:17.960
So 200 means it was a good request basically. And response

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:23.440
I'm able to get somehow right now. So here in a response

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:26.420
body, you will be able to find out that user ID. User

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:30.500
updated successfully. This is something that we have

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:34.140
written, right? So user updated successfully and then user

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:38.220
ID, it is going to return. So user ID is, or user detail, it

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:41.260
is going to return, right? So name and age, it is, it is

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:43.440
going to return that particular data, right? Whatever like

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:47.140
update that I have done. So successfully I'm able to update

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:53.160
a record. Simple. Yeah. So successfully I'm able to update a

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:57.720
record over here. So this is how this is like. A working

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:01.920
guys and this entire API is available at which place at this

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:04.720
particular place. I'm trying to pass what I'm trying to pass

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:09.900
ID, right? If I have to do a curl, so I can do a curl as

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:12.860
well. You will be able to find out a curl command. So where

00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:15.580
as a data I'm trying to pass name is equal to Kumar, age is

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:20.360
equal to 40 over here now. So let's suppose I would like to

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:23.920
print an updated data somewhere. Yeah. I would like to like

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:29.060
a print and updated data somewhere. Uh, not an issue. So I

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:33.220
can try to like maybe say that, okay. So in a console, just

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:37.300
try to print a, I can even write an API for that. But yeah,

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:40.380
let's, let's try to like, uh, do just a print operation. So

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:46.360
print the user DB over here and now, so let's go ahead and

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:54.240
let's try to hit this API once again. Yeah. Hit this API

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:54.920
once again.

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:12.680
Okay. So. So now I'm able to come out of this one. No, no,

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:21.230
no, it will not work in this way. So it is taking a global

00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:21.730
one.

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:56.280
Okay. So . Yeah.

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:11.270
So now I'm able to see the latest change, right? So name is

00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:14.170
equal to Kumar, age equal to 40. So I'm just like, we were

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:16.670
able to get it even before, but yeah, I was just trying to

00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:19.530
show you, uh, maybe somewhere in a console. I was trying to

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:21.830
show you that. Okay, fine. So this is something which you

00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:25.070
can see that whatever update, which I'm trying to send with

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:28.030
respect to a particular ID. So I'm able to get that

00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:30.990
particular data as simple as that. So it simply means that

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:34.250
I'm able to update a record and that was the whole

00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:39.010
objective. That was the whole idea. Yes. Chat pop up window

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:42.890
block. Let me do one thing. So attendees can chat with host

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:45.910
and panelists. Yeah. So now you will not be able to see each

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:48.350
and everyone's chat because I think it will become like a

00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:51.690
too much chatty and noisy. Okay. Uh, right. So I will be

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:53.930
able to see your chat and you will be able to see only my

00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:54.170
chat.

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.540
I have all the control. Don't worry. So you will not get

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:04.860
disturbed at any point of a time. So this is the code guys.

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:07.880
Again, I have pinged it to you and if we have to run the

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:11.840
code, so what is a command? So command is very simple. UV

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:14.760
corn in my studies class, I have used the exact same command

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.340
and I'm not using anything different today. It's exactly the

00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:19.140
same. Yeah. It's exactly the same.

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:28.440
Okay. So can you show another example for our update? I'll

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:31.140
show you multiple examples. Just wait. First of all, try to

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:33.640
execute this particular example. I'll show you that multiple

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:37.140
one. Fine guys. So we are, we are basically able to update

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:40.080
this particular record, whatever record that is available to

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:43.720
us right now, if we have to update maybe a record number

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:46.620
two, if we have to record update record number three, I will

00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:49.660
be able to update all of those records. Now let's try to

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:52.580
test it with the help of postman. So I believe we all have

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:55.800
installed a postman, uh, yesterday itself, right? So we all

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.920
have installed the postman now here. So if you'll come to

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:02.640
postman. And if you have to hit your API, so simple, you

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:05.320
have to select, first of all, a type of the request. So type

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:08.140
of the request is what? Put right. Type of the request is

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:11.860
technically a put over here. And then you have to basically

00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:17.040
give a URL. So whatever URL at which your data is available.

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.900
So you have to give that particular URL and then you have to

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:23.400
pass the data, right? You have to basically pass the data.

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:28.560
So here, uh, let's suppose I have this URL. So local host 8

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:35.230
,000. And then local host 8,000 and

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:40.740
uh, this is the route.

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:50.400
This is the route user underscore db slash data slash v1

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:53.300
slash update. Uh, let's suppose we are trying to update

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:56.520
record number two and data wise. So we can try to pass a

00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:01.980
data over here. So there will be a name, let's suppose. So

00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:07.220
name. So name is equals to maybe something. FSDS kind of a

00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:10.980
things. And then there will be a age, age is 10. Now I'm

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:14.360
going to send it and uh, yeah, so user updated successfully.

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:17.920
User name is equals to whatever name that I've given against

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:21.780
what? Against basically my user ID. So against my user ID

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:25.660
two, I have updated this particular record. Now if you will

00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:28.700
go and check your console, you will be able to find out the

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:33.920
exact same thing, right? So in your console against user ID

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:37.300
two, as we can see, this is the new record, which has been

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:40.520
updated. Now this record, I'm trying to update it in my

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:45.360
local, maybe I have a database and inside a database I can

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:48.180
go ahead and I can try to update the record. Maybe I have

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:52.360
some sort of a JSON file or maybe a CSB file, maybe a TXT

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:55.640
file inside that I would like to do something everywhere. I

00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:58.500
will be able to do it at the end of the day. Whole idea was

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:03.440
to call a put and with the help of put update some of the

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:07.540
data, update some of the records making sense guys. Okay. So

00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:09.100
to all of us, yes.

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:27.420
So someone is asking me that what is the difference between

00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:29.920
put and patch? Okay. So there is another method which

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:32.980
exists. So what put will do? So put will try to update the

00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:36.420
entire record, means with against whatever key or against

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:38.420
whatever value you are trying to do something. So put will

00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:42.760
try to, you know, update the entire record, whereas patch as

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:45.740
its name suggests patch, right? So patch means what? So we

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:47.980
are trying to do something partially. So we are trying to

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:51.120
apply a patch on top of something. So patch will help you

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:54.220
out in terms of updating a record. But partially, put means

00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:56.560
a full record update. So that is the whole difference

00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:59.780
between put and patch. Both eventually are going to help you

00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:03.260
out in terms of updating the record. Yeah. In terms of

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:06.460
updating the record. Okay. So here we are able to update the

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:10.260
record. Now I am going to terminate this program and now let

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:14.400
us try to understand a delete operation. Fine. So put is

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:17.260
completely fine. We are able to do it. Now let us try to

00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:20.900
understand the delete operation and I have seen guys that

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:23.860
many of you have not done the homework. So I have just seen

00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:26.020
like a couple of ping inside the group. So where people were

00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:29.360
saying that I'm able to do a homework. Now that's another

00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:34.080
problem, right? That's another problem. See, this is a teach

00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:38.380
technical class, right? It's not a movie. So which you will

00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:41.500
just watch and leave. You have to go ahead with the

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:44.080
assignments as well. The assignment which I'm giving you on

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:47.260
a regular basis going forward, that assignment will become a

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:50.700
challenges, right? And believe me, if you are going to do

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.540
those assignment, if you're going to do those challenges,

00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:56.080
every time you do assignment, every time you do a

00:47:56.080 --> 00:48:01.640
challenges, the success rate, the transition rate will

00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:06.060
increase each and every time. So you will get, you will get

00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:08.680
closer to your like a goal, whatever like goal or ambition

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.400
that you have, maybe to build a product or maybe to make a

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:13.880
transition, maybe to get a higher salary. But if you're not

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:17.080
doing it in every next class, you will end up asking just a

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:21.760
question, which is not going to help you out. Yeah. Where

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:24.360
to? So that's the problem. Right? Mohit is asking where to

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:26.700
submit the assignment. I believe we had a discussion. We had

00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:29.780
this discussions yesterday itself. That is, that is a major

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:30.260
problem guys.

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:37.530
Yep.

00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:46.240
So I'm expecting you to, you know, uh, complete all the

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:48.960
assignment, all the coursework, all the homework I'm trying

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:52.440
to give you. And now you can take a help of AI. I don't have

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:55.520
any kind of a issue. At the end of the day, what I want you

00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:59.080
to do is complete it. Because I know when you are going to

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:02.100
execute something in your system, that is the only point

00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:05.380
where you learn. You never learn when I come and teach,

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:08.380
teach, teach it to you. So you actually learn when you do it

00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:12.020
on your own, in your own system, by typing, maybe by doing a

00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:19.050
copy and paste, that's okay. Yeah. So thank you, sir. Now

00:49:19.050 --> 00:49:21.150
chats are not disturbing anymore. Yeah. We have all the

00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:24.270
control. Don't worry. So I can see all of your chat, but you

00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:26.550
are not able to see each and everyone's chat. I have just

00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:29.290
turned that off. I'll switch it on after the class. Yeah.

00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:37.260
How to see updating a terminal? Just print it. I have

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:39.580
applied a print over here, right? A simple print a statement

00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:42.340
so that every time it is going to update, it will try to

00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:46.800
print simple. Yeah. Okay. Now let's talk about a delete

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:49.760
operation guys. Yep. Delete operation. So delete means it

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:51.980
will try to delete something. Some records. This is the

00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:55.300
whole idea behind the delete operation. Right. Okay. So

00:49:55.300 --> 00:50:00.300
let's write a function. So def. Yeah. Def delete underscore

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:03.420
user function. So something like this, I'm going to write.

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:08.620
So delete underscore user function. Okay. User function. Now

00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:12.400
to delete any user, I just have to pass a user ID. So user

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:16.900
ID, I'm going to pass. So user ID as an integer. Now it will

00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:20.980
try to check if user ID in user DV. So if user ID exists,

00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:23.560
let's suppose you have passed a user ID is equal to four.

00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:27.060
That is not even available over here. So what it will

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:29.940
delete? Nothing. Right. It will not be able to delete

00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:34.540
anything. Yeah. So it will try to just check that user ID in

00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:39.100
user DV. So if this is true, if this is, this holds true,

00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:42.240
then it will try to call a delete operation. This is how

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:45.800
anything can be deleted in a dictionary. For example, if I

00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:49.720
have this dictionary, like user DV dictionary, and if I have

00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:52.260
to delete record number two, how I can delete record number

00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:57.040
two, simple call del function. Yeah. And then dictionary

00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:00.920
name, user underscore DV. Yeah. And then try to give a

00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:03.200
record, whatever record that you would like to maybe delete.

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:06.160
So let's suppose I would like to delete maybe a second

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:10.020
record. Yeah. Second record. So delete user DV, second

00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:14.200
record, this particular key. So execute it. Now if you are

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:18.160
going to print user DV, so we don't have a record number

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:20.460
two. We have record number one and we have record number

00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:23.620
three, two is gone. I have already deleted it. So same

00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:25.780
operation we are trying to perform. Same dictionary

00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:29.780
operation, right? So delete user ID. Whatever user ID. We

00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:32.140
are going to pass and then return a message that user

00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:34.780
deleted successfully. If user ID doesn't exist, it will fall

00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:38.440
inside else statement and it will return you that user not

00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:44.260
found as simple as that user not found. Okay. Fine. Now if I

00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:48.220
have to convert it into an API, again, we know the drill.

00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:52.540
Yeah. If we have to convert this one into an API, I think we

00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:57.940
know the drill. Simple decorated app dot. Right. And then

00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:03.520
delete. Call delete. And then give some route, maybe user DV

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:06.740
slash data slash V1 slash delete. And then you have to pass

00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:09.540
the user ID. So whatever route that you are going to like

00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:11.820
it, so just give that particular route and it will reach out

00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:15.500
to the route. It will try to perform the operation. So here

00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:18.240
is a code guys. I have pinged you. So hope you all are able

00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:22.100
to see my code in a chat. Yeah. So this is the code by the

00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:25.600
way. So it will be able to delete it. Now let's make this

00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:29.900
app up and running. Yeah. Let's execute it. So again, open

00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:33.680
up your commands. Clear. And you will call right, you will

00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:38.260
call my file name and then reload. Reload is not important.

00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:43.800
You can leave it or you can keep it. Fine guys. Yeah. And

00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:46.160
please change your file name. So if your file name is not

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:48.560
testing, don't use this command. Change your file name.

00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:51.020
Testing is my file name as you can see over here. Right.

00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:55.380
This is my file name. Fine. Okay. That's cool. So let's try

00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:58.540
to do experimentation guys. With respect to this. Delete

00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:02.700
operation. So I can try to use a curl. I can try to use

00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:07.360
basically swagger UI. So let's do it in a swagger UI here.

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:11.840
Right. Here. So localhost and then docs. So here my put

00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:14.920
request is available. My delete request is also available.

00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:17.700
Right. My put is available. My delete is available. Both is

00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:20.460
available. Put we have already tested. Let's test with the

00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:23.800
delete. It's a very easy one. So click on, try it out and

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:26.980
then pass a user ID. So user ID is equal to two. Execute.

00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:31.080
And put it. User deleted successfully. Simple. This is the

00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:33.980
response I am able to receive. Good response. Right. Let's

00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:36.100
suppose if I am going to give user ID is equal to seven.

00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:39.740
Execute. So in case of user ID seven, user not found. That's

00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:42.540
a response that you will be able to see. Yeah. So user

00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:45.280
technically not found. This is the response I am able to get

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:49.500
it. I can do it even with the help of curl. Right. I can do

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:52.040
it even with the help of curl. Because curl is going to

00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:54.620
consider just this one. And if you have to pass the data.

00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:57.320
But we are not passing any kind of a data. Hyphen D over

00:53:57.320 --> 00:53:58.760
here. Right. I can do it even with the help of curl. I can

00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:02.040
even test it with the help of what a postman. So over here,

00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:07.100
select this delete operation and then my entire URL was

00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:14.560
what? Delete. I believe this was the URL and then try to

00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:18.260
give the user ID. Right. Try to give the user ID. Keep it

00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:22.680
none. And then send. User deleted successfully. Not sending

00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:25.940
any raw data. So keep it none. Yeah. Keep it none over here

00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:28.880
inside the postman. So just select the delete option over

00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:31.840
here and then reach out to this particular location. So

00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:36.560
where your method has been hosted, give a parameter user ID.

00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:40.100
And then if again, I'm going to send it, user not found

00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:42.260
because I have already deleted it. Right. I have already

00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:44.960
deleted it. So again, if I'm going to send not found, not

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:48.460
found, not found, not found, but it is hitting my API. It is

00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:50.820
hitting my API as you can see. But yeah, there is no such

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:53.900
user with that particular ID. So what it is going to delete?

00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:00.270
Nothing. Fine guys. Postman and unicorns are the same. No,

00:55:00.350 --> 00:55:04.410
not at all. Postman is basically a tool, a tool which is

00:55:04.410 --> 00:55:08.130
going to help you out in terms of a, like a testing and API

00:55:08.130 --> 00:55:12.350
basically. Right. UV corn is nothing but a kind of a

00:55:12.350 --> 00:55:16.330
library, which is going to help me out in terms of executing

00:55:16.330 --> 00:55:24.130
a fast API. It's not same. I love swagger as it gives a curl

00:55:24.130 --> 00:55:26.930
command as well. Yeah. I mean like curl command is not

00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:30.110
difficult. So simple. Like a curl and then method name. You

00:55:30.110 --> 00:55:33.090
try to give, then you try to give a URL, then you give a

00:55:33.090 --> 00:55:37.530
header, then you give a data. End of the story. This is what

00:55:37.530 --> 00:55:42.450
a curl command is. Right. Fine guys.

00:55:45.770 --> 00:55:49.690
How the auto coding is coming into your system help where in

00:55:49.690 --> 00:55:52.270
my system it's not coming. So okay. If you would like to

00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:56.150
like do auto coding. So just go to this icon, which is

00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:59.010
called as extension. I taught up, talked about this one. I

00:55:59.010 --> 00:56:03.390
believe in my second class if I remember. So just try to

00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:07.090
click here. Just try to click on this icon. I believe my

00:56:07.090 --> 00:56:10.570
mouse cursor is visible to all of you and then try to search

00:56:10.570 --> 00:56:14.430
copilot or GitHub copilot. So anything is going to work. So

00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:19.670
copilot, C-O-P-I-L-O-T, P-I-L-O-T. So GitHub copilot and

00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:23.630
then like try to install it and likewise there are like so

00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:26.130
many things which is available. So you can try to, you know,

00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:27.070
use any of these.

00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:38.300
Fine guys. Okay. Is it clear? A put and delete operation. By

00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:38.600
the way.

00:56:43.770 --> 00:56:46.450
Sir, I understand everything. Yesterday was lagging behind.

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:49.750
Santur Haldar is saying. Santanu Haldar. Sorry. Yeah. So

00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:51.970
that's great. That's what happens. I don't understand

00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:54.270
everything one day. You will get it. It happens. Today 10%

00:56:54.270 --> 00:56:55.710
will come. Tomorrow 20% will come. The day after tomorrow 25

00:56:55.710 --> 00:56:56.830
% will come. So things go like this.

00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:05.520
And it's completely fine. There is no problem. Right. Okay.

00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:09.160
So let's move forward. It's fun. It will come further. I

00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:11.780
mean, if you do a little assignment, it will be fun. It will

00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:20.260
always come. Okay. So this is done by the way. So now what

00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:27.700
we are going to do. So maybe we can try to, you know, deploy

00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:30.820
this entire solution that maybe we can try to deploy this

00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:34.260
entire solution over some cloud platform. So as of now, this

00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:38.160
entire thing is running in my local host. And yesterday we

00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:41.600
have seen that if we have to do a port forwarding, port

00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:43.900
forwarding means if something is running. If something is

00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:47.860
running on my local host at some particular port and URL. So

00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:51.640
with the help of ng-rock, I will be able to expose it to the

00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:54.980
entire world, right? This is something that we have already

00:57:54.980 --> 00:57:57.920
discussed, right? In my yesterday's lecture itself, this is

00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:00.920
something which we have already gone through that with the

00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:04.440
help of port forwarding, for example, ng-rock, by the help

00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:07.800
of ng-rock, I will be able to expose it so that anyone and

00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:11.260
everyone will be able to come and they will be able to test

00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:16.160
it or they will be able to use my. My API is right. But

00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:19.360
let's suppose I don't want to keep a solution in my system.

00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:23.620
Not at all. Like I don't want any kind of a solution in my

00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:29.280
system. I just want all of these things on some server or

00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:33.480
maybe on some cloud platform. So how I can, I can do that

00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:37.000
basically how I will be able to do a deployment of this

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:40.780
entire API, this entire things, which whatever is running in

00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:43.800
my local system, it should not be available in my local

00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:46.600
system. It should be available somewhere in a global

00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:50.220
platform so that anyone will be able to access it without

00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:53.020
even tunneling or without even port forwarding the port

00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:55.620
forwarding that we have done yesterday. So to do that,

00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:59.260
obviously you have to deploy the solution on any of the

00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:01.480
cloud platform. So there are tons of cloud platform out

00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:05.120
there, not just one or two tons means literally a tons of

00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:09.380
provider. So AWS Azure GCP is the major provider. Apart from

00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:12.360
that, there is a render. There is a lot of bare metal cloud

00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:16.800
provider. So many, so many options you have by the way. So

00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:20.180
I'm going to now show you that how you will be able to bring

00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:22.980
this solution, which is a very small one, obviously, right?

00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:26.140
But on a cloud, how you can try to push it so that whatever

00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:29.560
solution going forward, we will build, we will try to build

00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:32.000
end to end going forward, we'll try to add a flavor of

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.820
databases as well. So many more flavor we'll keep on adding

00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:38.080
so that we can reach out to the reality, right? Reach out to

00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:41.180
the reality because obviously in real code is not going to

00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:44.120
run in your local system. Code will be available somewhere

00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:50.340
in a cloud platform. Yes. Somewhere in a cloud platform. So

00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:53.440
ng-rock not working in Mac, any other alternative? No, it

00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:56.760
works in a Mac by the way. So there is a Mac installation,

00:59:57.020 --> 01:00:00.820
which is available for a ng-rock. You have to just place

01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:04.680
inside that like a folder and then execute it. Someone is

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:07.180
saying, Satyam is saying unable to hear, is it guys? Am I

01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:12.900
able to all of you? Satyam, please check your, this one. I'm

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:17.440
not able to hear. Mike, I'm audible and visible to all of

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:17.640
you.

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:26.740
Okay. So now what we'll do, we can try to push this code

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:29.620
base, right? We can try to push this entire code base into

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:33.780
some of the cloud platform, right? Some of the cloud

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:38.120
platform. Now to push this entire code base into some of the

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:41.860
cloud platform. So basically we have to do some sort of a

01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:46.320
preparation. What kind of preparation? So see in my local

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:49.520
system, when I have done this. Uh, set up and when I'm able

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:53.440
to run this fast API, I have done a couple of installation,

01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:57.000
right? So I have done installation for fast API and I have

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.320
done installation for UV call. This is something I have

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:04.180
done. Now what cloud is going to provide. So cloud is going

01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:08.180
to provide you a machine, right? A machine, a compute, or

01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:10.560
maybe like a Ram. It is going to provide you maybe a hard

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:14.520
disk. It is going to provide you, but those cloud platform

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:18.900
never knows that what you are holding inside your code or

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:21.560
what kind of a library, what kind of a dependency that you

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:24.860
have, right? Cloud platform will not be having any kind of

01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:27.780
idea because there will be like a millions of people who

01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:30.340
will try to come and who will try to deploy a tens of

01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:33.240
millions of application on a cloud platform. So cloud

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:35.180
platform will not be aware about that, that what you are

01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:37.600
trying to deploy. It is just going to give you a machine, a

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.500
machine which is public. So as of now I'm using my machine,

01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:43.300
but it is not public. It is basically my local machine,

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:46.520
right? Local machine. But on a cloud, you will be able to

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:49.320
get something. Which will be a public machine. So whatever

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:52.280
is running here, which I'm able to access, though, if I'm

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:55.560
going to run the same thing on that machine, all of us will

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:58.500
be able to access. This is what it means, right? In terms of

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:02.300
a deployment in a layman way, right? As a beginner. So cloud

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:05.420
platform will not be having any idea that, uh, what kind of

01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:08.080
a dependency, what kind of installation it has to do. So you

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:12.580
have to mention it how. So in case of Python project, so you

01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:16.540
have to create basically a file called as requirement, R E.

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:25.080
Q. U. I. R. E. M. E. N. T. S. Dot. T. X. T. Requirements. T.

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:28.400
X. T. If your spelling is going to be wrong, it will not

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:33.100
work. So it should be requirements. S. S. Yes. Requirements.

01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:36.200
Basically check the spelling, the spelling, which I have

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:38.400
written over here. You have to use the exact same spelling.

01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:43.080
And then you have to mention a library. So which library we

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:47.420
have installed. So technically we have installed off. Like a

01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:51.180
fast API. And basically we have installed. We have installed

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:53.700
you. We call these two installation. We have done base was

01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:57.600
python. Right. Base was python. But fast API and you. We

01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:01.180
call it is something that we have. Uh. Black. Uh. Installed.

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:03.740
Right. We have technically this something that we have

01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:06.580
installed. So. Okay. This is something that you have to

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:09.800
mention. So requirement. T. X. T. And we have this

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:13.560
particular file. Uh. Testing. Pie file is there with us.

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:18.840
Right. So is there with us. Now what we can do. We can try

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:22.420
to choose a cloud platform. So where we can do a deployment.

01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:27.980
Yeah. Where we can do a deployment. So now let's go ahead.

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:30.460
And let's try to do a deployment. If there will be some

01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:32.620
error. If it is going to say that I have to install even

01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:35.080
pidentic as people are suggesting over here inside a chat.

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:39.020
We'll do it. We'll do it on the fly. So first of all guys.

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:44.020
You have to push your code. Where. On a github. Yeah. So on

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:46.920
a github. You have to push your code. And. Uh. You have to.

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:49.500
You have to choose your cloud platform. So I'm going to

01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:51.940
choose a render which is going to be free. It is not going

01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:55.560
to ask for the credit card. Uh. And you will be able to do a

01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:58.940
deployment. Right. You will be able to do a deployment. So

01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:02.340
let me go to a Google. And once you will go to a Google.

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:10.220
Render. Yeah. So just try to search for a not R E N D E R

01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:15.660
render. Fine. Render. So this is the platform guys. I have

01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:18.860
pinned you the link. Right. And you just have to do a login.

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:21.740
So those who are doing a login for the very first time. So

01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:23.920
please take your time. Two three minute. It should not take

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:27.240
more than that. Right. Those who have already logged in. So

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:30.400
come to the dashboard. So once you are going to log in. So

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.440
it is. It is not a big deal to create an account. It's a

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:35.860
very easy. Right. Just use a Google sign up option and you

01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:38.860
will be able to create the account. So do it guys and

01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:42.860
confirm me inside a chat. Sign in to render. So I'm going to

01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:50.460
sign in with the Google. Yeah. So just try to sign in. Just

01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:53.320
use a Google option. You will be able to do a login quickly.

01:05:13.070 --> 01:05:15.990
Done guys. Done. Done. Done. Okay. Visa version number

01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:19.290
should also match in a requirement file. Leave it. We'll

01:05:19.290 --> 01:05:22.430
see. Like I said, so if you are going to get a bug, uh,

01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:25.730
we'll solve it. And in that way you will learn, learn more.

01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:29.530
Just just a login guys, everyone just

01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:36.790
log in and confirm me inside a chat. I can see done, done,

01:05:36.810 --> 01:05:39.750
done from many people. I'm just waiting for most of you.

01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:43.750
Okay. It's done. Oh yeah. Most of you have done. Okay. Good.

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:53.520
So anyone who has not done, so please ping me maybe by

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:54.700
saying no or something.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.420
Yeah. Is it free? Yeah. It's completely free. It will never

01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:09.320
ask you to add the like a card. Okay. One moment. Fine. I'm,

01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:11.460
I'm waiting. I'll give you like another two, three minutes

01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:16.000
of time to take your time. Yes. Not able to log in. Why not

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.280
able to log in? It's a simple portal, right? Just go ahead

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:21.560
and click on that. Google sign in. And then you will be able

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:22.940
to log in. As simple as that.

01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:30.200
Same Gmail credential. I mean like it's up to you what Gmail

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:31.540
credential you are going to use.

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:41.720
No, if you're doing a Google signup, then this lengthy

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:45.140
option is not allowed, like not required. You can just do

01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:48.700
and go and do other signup. Just click on the Google login

01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:54.300
and then approve your Google signup. Logged in using GitHub.

01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:57.000
Yeah, that is also fine. If you are logged in using a

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.600
GitHub, not an issue at all. Is it the same? Same like we

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:04.720
did in a Streamlit in a FSDS. Yeah, Streamlit is also a

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:07.640
cloud platform and Render is also another cloud platform. So

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:10.580
Streamlit generally supports a Streamlit based application

01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:11.920
itself. Render supports everything.

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:17.120
Yep.

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:27.380
Meantimes are how you find this free tools, which blogs,

01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:36.100
okay. So if you are active in a tech, you will get all the

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:39.000
news and information. So you just have to keep yourself

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:39.400
active.

01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:45.880
Already having a Render login since like 2019, 2021, okay,

01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:50.820
that's great. So now we have a Render account, right? And

01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:54.720
this Render is going to provide you a machine, right? A

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:58.620
machine. So where you will be able to, you know, go and you

01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:00.660
will be able to productionize your application means

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:03.780
whatever is working in your local system. You can try to put

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:06.920
that up into a Render and it is going to give you a shared

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:09.500
instances. Means there will be a big machine which will be

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:13.260
shared by multiple people. There is a payment option. So if

01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:16.760
you are going to attach a payment option, then it will try

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:19.820
to give you more and more facility in terms of the scaling

01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:22.360
security and many more things, right? Many more things

01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:25.000
they're going to give you, but even without a payment. So,

01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:28.820
so far, I'm not sure about future, future, right? Yeah. But

01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:32.000
so far, so without even adding a card, you will be able to

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.880
do a deployment, whereas, so if you're going to offer Azure,

01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:40.220
GCP or AWS without card, at least you have to add the card.

01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:42.640
They are going to give you a free credit for the very first

01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:46.060
time for like a couple of months or maybe for a particular

01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:49.420
amount, but you have to add the card and they will start

01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:52.520
charging once you're like a free credit is going to be over.

01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:57.240
So here Render is not like that, at least till now, I don't

01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:00.020
know what is going to happen in future by the way. So here

01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:04.900
we have a Render account. Now parallel to that, try to open

01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:08.740
up your GitHub account, everyone try to open up your GitHub

01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:12.640
account. By the way. So inside what we are going to do, so

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:16.520
we are going to push our code into a GitHub, right? We are

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:19.320
going to push our code into a GitHub and once we'll be able

01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:24.720
to push our code into a GitHub, so we are going to attach

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:29.440
those code inside a render and that will be deployed. So

01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:32.660
first you have to push your code into a GitHub and then from

01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:36.620
a GitHub, we will be able to deploy it. So now to push

01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:40.800
something into a GitHub. It's very simple, right? It's very

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:45.280
simple. So anyone guys from a group who have not done even a

01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:47.400
single check-in into a GitHub, anyone?

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:51.040
Yeah.

01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:57.560
Okay. So basically those who are saying me no, or I don't

01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:00.120
have, I haven't used it, right? It simply means that they

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:01.380
have not gone through a Python lecture.

01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:10.240
Okay. This is, this is what I wanted to know.

01:10:15.790 --> 01:10:20.830
Okay. Not an issue. Okay. So basically, uh, those who are

01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:24.270
new, right? So GitHub is basically a platform. So where you

01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:27.570
can try to push your code, right? And eventually whenever

01:10:27.570 --> 01:10:30.010
you are going to do a deployment, uh, basically in a

01:10:30.010 --> 01:10:32.430
majority of cloud platform, whenever you will go and do a

01:10:32.430 --> 01:10:37.090
deployment, so you have to like basically attach your GitHub

01:10:37.090 --> 01:10:40.190
ID or GitHub account and from a GitHub repository itself, it

01:10:40.190 --> 01:10:43.550
will be able to, uh, pull your code and then it will be able

01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:45.970
to do a deployment and going forward. So when we are going

01:10:45.970 --> 01:10:48.690
to perform a CI CD operation, so continuous integration and

01:10:48.690 --> 01:10:49.410
continuous deployment, right? It will be able to do a

01:10:49.410 --> 01:10:51.910
deployment operation. So even at that point of a time, so

01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:54.490
we'll show you that how continuously you will keep on

01:10:54.490 --> 01:10:56.690
checking a code, you will keep on merging your file,

01:10:56.870 --> 01:11:00.210
resolving your conflict, and then automatically it will keep

01:11:00.210 --> 01:11:03.270
on deploying on your server. But that's a long story that

01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:06.310
will come in a picture after maybe two, three months of

01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:10.010
time. Not now. Uh, so those who is not having a GitHub

01:11:10.010 --> 01:11:13.750
account, so please, uh, try to search GitHub on a Google.

01:11:14.170 --> 01:11:16.870
This is again one time, but we are going to use it

01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:20.070
throughout the lecture, throughout the class. And like I

01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:22.890
said, please try to spend some time this week, at least on

01:11:22.890 --> 01:11:23.690
my Python lectures.

01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:31.860
Yeah. GitHub is free. Yes, it's completely free. At least

01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:34.840
for now. I mean like not for everyone for organization, you

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:38.440
have to pay, I think $6 per, no $4 per user.

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:45.880
Fine. So just try to create a GitHub account so that you

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:49.320
will be able to push a code. And as a techie guys, one

01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:52.800
thing, let me tell you, if you are not having a GitHub

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:56.520
account, if you are not having a LinkedIn account. Okay.

01:11:56.540 --> 01:12:00.820
Please go and create, I know all of us have a Instagram

01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:04.820
account or Facebook account, but as a professional, you must

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:07.660
have, and you should have a LinkedIn account and you should

01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:12.660
have a GitHub account. And please try to activate yourself

01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:16.680
in both the places because in both like GitHub account and

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:20.200
LinkedIn account is going to build a credential, build

01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:24.960
authenticity basically for you start posting something on a

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:27.560
LinkedIn. Something valuable. Maybe you are trying to learn

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:30.400
something, right? Post it that, okay, fine. So this is

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:32.820
something which I've explored because there are like every

01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:35.940
kind of a people available on these platforms, right? So

01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:38.480
those who are beginner, those who are new, they will get

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:41.000
attached to you, right? They will get attached to what you,

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:45.040
and eventually in a year of time, not, not immediately, I

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:47.660
would say, right. But in a year of time in two year of time.

01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:51.560
So you will be having a similar kind of a connection or

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:54.680
maybe a followings from the same kind of a segment. Because

01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:56.920
this is how all the social media is going to work, right?

01:12:57.100 --> 01:13:00.780
And when you are going to like, you know, distribute or when

01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:02.300
you are going to upload or when you're going to post

01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:05.000
something good, something like genuine. So obviously people

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.680
are going to like it. People are going to appreciate it. And

01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:12.520
these are the same people who will help each other. I have

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:14.780
seen like people are using LinkedIn, right? And they

01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:17.580
straight forward, they go and they try to ask for the

01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:19.800
referral. They straight forward. They go and they try to ask

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:22.260
for maybe some sort of a recommendation jobs or something,

01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:25.820
right? No one is going to help you out. No one means

01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:29.500
literally no one. If you have an authenticity, if you have

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:33.140
built your credentials, right? If you are good in terms of

01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:35.700
providing content, people will reach out to you

01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:39.000
automatically saying that, okay, fine. So like, uh, I'm

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.180
looking for this kind of a person, that kind of person, I

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:43.660
have had this kind of book, that kind of a work, right? So

01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:47.040
build your authenticity and majority of people feels over

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:51.060
there in today's world. Personal branding is important. And

01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:54.700
believe me, maybe you will not realize it now. But in next

01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:57.400
five year, all of you are going to realize, I know a lot of

01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:59.400
people, right? And even in our group itself, we have a lot

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:02.580
of people. So whose experience is maybe like a 15 year, 20

01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:05.180
year, but they have not built any kind of a social

01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:08.120
credentials. They have not built any kind of a followings.

01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:12.260
They have not built any kind of a connections. Now after

01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:15.520
some time, obviously you will face a challenges because

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:20.360
after 15 year of experience into our industry, you can't say

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:23.340
that I will go and I will apply for the job. Right? Because

01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:26.620
your job comes from the referral majority. I will say 90% of

01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:31.000
the job that people used to get after 15, 20 year is from

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.860
referral. Just from a referral. If someone knows you,

01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:37.460
someone will refer you and how someone is going to know you

01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:41.920
in this like whole world, obviously with your work, right?

01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:45.080
That that's the best way to introduce yourself. So if you

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:47.980
have to introduce yourself, showcase your work and keep on

01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:50.300
showing it continuously, that is going to build a credential

01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:52.880
and believe me, that is going to give you an amazing return,

01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:56.680
amazing means literally amazing, amazing return, right?

01:14:57.940 --> 01:15:01.300
Start doing it from today itself. It's a time now.

01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:09.140
So fine. Let me share my screen once again.

01:15:12.190 --> 01:15:15.350
So just, I believe all of you have logged in into a GitHub.

01:15:15.490 --> 01:15:20.290
Those who had not a LinkedIn, sorry, not LinkedIn. So those

01:15:20.290 --> 01:15:23.250
who didn't had a GitHub account, I believe they are able to

01:15:23.250 --> 01:15:28.090
create it. Yes, everyone. Yeah. GitHub account. Again, it

01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:29.590
will take two, three minutes of time to create a GitHub

01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:34.830
account. Fine. So once you are able to create a GitHub

01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:38.110
account and those who are trying to push a code for the very

01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:40.730
first time, right? For the very, very first time inside a

01:15:40.730 --> 01:15:43.890
GitHub account, you have to do a small setup, right? You

01:15:43.890 --> 01:15:46.550
have to do a small setup. What kind of a setup? So go to

01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:49.490
Google for the first time user of the GitHub into a system.

01:15:49.830 --> 01:15:54.030
So get and then download. So you have to basically search

01:15:54.030 --> 01:15:57.290
for a Git download and you will be able to reach out to the

01:15:57.290 --> 01:16:01.530
official, like a page of Git download. And here, let me ping

01:16:01.530 --> 01:16:04.030
you this link, Git download link. So link is available in

01:16:04.030 --> 01:16:07.090
your chat. You can check this out. So here there is a Mac,

01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:10.490
Windows and Linux all for all machines it's given to you. So

01:16:10.490 --> 01:16:12.850
let's suppose I'm using Windows. I'll click over here and

01:16:12.850 --> 01:16:16.910
then I'll try to get for Windows 64 setup. So it is going to

01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:20.170
download the files for me and then once it will be able to

01:16:20.170 --> 01:16:23.830
download a file for me, I'll simply click over here. It's a

01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:26.650
very simple download, right? Very simple download. So I'll

01:16:26.650 --> 01:16:29.990
just click over here. And then I'll try to click, click,

01:16:30.010 --> 01:16:32.490
click install and within two, three minutes it will be able

01:16:32.490 --> 01:16:35.910
to install. It's a very, very light weighted file and then

01:16:35.910 --> 01:16:39.130
close your VS code. Open up once again or maybe you can open

01:16:39.130 --> 01:16:42.110
up your command prompt and then I'll show you check your

01:16:42.110 --> 01:16:42.370
version.

01:16:46.130 --> 01:16:49.950
So just do this. I have already pinned you a link guys. So

01:16:49.950 --> 01:16:54.850
please try to, you know, go to this location, get a download

01:16:54.850 --> 01:16:57.990
and as per your system. So whatever system that you are

01:16:57.990 --> 01:17:01.130
using, whether it's a Mac, Linux or Windows. So please try

01:17:01.130 --> 01:17:04.530
to do a very, very quick installation because without this

01:17:04.530 --> 01:17:07.170
you will not be able to push a code inside a GitHub

01:17:07.170 --> 01:17:10.910
repository in which you have signed up. Git must be

01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:14.430
available. So Git is basically a open source project. It's

01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:18.650
an open source like a tool and this GitHub is nothing but

01:17:18.650 --> 01:17:20.730
it's a proprietary one which belongs to a GitHub

01:17:20.730 --> 01:17:23.490
organization as an organization. Unlike GitHub, there is

01:17:23.490 --> 01:17:25.730
something called as Bitbucket, Gitlabs, there are so many

01:17:25.730 --> 01:17:26.910
other organizations. There are so many other organizations,

01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:31.030
technically they maintain the code, they help you out in

01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:33.890
terms of managing the entire repository, a code base, a

01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:38.090
large base, right? But under the hood they are using that

01:17:38.090 --> 01:17:38.390
Git.

01:17:42.610 --> 01:17:45.630
What is the path variable that we should use? Just go with

01:17:45.630 --> 01:17:49.710
the default one. Fine. So once you are able to install just

01:17:49.710 --> 01:17:52.490
to like confirm that whether Git is available inside my

01:17:52.490 --> 01:17:55.770
system or not, so maybe you can come to a command prompt and

01:17:55.770 --> 01:17:58.510
write Git. If you are able to see something like this, it

01:17:58.510 --> 01:18:01.610
simply means that Git is available. Yeah. If you are not

01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:03.430
able to see like command not found or something like this,

01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:06.530
it simply means that system is not able to recognize your

01:18:06.530 --> 01:18:09.850
Git. And in that case you have to set the path, which is

01:18:09.850 --> 01:18:12.970
very rare. Nowadays all softwares are giving you a default

01:18:12.970 --> 01:18:17.250
like a path configuration. Done everyone. Are we able to

01:18:17.250 --> 01:18:21.890
install Git? I'll wait. And again, so from next class

01:18:21.890 --> 01:18:25.250
onwards, we'll not do these things. We need it, but we'll

01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:28.130
not do it. So, so that like, you know, we can save some

01:18:28.130 --> 01:18:32.070
time. Okay. Git is not recognizing international command. So

01:18:32.070 --> 01:18:35.390
first of all, install and then try to set the path.

01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:45.000
Done everyone. Yeah.

01:18:52.770 --> 01:18:56.590
Okay. Done. Done. Done. And those who are facing an issue

01:18:56.590 --> 01:18:58.730
come to a doubt clearing right up to the class. I'll, I'll

01:18:58.730 --> 01:19:02.330
fix some of the issues. How to check if Git is installed? I

01:19:02.330 --> 01:19:05.630
have already shown you. So where is your attention Selva? So

01:19:05.630 --> 01:19:09.210
just open up a command prompt and type a Git, D-I-T Git.

01:19:09.390 --> 01:19:10.330
This is how you will check.

01:19:14.650 --> 01:19:18.410
Sir, can you go a little bit fast? Not now. I think in a

01:19:18.410 --> 01:19:22.810
future lectures, but not now because everyone is not on the

01:19:22.810 --> 01:19:26.690
same page, but yeah, everyone will be very soon. I know.

01:19:30.650 --> 01:19:33.630
Okay. Git install. Fine. That's cool. So Git is installed.

01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:37.210
Just close your VS code once and then open it once again

01:19:37.210 --> 01:19:39.450
because sometime it will not be able to recognize because of

01:19:39.450 --> 01:19:42.910
the cache issue. So it will be able to recognize it. Now we

01:19:42.910 --> 01:19:46.210
had this file guys, we had a testing.py file and we had

01:19:46.210 --> 01:19:49.330
already created a requirement.txt file. Now what I have to

01:19:49.330 --> 01:19:52.150
do? I have to push this code, a code which is available in

01:19:52.150 --> 01:19:55.610
my local system to a GitHub. Right to a GitHub. That's the

01:19:55.610 --> 01:19:58.010
reason. So we were talking about GitHub. Right. So to a

01:19:58.010 --> 01:20:02.450
GitHub. So the flow is very simple. What we are going to do.

01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:07.250
So basically we are going to push our code base. So whatever

01:20:07.250 --> 01:20:08.810
is available in my local.

01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:20.100
So whatever is available in my local, I'll try to push it

01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:25.100
inside a GitHub, which is nothing, but a code repository,

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:29.200
right repo and then from GitHub. So I'm going to call it

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:35.060
inside a render cloud cloud. So this is the step that we are

01:20:35.060 --> 01:20:38.140
going to follow. So from local to GitHub to a render. So

01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:41.180
let's do it. GitHub is ready. Render. We are able to log in

01:20:41.180 --> 01:20:43.740
and in my local, I have already tested each and everything.

01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:46.500
So all these three components are ready, right? All these

01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:48.920
three components are ready. My local testing is done.

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:51.820
GitHub. I'm able to log in. I'm able to do an installation

01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:54.380
and then render. I'm able to do. I'm able to sign up. So

01:20:54.380 --> 01:20:57.380
these are the base. These are the base. Now we are like a

01:20:57.380 --> 01:21:00.400
good to go with the, uh, pushing a code into a GitHub. So

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:03.420
let's push a code from local to a GitHub. How? Let me show

01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:07.640
it to you. Yeah. So once you have a GitHub account, click on

01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:11.380
your profile, the corner one, right? Right hand side, upper

01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:15.040
corner. So just click over here. You will be able to see

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:19.950
your repository option. Are you able to see it guys? Yes.

01:21:20.170 --> 01:21:24.630
Are you able to see it? So just click on your profile tab.

01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:27.250
The icon. Right. And here you will be able to see your

01:21:27.250 --> 01:21:31.490
repository. So click on your repository. Click it. Yeah. So

01:21:31.490 --> 01:21:33.750
click on your repository. And again, every time you will do

01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:36.810
the same thing, exact same thing. So no changes at all. And

01:21:36.810 --> 01:21:39.350
almost in every alternate class, we are going to do a

01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:41.590
deployment. And whenever I'm going to give you challenges

01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:44.430
again, you will do a deployment without deployment will not

01:21:44.430 --> 01:21:49.490
complete even a single example. Fine. Now here, click on

01:21:49.490 --> 01:21:52.750
new, you must be able to see this green button new, right?

01:21:52.930 --> 01:21:55.490
So click on new. And just give a repository name. So let's

01:21:55.490 --> 01:21:59.910
suppose I'm giving a repository name as a API. Fine. So API

01:21:59.910 --> 01:22:02.810
is a repository name I'm giving. It's local to me by the

01:22:02.810 --> 01:22:05.690
way, right? So API is a repository name. I'm not going to

01:22:05.690 --> 01:22:09.330
give anything else. Leave all the options as it is. No need

01:22:09.330 --> 01:22:12.230
to change anything. And then click on create repository. So

01:22:12.230 --> 01:22:15.390
simple. You can give your name, whatever name that you want,

01:22:15.450 --> 01:22:20.470
you can give it to it. So click on create repository. Yeah.

01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:24.530
And then you will be able to find out these commands. These

01:22:24.530 --> 01:22:26.770
commands, you will be able to find out now these commands

01:22:26.770 --> 01:22:31.170
are going to help you out in terms of pushing your code into

01:22:31.170 --> 01:22:36.690
a GitHub repository. So here, right? So these commands,

01:22:36.850 --> 01:22:39.550
again, these commands are like the only four to five command

01:22:39.550 --> 01:22:42.810
you have to use. And then from the next time, only two or

01:22:42.810 --> 01:22:45.190
three command you will have to use. So what are the command?

01:22:45.390 --> 01:22:47.950
First of all, git init. So you have to initialize a git,

01:22:48.030 --> 01:22:52.490
then git add. So try to add your file into a buffer memory.

01:22:52.490 --> 01:22:57.810
Or like in between GitHub and your local, technically in a

01:22:57.810 --> 01:23:00.430
local basically. And commit means just try to send some sort

01:23:00.430 --> 01:23:03.090
of a message. Then branch means access the branch where

01:23:03.090 --> 01:23:06.350
you're trying to send your code. And this is nothing but

01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:09.130
this is a URL, the highlighted one. The selected one is

01:23:09.130 --> 01:23:13.150
nothing but it's a URL of this repository. So here you have

01:23:13.150 --> 01:23:16.710
to push the code, right? Where? Here. Here. You have to push

01:23:16.710 --> 01:23:20.030
the code. And then push means final. Push it. Let's do it

01:23:20.030 --> 01:23:22.930
one by one. Yeah, let's do it one by one. So first of all,

01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:27.810
you have to do what? So come to this side, come to your

01:23:27.810 --> 01:23:34.370
terminal, stop each and everything, right? And I'm going to

01:23:34.370 --> 01:23:38.490
do git init, initialize it, first of all, yeah, initialize

01:23:38.490 --> 01:23:42.010
it. So whatever is available inside this directory, this

01:23:42.010 --> 01:23:45.150
location, so where you are writing git init, so it will be

01:23:45.150 --> 01:23:48.350
able to initialize it. So initialize and color has changed.

01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:52.170
It is able to initialize it. Now I'm going to call git add

01:23:52.170 --> 01:23:56.530
and then over there. So it is written git add readme.md

01:23:56.530 --> 01:23:58.850
file. So readme file they are trying to add. So what I will

01:23:58.850 --> 01:24:03.010
do, I'll not write readme.md. So what I will do, git add dot

01:24:03.010 --> 01:24:06.170
means whatever file which is available, dot means whatever

01:24:06.170 --> 01:24:09.270
file is available in this directory, right? Add everything.

01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:14.150
Simple. Add everything. So here git add dot, hit enter. So

01:24:14.150 --> 01:24:19.130
simple added each and everything. Now. Now. So the next one

01:24:19.130 --> 01:24:22.910
is commit. Commit means, so you are trying to do some sort

01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:26.010
of a commit. You are trying to send some code, but you would

01:24:26.010 --> 01:24:28.650
like to write some message along with that. So that is the

01:24:28.650 --> 01:24:33.550
meaning of commitment. So commit. For example, you go and

01:24:33.550 --> 01:24:36.110
commit to your girlfriend or boyfriend, right? But that

01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:37.810
doesn't mean that you will get married. So the similar

01:24:37.810 --> 01:24:41.430
manners basically. So we are doing a commit that, okay,

01:24:41.450 --> 01:24:44.330
fine. So let's keep it inside the buffer. Doesn't mean that

01:24:44.330 --> 01:24:49.310
I'll try to push it inside the cloud. Okay. Or GitHub. Yeah.

01:24:49.630 --> 01:24:54.530
So I don't know whether that was a good or bad example, but

01:24:54.530 --> 01:24:59.290
yeah, this was something which came in my mind. Okay. Git C

01:24:59.290 --> 01:25:03.150
-M-M-I-T. Commit hyphen M is message. Yeah. Hyphen M is

01:25:03.150 --> 01:25:06.350
message by the way. And I can write a message over here. So

01:25:06.350 --> 01:25:11.150
inside my string. So this is my first code. Yeah. This is my

01:25:11.150 --> 01:25:16.110
first code and hit enter. So it is, it has committed into a

01:25:16.110 --> 01:25:19.370
buffer memory. As of now. Code is not available. It's in

01:25:19.370 --> 01:25:22.690
buffer. Now it's in bit. It's hung in between my system and

01:25:22.690 --> 01:25:25.450
the Git repository. So you can, you can think in that way,

01:25:25.530 --> 01:25:28.650
but in the repository code is not available. I have just

01:25:28.650 --> 01:25:31.630
committed. I've just committed. Yes. So committed, which

01:25:31.630 --> 01:25:33.750
file, this file, this file in this file. So whatever file

01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:36.370
was available, I'm just like, okay, fine. Let's do a commit.

01:25:36.490 --> 01:25:40.410
Yeah. So it is going to do a commit. Now once commit is

01:25:40.410 --> 01:25:43.610
done, right? Once this one is done, then you have to push a

01:25:43.610 --> 01:25:47.330
code. So where you have to push a code. So inside a Git,

01:25:47.390 --> 01:25:49.930
there is a concept of branching, which will eventually more

01:25:49.930 --> 01:25:53.410
and more clear. So once you will get involved into it. So by

01:25:53.410 --> 01:25:56.350
default, there is a main branch. So in main branch, we try

01:25:56.350 --> 01:26:01.090
to push the code. So Git branch, hyphen M and then main. So

01:26:01.090 --> 01:26:03.930
Git branch, hyphen M main. So in, so this is the location

01:26:03.930 --> 01:26:07.830
where I have to place the code. Now in a, what is the URL,

01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:11.250
how someone will be able to reach out to main branch, right?

01:26:11.310 --> 01:26:13.630
How someone will be able to reach out to main branch. So

01:26:13.630 --> 01:26:17.470
coming to the next code. So Git remote add origin and this

01:26:17.470 --> 01:26:21.590
is basically a place. This is basically a URL by which

01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:23.470
someone can reach out to the main branch. So for every

01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:26.130
repository, it's going to be different as you can see api

01:26:26.130 --> 01:26:29.010
.git. So this is something that Git has created. Now copy

01:26:29.010 --> 01:26:33.610
and then Git remote add origin, the URL only for the first

01:26:33.610 --> 01:26:38.410
time you have to do it now. So URL has been added. Now my

01:26:38.410 --> 01:26:41.510
system knows that where I have to send the code, whatever

01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:44.770
code that I have committed, right? Till commit, everything

01:26:44.770 --> 01:26:47.350
is going to happen in local. Then we are trying to add that

01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:50.470
global environment or Git you can say, right? So now my

01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:52.410
system knows that, okay, fine. So I have to send this

01:26:52.410 --> 01:26:55.990
particular code in this location, in this Git repository. So

01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:59.270
this is how system will get to know that, okay, fine. So I

01:26:59.270 --> 01:27:03.570
have to send a code over there and then finally, so push

01:27:03.570 --> 01:27:07.390
origin main, right? So what the origin that you have added,

01:27:07.470 --> 01:27:10.770
the main origin. So over there, Git push. So push the entire

01:27:10.770 --> 01:27:12.650
code. So this is the final step. This is the final step and

01:27:12.650 --> 01:27:16.790
it will push, as you can see, it has pushed, right? It has

01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:19.430
pushed all the code and here if you will come and if you'll

01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:22.010
try to refresh it, right? If you'll try to refresh it, you

01:27:22.010 --> 01:27:23.390
will be able to see all the code.

01:27:27.290 --> 01:27:28.010
Yes everyone,

01:27:32.210 --> 01:27:36.230
unable to do auto direct email address, just add it. So it

01:27:36.230 --> 01:27:38.510
is giving you this error, right? Git config global user

01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:42.030
email, right? So instead of writing, so just copy that one

01:27:42.030 --> 01:27:45.510
and wherever you are getting you at the rate example.com,

01:27:45.630 --> 01:27:50.050
try to put your email ID. Simple. In your name, try to put

01:27:50.050 --> 01:27:52.810
your, your name. For some of you, it is going to give this

01:27:52.810 --> 01:27:53.370
kind of a issue.

01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:11.700
Email issue resolved, right? Yeah, this is a, some of you

01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:14.880
are going to see that issue. Error specs, reference spec,

01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:20.060
main doesn't match any, okay. So some of you are facing even

01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:21.060
this kind of a issue.

01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:33.460
So just, just try to check your like a branch name

01:28:33.460 --> 01:28:37.620
basically. So your branch should be always a main. Those who

01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:40.980
are getting that source spec, main doesn't match, right? So

01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:42.780
you have written a grid. Okay.

01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:59.500
So after that, you have to add, you have to add basically

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:02.900
your, this one, this, but this is what your get a basically,

01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:06.080
right? This is technically your get. So you have to add it.

01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:09.940
For example, in my case, so what I have done, so I have

01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:13.380
basically done get remote origin, get remote, add origin,

01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:17.920
this one, my URL, right? So you have to do this. Get remote,

01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:21.540
add origin and after that push. So get push hyphen you

01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:25.260
origin main. All these codes are already available. Maybe

01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:27.900
you can create, go and create a new repository and then you

01:29:27.900 --> 01:29:30.920
can check that out. Right. They used to list all the

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:32.300
commands. So you don't have to even remember.

01:29:45.490 --> 01:29:48.830
Sayyed Vakruddin, I think you are using your companies or

01:29:48.830 --> 01:29:51.010
maybe some other repositories. That's the reason it's

01:29:51.010 --> 01:29:53.770
looking for the authentication in this way, such as such

01:29:53.770 --> 01:29:57.510
token. Just use your private GitHub account.

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:06.620
Yeah. Okay. So now guys, uh, we are, most of us are able to

01:30:06.620 --> 01:30:08.600
push the code. I think I know some of you will face the

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:11.240
issue, uh, which, uh, anyhow, we are going to resolve it in

01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:16.240
and out clearing, right? So now, uh, code is available

01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:20.720
inside my GitHub repository. So till this point I'm able to

01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:25.540
do it. So from local to GitHub, this is done right now

01:30:25.540 --> 01:30:28.860
render. So let's, let's go over there and let's see. So what

01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:30.720
kind of an issue we are going to face with respect to

01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:34.200
render. So here we'll come to render, right, we'll come to

01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:38.100
render, uh, now this code is available. I can see, uh, this

01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:41.880
is unnecessary code demo.ipunv file. This was not required

01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:46.020
technically, but I have pushed this code as well. Uh, that's

01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:49.800
okay. That's completely fine. Right now. So I can try to

01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:52.940
like, uh, create an application over here inside a render.

01:30:53.300 --> 01:30:56.700
So here I can try to click on new or maybe add new. It's

01:30:56.700 --> 01:31:00.040
completely fine. So click on new. Okay. And once you are

01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:04.220
going to click on new or maybe once you are going to click

01:31:04.220 --> 01:31:08.140
on add new, so you can try to choose a bev service maybe

01:31:08.140 --> 01:31:12.700
yes, bev service. So here just try to click on a bev service

01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:17.660
and then for the very first time, right, for the very first

01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:20.840
time, if you are doing it, it is going to ask you to attach

01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:25.340
your GitHub, right? Or maybe like any, any git provider. So

01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:28.480
it is going to do, ask you to do a sign up basically. Okay.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.860
So just try to do a sign up. And once you are going to do a

01:31:31.860 --> 01:31:35.680
sign up over here, it is going to show all the repository.

01:31:35.900 --> 01:31:38.340
So let's suppose I have a 34 repository in this GitHub

01:31:38.340 --> 01:31:41.520
account, right? And just now I have created this one API

01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:45.020
repository where I have pushed my code, a new code. So it is

01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:51.120
showing me all of my repos, fine guys, yeah. Repeating once

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:55.560
again, click on new or maybe add new, click on bev service,

01:31:55.900 --> 01:31:58.720
right? So once you are going to click on bev service. Bev

01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:01.440
service always, right? Second option. So once you are going

01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:03.700
to click on web service, you will come on this particular

01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:07.100
page. Now if you are coming here for the very first time, it

01:32:07.100 --> 01:32:10.880
is going to ask you to attach your GitHub. Click and then

01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:14.100
attach the same GitHub account. It will be able to render

01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:17.180
all your like a repository. Let's suppose I have a 10, 20,

01:32:17.180 --> 01:32:19.860
hundreds of repository. It will be able to render. So just

01:32:19.860 --> 01:32:22.940
give authorization that, okay, fine. So you are authorized

01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:27.420
to access my GitHub account. So give authorization. And now

01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:30.380
once you will be able to give the authorization, then

01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:34.100
basically it is like going to show you all the repository,

01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:42.240
yes, all the repository, fine. So many of you are saying,

01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:44.960
yes, you are able to see all the repository. Repo should be

01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:47.840
public, no, it is private. You are authorizing it, right? So

01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:54.700
even private repository, it will be able to access, yes. You

01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:56.900
are authorizing it. Technically you are authorizing it,

01:32:56.940 --> 01:32:59.720
means you are bypassing your password and authentication. So

01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:04.350
even private and public, it will be able to list down. So

01:33:04.350 --> 01:33:06.710
you can keep your repo private as well. No need to like keep

01:33:06.710 --> 01:33:10.190
it public. Okay, fine. Cool. So here my API repository,

01:33:10.390 --> 01:33:12.750
which I have created just five minutes back, right? So which

01:33:12.750 --> 01:33:15.470
is like been shown over here. So just try to select this

01:33:15.470 --> 01:33:19.670
API, right? So what is the repository name? API. Fine. It is

01:33:19.670 --> 01:33:22.750
able to select automatically and select means what? Source

01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:25.990
code. It will be able to pull all the source code into this

01:33:25.990 --> 01:33:28.490
machine, the render machine that we have, right? So in the

01:33:28.490 --> 01:33:30.630
render machine, it will be able to pull all the source code.

01:33:30.630 --> 01:33:32.690
As you can see. So source code, it will be able to access

01:33:32.690 --> 01:33:35.930
from where? From here. It will be able to access it. Now

01:33:35.930 --> 01:33:39.790
language. So which language you have used basically? So

01:33:39.790 --> 01:33:43.990
Python, right? So okay. Keep it as it is. Python. Fine. If

01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:46.430
you are using some other language, maybe a Node, maybe a Go,

01:33:46.490 --> 01:33:48.930
maybe Elixir, maybe a Docker container, you are trying to

01:33:48.930 --> 01:33:51.210
use Ruby or Rust. So you can go ahead with that. But as of

01:33:51.210 --> 01:33:54.170
now, it's like a Python. Okay. So I'll select Python, which

01:33:54.170 --> 01:33:57.890
is a default one. In which branch you have a code. So if

01:33:57.890 --> 01:34:00.090
you'll go over here, what is the branch that you are able to

01:34:00.090 --> 01:34:03.210
see? It's a main branch, right? Going forward as we'll move.

01:34:03.310 --> 01:34:06.150
So you will learn a lot in terms of like a branching,

01:34:06.150 --> 01:34:08.670
forking and then merging the branches, conflict resolution,

01:34:09.010 --> 01:34:11.490
all of those things you will be able to learn. But as of

01:34:11.490 --> 01:34:14.270
now, where my code is, in which branch? In a main branch,

01:34:14.430 --> 01:34:17.450
right? As you can see here itself. So in a main branch.

01:34:17.550 --> 01:34:20.490
Going forward, I'll even show you that how in a same branch

01:34:20.490 --> 01:34:23.710
you can keep backend and frontend and then separately you

01:34:23.710 --> 01:34:26.150
can deploy a backend, separately you can deploy a frontend

01:34:26.150 --> 01:34:29.490
because this is what we do. Even in real life, this is what

01:34:29.490 --> 01:34:33.590
we do. But as of now, I should not like think much about it.

01:34:33.670 --> 01:34:37.070
So just do it. So here, main branch and by default, main

01:34:37.070 --> 01:34:40.330
branch will be selected, right? By default, main branch will

01:34:40.330 --> 01:34:44.230
be selected. As simple as that. Now, all these things are

01:34:44.230 --> 01:34:46.490
default. We are not like changing anything. If you would

01:34:46.490 --> 01:34:48.930
like to change the name, you can do it. Like it is not going

01:34:48.930 --> 01:34:52.070
to harm you, but yeah, you can leave it as it is. Now build

01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:55.390
command. So build command means, so whenever it is trying to

01:34:55.390 --> 01:34:58.710
spin the machine, whenever it is trying to allocate our

01:34:58.710 --> 01:35:02.430
resources. So what kind of a setup it is supposed to do?

01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:06.570
Means what kind of an installation it is supposed to do? So

01:35:06.570 --> 01:35:09.290
if you remember, so we have attached what we have attached

01:35:09.290 --> 01:35:11.990
requirement.txt file and by default it will give you this,

01:35:12.090 --> 01:35:14.550
right? By default. So we have attached what we have attached

01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:17.610
requirement.txt file and what we have mentioned inside it,

01:35:17.690 --> 01:35:22.150
the installation, right? So let's suppose for my project

01:35:22.150 --> 01:35:25.230
fast api and uvcon is required. Yeah. For my project, fast

01:35:25.230 --> 01:35:27.770
api and uvcon is required. So I've already mentioned this

01:35:27.770 --> 01:35:31.590
fast api and uvcon. Yes, everyone. So I've already mentioned

01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:34.790
this fast api and uvcon over here. So by default, what it

01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:37.270
will do when it will try to spin the machine, start the

01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:40.350
machine for you, for your project, right? It will try to do

01:35:40.350 --> 01:35:42.850
the installations. Let's suppose I have mentioned maybe 10,

01:35:42.910 --> 01:35:46.650
20, hundreds of libraries. So in that machine, the instance,

01:35:46.770 --> 01:35:49.850
the resource which it is going to allocate inside a machine.

01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:52.990
So in that one, it will try to install each and everything

01:35:52.990 --> 01:35:55.690
that you have mentioned over here. This is the meaning of

01:35:55.690 --> 01:36:00.370
this one. Yes. Okay. Now start command. So let's suppose we

01:36:00.370 --> 01:36:03.770
have like a done, it is able to prepare the machine. Your

01:36:03.770 --> 01:36:08.770
code is available. Now when we have to start, means when we

01:36:08.770 --> 01:36:11.370
have to launch the application. So what is the command that

01:36:11.370 --> 01:36:17.390
we have given guys? Yeah. So what is the command that we

01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:22.060
have given? It's like a Docker image. No Docker image is a

01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:24.100
different option. I'll show you going forward. What is

01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:26.960
Docker? So basically we have given like a, someone is saying

01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:29.140
nothing. How we have given nothing. So what is the start

01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:31.540
command for us in our local system? How we have launched the

01:36:31.540 --> 01:36:35.080
application? So it was a UV corn, right? So you will call

01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:37.820
and then file name and then like a app and then like a,

01:36:37.820 --> 01:36:40.900
something like this we have given, right? Okay. So maybe,

01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:45.020
maybe I can try to give the same thing. So you will call,

01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:50.900
you will call over here, right? And then maybe we can try to

01:36:50.900 --> 01:36:53.620
give something like this. So here,

01:36:56.290 --> 01:37:02.010
our app name is my app. The file name is testing T S T I N G

01:37:02.010 --> 01:37:05.390
testing. So testing app holds this on port number. This one.

01:37:05.450 --> 01:37:09.890
So over here you can try to define this. I have just pinged

01:37:09.890 --> 01:37:13.390
you change your file name, your file name and my will must

01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:16.310
be different, right? Or maybe it might be different. So just

01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:20.150
change your file name. My file name is testing. So you just

01:37:20.150 --> 01:37:22.590
have to change your file name, host and port number is going

01:37:22.590 --> 01:37:23.950
to be like same.

01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:28.420
Yeah.

01:37:32.490 --> 01:37:35.010
Port and host. It's got 0, 0, 0. Means you are allowing

01:37:35.010 --> 01:37:37.230
traffic from everywhere. This is the meaning of this one. 0,

01:37:37.270 --> 01:37:40.710
0, 0, 0. Port number you can change. You can maybe 10,001, 8

01:37:40.710 --> 01:37:43.530
,001, 3,000 series, 6,000 series, whatever you want. You can

01:37:43.530 --> 01:37:47.410
just like a try to give it. Yeah. Can I give a multiple

01:37:47.410 --> 01:37:50.470
command? No. For one server, obviously there will be only

01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:53.870
one entry point, right? There will be only one entry point.

01:37:54.070 --> 01:37:55.350
So this is the entry point.

01:37:59.630 --> 01:38:02.310
Fine. So this is the command guys. I have already pinged you

01:38:02.310 --> 01:38:06.830
inside your chat box. Just change, just change this like a

01:38:06.830 --> 01:38:10.770
file name. My file name is testing. And hope by this time we

01:38:10.770 --> 01:38:12.870
all understand this part. So my file name is testing

01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:15.790
whatever file name that you have to give that file name. And

01:38:15.790 --> 01:38:19.030
then for hobby project, select this free. Yeah. So this

01:38:19.030 --> 01:38:21.570
free, otherwise it is going to charge you. So at this free,

01:38:21.690 --> 01:38:26.830
uh, now, so you don't have to do anything, click on deploy

01:38:26.830 --> 01:38:29.710
the web services. And if everything is going to work fine,

01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:34.050
you will be able to see a deployment in some time. And if

01:38:34.050 --> 01:38:36.670
there will be an error, you will be able to see an error as

01:38:36.670 --> 01:38:38.810
well. So now it has started deploying. So. So first of all,

01:38:38.850 --> 01:38:42.170
what it will do, it will clone it from the GitHub. As you

01:38:42.170 --> 01:38:47.330
can see inside this, uh, uh, log that it is trying to pull

01:38:47.330 --> 01:38:51.470
the code first of all. So from a GitHub, it is connecting,

01:38:51.670 --> 01:38:54.210
it is trying to pull the code and then one by one uploading

01:38:54.210 --> 01:38:56.550
in three seconds, a building. So build successful

01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:58.890
immediately, right? So it's, it's a very light weighted

01:38:58.890 --> 01:39:01.310
project. So immediately, just in a fraction of a second, it

01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:03.370
is able to build it in some of the project is going to take

01:39:03.370 --> 01:39:09.040
some time running UV con test app host this, this, this at a

01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:09.620
port number. So it is going to take some time running UV con

01:39:09.620 --> 01:39:10.600
test app host this, this, this at a port number. 10,000.

01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:14.680
Okay. That's amazing. Right? So, and within a fraction of a

01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:18.240
second, you can see that I'm able to get alive. Are you able

01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:22.420
to see live guys? Are you, are you able to see live this,

01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:29.420
this one? Yeah. So this app is live. This app is live means

01:39:29.420 --> 01:39:33.880
whatever was working in my local, not global, not global

01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:38.400
technically. And it's live now in my local system, the URL

01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:42.180
was local. Okay. So this is the URL, host, colon, whatever

01:39:42.180 --> 01:39:44.240
port number that I have given, right? This was the URL

01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:48.320
basically. Yes. This was the URL, total URL, right? Now

01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:54.100
here, this is the URL. This is the URL simple, which is a

01:39:54.100 --> 01:39:57.800
global one, which is a HTTPS URL. Yeah. So now let's go

01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:01.500
ahead and test it that whether it's working or not. So here,

01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:06.040
right? So everything is live. Everything is up and running

01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:08.940
in a fraction of second. Now, if I'm going to hit this URL.

01:40:08.940 --> 01:40:12.740
The URL, which I'm able to see. So okay. That's cool. Now

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:15.960
slash, if I have to use a swagger UI because it's a fast

01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:19.220
API, right? So DOCS, the way we were doing it in a local

01:40:19.220 --> 01:40:23.300
local host port number, similarly, I have a URL, which is a

01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:28.280
global one and I'm able to get my put and delete on this

01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:32.420
URL. Yeah. Now you guys can even try this out. My URL,

01:40:32.540 --> 01:40:34.720
because now it's global, it's on cloud now.

01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:40.460
Doing it first time. This is excellent. I'm a hundred

01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:42.560
percent sure. I will be learning a lot of things in it. A

01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:45.680
lot. I mean like we have not even started properly. Believe

01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:48.340
me, I'm still like trying to give a classes where we are

01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:49.160
building a base.

01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:56.050
Yes. So now my entire backend, this is called as backend

01:40:56.050 --> 01:40:58.310
deployment. There is no UI, right? So basically we have

01:40:58.310 --> 01:41:03.030
deployed our APIs. Now anyone can consume this API. I can

01:41:03.030 --> 01:41:08.750
test this API in any way I want from a postman, from this

01:41:08.750 --> 01:41:13.130
swagger UI, from the curl command. Anyone can call your

01:41:13.130 --> 01:41:17.590
this, this is the API guys, this is the API, right? The live

01:41:17.590 --> 01:41:23.270
API we are able to see and we know that out, right? So let's

01:41:23.270 --> 01:41:26.690
suppose if I have to access maybe update user, right? We

01:41:26.690 --> 01:41:30.030
know the route. This is the route. So this URL, this URL

01:41:30.030 --> 01:41:33.230
slash user DB slash data slash V one slash update, pass the

01:41:33.230 --> 01:41:37.450
user ID done, right? If I have to lead something, do the

01:41:37.450 --> 01:41:40.070
same thing. If I have to post form some sort of a get or

01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:43.390
post operation that we have done yesterday, do it because

01:41:43.390 --> 01:41:46.310
now we understand what is the route, right? Now we

01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:48.150
understand what is the route, how we can try to pass the

01:41:48.150 --> 01:41:51.610
data, like how, what is the meaning of a body, how, what is

01:41:51.610 --> 01:41:53.830
the meaning of passing a data through a URL. Now we

01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:57.690
understand all of these things and that too. Now my API is

01:41:57.690 --> 01:41:57.990
global.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:04.980
Simple application hosted in cloud. Yeah. So whatever was

01:42:04.980 --> 01:42:06.860
running in my local system, now it's live. That's it.

01:42:08.460 --> 01:42:09.040
Nothing much.

01:42:12.390 --> 01:42:13.030
Yes, everyone.

01:42:16.460 --> 01:42:21.320
I can see that it has changed to HTTPS. Yeah. So now it

01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:23.160
become a HTTPS secured one.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.660
Yeah. So are we, are we able to do it guys? How many of you

01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:31.660
are able to do it? How many of you are able to see your

01:42:31.660 --> 01:42:38.520
Swagger UI live and you all are able to get the URL. Now let

01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:43.220
me enable a chat to everyone working for me. Done. I am

01:42:43.220 --> 01:42:48.400
done. Okay. Fine. UV con commander, UVI, C O R N command not

01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:53.040
found. So maybe you have not done a like a kept. A UV con

01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:56.620
here. Maybe you are not keeping UV con inside your

01:42:56.620 --> 01:42:58.740
requirement or TXT. So it will not be able to find out

01:42:58.740 --> 01:43:02.480
because it was not able to install. Okay. So for most of you

01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:05.320
working, could not open the requirement files, there are no

01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:08.340
search file directory. R E Q U I R E M E N T S dot TXT.

01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:11.840
Yeah. So if you don't have a file, then that's a error. So

01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:14.640
try to push that particular file, try to push a requirement

01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:15.140
or TXT.

01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:20.820
Can't we use a reload option on render? See what is the

01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:23.760
meaning of reload option? First of all, tell me. Okay. So

01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:26.060
the meaning of load option was very simple that whenever you

01:43:26.060 --> 01:43:28.920
are, let's suppose you are, you have already executed a UV

01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:31.340
con command means your API is up and running now in between

01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:33.900
you are making some changes. So whenever you will do control

01:43:33.900 --> 01:43:37.080
S it will try to refresh the entire API so that new changes

01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:39.880
it will be able to adopt in a cloud. It's not required in a

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:42.660
cloud. So if you are going to push some code, so basically

01:43:42.660 --> 01:43:46.500
we go ahead with the restart service or deploy the latest

01:43:46.500 --> 01:43:49.160
commit. This option we have, right? Deploy a latest commit

01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:52.460
and yeah, I can see all the hits. So like so many people are

01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:55.080
trying to hit my API. And I can, I can see all the hits over

01:43:55.080 --> 01:44:01.000
here. So many people see 200, 200, 200, 200, 200. So we are,

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:01.920
we are able to get the hits.

01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:15.880
It's live now, sir. Yes. Amazing.

01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:21.500
If you can show one more time connecting render to a GitHub,

01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:25.480
it's again nothing. So click on new, click on web services,

01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:28.140
right? And then here, if you're connecting for the very

01:44:28.140 --> 01:44:31.280
first time, so it is, it is going to give you an, like a

01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:34.440
link over here, right? So let's suppose this is the one,

01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:38.740
right? So this one. Okay. So just click over there. It will

01:44:38.740 --> 01:44:41.120
try to pop up the window to give you the authorization, give

01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:43.540
the authorization done only this much, two clicks.

01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:50.460
Can we neglect ng-rock with this approach? See ng-rock is

01:44:50.460 --> 01:44:53.740
basically a port forwarding solution. So if something is

01:44:53.740 --> 01:44:56.500
working in your local, it's still, it's in local, right?

01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:59.360
It's still local. Once your system will go off, let's

01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:02.120
suppose if you are going to shut down your system, it will

01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:06.660
be off. But now this is a cloud. It will keep on up, running

01:45:06.660 --> 01:45:10.100
up and running. Even if I'm going to shut down my system. My

01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:12.600
APIs now will be up and running, even if I'm going to shut

01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:15.560
down my system, because now there is no dependencies, there

01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:19.540
is no linkage with my local system. Whereas in case of ng

01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:23.520
-rock, if you're going to shut down your laptop, it's gone.

01:45:24.420 --> 01:45:27.960
So that was a testing solution by the way. So where you can

01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:31.220
try to, you know, do a port forwarding means whatever is

01:45:31.220 --> 01:45:34.240
running in your particular port, you are just exposing it to

01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:37.200
the outer world. So that was not a deployment solution. That

01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:40.660
was a port forwarding solution. Which generally we use at

01:45:40.660 --> 01:45:41.360
the time of testing.

01:45:44.570 --> 01:45:49.870
Now get and post user in this file. What is the package

01:45:49.870 --> 01:45:51.270
file? Is it necessary? No, not necessary.

01:46:00.250 --> 01:46:01.190
Fine guys. Done.

01:46:06.620 --> 01:46:09.100
Can you teach us docker also? Yeah, I will. I will be like

01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:12.020
doing, I'll be converting some of the application into a

01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:14.820
docker and then I'll show you how to deploy the docker. I

01:46:14.820 --> 01:46:16.860
have already done that. If you'll go and check my others

01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:19.880
lecture, right? Whatever you are asking, it's already done.

01:46:20.020 --> 01:46:21.920
All those lectures are already available, but yeah, even in

01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:25.940
your class, the live classes, will be done. Fine. So now

01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:29.600
successfully guys, successfully we are able to deploy our

01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:34.560
application on render. Although it was a very small one,

01:46:34.620 --> 01:46:38.980
just API, but I believe we are able to get some sort of a

01:46:38.980 --> 01:46:43.200
confidence, right guys? So GitHub, render, local API

01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:48.840
testing, meaning of APIs, put get post delete, yeah.

01:46:54.980 --> 01:46:57.980
So now at least we are like familiar with couple of things,

01:46:58.100 --> 01:47:00.620
right? We'll render also having a database hosting

01:47:00.620 --> 01:47:03.440
connection with API access. So render will not give you a

01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:06.360
direct database like a options by the way. So you have to

01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:09.440
like go ahead with some external database and connect it

01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:10.000
inside the code.

01:47:19.460 --> 01:47:22.140
This platform is great. Also support auto deploy without

01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:26.160
configuring, yeah. Now most of the platforms deployment

01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:29.240
wise, it's like almost same, like they are giving you a best

01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:31.660
possible services where within two, three clicks you will be

01:47:31.660 --> 01:47:34.140
able to do the deployment and then whenever you're going to

01:47:34.140 --> 01:47:37.380
make a changes into a code, it will call, the auto

01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:40.000
deployment, right? It will try to call the auto deployments

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.660
and most of the platforms are like that nowadays. So it's

01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:45.680
not difficult to basically, it's just a one time game. So if

01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:48.640
you are able to do it once in one platform, you will be able

01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:50.020
to do it again and again and again.

01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:04.500
Okay. So now this part is done and our API is live and you

01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:07.900
can test the API, use curl, use postman, use URL, use

01:48:07.900 --> 01:48:11.320
Python, whatever you want, just use it, right? So we know

01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:13.660
the testing now and we understand all of these things. We

01:48:13.660 --> 01:48:17.020
understand the fundamentals. Now coming to the next part

01:48:17.020 --> 01:48:20.680
guys. So as we are able to do a deployment, closing this

01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:25.020
entire things, right? Closing this entire things and now

01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:32.760
let's come to Euron, yeah. Now come to URI API. So now we

01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:36.240
understand the meaning of APIs. So hopefully you all will be

01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:39.900
able to understand that how URI API is going to work. So let

01:48:39.900 --> 01:48:43.480
me give you a complete introduction about the URI API. So

01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:43.480
let me give you a complete introduction about the URI API.

01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:48.020
So see, we have a chat solution, right? We have a chat

01:48:48.020 --> 01:48:51.820
solution, URI, so which is same as your any other chat

01:48:51.820 --> 01:48:54.720
solution in a market where you can ask a question, it will

01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:57.480
be able to give you the answer. You will be able to even

01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:00.940
upload our images. You will be even upload a speech over

01:49:00.940 --> 01:49:04.280
here. You can do even a real time web search. So just click

01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:07.000
over here, select it and then real time web search. You will

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:11.520
be even able to execute a code, a basic one basically so you

01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:14.420
don't have to copy and paste into some IDs. Here itself, you

01:49:14.420 --> 01:49:17.460
will be able to execute the code. You will be able to upload

01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:21.020
any kind of files or even screenshot directly from here

01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:23.180
itself capture option. So we have given you all those

01:49:23.180 --> 01:49:26.660
options and you will be able to even share. So let's suppose

01:49:26.660 --> 01:49:29.280
you are doing some research and you would like to share this

01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:31.880
entire page. Let's suppose I have done this research, right?

01:49:31.900 --> 01:49:34.520
Something like that. And I would like to basically like a

01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:37.120
share this entire information. So I have this share option

01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:40.160
as well. So without login, people will be able to copy this

01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:44.740
link and people will be able to. Okay. Like share it with

01:49:44.740 --> 01:49:49.440
everyone, right? And recently GPT-5 model has been released,

01:49:49.580 --> 01:49:53.180
which I say it's an umbrella model. So we have attached GPT

01:49:53.180 --> 01:49:58.220
-5 as well. I still like 4.0 and 4.1 because it's just an

01:49:58.220 --> 01:50:00.020
umbrella model. So it is trying to make a decision

01:50:00.020 --> 01:50:03.260
automatically that which now, and yeah, the best part is

01:50:03.260 --> 01:50:05.360
that it is trying to do some sort of a research before it,

01:50:05.420 --> 01:50:08.600
but I believe it's like a combination of previous model.

01:50:08.700 --> 01:50:11.920
It's not a new one that they have trained, but yeah, that

01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:13.800
that's a claim that they're trying to make. So let's not get

01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:16.660
into that discussion. So here you will be able to share. So

01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:19.560
this is basically a URI system which has been given to you

01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:24.300
so that it will be able to fulfill a need of AI because some

01:50:24.300 --> 01:50:27.120
platform is giving you free. Some platform is going to give

01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:30.340
you a charges. Some is charging $20 this, that blah, blah,

01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:34.600
right? And user gets confused. We have created a unified

01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:38.080
platform, one place access, whatever you want, right?

01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:41.300
Whatever you want. You are looking for Google's like deep

01:50:41.300 --> 01:50:43.980
search, do it. You are looking for real time web search. Do

01:50:43.980 --> 01:50:46.680
it. You are looking for image generation. Do it. Quote

01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:50.540
interpretation. Do it right in the exact same way you are

01:50:50.540 --> 01:50:52.920
looking for this, everything, everything will be done. So

01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:55.340
this is where URI comes into a picture where we have

01:50:55.340 --> 01:50:59.540
basically hosted some of the model on our own and we are

01:50:59.540 --> 01:51:03.240
using some of the proprietary API, for example, GPTs, right?

01:51:03.300 --> 01:51:07.000
Five and four O four series and five series. So basically

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:11.260
this is a proprietary model. Now we can't access a model

01:51:11.260 --> 01:51:14.940
directly. We have to access through an API. So we have

01:51:14.940 --> 01:51:18.480
integrated through an API, whereas this Lama deep seek,

01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:20.960
right? These are the open source model weights are already

01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:23.540
available on hugging face. Waits are available on Ulama.

01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:27.180
Waits are already available. So those model we have deployed

01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:32.220
on our instances and then we are hitting our, whenever you

01:51:32.220 --> 01:51:35.320
are going to select Lama or maybe some other. So it is

01:51:35.320 --> 01:51:39.300
hitting our instances where we have deployed right where we

01:51:39.300 --> 01:51:41.980
have deployed. Now, if you would like to know. More about

01:51:41.980 --> 01:51:45.980
these deployment and how it is going to happen. So I don't

01:51:45.980 --> 01:51:48.180
know whether you have gone through those videos or not. So I

01:51:48.180 --> 01:51:50.520
have published those videos in your group yesterday itself.

01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:55.020
And even Dave Forrester days, right? So where I have shown

01:51:55.020 --> 01:51:58.620
you that how you will be able to deploy the model, it was

01:51:58.620 --> 01:52:00.780
very simple approach in a very simplistic way. I have like

01:52:00.780 --> 01:52:04.600
shown that and Dave Forrester days. So I have basically like

01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:07.580
even shown you that how you will be able to deploy this kind

01:52:07.580 --> 01:52:10.880
of a UI. So if you're interested, go with that. But yeah.

01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:14.020
I'm just trying to talk you talk about the behind the scene

01:52:14.020 --> 01:52:16.540
mechanism that how this things are all actually working

01:52:16.540 --> 01:52:21.200
right in a layman way. Now so this is one part right where

01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:23.480
you will be able to come and you will be able to chat. The

01:52:23.480 --> 01:52:27.800
another part inside your own is a API ecosystem now. So from

01:52:27.800 --> 01:52:32.240
next class onwards without this API, you will not be able to

01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:36.500
build even a single system in generative AI. Generative AI

01:52:36.500 --> 01:52:40.600
simply means that you need an access of LLMs. Doesn't matter

01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:42.920
you are learning here, you are learning somewhere else,

01:52:43.060 --> 01:52:48.040
doesn't matter at all. You need an API access, right? You

01:52:48.040 --> 01:52:51.000
need an API access. Now to get those API access because

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:54.080
sometime you need open AI access, sometime you need Gemini,

01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:57.260
sometime you need a llama, sometime you need for API access

01:52:57.260 --> 01:52:59.860
for embedding, sometime you need API access for image

01:52:59.860 --> 01:53:03.300
generation, sometime you need API access for text to speech.

01:53:04.100 --> 01:53:07.180
There are lot, right? There are lot. There are different,

01:53:07.220 --> 01:53:10.060
different kind of use cases into a generative AI. AI and

01:53:10.060 --> 01:53:13.920
without LLM not even a single believe me not even a single

01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:16.740
application not even a smallest one you will be able to

01:53:16.740 --> 01:53:20.560
build in a generative AI without a LLM access because

01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:24.460
generative AI is all about LLMs actually right all about

01:53:24.460 --> 01:53:28.760
LLMs. So this is and like students used to go here used to

01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:31.980
go there some APIs are free some of them are giving you a

01:53:31.980 --> 01:53:34.900
little bit of free credit and then you have to like go for

01:53:34.900 --> 01:53:38.120
the payment. Now here we have created this entire ecosystem

01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:41.140
where everything is sorted. Everything is sorted means

01:53:41.140 --> 01:53:43.520
literally everything is sorted. Now what is sorted? Let me

01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:46.480
talk about that. You are looking for some API from OpenAI

01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:50.620
right a different different model even five GPT-5 latest one

01:53:50.620 --> 01:53:53.260
which was released just two days two days back right. You

01:53:53.260 --> 01:53:58.200
have an access OSS 20 billion OSS 120 billion which was open

01:53:58.200 --> 01:54:01.820
source recently right. So even that is available embedding

01:54:01.820 --> 01:54:04.920
that is available. So from OpenAI it's available. From

01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:08.220
Google it's available. You have an access of real time web

01:54:08.220 --> 01:54:11.640
search model as well inside a Google right real time web

01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:16.100
search model as well Gemini embedding model as well. Now so

01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:19.640
if you are looking for some API access from a Meta, Lama

01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:23.480
series that is also available right Lama series from a deep

01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:28.940
seek Chinese model that is also available Alibaba this is

01:54:28.940 --> 01:54:31.900
also a quen model available Mistral this is also available.

01:54:32.160 --> 01:54:36.000
So all famous one. All famous one black forest lab basically

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:40.560
this has been used for a like a generating images. So this

01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:45.000
is available play.ai for like a TTS text to speech. So this

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:49.980
is also available. So all of these models which you need for

01:54:49.980 --> 01:54:53.720
sure and without that you will not be able to do any kind of

01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:56.780
application in a generative AI not even the smallest one.

01:54:58.460 --> 01:55:01.900
It's already available and it's already sorted for all of

01:55:01.900 --> 01:55:04.820
you so that you will be able to build any kind of MVPs. You

01:55:04.820 --> 01:55:06.980
will be able to build any kind of POCs and any kind of a

01:55:06.980 --> 01:55:10.440
product and then you can deploy it because all of these are

01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:15.780
live for 24 by 7 right. So going so all of these model

01:55:15.780 --> 01:55:18.540
cities we are going to use it one by one one by one one by

01:55:18.540 --> 01:55:24.060
one right. But to use it you need an access. So now we

01:55:24.060 --> 01:55:27.500
understand API right. Now we understand API. Now whatever

01:55:27.500 --> 01:55:30.520
API that we have created. So we were having just an end

01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:34.440
point right. Endpoint. So some URL by which I will be able

01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:38.200
to access here to access your model. You have to give an API

01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:42.380
key means to access model you are accessing model means

01:55:42.380 --> 01:55:46.240
what. So let's suppose I had a model I have kept it on my

01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:50.000
platform and there is a function I have created. So whenever

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:53.660
you are hitting my model you are trying to pass some values

01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:56.500
right that give me this data. Give me that data. Tell me

01:55:56.500 --> 01:55:58.700
about data science something like this right when you are

01:55:58.700 --> 01:56:02.300
trying to pass as a data as an input. So this is going to

01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:05.640
get into my function. My function is trying to give an input

01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:08.480
into a model. Now my function is trying to give a return and

01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:11.560
that return you will be able to see. I believe that's a core

01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:16.180
philosophy behind API right everyone. That's a core

01:56:16.180 --> 01:56:19.080
philosophy behind API right. This is something that we have

01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:23.060
we are discussing since yesterday's class yeah that you will

01:56:23.060 --> 01:56:26.400
give the input. API means what. So there is some function

01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:29.220
sitting on some server or some machine. You will give an

01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:31.680
input. It will try to execute that function and eventually

01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:34.160
that function is doing what. That function is trying to load

01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:36.960
a model. If you are trying to call maybe an OpenAI model

01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:39.780
maybe a Mistral model maybe a Lama model. So that function

01:56:39.780 --> 01:56:43.620
is trying to basically put that data into that model. Model

01:56:43.620 --> 01:56:46.360
is giving me response right. So function will give a return

01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:49.680
and that return as a user I will be able to see. That's a

01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:53.180
core philosophy. That's the whole idea. Now to access that

01:56:53.180 --> 01:56:57.040
function you need an API key because we have like a secure

01:56:57.040 --> 01:56:59.440
audit right. We have without authorization. You have a

01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:00.960
security. You will not be able to access it. How to create

01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:04.600
an API key. So it's very simple. Just one click fraction of

01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:07.540
second you will be able to create an API key over here just

01:57:07.540 --> 01:57:10.820
like any other international platform right. On single API

01:57:10.820 --> 01:57:13.820
key only one API key you need and you will be able to access

01:57:13.820 --> 01:57:16.700
all the series of model. So it is not like you have to come

01:57:16.700 --> 01:57:18.500
and create an API key again and again and again. You can

01:57:18.500 --> 01:57:22.860
create multiple that's okay right but only one. So click

01:57:22.860 --> 01:57:26.620
create an API key give any kind of a name xyg right and this

01:57:26.620 --> 01:57:29.340
API key will be created. You can copy it and now you can use

01:57:29.340 --> 01:57:33.280
it and this API key you will be able to use it for all the

01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:36.460
model right. This API key you will be able to use for all

01:57:36.460 --> 01:57:40.140
the model. You can even delete it right. Now so let's

01:57:40.140 --> 01:57:43.560
suppose here I have given you one example right. Here we

01:57:43.560 --> 01:57:46.340
have given you one example a curl. Now we all understand

01:57:46.340 --> 01:57:49.980
curl. We can try to use the same thing even in a like a

01:57:49.980 --> 01:57:53.840
postman right. So this is let's suppose a curl which is

01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:56.040
given to me. Now what is the meaning of this curl. Let me

01:57:56.040 --> 01:57:58.860
explain it to you. Yesterday. I have explained but let me

01:57:58.860 --> 01:58:01.880
explain it to you once again. So what is the meaning of this

01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:07.980
curl. So curl means command to execute some URL post. So we

01:58:07.980 --> 01:58:10.900
understand the post method basically. So basically method is

01:58:10.900 --> 01:58:16.180
basically post and we are trying to hit this URL. Hit this

01:58:16.180 --> 01:58:20.400
URL means what at this place my function is available. This

01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:24.340
is the meaning of this URL right and this function that you

01:58:24.340 --> 01:58:28.040
are trying to execute. It needs a header. It needs a header.

01:58:28.180 --> 01:58:31.080
What kind of a header. So inside a header you have to pass

01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:35.780
your API key. So you have to replace this with the sorry my

01:58:35.780 --> 01:58:39.940
bad. So you have to basically replace this with the API key

01:58:39.940 --> 01:58:43.160
that you have created. So this API key that you have created

01:58:43.160 --> 01:58:46.880
because it's an authorization. So here you have to replace

01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:50.000
this particular part with this one fine you have to replace

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:53.820
this one with this one and then hyphen D hyphen D means what

01:58:53.820 --> 01:58:57.540
you are calling a post request. So you are sending a data as

01:58:57.540 --> 01:59:00.540
a body. What data you are trying to send, what input you are

01:59:00.540 --> 01:59:02.720
trying to send into your function. So this is the input that

01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:04.840
you are sending into a function. So you are sending

01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:08.220
basically two things to parameter. One is a message. Another

01:59:08.220 --> 01:59:12.720
one is a model that okay. So this is the message right and

01:59:12.720 --> 01:59:17.780
this is the model. So this model you are supposed to hit. So

01:59:17.780 --> 01:59:21.680
this is technically a model ID now here. So if I would like

01:59:21.680 --> 01:59:25.460
to use some other model ID, I will be able to use it. I'll

01:59:25.460 --> 01:59:28.020
show it to you. So GPT-5 nano 2025, this is the recent

01:59:28.020 --> 01:59:31.720
model. So just call it and then just like we do a curl right

01:59:31.720 --> 01:59:37.200
command prompt. Let's try to open up the command prompt and

01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:43.190
from a command prompt, let's hit it and let's see. Yeah. So

01:59:43.190 --> 01:59:46.390
see I'm able to get some output right. I'm able to see get

01:59:46.390 --> 01:59:49.790
some output. So content was hello and it has given me some

01:59:49.790 --> 01:59:53.830
response. So message role assistance this content and it is

01:59:53.830 --> 01:59:58.930
giving me hi there, something like this. So it is, it is

01:59:58.930 --> 02:00:02.050
telling me hi there. So I'm able to get the response, right?

02:00:02.090 --> 02:00:04.790
I'm able to get the response. Now if I'm going to change my

02:00:04.790 --> 02:00:10.510
content, I am going to say that, tell me about, uh, Jen AI

02:00:10.510 --> 02:00:15.710
fine control C and then hit again. It will be able to hit my

02:00:15.710 --> 02:00:18.790
model and then it will be able to give me the response.

02:00:19.210 --> 02:00:25.590
Okay. So here I'm able to roll assistance content. Content

02:00:25.590 --> 02:00:29.090
is equal to blank. Okay. So for this reason length, okay,

02:00:29.190 --> 02:00:33.290
uses prompt token. So it is not able to give me any kind of

02:00:33.290 --> 02:00:35.470
a content by the way.

02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:44.000
Yeah. Content is blank. It is showing me. Now let me replace

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:51.540
this model with some other model. So this is 4.1. Let me

02:00:51.540 --> 02:00:59.820
replace this with open AI, maybe 4.1 nano model. Okay. So

02:00:59.820 --> 02:01:03.660
with this GPT-4.1-nano model, 4

02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:14.020
.1 nano. So this is the model ID. So now I'm hitting this

02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:15.140
model basically. Right.

02:01:24.090 --> 02:01:26.670
And again, same question. Tell me about Jen AI. Now it is

02:01:26.670 --> 02:01:29.510
able to generate some sort of a long context, right? Long

02:01:29.510 --> 02:01:32.870
output. It is able to generate, and this is called as

02:01:32.870 --> 02:01:36.690
inferencing, right? So here message roll assistance content.

02:01:37.010 --> 02:01:39.850
Now content wise, it is giving me this one. So tell me Jen

02:01:39.850 --> 02:01:42.510
AI refers to a subset of the artificial intelligence. It is

02:01:42.510 --> 02:01:45.550
focused on creating a new content such as text, images,

02:01:45.690 --> 02:01:48.490
audio, video. So it is giving me a very, very long, like an

02:01:48.490 --> 02:01:51.770
information about this entire things, right? About this

02:01:51.770 --> 02:01:55.130
entire thing. So it is able to give it to me. And this is

02:01:55.130 --> 02:01:59.310
called as inferencing. When you send some data, when you ask

02:01:59.310 --> 02:02:02.030
some question, right? And when model is going to give you a

02:02:02.030 --> 02:02:05.650
response. So that part is called as inferencing. So we are

02:02:05.650 --> 02:02:09.070
able to inference with one of my model. Now let's suppose if

02:02:09.070 --> 02:02:11.110
I have to do inferencing with respect to other models,

02:02:11.170 --> 02:02:15.250
right? I can do it now. So here we have a category of the

02:02:15.250 --> 02:02:19.270
model, for example, now API key is fine, we are able to

02:02:19.270 --> 02:02:23.150
create now come to the user's part. So whatever model you

02:02:23.150 --> 02:02:26.670
are hitting and whatever token it is going to consume, you

02:02:26.670 --> 02:02:29.070
will be able to track that particular part. Model

02:02:29.070 --> 02:02:31.970
statistics, you will be able to track. So which model you

02:02:31.970 --> 02:02:34.170
are trying to hit and if you are going to receive some

02:02:34.170 --> 02:02:36.950
error, so you will be able to track your error as well,

02:02:37.050 --> 02:02:40.510
right? Logs wise, so you will be able to see that, okay,

02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:43.750
fine. So I have just now, recently I have hit like a 4.1

02:02:43.750 --> 02:02:46.250
before that I was hitting this model, this model two times,

02:02:46.350 --> 02:02:49.350
right? Everything just like any other international

02:02:49.350 --> 02:02:52.050
platform, you will be able to see it. And this was the

02:02:52.050 --> 02:02:54.610
content which was returned, right? This was a response which

02:02:54.610 --> 02:02:57.170
was returned. So you will be able to see your response as

02:02:57.170 --> 02:02:59.210
well. That what was the response you have received before

02:02:59.210 --> 02:03:03.470
that the content was empty. So yes, it's empty. So

02:03:03.470 --> 02:03:05.990
everything you will be able to track, everything you will be

02:03:05.990 --> 02:03:11.550
able to log just like anything, right? Just like a true API.

02:03:12.170 --> 02:03:15.570
Now we have given you an end point. Now come to the end

02:03:15.570 --> 02:03:17.730
point. Let's suppose I would like to generate the image,

02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:20.730
right? I would like to generate the image. Yeah. So to

02:03:20.730 --> 02:03:24.690
generate the image, we have given you another URL. See we

02:03:24.690 --> 02:03:28.010
have given you multiple end point, chat completion. So now

02:03:28.010 --> 02:03:30.270
we understand the end point by the way, we all understand

02:03:30.270 --> 02:03:33.350
what is the actual meaning of the end point. So whenever you

02:03:33.350 --> 02:03:36.390
are going to call this end point, chat completion function

02:03:36.390 --> 02:03:39.030
will be called. Whenever you are going to call embedding end

02:03:39.030 --> 02:03:42.950
point. So embedding function will be called. I believe we

02:03:42.950 --> 02:03:46.130
all understand this part, right guys? Meaning of end point.

02:03:47.610 --> 02:03:51.710
Yeah. So when I'm going to call basically

02:03:52.960 --> 02:03:57.360
this chat completion, we know that a function which is going

02:03:57.360 --> 02:03:59.920
to like a give me chat completion that will be called

02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:03.880
embedding. So embedding function will be called audio to

02:04:03.880 --> 02:04:07.200
speech that will be called image generation that will be

02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:09.900
called. So now we understand. We all understand the end

02:04:09.900 --> 02:04:12.800
point. The meaning of end point. So now these lines are not

02:04:12.800 --> 02:04:16.260
alien to me, right? We all understand this entire thing

02:04:16.260 --> 02:04:20.940
that, okay, fine. So what will happen in our backend? So now

02:04:20.940 --> 02:04:23.720
it's not like a black box for any one of us by the way.

02:04:24.100 --> 02:04:28.460
Okay. That's cool. Uh, no. So let me show you how to

02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:31.560
generate an image through an API to a chat. You can do it,

02:04:31.620 --> 02:04:33.800
but through an API. So let's suppose this is my image

02:04:33.800 --> 02:04:37.720
generation endpoint curl is given to me, right? I can, I can

02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:40.740
convert this curl in any language code. I think I have

02:04:40.740 --> 02:04:43.240
already shown you yesterday. So just copy it and then like,

02:04:43.340 --> 02:04:46.920
uh, you know, uh, try to say that, okay, give me a Python

02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:48.820
equivalent. It will be able to give the Python equivalent

02:04:48.820 --> 02:04:53.860
now here, right? So here, this is my curl. Now let me attach

02:04:53.860 --> 02:05:01.850
a API key, right? So API token I have to attach. So maybe I

02:05:01.850 --> 02:05:07.810
can go to URI API API keys, create a new one, anything and

02:05:07.810 --> 02:05:14.260
copy it. So. Yeah. So here your API token, I just had to

02:05:14.260 --> 02:05:17.640
replace this one and the point is already given. And then

02:05:17.640 --> 02:05:20.840
data, what data I'm sending to generate this image, a

02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:24.480
prompt, a beautiful sunset over a mountain. This is the

02:05:24.480 --> 02:05:28.160
prompt. Maybe I can try to like, uh, send something

02:05:28.160 --> 02:05:32.540
innovative. That's completely fine if you want. Right. And a

02:05:32.540 --> 02:05:35.540
model. So black forest, this model I'm going to use. This

02:05:35.540 --> 02:05:38.360
model is already available. So this model I'm going to use

02:05:38.360 --> 02:05:41.880
it. And a number of images equal to two size. You can try to

02:05:41.880 --> 02:05:44.720
manipulate. If you want an image with a different size, you

02:05:44.720 --> 02:05:48.120
can do it. Quality is standard or HD. Again you can try to

02:05:48.120 --> 02:05:51.880
change the small format in a URL or if you want, it will try

02:05:51.880 --> 02:05:56.240
to give you even as a downloadable format style vivid. Now

02:05:56.240 --> 02:06:04.170
just copy it and uh, do the curl, clear my screen, do the

02:06:04.170 --> 02:06:09.810
curl, hit enter and wait for some time. Yeah. So wait for

02:06:09.810 --> 02:06:12.470
some time. So this is the URL. It is able to return guys.

02:06:12.690 --> 02:06:15.330
This is the URL. It is able to return. Yeah. So this

02:06:15.330 --> 02:06:18.330
function is returning the URL. Now if you will go and check

02:06:18.330 --> 02:06:24.910
this URL. Now if you will go and check this URL that what is

02:06:24.910 --> 02:06:29.070
there at this URL, this is my image which has been generated

02:06:29.070 --> 02:06:33.790
right now. My prompt was what my prompt was a beautiful

02:06:33.790 --> 02:06:36.250
sunset over a mountain. Let's suppose if I'm going to change

02:06:36.250 --> 02:06:44.570
my prompt, uh, picture of Elon Musk. I don't know. Elon Musk

02:06:44.570 --> 02:06:51.590
playing guitar, control C. I just have changed my prompt

02:06:51.590 --> 02:06:55.650
picture of Elon Musk playing guitar. Now this is the new URL

02:06:55.650 --> 02:06:58.990
I have received. So if I'll go and check image,

02:07:03.560 --> 02:07:05.520
it is able to generate. So whatever it was able to

02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:08.380
understand as a Elon Musk, uh, it is, it is able to generate

02:07:08.380 --> 02:07:14.340
the image, right? So this is how like, uh, things is

02:07:14.340 --> 02:07:17.620
working. I can give us some text and then I can try to get

02:07:17.620 --> 02:07:20.720
some, something in terms of a speech, right? In a multiple

02:07:20.720 --> 02:07:24.080
language with a multiple person's voice. All of these things

02:07:24.080 --> 02:07:26.660
are happening with the help of my LLM model. Chat

02:07:26.660 --> 02:07:29.380
completion. Yes, I'm able to do a streaming. Yes, I will be

02:07:29.380 --> 02:07:31.820
able to do embedding. Yes, I will be able to do image

02:07:31.820 --> 02:07:35.020
generation. Yes, I will be able to do text to speech. Yes, I

02:07:35.020 --> 02:07:38.080
will be able to do. And technically for everything we have

02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:43.100
an end point. Yes. How to download the images? Simple click

02:07:43.100 --> 02:07:46.920
over here and then download the images. Otherwise just like

02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:49.640
a call a Python code, which will be able to. Yes. To like,

02:07:49.780 --> 02:07:51.940
uh, you know, download the images from this particular URL.

02:07:52.600 --> 02:07:57.260
Simple. Yeah. Now, can you please showcase our text to

02:07:57.260 --> 02:07:59.760
speech? Obviously I can show you text to speech. So let's

02:07:59.760 --> 02:08:02.420
suppose this is my text to speech, right? And this is the

02:08:02.420 --> 02:08:08.280
curl. You can even do a Python code, right? Now this is my

02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:11.140
input, right? And this is my model, which I'm going to use.

02:08:11.220 --> 02:08:13.720
And voice wise, you can select a multiple voice. So we have

02:08:13.720 --> 02:08:17.020
given you a parameter. So voice wise, these many voices are

02:08:17.020 --> 02:08:21.220
available by the way. Yeah. It's Arabic voice. So Arabic is

02:08:21.220 --> 02:08:24.260
also available. So you can choose any of these voice of your

02:08:24.260 --> 02:08:27.220
choice. We have given you all the options, right? You can

02:08:27.220 --> 02:08:30.740
try to pass any of this parameter over here. Now let me use

02:08:30.740 --> 02:08:36.600
my API key and replace it over here. Right. And now let's do

02:08:36.600 --> 02:08:43.120
a girl. So clear. Hello. This is that text message, right?

02:08:45.460 --> 02:08:52.800
Hmm. Uh, 404 model does not exist. Play. I. Yeah. I don't

02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:54.860
have access internal code.

02:08:57.200 --> 02:09:05.980
Okay. Play AI TTS. It's not working. Let me check. Uh, well

02:09:05.980 --> 02:09:09.120
last time when I have tested couple of days back, it was

02:09:09.120 --> 02:09:09.880
working.

02:09:27.530 --> 02:09:34.490
Play I TTS. Let me, uh, check my models. Black forest play.

02:09:34.590 --> 02:09:36.590
I play. I TTS.

02:09:39.460 --> 02:09:48.720
So. So this is listed here. Hmm. Text to speech, nothing

02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:52.720
much I can do because it is not able to find

02:09:54.830 --> 02:09:57.750
P L A Y A I hyphen TTS

02:10:00.330 --> 02:10:07.150
production P L A Y A I hyphen TTS. So maybe the team has

02:10:07.150 --> 02:10:10.170
kept this model down as of now because when I last time I

02:10:10.170 --> 02:10:13.090
was testing it. So it was working basically. So model was

02:10:13.090 --> 02:10:19.410
up. Maybe now it's not up. I'll ask team to make it up so

02:10:19.410 --> 02:10:22.370
that you will be able to hit that model. Yeah. As of now, I

02:10:22.370 --> 02:10:23.370
think it's, it's not up.

02:10:31.560 --> 02:10:35.880
Well, no, it's not up 404. So model is not up as of now.

02:10:35.960 --> 02:10:39.640
I'll just ask him to like, uh, uh, keep it active. This, uh,

02:10:39.680 --> 02:10:41.900
speech to text model, keep it active. So they will do it.

02:10:41.940 --> 02:10:44.640
And once they will do it, you will be able to hit it and it

02:10:44.640 --> 02:10:47.080
is going to give you a return. Return wise. What? So it is

02:10:47.080 --> 02:10:48.720
going to give you a response as of now. It is going to give

02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:52.160
you a URL. So where you will be able to find out MP3 as

02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:55.160
simple as that, right? Just like for a pictures, it is able

02:10:55.160 --> 02:10:57.440
to give you the URL in a similar manner. It will be able to

02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:01.280
give you the URL for a MP3. So this is how you will be able

02:11:01.280 --> 02:11:06.320
to hit any of our model. Now not just that, right? Not just

02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:09.800
that. So see, uh, whenever you are going to use any of this

02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:12.020
framework, right, whether it's a Lang chain, whether it's a

02:11:12.020 --> 02:11:14.760
Lama indexes, whether it's a Lang graph, which is already a

02:11:14.760 --> 02:11:19.520
part of your syllabus. Without LLMs. You will not be able to

02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:22.620
use any of this framework. Every framework requires an

02:11:22.620 --> 02:11:25.720
access of a LLMs, right? Every framework. Now what we have

02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:29.900
done from our side. So we have released up SDKs. So we have

02:11:29.900 --> 02:11:33.140
released basically SDK. So if you will go to a Pi Pi, you

02:11:33.140 --> 02:11:36.200
will be able to find out a URI AI SDK. So you just have to

02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:38.640
do a pip install URI AI, just like you install anything

02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:41.840
else, right? So you have to install pip install URI AI.

02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:44.340
That's it. This is the only thing that you have to do,

02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:48.440
right? And then whether it's a Lang graph, Lang chain. A

02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:52.520
small agent Lama indexes, screw AI directly, you will be

02:11:52.520 --> 02:11:55.480
able to use it. And this is something that we are going to

02:11:55.480 --> 02:12:00.160
use on a regular basis, starting from next to next class

02:12:00.160 --> 02:12:03.300
onwards. Yeah, this is something that we will start using

02:12:03.300 --> 02:12:07.080
it. So we have already released the SDK so that your life

02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:11.660
will be even way more easier in terms of accessing those

02:12:11.660 --> 02:12:15.960
LLMs in any other frameworks, because when you try to use

02:12:15.960 --> 02:12:18.620
any kind of LLM on a framework. You have to make it

02:12:18.620 --> 02:12:21.480
compatible, compatible with respect to that framework. And

02:12:21.480 --> 02:12:25.620
this is where this URI AI SDK comes into a picture, which

02:12:25.620 --> 02:12:27.840
we'll be using a lot in almost all the framework, like

02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:30.720
starting from a Lang chain, Lama index, Lang graph, auto

02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:34.820
gen, crew AI everywhere, everywhere we are going to use our

02:12:34.820 --> 02:12:38.860
URI AI. Can we create our own SDKs? Yeah, you can create

02:12:38.860 --> 02:12:41.620
your own SDKs. I have already released one YouTube videos

02:12:41.620 --> 02:12:44.500
where I'm showing you that how to create your own Pi Pi

02:12:44.500 --> 02:12:46.840
package and how to publish it. So you can go and you can

02:12:46.840 --> 02:12:50.180
check that out. If you have to create your own SDKs. Yeah.

02:12:50.480 --> 02:12:53.280
So I've already shown that step by step, all of these part

02:12:53.280 --> 02:12:56.160
that how to create your own package and how to publish it so

02:12:56.160 --> 02:12:59.160
that other people will be able to use those SDKs or other

02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:01.780
people will be able to use that libraries because this is

02:13:01.780 --> 02:13:05.320
something that we have written. So initially I have written

02:13:05.320 --> 02:13:07.960
personally the entire part and then my team has done some

02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:11.000
sort of a modification into it. And now this is available

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:15.760
for all of us. Just do pip install URI AI. Bingo. With

02:13:21.800 --> 02:13:25.120
one API key we can access all end point. Yes. All end point.

02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:29.280
Only one API key. You don't have to create like a end point

02:13:29.280 --> 02:13:32.900
wise API key, just one password and all system will be

02:13:32.900 --> 02:13:33.260
accessible.

02:13:37.900 --> 02:13:40.980
Can we use URI or URI pin mark? You can use anywhere. We

02:13:40.980 --> 02:13:44.180
don't have any kind of issue. So we have given you one lakh

02:13:44.180 --> 02:13:47.480
token limit per day. So you have, let's suppose one year of

02:13:47.480 --> 02:13:52.040
access. It simply means that 365 lakh. Now if you are going

02:13:52.040 --> 02:13:59.800
to estimate a cost. Okay. Of 365 lakh token with anyone else

02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:06.790
who is providing, you will be amazed. Just do the math. Is

02:14:06.790 --> 02:14:11.790
URI like a group? It's kind of, you can say, right, but we

02:14:11.790 --> 02:14:14.690
have a group has not given you this like a framework

02:14:14.690 --> 02:14:18.650
integration. They have just given you the end point or for a

02:14:18.650 --> 02:14:21.170
particular model. So whatever model you will be able to find

02:14:21.170 --> 02:14:25.370
out in groups, it's already available API wise. Right. And

02:14:25.370 --> 02:14:27.710
even for chat, so we have given you a best of best

02:14:27.710 --> 02:14:33.570
interfacing. The another part is SDKs, compatibility. They

02:14:33.570 --> 02:14:38.070
are not giving you, we have done that as well. How to

02:14:38.070 --> 02:14:40.290
convert bad quality image into a high quality images through

02:14:40.290 --> 02:14:44.310
the model. So nowadays we have like a so many platform which

02:14:44.310 --> 02:14:47.410
is available, maybe try to use a Delhi or maybe a Sora, then

02:14:47.410 --> 02:14:52.690
try to like convert it. How you are providing these made

02:14:52.690 --> 02:14:57.250
tokens hit at no price. Okay. So we are providing it, we are

02:14:57.250 --> 02:15:00.230
burning money, a lot of money.

02:15:03.300 --> 02:15:05.960
It's very useful. If you make unused token today, carry

02:15:05.960 --> 02:15:10.600
forward, no, that's option we are not going to give. It's

02:15:10.600 --> 02:15:13.660
not our token bank basically. Right. It's like something

02:15:13.660 --> 02:15:15.800
that we have created so that my learner, my students would

02:15:15.800 --> 02:15:19.620
not go to XYZ platform, attach their card and then look for

02:15:19.620 --> 02:15:21.980
the free API or something like that. Right. My students

02:15:21.980 --> 02:15:24.060
should sit peacefully. They should do the experimentation,

02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:27.280
whatever they want, the way they want. And for that we have

02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:30.820
created this entire ecosystem so that there should not be

02:15:30.820 --> 02:15:35.350
any kind of a bottling in terms of creating an app. Okay,

02:15:35.430 --> 02:15:38.250
fine. So cool. Hope all of you are able to understand the

02:15:38.250 --> 02:15:41.370
URI API. Now we can see that how we can hit the URI API,

02:15:41.630 --> 02:15:45.610
right. AI framework, all of these things we are going to

02:15:45.610 --> 02:15:49.290
like discuss. So as we will progress one by one and so many

02:15:49.290 --> 02:15:52.010
examples we have already given to you. If you will click on

02:15:52.010 --> 02:15:54.370
these things, right, so, so many things we have already

02:15:54.370 --> 02:15:57.010
built it for you so that life will be pretty much easier.

02:15:57.010 --> 02:16:02.770
Right. Life will be literally easier and you can learn in

02:16:02.770 --> 02:16:05.910
the easiest possible way with fun. There you will see the

02:16:05.910 --> 02:16:07.570
result and you will be able to build something.

02:16:11.810 --> 02:16:19.170
So now I'm done with today's class. Right. And in my next

02:16:19.170 --> 02:16:24.290
class, right, in my next class, basically, we are going to

02:16:24.290 --> 02:16:28.290
start a vector data base, basically. So we'll try to

02:16:28.290 --> 02:16:30.870
understand that. Why? Why vector database is important,

02:16:31.230 --> 02:16:35.610
which and all vector database is available in a market. What

02:16:35.610 --> 02:16:38.990
vector database I'm going to use for what kind of a use

02:16:38.990 --> 02:16:44.090
cases, how I will be able to do a setup plus for vector

02:16:44.090 --> 02:16:48.270
database, you need one thing which is called as embeddings.

02:16:48.410 --> 02:16:51.210
Without embeddings, you will not be able to use a vector

02:16:51.210 --> 02:16:55.350
database. So we'll try to teach you that what is the actual

02:16:55.350 --> 02:16:58.530
meaning of embeddings, what is the mathematics behind a top

02:16:58.530 --> 02:17:01.690
case search. For example, a course and similarity or

02:17:01.690 --> 02:17:04.490
Euclidean distances or Manhattan distances. So what is the

02:17:04.490 --> 02:17:06.370
meaning of it? How calculation actually happens

02:17:06.370 --> 02:17:09.570
mathematically, right? And then in terms of programming, so

02:17:09.570 --> 02:17:12.030
how these things are going to happen. So that will be the

02:17:12.030 --> 02:17:15.770
agenda for my upcoming class, which is going to be the next

02:17:15.770 --> 02:17:19.950
one. And even over there, we are going to use something

02:17:19.950 --> 02:17:24.770
called as embedding this one. So we will try to create the

02:17:24.770 --> 02:17:27.870
embeddings. Then only we can try to store it inside the

02:17:27.870 --> 02:17:30.870
vector database. Right. So theory, practical, each and

02:17:30.870 --> 02:17:33.310
everything will try to understand and then we'll try to make

02:17:33.310 --> 02:17:36.370
it live. Live means deploy, productionize it. So that will

02:17:36.370 --> 02:17:40.150
be the agenda for my next class. Now next to next week,

02:17:40.250 --> 02:17:45.250
right? Next to next week, which is technically a 23rd, 24th,

02:17:45.250 --> 02:17:48.710
right? So 23rd, 24th, I'm just giving you an early

02:17:48.710 --> 02:17:51.970
announcement, 23rd, 24th, I am on leave. So I have a

02:17:51.970 --> 02:17:55.790
planned, like I have some different schedule on 23rd, 24th.

02:17:56.010 --> 02:17:58.970
So next week we have a class, agenda is fixed, right? And

02:17:58.970 --> 02:18:03.130
next to next week, I'm on leave. So there will be no class.

02:18:03.250 --> 02:18:06.190
You guys can plan yourself, whatever you want on that

02:18:06.190 --> 02:18:09.090
Saturday and Sunday, right? Two weeks before I'm telling

02:18:09.090 --> 02:18:11.810
you, 15 days before I'm telling you these things, so that

02:18:11.810 --> 02:18:14.490
you will be able to plan. So that there will not be any kind

02:18:14.490 --> 02:18:17.530
of a surprise because I have already planned something

02:18:17.530 --> 02:18:22.170
basically. So I will not be available. I will be available

02:18:22.170 --> 02:18:25.890
on next. So we will be having holiday on 23rd, 24th, that

02:18:25.890 --> 02:18:28.630
particular weekend. I'll make an announcement in group.

02:18:28.650 --> 02:18:29.670
Okay. I will be there as well. But yeah, those who have

02:18:29.670 --> 02:18:33.430
joined the class just, uh, I'm not defying you so that if

02:18:33.430 --> 02:18:36.030
you are planning to create some land for you, some like a,

02:18:36.110 --> 02:18:41.320
you know, tour or visit or something, you can do it. So with

02:18:41.320 --> 02:18:45.820
that guys, thank you so much. And if you have any kind of a

02:18:45.820 --> 02:18:48.820
question, so please be here, those who is not having any

02:18:48.820 --> 02:18:50.360
kind of a question. So you can drop off now.

02:18:59.760 --> 02:19:04.140
Yeah. And one more thing. So by evening, right by evening,

02:19:04.240 --> 02:19:07.700
so I'm going to create a homework. So by the time I'm going

02:19:07.700 --> 02:19:10.600
to upload a recording. Okay. I'm going to upload our

02:19:10.600 --> 02:19:13.180
assignments as well for this class. So whatever I have

02:19:13.180 --> 02:19:15.320
discussed, so I have to give you a lot of assignment for

02:19:15.320 --> 02:19:18.540
this entire week so that you all will sit and you all will

02:19:18.540 --> 02:19:21.460
be able to solve it and make sure guys that doesn't matter

02:19:21.460 --> 02:19:24.560
whether you are solving assignment with AI or you're writing

02:19:24.560 --> 02:19:28.460
a code on your own. What I want from your side is to solve

02:19:28.460 --> 02:19:31.680
it, touch those assignment at least, right? Touch those

02:19:31.680 --> 02:19:33.600
assignment because I know that that if you're going to

02:19:33.600 --> 02:19:37.060
execute and if you're able to see the result, you will be

02:19:37.060 --> 02:19:40.480
able to understand at least maybe a 10, 20%. So by the time

02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:43.500
I'm going to upload a video recording technically by

02:19:43.500 --> 02:19:46.460
evening, right? Because that much time it takes to convert a

02:19:46.460 --> 02:19:50.200
video into MP4 format. Along with that, I will be attaching

02:19:50.200 --> 02:19:55.620
a assignment for this whole week. Solve it, discuss it among

02:19:55.620 --> 02:20:01.720
yourself inside a group as much as possible and then come to

02:20:01.720 --> 02:20:05.220
the class next week on Saturday. And those who are not aware

02:20:05.220 --> 02:20:08.280
about a Python, please make sure that that you are spending,

02:20:08.460 --> 02:20:12.060
at least this week. Enough amount of time on core Python.

02:20:12.900 --> 02:20:18.100
Yep. So assign, assign will be fun. Believe me, you will

02:20:18.100 --> 02:20:21.920
learn a lot. You will learn more than like things that I'm

02:20:21.920 --> 02:20:24.440
teaching you in a class when you are going to solve my

02:20:24.440 --> 02:20:29.340
assignments and going forward challenges where I can find

02:20:29.340 --> 02:20:31.380
the previous assignment in whatever class I'm giving

02:20:31.380 --> 02:20:33.660
assignment, you will be able to find out in that lecture

02:20:33.660 --> 02:20:36.300
dashboard. Simple. So everything is structured. Everything

02:20:36.300 --> 02:20:39.120
is uploaded in a lecture dashboard. Just click and get it.

02:20:40.080 --> 02:20:43.680
So hope you're liking it guys. Yes. Everyone. Any complaints

02:20:43.680 --> 02:20:49.060
like, no, this class is not going good and I'm not able to

02:20:49.060 --> 02:20:52.340
understand and like you should teach in this way, that way,

02:20:52.420 --> 02:20:59.560
something like this. Yeah. Any complaint? Okay. Guys. See,

02:20:59.580 --> 02:21:01.740
it's, it's completely fine. You have a complaint or you

02:21:01.740 --> 02:21:04.020
don't have a complaint, but whenever I'm giving assignments,

02:21:04.400 --> 02:21:09.180
please solve it. Yes. And in my class, always make sure that

02:21:09.180 --> 02:21:13.080
you are coming with, uh, coming for a hands-on, right? Not

02:21:13.080 --> 02:21:15.180
just what in the lecture, because I don't like that

02:21:15.180 --> 02:21:17.880
approach. Like I said, and I will keep on telling you that

02:21:17.880 --> 02:21:20.540
we aren't preparing for the exam. We are preparing for a

02:21:20.540 --> 02:21:24.740
life, right? So this practical will help you out a lot. And

02:21:24.740 --> 02:21:28.340
yes, it's true that, uh, initially it will be a little bit

02:21:28.340 --> 02:21:32.560
painful because maybe you have not gone through those things

02:21:32.560 --> 02:21:35.360
so far. You have not gone through that particular track so

02:21:35.360 --> 02:21:38.600
far. So it's completely fine, but that pain will be gone

02:21:38.600 --> 02:21:41.520
very, very soon. Believe me, within a couple of weeks, it

02:21:41.520 --> 02:21:44.660
will be gone and you will be very much comfortable. And then

02:21:44.660 --> 02:21:47.740
you will start enjoying. Then it will not look like that.

02:21:47.780 --> 02:21:50.700
You are learning something because I know learning is stuff,

02:21:50.920 --> 02:21:55.440
right? So my, my first objective is to remove that

02:21:55.440 --> 02:21:58.580
bottleneck where we think that I have to go and learn. No, I

02:21:58.580 --> 02:22:00.680
don't have to go and learn. I just have to go experiment,

02:22:00.960 --> 02:22:05.480
uh, build something. And then like, uh, my work is done. And

02:22:05.480 --> 02:22:08.680
when you will, when you will get into that stage, believe

02:22:08.680 --> 02:22:11.740
me, you will enjoy. You will not feel like a pressure. You

02:22:11.740 --> 02:22:15.040
will not feel like a burden because now you will, at that

02:22:15.040 --> 02:22:17.080
point of time, you will start connecting the dots

02:22:17.080 --> 02:22:21.180
automatically. So I have to put you on that place so that

02:22:21.180 --> 02:22:23.460
going forward, you will be able to learn anything and

02:22:23.460 --> 02:22:25.540
everything on your own. Then you don't need me.

02:22:30.470 --> 02:22:34.030
Yeah. Can you split video into two part actually teaching

02:22:34.030 --> 02:22:36.890
one recording by discussion? I mean, like, it's not that

02:22:36.890 --> 02:22:39.230
tough to, you know, how, what? But till two hour and then

02:22:39.230 --> 02:22:41.710
two hours. So why you are expecting me to cut this video

02:22:41.710 --> 02:22:46.150
into two part doesn't make sense, right? One video, you know

02:22:46.150 --> 02:22:48.930
that, that for two hour, I have discussed a core topic for

02:22:48.930 --> 02:22:51.330
last two hours. I have discussed basically like, uh, doubts

02:22:51.330 --> 02:22:54.450
just watch till two hours, no one is stopping you. Right?

02:22:58.520 --> 02:23:01.740
Yeah. I mean, like these are the unnecessary expectation

02:23:01.740 --> 02:23:06.340
guys. And for sure, I will not be able to fulfill. Even I

02:23:06.340 --> 02:23:08.580
want, even if I wanted to, because this is unnecessary,

02:23:08.820 --> 02:23:12.040
right? Unnecessary bottleneck hurdles. Yeah. I think so.

02:23:12.280 --> 02:23:15.340
Yeah. So fine guys. Thank you so much. Those who is having a

02:23:15.340 --> 02:23:17.560
doubts, please be here. Those who is not having a doubt.

02:23:17.620 --> 02:23:20.040
Thank you so much. We are done with the today's class, uh,

02:23:20.140 --> 02:23:23.100
by evening assignments will be available late evening. You

02:23:23.100 --> 02:23:25.720
can say like today's Sunday. So even I have some work to do,

02:23:25.780 --> 02:23:30.360
uh, so I'll upload assignments, uh, by late, late evening.

02:23:30.460 --> 02:23:33.080
Yeah. And you have like a whole week of time to solve those

02:23:33.080 --> 02:23:36.100
assignments and to discuss inside your groups. Uh, so with

02:23:36.100 --> 02:23:38.960
that, uh, thank you so much guys. See you in the next class.

02:23:39.140 --> 02:23:41.300
Those who is not having a doubt. Those who is having a

02:23:41.300 --> 02:23:42.120
doubt. Be here.

02:23:45.190 --> 02:23:51.050
Yeah. So now guys, uh, I'm lowering your hands. Shall we

02:23:51.050 --> 02:23:54.270
take a break for two, three minutes? Yeah. Shall we take a

02:23:54.270 --> 02:23:55.350
break? Two, three minutes break.

02:23:59.320 --> 02:24:03.060
Okay. Fine. I'm going on break. Just like two minutes. It's

02:24:03.060 --> 02:24:09.220
11 or 23. So 20 by 11 or 27, I will be back and then, uh,

02:24:09.320 --> 02:24:11.220
raise your hand and those who would like to share the

02:24:11.220 --> 02:24:13.980
screen, those who are facing any kind of issues, uh, with,

02:24:13.980 --> 02:24:17.580
you know, uh, any kind of a command code, whatever. So just

02:24:17.580 --> 02:24:20.300
keep your screen ready. You can share your screen and then,

02:24:20.320 --> 02:24:23.640
uh, we'll start solving your, uh, issues in your system.

02:24:24.660 --> 02:24:28.540
Yeah. So we'll go on a break for three minutes only. Only

02:24:28.540 --> 02:24:28.980
three minutes.

02:30:16.340 --> 02:30:20.280
Okay. Finally, do you want, so I think we are back. Uh, so I

02:30:20.280 --> 02:30:23.120
can see some hands, uh, and guys, those who would like to

02:30:23.120 --> 02:30:25.920
share their screen, right? So please bring me in a chat. So

02:30:25.920 --> 02:30:28.440
I would like to share the screen. So I'll just move you to

02:30:28.440 --> 02:30:33.440
the panelists by the way. Yeah. And then I'll call out the

02:30:33.440 --> 02:30:37.520
name one by one. Okay. So that, uh, you know, you can talk.

02:30:37.880 --> 02:30:40.460
So Selva is saying he would like to share the screen. Okay.

02:30:40.980 --> 02:30:44.480
And keep yourself on a mute guys, unless I'm not calling

02:30:44.480 --> 02:30:49.160
your name, otherwise I'll keep you on a mute. So Selva.

02:30:49.260 --> 02:30:52.680
Okay, fine. You will be joining as a panelist then, uh,

02:30:52.880 --> 02:30:57.260
monies I wanted to share the screen. Okay. So there is

02:30:57.260 --> 02:31:01.780
monies. I think monies has not raised his hand. Hello.

02:31:07.020 --> 02:31:10.500
Just a minute. Just a minute. I'll call out the name and

02:31:10.500 --> 02:31:13.280
then I'm just adding everyone in the panelists, uh, to share

02:31:13.280 --> 02:31:16.920
the screen for the, uh, any plan to upload the video on a

02:31:16.920 --> 02:31:19.700
masterclass I'm doing it. That's going a little bit slow,

02:31:19.800 --> 02:31:20.940
but yeah, it will be done.

02:31:23.900 --> 02:31:26.720
Uh, I want to share the screen. Hey, month is saying fine.

02:31:26.920 --> 02:31:30.880
So him on join as a panelist, Mukesh is saying, would like

02:31:30.880 --> 02:31:34.700
to share the screen. Fine. Join as a panelist. Mohit, Mohit.

02:31:34.700 --> 02:31:38.200
Where is Mohit? Okay. Got it. So Mohit will be joining.

02:31:39.100 --> 02:31:45.460
Bharadwaj is seeing. So fine, Bharadwaj and Armaan is

02:31:45.460 --> 02:31:49.960
sharing Armaan. Where is Armaan? Okay. So Armaan will be

02:31:49.960 --> 02:31:53.980
joining as a panelist. Okay. I have one quick question. Just

02:31:53.980 --> 02:31:56.940
wait. Just wait. Yeah. So those who don't want to share the

02:31:56.940 --> 02:32:00.080
screen, uh, fine. I have just segregated the people. So

02:32:00.080 --> 02:32:02.400
those who would like to share the screen and those who like

02:32:02.400 --> 02:32:06.220
to chat. So first of all, let's, uh, take a question from a

02:32:06.220 --> 02:32:09.420
person who would like to just chat. Uh, yeah. Ramesh. Yes.

02:32:09.420 --> 02:32:14.920
Go ahead. Yeah. I shouldn't sell. Thanks for taking session.

02:32:15.180 --> 02:32:19.280
It is obviously clear. It's a wonderful session today. So I

02:32:19.280 --> 02:32:22.200
have the couple of question. When you explained the URI API,

02:32:22.460 --> 02:32:26.620
you have showed some use cases to extract the, no, when we

02:32:26.620 --> 02:32:30.560
pass the question, we can get the response. So are we able

02:32:30.560 --> 02:32:35.600
to retrieve the videos or audio kind of use cases by, uh, by

02:32:35.600 --> 02:32:40.740
using the URI API? Yes. So basically TTS, TTS is something

02:32:40.740 --> 02:32:43.520
that we have given you as an access. So text to speech, by

02:32:43.520 --> 02:32:46.000
the way. So that text to a speech model is going to renew

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:49.080
the URL. So which is not downloadable URL. So text to

02:32:49.080 --> 02:32:51.580
speech, you can do it. And like I've shown you, you will be

02:32:51.580 --> 02:32:55.280
able to generate the images. So text to image. So that is,

02:32:55.280 --> 02:32:58.440
uh, again, model that we have already attached and end point

02:32:58.440 --> 02:33:01.220
we have given to you API. We have given to you. And as I

02:33:01.220 --> 02:33:04.060
have shown it to you that, uh, just pass, uh, any kind of a

02:33:04.060 --> 02:33:06.820
text or any kind of a prompt. And eventually it will be able

02:33:06.820 --> 02:33:09.560
to generate the images. And from that URL, just like, uh,

02:33:09.600 --> 02:33:12.500
write a Python code, which will pull the images out of that

02:33:12.500 --> 02:33:19.540
URL. Simple. Yeah. What about the video? Is there any way we

02:33:19.540 --> 02:33:22.340
are not giving as of now, because video is literally a

02:33:22.340 --> 02:33:25.800
expensive, very, very expensive one. So for video, maybe you

02:33:25.800 --> 02:33:29.120
can try to use a group nowadays group is giving you that

02:33:29.120 --> 02:33:32.480
option. You can try to use a VO three from a Google, which

02:33:32.480 --> 02:33:35.440
has been released recently. You can try to use. Maybe a Sora

02:33:35.440 --> 02:33:39.640
for that one. You can even try to use a Dali. So there are

02:33:39.640 --> 02:33:42.500
many other, so there are many other platform, which is

02:33:42.500 --> 02:33:45.200
giving you those options where you can upload one image or

02:33:45.200 --> 02:33:48.140
you can try to give a prompt and out of prompt, it will be

02:33:48.140 --> 02:33:51.400
able to create the videos. And most of the prompt are giving

02:33:51.400 --> 02:33:55.200
you a very, very limited API access. Uh, they will, they

02:33:55.200 --> 02:33:57.320
will start charging you because it's literally an expensive

02:33:57.320 --> 02:34:01.860
process. Very expensive process. Okay. Uh, sir. And one more

02:34:01.860 --> 02:34:04.540
question. We have the 10 K tokens. You told me that to

02:34:04.540 --> 02:34:06.460
print. You can provide some token. No, you don't have 10K.

02:34:06.460 --> 02:34:11.180
You have 1 lakh actually per day. So 1 lakh token. Okay. Is

02:34:11.180 --> 02:34:15.340
there any possibilities? Can we get the token? Um, or maybe

02:34:15.340 --> 02:34:19.800
do we charge or something? No. The extra token. Yeah. So I'm

02:34:19.800 --> 02:34:22.600
planning for that because I know if you are running some app

02:34:22.600 --> 02:34:25.600
in a production system, right? So, uh, you need more than

02:34:25.600 --> 02:34:27.720
one line. Let's suppose you have built some application,

02:34:27.880 --> 02:34:31.060
which you are like, you know, uh, sharing with multiple

02:34:31.060 --> 02:34:34.660
users, maybe a commercial one, right. Commercial one. Uh,

02:34:34.660 --> 02:34:37.700
so, uh, keeping that in our mind, I'm thinking about that

02:34:37.700 --> 02:34:40.620
plan. So we are doing a lot of like a price calculation

02:34:40.620 --> 02:34:44.440
around it because we are into edutech, right. And that is a

02:34:44.440 --> 02:34:46.400
completely different domain where we are selling just a

02:34:46.400 --> 02:34:51.240
token. Uh, hope you get my point. Right. Yeah. So, uh, we,

02:34:51.320 --> 02:34:53.840
we are planning that how we can price it out, uh, basically

02:34:53.840 --> 02:34:56.720
that, okay, fine. So anyone who would like to, uh, you know,

02:34:56.720 --> 02:35:00.060
uh, get an access of this entire ecosystem, there is your

02:35:00.060 --> 02:35:02.820
own plus, right. There is your own plus. Now, beyond that,

02:35:02.920 --> 02:35:04.660
let's suppose someone is looking for more capital. Someone

02:35:04.660 --> 02:35:06.440
is looking for more token. Someone is looking for more

02:35:06.440 --> 02:35:09.880
resume AI. Someone is looking for more Avni because as of

02:35:09.880 --> 02:35:13.020
now we have given three, like a, uh, interview per month.

02:35:13.080 --> 02:35:16.700
Right. So more Avni, someone is going to look for more Uri

02:35:16.700 --> 02:35:21.100
chat and more Uri API token, all of this more. Right. So we

02:35:21.100 --> 02:35:24.000
are like, uh, I'm working on the plan, uh, especially on a

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.960
price calculation side of it. Right. That, uh, what should

02:35:26.960 --> 02:35:30.360
be the ideal price. And in that ideal price, what I will be

02:35:30.360 --> 02:35:33.520
able to offer. So maybe in like a next couple of months, uh,

02:35:33.620 --> 02:35:38.120
we will come up with those plans. But not now. Okay. It's

02:35:38.120 --> 02:35:40.620
nice, sir. So the one more final question, sir, actually we

02:35:40.620 --> 02:35:44.060
have done some use case, uh, by using the vector DB, you

02:35:44.060 --> 02:35:46.900
know, the rat techniques only, I just, I have the one

02:35:46.900 --> 02:35:50.260
question, uh, there is a context length over there and if

02:35:50.260 --> 02:35:53.160
you increase the context length, uh, which is the better,

02:35:53.240 --> 02:35:55.900
which is efficient, or if you, if you have the very less

02:35:55.900 --> 02:35:59.160
context to window, uh, is it the better, which approach is

02:35:59.160 --> 02:36:02.920
the better, sir? I think the mid size context window is

02:36:02.920 --> 02:36:06.580
always like a better. For most of the use cases, for

02:36:06.580 --> 02:36:09.660
example, so let's suppose if I'm trying to ask a question on

02:36:09.660 --> 02:36:12.440
maybe some like, uh, something related to a coding module,

02:36:12.620 --> 02:36:15.640
right? So in that case, a mid size or maybe a small size

02:36:15.640 --> 02:36:19.280
context window is completely fine. But let's suppose, let's

02:36:19.280 --> 02:36:22.740
suppose if I have a Wikipedia kind of a data, Wikipedia kind

02:36:22.740 --> 02:36:26.800
of a file, and, uh, there are like a lot of information

02:36:26.800 --> 02:36:30.720
which is connected with the other information we have. So in

02:36:30.720 --> 02:36:33.480
that case, longer context window. So that. Whenever we are

02:36:33.480 --> 02:36:36.860
going to hit a query, it will be able to bring a top case

02:36:36.860 --> 02:36:40.700
search, but with a bigger context and that will go inside my

02:36:40.700 --> 02:36:43.840
LLM so that I will be able to get a better result without

02:36:43.840 --> 02:36:46.660
any kind of hallucination. So it's a case by case what

02:36:46.660 --> 02:36:49.520
you're trying to solve basically, but ideal size, I believe

02:36:49.520 --> 02:36:52.920
like a 400, 500, if you are going to keep, uh, I think that

02:36:52.920 --> 02:36:56.520
will be a great starting point or maybe thousand. Yeah. And

02:36:56.520 --> 02:36:59.060
what is a good part of the top K five or 10, like, is there

02:36:59.060 --> 02:37:03.260
any interest in specific, sir? Yeah. LLM is top three, top

02:37:03.260 --> 02:37:06.320
two. So whenever you're trying to send a query into the

02:37:06.320 --> 02:37:09.680
vector database, right? So it will try to take the very

02:37:09.680 --> 02:37:12.280
first, the closest one, then the second closest one, then

02:37:12.280 --> 02:37:15.960
the third closest one. Yeah. So basically these three

02:37:15.960 --> 02:37:18.480
contexts, if you are going to bring together, so most of

02:37:18.480 --> 02:37:21.220
the, like maybe you will be able to achieve 95% accuracy

02:37:21.220 --> 02:37:24.000
over there, or maybe 90% accuracy over there. So that's the

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:28.260
reason we always go with the top K. Okay. So LLM, uh, going

02:37:28.260 --> 02:37:30.900
to use all the three, for example, if we use the top K

02:37:30.900 --> 02:37:33.020
three, top K three, LLM.

02:37:36.380 --> 02:37:41.740
Yeah. So technically it will be query plus context. So query

02:37:41.740 --> 02:37:44.220
will be your original query or context will be what? That

02:37:44.220 --> 02:37:48.880
top K. Correct. So LLM is going to aggregate all the top K,

02:37:48.940 --> 02:37:53.400
the written top element and will refine it or Yeah. When you

02:37:53.400 --> 02:37:56.340
are creating the context by default, all these top K will be

02:37:56.340 --> 02:37:59.320
aggregated. If you are setting a value of K is equal to one

02:37:59.320 --> 02:38:02.760
means only one, only one. Very fast. That's the first top

02:38:02.760 --> 02:38:06.220
one. Okay. Okay. But LLM is going to refer all the things

02:38:06.220 --> 02:38:09.620
based on the top K. Yes. Based on the top K. Yes. Yes. Okay.

02:38:09.740 --> 02:38:12.140
Okay. Okay. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Okay. Next one is

02:38:12.140 --> 02:38:13.360
Anurabha. Please go ahead with the question.

02:38:16.420 --> 02:38:18.920
Yeah. Anurabha, then Naresh, then Siddharth. One by one,

02:38:18.960 --> 02:38:25.760
please go ahead guys. Yeah. Hi. So, uh, uh, I have some

02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:28.460
general questions and two questions related to this class.

02:38:28.620 --> 02:38:31.460
So you have mentioned that there are multiple keys that we

02:38:31.460 --> 02:38:34.580
can use in URI API. Yeah. So I want to understand why is it

02:38:34.580 --> 02:38:36.520
required because you have mentioned that one key is good

02:38:36.520 --> 02:38:39.200
enough. No, no, no. One key is good enough. But basically

02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:42.100
when you are going to create a key, for example, let me

02:38:42.100 --> 02:38:45.020
share my screen. If I have created a key over here, right.

02:38:45.460 --> 02:38:48.140
And uh, created a key, something like this I have created.

02:38:48.400 --> 02:38:52.280
And then if you are going to refresh this screen, now you

02:38:52.280 --> 02:38:54.380
will not be able to copy the key. We are not allowing you to

02:38:54.380 --> 02:39:00.550
copy the key. Okay. So basically we are allowing you from

02:39:00.550 --> 02:39:02.870
the security purposes, basically we are allowing you only

02:39:02.870 --> 02:39:05.390
copying a key for one key. So one time when you are going to

02:39:05.390 --> 02:39:08.650
create it, right. So obviously now you can't copy the key.

02:39:08.750 --> 02:39:10.630
Now which key you are going to you, let's suppose you have

02:39:10.630 --> 02:39:12.470
not copied the previous one. Let's suppose you forgot the

02:39:12.470 --> 02:39:15.770
previous key, right. So now which, which key you are

02:39:15.770 --> 02:39:17.850
supposed to use. So you will have to come and create the new

02:39:17.850 --> 02:39:20.110
key. That's the reason. So we have given you this option

02:39:20.110 --> 02:39:22.690
because this is the standard procedure as per the security

02:39:22.690 --> 02:39:27.990
reasons. Okay. Uh, so the next question is that, uh, in, uh,

02:39:28.650 --> 02:39:32.070
uh, the post and get method and all of that. So you are

02:39:32.070 --> 02:39:37.110
basically returning a statement. Let's see. So, uh, which,

02:39:37.250 --> 02:39:40.250
uh, who is calling and who are you returning to? Because

02:39:40.250 --> 02:39:43.790
usually in the Python classes that we have gone to, we are

02:39:43.790 --> 02:39:47.070
using the, either the debug statement or we are printing at

02:39:47.070 --> 02:39:50.610
different points of time, uh, to understand how the flow of

02:39:50.610 --> 02:39:54.950
logic is going. But here we are returning, uh, in the

02:39:54.950 --> 02:39:57.870
mentioned, no, no, no, you are, I think you are doing a

02:39:57.870 --> 02:40:00.890
apple to orange comparison. So debugging is completely

02:40:00.890 --> 02:40:03.990
different. So we are a step by step in which a step. What is

02:40:03.990 --> 02:40:06.730
the variable values? And then in a, in between, so we can

02:40:06.730 --> 02:40:09.350
try to even feed the variable values. And then what will be

02:40:09.350 --> 02:40:11.270
the value, which will go to the next step. This is something

02:40:11.270 --> 02:40:13.450
that we try to check. So debugging is a different process,

02:40:13.590 --> 02:40:17.150
right? Think as a executing a function, not debugging,

02:40:17.250 --> 02:40:19.170
executing a function. So when you execute a function, what

02:40:19.170 --> 02:40:22.090
do you do? You try to pass the input, right? If function is

02:40:22.090 --> 02:40:24.010
taking some input and then eventually you will be able to

02:40:24.010 --> 02:40:27.390
get the output. Same thing goes with the API. The only

02:40:27.390 --> 02:40:30.870
difference is that same function I have this, I'm trying to

02:40:30.870 --> 02:40:34.910
hit it with the help of rule. Yes. System, which is called

02:40:34.910 --> 02:40:39.190
as URL. Okay. Basically I'm trying to make it neutral. I'm

02:40:39.190 --> 02:40:41.650
trying to make it, this is what I have discussed in a, in my

02:40:41.650 --> 02:40:45.450
studies class, meaning of API. It is technology agnostic,

02:40:45.610 --> 02:40:49.010
right? Exactly. Is that basically you, you have like a

02:40:49.010 --> 02:40:51.110
heterogeneous system. So where someone is writing code in

02:40:51.110 --> 02:40:53.030
some other language, as you are using some different

02:40:53.030 --> 02:40:55.870
platform, I'm using some different platform, but eventually

02:40:55.870 --> 02:40:58.830
you will be able to access my code, my function, and you

02:40:58.830 --> 02:41:01.090
will be able to access your function and I will be able to

02:41:01.090 --> 02:41:04.130
access your function. Vice versa. If I have exposed

02:41:04.130 --> 02:41:08.070
something as an API, simple moving forward, all of these

02:41:08.070 --> 02:41:12.490
APIs are basically, you know, either nested or a simple

02:41:12.490 --> 02:41:17.330
dictionary key value pairs, right? No, not like that. See

02:41:17.330 --> 02:41:20.270
it. Technically it's a function I'm trying to execute. It's

02:41:20.270 --> 02:41:22.710
not like why you're doing a comparison with the dictionary

02:41:22.710 --> 02:41:25.470
key value pair all the time. Yeah. I'm returning key value

02:41:25.470 --> 02:41:28.090
pair. Maybe in some of the, some other cases, maybe I will

02:41:28.090 --> 02:41:30.070
returning just a text in some other cases. I'm returning

02:41:30.070 --> 02:41:32.790
just a table in some other cases. Maybe I'm just trying to

02:41:32.790 --> 02:41:35.230
store a data into a database. There can be infinite number

02:41:35.230 --> 02:41:38.850
of cases, right? Technically API means I'm able, I'm trying

02:41:38.850 --> 02:41:41.630
to execute a same function that you are able to execute,

02:41:41.770 --> 02:41:45.950
maybe like a somewhere in IDs, but with the help of URL,

02:41:46.190 --> 02:41:50.770
that that's a whole meaning. Okay. You are pasting this curl

02:41:50.770 --> 02:41:54.610
command in PowerShell or in normal CMD? You can push it in a

02:41:54.610 --> 02:41:57.110
CMD. You can paste it in a PowerShell, anyone, anywhere you

02:41:57.110 --> 02:42:01.710
want, curl will be accessible. So actually I was facing some

02:42:01.710 --> 02:42:04.450
problems in CMD. I was, I was thinking that you are pasting

02:42:04.450 --> 02:42:08.410
in PowerShell. Yeah. So just wherever curl is available,

02:42:08.630 --> 02:42:10.810
curl is basically a command. It's a library, right? It's a

02:42:10.810 --> 02:42:13.790
package. So wherever curl is available, it will work. If

02:42:13.790 --> 02:42:16.370
curl is not available, it will not work. We have to install

02:42:16.370 --> 02:42:19.830
a curl. Yeah. You will have to install the curl. Yes. Okay.

02:42:19.970 --> 02:42:23.150
I understand that point. Okay. See the major problem that

02:42:23.150 --> 02:42:26.350
I'm facing right now is that, what I understand going

02:42:26.350 --> 02:42:30.990
forward, right now in the VM, the fourth class. So company

02:42:30.990 --> 02:42:36.110
laptops. I don't think we'll not be a good, you know, option

02:42:36.110 --> 02:42:39.090
to go ahead because moving forward, there will be multiple

02:42:39.090 --> 02:42:41.690
permissions that will be required and we do not have the

02:42:41.690 --> 02:42:44.690
such access. Some of them are already installed in my system

02:42:44.690 --> 02:42:51.050
because I was working on some projects, build something apps

02:42:51.050 --> 02:42:55.910
or automations for my own development as well. But apart

02:42:55.910 --> 02:42:59.570
from that, so can you, you know, give us an idea as to what

02:42:59.570 --> 02:43:02.290
kind of a laptop, laptop or desktop, because I am, I'm not

02:43:02.290 --> 02:43:05.470
moving to planning to move out of my current city right now.

02:43:05.530 --> 02:43:08.230
So should we go for laptop or should we go for desktop

02:43:08.230 --> 02:43:12.930
configurations? And if you can just anything below 70,

02:43:13.010 --> 02:43:16.290
because last time I think it was touching around one lakh.

02:43:17.690 --> 02:43:23.110
And the second part of this question is that, since we have

02:43:23.110 --> 02:43:26.730
already mentioned a very deep significance of APIs and what

02:43:26.730 --> 02:43:30.590
most of the work that we'll be doing is on deployment. And

02:43:30.590 --> 02:43:33.910
we are using models that has been rendered somewhere else.

02:43:34.050 --> 02:43:39.910
So do we need to have a local GPU, a high capacity GPU? No,

02:43:40.030 --> 02:43:43.290
not at all. So even the recent video, if you'll follow, if

02:43:43.290 --> 02:43:46.470
you'll see, so I have used a GPU from some other platforms.

02:43:46.610 --> 02:43:49.170
I'm not using my local GPU, even though I have a GPU, but

02:43:49.170 --> 02:43:52.250
practically even this GPU will not be sufficient. Even if I

02:43:52.250 --> 02:43:57.910
have a 48 GB of GPU or 28 GB of GPU, RTX series, that is not

02:43:57.910 --> 02:44:00.970
going to help me out. In terms of, you know. Retraining the

02:44:00.970 --> 02:44:03.970
model in terms of fine tuning a model, or even in terms of

02:44:03.970 --> 02:44:07.870
inferencing the model, existing model. So ideally it's of no

02:44:07.870 --> 02:44:11.890
use for me. Like I can just use my system for writing a

02:44:11.890 --> 02:44:14.750
light weighted code, even though my system is a bulkier one,

02:44:14.910 --> 02:44:17.750
like it's a heavy system that I'm using, but it's still not

02:44:17.750 --> 02:44:22.290
enough at all for those kinds of models. So I will show you

02:44:22.290 --> 02:44:25.290
even in class, I'll show you those example with those GPU.

02:44:25.390 --> 02:44:28.230
And in a real time we are using those GPU, which is

02:44:28.230 --> 02:44:31.330
available over the cloud. And even if you'll see my video,

02:44:31.390 --> 02:44:33.750
which I published yesterday and day before yesterday, I have

02:44:33.750 --> 02:44:37.890
shown each and everything in a, like this one. So hyperscale

02:44:37.890 --> 02:44:41.430
cloud, basically, and like there is something called a paper

02:44:41.430 --> 02:44:44.690
space, even on AWS, Azure, GCP, you will be able to get the

02:44:44.690 --> 02:44:47.770
similar kind of a GPU. So we'll not be using in our system.

02:44:48.630 --> 02:44:51.350
So in that case, any recommendations, like what is the

02:44:51.350 --> 02:44:54.190
configuration that we should be going ahead with? I will say

02:44:54.190 --> 02:44:57.810
go with the i5, go with the i5 later generation that will

02:44:57.810 --> 02:45:01.850
work. Okay. And is there, what is the basic difference

02:45:01.850 --> 02:45:05.610
between this generation and this i7 and i9? So which should

02:45:05.610 --> 02:45:09.030
we go for a generation, higher generation or higher i5 or

02:45:09.030 --> 02:45:12.570
i7? Basically i9 will be the latest again in i9. So you will

02:45:12.570 --> 02:45:15.750
be able to find out a latest family, maybe a 12 series, 13

02:45:15.750 --> 02:45:18.310
series, something like that. Right? So basically this i5,

02:45:18.410 --> 02:45:20.650
there is a generation called as i3. Then there is a

02:45:20.650 --> 02:45:23.010
generation called as i5, there is a generation called as i7,

02:45:23.130 --> 02:45:25.750
there is a generation called as i9, all odd numbers, right?

02:45:25.850 --> 02:45:28.790
Now inside that generation also, you will be able to find

02:45:28.790 --> 02:45:33.530
out the series. So it's like a worsening. So we write like

02:45:33.530 --> 02:45:36.150
software version, we do it, right? Like 1.0 point something,

02:45:36.390 --> 02:45:40.410
then 2.3 point something. So in the similar manner, this

02:45:40.410 --> 02:45:44.390
laptop configuration has been like a worsened, i9 is going

02:45:44.390 --> 02:45:47.110
to be the latest one. And again, you have to check with the

02:45:47.110 --> 02:45:49.790
latest generation, which is running maybe 12 or 13. So i9.

02:45:50.730 --> 02:45:53.730
For the use case of this particular course that you will be

02:45:53.730 --> 02:45:56.910
teaching from the start to the end, what do you suggest that

02:45:56.910 --> 02:46:01.030
we should go? i5 to i7 is better. Okay. It is going to work

02:46:01.030 --> 02:46:05.070
and it is not going to cost you much. So maybe you can get

02:46:05.070 --> 02:46:10.450
something like this between like 60 to 70k or 55 to 70k.

02:46:10.990 --> 02:46:15.710
Okay. Okay. Thanks. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So Naresh,

02:46:15.750 --> 02:46:19.510
just a minute. I'll call out. Yeah. Naresh, please go ahead.

02:46:19.690 --> 02:46:22.970
Yeah. Hi Sudhans. The class was very good. Thank you so much

02:46:22.970 --> 02:46:27.590
for that. Thanks. Yeah. My next question is, we are in a

02:46:27.590 --> 02:46:31.130
generative AI course, right? Yeah. So there are a lot of

02:46:31.130 --> 02:46:34.390
terms, you know, which are leading to the confusion. Like

02:46:34.390 --> 02:46:37.290
what is AI Genetic AI, Generative AI. I understood

02:46:37.290 --> 02:46:41.150
Generative AI, we are using some LLM and we are generating

02:46:41.150 --> 02:46:44.310
the output. Right. So what does it mean by AI Genetic AI?

02:46:45.010 --> 02:46:49.850
Okay. So I think a lot of like a syllabus, I have already

02:46:49.850 --> 02:46:53.170
like mentioned that we are going to create the agents. AI

02:46:53.170 --> 02:46:56.250
Genetic AI is nothing but a kind of an intelligent function

02:46:56.250 --> 02:46:58.890
as of now. You understand function, right? Yes. That we

02:46:58.890 --> 02:47:01.270
write inside our programming language. Yes. So think in that

02:47:01.270 --> 02:47:03.870
way, that kind of an intelligent function, which is using

02:47:03.870 --> 02:47:07.170
your LLMs. LLM is chat GPT kind of a thing, right? So which

02:47:07.170 --> 02:47:11.190
is using your LLMs and it is able to do some sort of a task

02:47:11.190 --> 02:47:14.450
automatically without asking you or without even taking your

02:47:14.450 --> 02:47:16.630
permission. That is something called as agent in a layman

02:47:16.630 --> 02:47:19.910
way. Okay. Technically it's a function. It's actually a

02:47:19.910 --> 02:47:22.990
function. And I can create an agent with the help of some of

02:47:22.990 --> 02:47:25.330
the framework which is out there in a market. For example,

02:47:25.570 --> 02:47:30.050
Langchain, Lama Index, Langraph, Crew AI, Autogen, or maybe

02:47:30.050 --> 02:47:35.250
N8n. Okay. So my next question is that only. So we have a

02:47:35.250 --> 02:47:39.130
lot of no-code tools and low-code tools, like you mentioned

02:47:39.130 --> 02:47:44.010
N8n and Google is also planning to release Opal, which is in

02:47:44.010 --> 02:47:49.150
testing phase, I guess. So if these tools come into the

02:47:49.150 --> 02:47:53.210
picture, like what is the future of AI Genetic AI with

02:47:53.210 --> 02:47:56.290
Python, instead of using the tools, which is, you know,

02:47:56.310 --> 02:48:00.430
doing our task way better. Okay. I'll try to give you this

02:48:00.430 --> 02:48:03.350
example. So see, we had Excel sheet since a decade, right?

02:48:03.410 --> 02:48:06.530
Since two, three decades, we are using Excel sheet. Inside

02:48:06.530 --> 02:48:09.210
Excel sheet, we have a formulas and automation we can do,

02:48:09.250 --> 02:48:12.830
right? Yeah. Yes. But we still, we need someone to write

02:48:12.830 --> 02:48:16.150
those formulas, some expert, because everyone can't write

02:48:16.150 --> 02:48:18.990
those formulas, right? Correct. Even though those formulas

02:48:18.990 --> 02:48:22.390
are not a black box, right? It's like a understand the

02:48:22.390 --> 02:48:23.670
business use cases. Understand the business use cases.

02:48:23.690 --> 02:48:26.070
Understand the data, write the formula and maintain it. And

02:48:26.070 --> 02:48:28.210
then eventually you will be able to see the final report

02:48:28.210 --> 02:48:30.210
inside Excel sheet. Only Excel sheet I'm talking about. Not

02:48:30.210 --> 02:48:33.390
nothing, not very fancy things, right? So similar, this is

02:48:33.390 --> 02:48:36.910
how I see the future of even agents. So yes, there is a no

02:48:36.910 --> 02:48:39.810
-code tool. There is a low-code tool and there is a code

02:48:39.810 --> 02:48:42.830
based tool, right? For example, this Lang chain, Lang graph,

02:48:42.930 --> 02:48:46.210
Lama indexes. So these are basically a pure code based tool.

02:48:46.410 --> 02:48:50.510
If I'll talk about N8n, so it's a low-code or no-code kind

02:48:50.510 --> 02:48:53.430
of a tool, right? So where you can try to even like, you

02:48:53.430 --> 02:48:55.470
know. Upload the JSON file and then it will be able to

02:48:55.470 --> 02:48:57.590
create the flow or you can just do a drag and drop, drag and

02:48:57.590 --> 02:48:59.670
drop, drag and drop. All those components are one by one

02:48:59.670 --> 02:49:02.750
connected. And even anyone will be able to like, you know,

02:49:02.770 --> 02:49:03.450
create the workflow.

02:49:06.230 --> 02:49:09.430
Now just like an Excel sheet, we need an expert who can

02:49:09.430 --> 02:49:12.010
write the formula, who can understand the data. We need an

02:49:12.010 --> 02:49:16.250
expert. Even in low-code, no-code and complete code kind of

02:49:16.250 --> 02:49:19.210
a system. So this is how I see the future. So there is a lot

02:49:19.210 --> 02:49:22.630
of future. And yeah, as these agents are like, you know.

02:49:23.050 --> 02:49:27.330
Yeah. Being a mainstream, I will say a kind of a tech

02:49:27.330 --> 02:49:31.010
frontier for most of the company or for most of the

02:49:31.010 --> 02:49:33.870
application. So obviously demand is growing and going

02:49:33.870 --> 02:49:37.370
forward, you will be able to see a lot of things like in

02:49:37.370 --> 02:49:40.250
demand. There people are like getting a very good

02:49:40.250 --> 02:49:42.630
opportunity just in terms of agents so that they can go and

02:49:42.630 --> 02:49:46.630
automate the work. That that's my perspective. Okay. Yeah.

02:49:46.730 --> 02:49:51.710
Understood. My last question is, so in this course, I think

02:49:51.710 --> 02:49:58.870
we are covering the fine tuning. So let's say I, instead of

02:49:58.870 --> 02:50:02.690
using 3 billion parameters, 7 billion, there are a lot of

02:50:02.690 --> 02:50:06.490
waiters is available in the market, like 70 billion, 30

02:50:06.490 --> 02:50:11.750
billion. Let's say for my use case, I just need a small, a

02:50:11.750 --> 02:50:17.190
small LLM. So which course do I need to take if I want to

02:50:17.190 --> 02:50:21.430
build a small LLM? So which. From a scratch or from fine

02:50:21.430 --> 02:50:23.650
tuning? From a scratch or from fine tuning? From a scratch

02:50:23.650 --> 02:50:27.200
or from fine tuning? So you are, you're trying to build a

02:50:27.200 --> 02:50:30.000
model, but from scratch, you are trying to build a model.

02:50:30.060 --> 02:50:34.680
Might be from. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Might be, might be from a

02:50:34.680 --> 02:50:38.360
scratch because I see already available models. If you see,

02:50:38.420 --> 02:50:41.020
right. There are unnecessary languages that are included,

02:50:41.160 --> 02:50:44.920
mostly like German languages, Spanish. So I don't need all

02:50:44.920 --> 02:50:48.120
these languages. I need only basic English model. So I just

02:50:48.120 --> 02:50:51.240
want to build from the scratch. So for that, what skills do

02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:54.580
I need? Okay. So basically you have to understand our

02:50:54.580 --> 02:50:58.020
fundamentals. Which is our fundamentals of transformer. For

02:50:58.020 --> 02:51:01.280
example, if you will go through this lecture, which I have

02:51:01.280 --> 02:51:04.160
given. So where I have even shown to build a model from the

02:51:04.160 --> 02:51:10.520
scratch. So here, uh, generative AI, uh, generative,

02:51:10.540 --> 02:51:16.040
generative AI, yeah, uh, this one. So this was also a live

02:51:16.040 --> 02:51:18.580
class. Now if you'll go through this, uh, live class

02:51:18.580 --> 02:51:23.300
lecture. So here the fundamental, uh, April transformer and

02:51:23.300 --> 02:51:28.000
GRU and, uh, values. Various model comparison. Yes. GPT

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.620
practical from a scratch, right? So this, this lecture, and

02:51:30.620 --> 02:51:33.920
here I'm teaching like building a GPT is kind of a model

02:51:33.920 --> 02:51:36.340
from the scratch, but before that, right, right before that.

02:51:36.460 --> 02:51:39.460
So I talked about the RNN, I talked about LSTM and before

02:51:39.460 --> 02:51:41.940
that I talked about a vectoring. I talked about basically a

02:51:41.940 --> 02:51:45.780
neural network. And then I talked about a transformer. There

02:51:45.780 --> 02:51:48.840
is a research paper called as attention is all you need. And

02:51:48.840 --> 02:51:52.280
basically that is a mother of all the GPTs or LLMs that you

02:51:52.280 --> 02:51:54.500
are able to see today. That is the mother. Basically.

02:51:54.500 --> 02:51:56.960
Without understanding that you will not be able to

02:51:56.960 --> 02:51:59.040
understand the core transformer. So that is something which

02:51:59.040 --> 02:52:02.720
I have discussed over here in theory, in practical all. And

02:52:02.720 --> 02:52:05.380
then we are trading a model from the scratch, as you can see

02:52:05.380 --> 02:52:09.680
this 13th April lecture. And then, uh, I'm showing even a

02:52:09.680 --> 02:52:12.300
fine tuning. So both the approach. So let's suppose I have

02:52:12.300 --> 02:52:15.300
like a chain, the model from the scratch, I can do it. I

02:52:15.300 --> 02:52:18.180
have to fine tune the model right in a different, different

02:52:18.180 --> 02:52:20.820
way for the different, different tasks. Even that, uh, like,

02:52:20.820 --> 02:52:24.140
uh, things I have even shown, uh, inside this one. And even

02:52:24.140 --> 02:52:27.040
in this lecture, this generative that is going on, right? So

02:52:27.040 --> 02:52:30.800
I have already mentioned about, uh, fine tuning and, uh,

02:52:30.880 --> 02:52:33.520
I'll try to even teach you that how to train a model from

02:52:33.520 --> 02:52:35.780
the scratch. So if you would like to go ahead with those

02:52:35.780 --> 02:52:38.840
lecture, now it's available, right? You can go and check

02:52:38.840 --> 02:52:42.340
that out. It was also a live class. And if you have to wait,

02:52:42.500 --> 02:52:45.520
then wait for your class. And even here, I'm going to talk

02:52:45.520 --> 02:52:50.220
about it. Okay. Uh, so, uh, my last question, uh, so this

02:52:50.220 --> 02:52:53.900
LLMs, right? Uh, the generate output. Okay. Uh, a single

02:52:53.900 --> 02:52:58.000
token at a time, uh, correct me if I'm not wrong chunk by

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:00.860
chunk, basically they have a context length output context

02:53:00.860 --> 02:53:03.500
length. So let's suppose output is this much. So this much,

02:53:03.600 --> 02:53:08.020
they will be able to generate one at a time. Uh, I read some

02:53:08.020 --> 02:53:12.100
news, I think, uh, uh, day before yesterday, I think so, uh,

02:53:12.300 --> 02:53:16.020
Apple has come out with, uh, you know, uh, multiple, uh,

02:53:16.200 --> 02:53:19.380
output tokens, some, something related. I, uh, if you know

02:53:19.380 --> 02:53:21.620
anything about that, you can explain because I didn't

02:53:21.620 --> 02:53:24.140
understand what they were. So multiple output token, any,

02:53:24.200 --> 02:53:27.980
how every model is doing it, every LLM is doing it by the

02:53:27.980 --> 02:53:30.900
way. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, maybe I'll do one thing. I'll search

02:53:30.900 --> 02:53:35.840
that article and send you in the group because context could

02:53:35.840 --> 02:53:38.920
be different. Maybe context could be different, which maybe

02:53:38.920 --> 02:53:41.060
you are not able to remember. So yeah, just send me that

02:53:41.060 --> 02:53:44.540
article, but I think every model is doing it. So even the

02:53:44.540 --> 02:53:46.760
model that we are using it, right. By default is doing it.

02:53:47.140 --> 02:53:49.320
Okay. That's the reason it's called the multi headed

02:53:49.320 --> 02:53:51.980
attention. Multi head means anyhow, multiple output. I will

02:53:51.980 --> 02:53:55.180
be able to get. Okay. Thanks for this. Thank you so much.

02:53:55.300 --> 02:53:58.340
Thank you. Okay. Next is Siddharth. Please go ahead. Hello,

02:53:58.540 --> 02:54:01.740
Sudhanshu. Thank you so much for this great session. And I'm

02:54:01.740 --> 02:54:06.480
happy that I could, uh, utilize yesterday's session and, uh,

02:54:06.640 --> 02:54:10.840
run it successfully on my system. So my question is in case

02:54:10.840 --> 02:54:15.600
of Postman, we can send this, uh, get API through Postman.

02:54:15.680 --> 02:54:19.340
And also we can directly paste it in the link using, uh,

02:54:19.560 --> 02:54:24.920
question mark. URL. Yeah. So in case of post, I could

02:54:24.920 --> 02:54:28.380
successfully run it from Postman, but in URL we cannot do

02:54:28.380 --> 02:54:30.760
it, isn't it? No, you can't do it basically because URL

02:54:30.760 --> 02:54:33.480
means your data is exposed and post simply says that, that

02:54:33.480 --> 02:54:35.920
your data should be secured means whenever I'm sending a

02:54:35.920 --> 02:54:38.840
data, I should send it as a body, not inside the URL, which

02:54:38.840 --> 02:54:42.520
should be visible to everyone. Okay. And another question is

02:54:42.520 --> 02:54:46.300
that we use render today to deploy, uh, our code, but

02:54:46.300 --> 02:54:50.800
yesterday we use also to, uh, deploy our code. We have not

02:54:50.800 --> 02:54:53.020
deployed yesterday. We have not deployed yesterday. So our

02:54:53.020 --> 02:54:56.980
code was in my system code was running in my system. So

02:54:56.980 --> 02:55:00.900
basically it was using my compute, my CPU, my Ram, my disk

02:55:00.900 --> 02:55:05.260
space. I have just done one thing on whatever port select

02:55:05.260 --> 02:55:08.340
things was running in my system with the help of NG log. I

02:55:08.340 --> 02:55:11.900
have exposed that port and made my system as a server, a

02:55:11.900 --> 02:55:15.140
global server, but eventually it was utilizing my resources,

02:55:15.340 --> 02:55:18.760
my computation, my Ram today, what we have done. So we are

02:55:18.760 --> 02:55:21.460
not running anything in our local system. We have. All the

02:55:21.460 --> 02:55:24.080
code into a GitHub eventually render is trying to pull all

02:55:24.080 --> 02:55:27.380
my code. Render is trying to set up all the system. Uh, even

02:55:27.380 --> 02:55:31.020
when I have switched off my API, if you are going to hit my

02:55:31.020 --> 02:55:33.280
render API, you will be able to access it because still it's

02:55:33.280 --> 02:55:36.200
up and running and it's independent of my system. So both

02:55:36.200 --> 02:55:39.260
approaches are different. NG log was, this is something

02:55:39.260 --> 02:55:41.440
which I told you, right? NG log has been used for the port

02:55:41.440 --> 02:55:45.260
forwarding means whatever the writing in my port, make it

02:55:45.260 --> 02:55:48.560
available to the entire world, but compute will be mine if

02:55:48.560 --> 02:55:50.700
I'm going to switch off that system. If I'm going to switch

02:55:50.700 --> 02:55:53.100
off that API, it is not going to work. NG log is not going

02:55:53.100 --> 02:55:56.000
to give you any responses in case of render. It's global now

02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:58.780
on a cloud without my computation, without my resources.

02:56:00.640 --> 02:56:05.060
Okay. And for the, uh, render, you want them to give, can we

02:56:05.060 --> 02:56:08.080
modify it? Like using our, you can, you can do your own

02:56:08.080 --> 02:56:10.400
mapping. You can do your own mapping, but that is available

02:56:10.400 --> 02:56:13.720
with a paid plan. Thank you. Thank you. So let's suppose you

02:56:13.720 --> 02:56:16.280
would like to deploy it at the Siddharth at the rate,

02:56:16.340 --> 02:56:19.600
Siddharth.com or Siddharth.ai. Maybe you have that domain.

02:56:19.600 --> 02:56:21.600
Right. Name with you. Right. You have posted that domain.

02:56:21.740 --> 02:56:26.680
You can point your domain with that. Okay. Thank you. Yeah.

02:56:26.740 --> 02:56:28.600
Thanks. Okay. Next is Ganesh. Please go ahead.

02:56:32.100 --> 02:56:37.360
Yeah. Yeah. Ganesh. So, sir, my question is related to this,

02:56:37.480 --> 02:56:44.680
uh, uh, Python file. Hmm. So when we use a Java and the time

02:56:44.680 --> 02:56:48.700
we create a class and then file name is also with the class

02:56:48.700 --> 02:56:52.800
name in the Python, we don't do that. Any, any name we

02:56:52.800 --> 02:56:56.500
define and class say inside the class and, uh, I have not

02:56:56.500 --> 02:56:58.320
even created the class by the way. I have not even created

02:56:58.320 --> 02:57:03.300
the class over here. How I created a class in today's class.

02:57:04.300 --> 02:57:06.580
That was the pidentic one. That was for the data validation.

02:57:06.740 --> 02:57:10.260
That was not a classes that you understands. Right. Uh, so

02:57:10.260 --> 02:57:13.280
basically pident my class was inheriting the base class,

02:57:13.420 --> 02:57:16.080
which is technically, uh, like, uh, it was trying to inherit

02:57:16.080 --> 02:57:20.060
something from the, uh, pidentic, uh, in nature, like a

02:57:20.060 --> 02:57:23.400
rules. But I haven't been to the class technically, even in

02:57:23.400 --> 02:57:27.280
today's class. So in Python also we create a class, right?

02:57:27.640 --> 02:57:30.180
Yeah. We do create a class. Python supports a complete

02:57:30.180 --> 02:57:34.000
auditory programming along with the scripting. So file name

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:36.860
is a different and the class we create inside that file.

02:57:37.180 --> 02:57:42.380
There could be different. Yes. So how, uh, suppose, suppose

02:57:42.380 --> 02:57:46.440
10 files I have created in inside the 10 files, the same

02:57:46.440 --> 02:57:50.480
class I have created. Right. So which, which will be called,

02:57:50.580 --> 02:57:54.340
uh, how the Python decides. So basically how Python works is

02:57:54.340 --> 02:57:57.400
that, that let's suppose there is a file called as X, Y, G.

02:57:57.460 --> 02:58:00.960
Okay. Let me share my screen. Let me explain it to you in

02:58:00.960 --> 02:58:05.000
theory. So, and a beautiful explanation I have given to you

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:06.740
the Python lecture, which I have uploaded, right. A

02:58:06.740 --> 02:58:08.820
beautiful practical explanation I have already mentioned,

02:58:08.940 --> 02:58:12.480
but as you have asked, so let me like, uh, so let's suppose

02:58:12.480 --> 02:58:16.020
I have a, I think my, uh, pen market is visible, right?

02:58:16.440 --> 02:58:21.480
Yeah. Okay. So let's suppose I have a technically a class or

02:58:21.480 --> 02:58:26.200
the pile over here, let's suppose a test dot PI file. And

02:58:26.200 --> 02:58:30.200
then I have something called as X, Y, G dot PI file. And

02:58:30.200 --> 02:58:33.540
then something I have called it ABC dot PI file. Right.

02:58:33.900 --> 02:58:37.380
Inside ABC, there is a possible that I will be having class

02:58:37.380 --> 02:58:41.420
ABC. Right. Right. This X, Y, G dot PI file. There is a

02:58:41.420 --> 02:58:44.780
possibility that there will be a class Sudhanshu. Right. Not

02:58:44.780 --> 02:58:48.360
X, Y, G. In ABC, there is already like, so just case number

02:58:48.360 --> 02:58:50.960
one, let's suppose that your file name and class name is

02:58:50.960 --> 02:58:53.920
same, right? Case number two, my file name and class name is

02:58:53.920 --> 02:58:57.200
different. Right. And then test dot PI file, you are trying

02:58:57.200 --> 02:58:59.740
to access basically whatever is available here, whatever is

02:58:59.740 --> 02:59:01.860
available here, because that will be a full objective.

02:59:02.320 --> 02:59:06.940
Right. To call class ABC and call class Sudh. Now, so

02:59:06.940 --> 02:59:09.660
basically we try to maintain a package or directory

02:59:09.660 --> 02:59:11.500
structure and with the help of directory structure, it will

02:59:11.500 --> 02:59:13.660
be able to understand it. So, and there is also a

02:59:13.660 --> 02:59:16.000
possibility that these are the directory structures. So,

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:16.000
just like in a class name, we will call this class name and

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:17.760
it will send this file And then there is a folder over here.

02:59:17.780 --> 02:59:20.880
Now, inside this folder, I have another file, right? Yeah.

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:24.480
One step like a down or one step up, you have to go. So,

02:59:24.500 --> 02:59:27.740
let's try to talk about this example first of all. So, if I

02:59:27.740 --> 02:59:31.460
have to like take an action or if I have to call this ABC

02:59:31.460 --> 02:59:35.180
from this test dot PI file. So, first of all, it will call a

02:59:35.180 --> 02:59:39.080
file name. So, ABC. Right? So, we are going to write

02:59:39.080 --> 02:59:45.160
something like from ABC, import ABC. Because class name is

02:59:45.160 --> 02:59:48.260
already there. what abc so from the file name import what

02:59:48.260 --> 02:59:52.240
import class name simple right case number two again from

02:59:52.240 --> 02:59:55.480
test.py file i'm trying to call this sudh class so again

02:59:55.480 --> 03:00:03.220
what i will write from xyg import what import what sudh yeah

03:00:03.220 --> 03:00:08.520
so in this way it will be able to access simple okay so

03:00:08.520 --> 03:00:13.040
there we call a package here we call directory structure no

03:00:13.040 --> 03:00:15.940
here also we call classes and packages and modules basically

03:00:15.940 --> 03:00:19.480
so we we call packages and then inside that so we will be

03:00:19.480 --> 03:00:21.480
having a model so this is something which i have explained

03:00:21.480 --> 03:00:24.280
you in your python lecture as well with practical and again

03:00:24.280 --> 03:00:26.620
there are some edge cases like init and many things we try

03:00:26.620 --> 03:00:29.800
to handle so if you also looking something in detail watch

03:00:29.800 --> 03:00:33.600
my python recordings but i believe this answers your

03:00:33.600 --> 03:00:36.660
question the explanation which i have given to you oh yeah

03:00:36.660 --> 03:00:41.640
yes the next question is the api key that we generate so

03:00:41.640 --> 03:00:46.880
what is the validation duration for this only 24 hours are

03:00:46.880 --> 03:00:51.360
no this api key will be live as long as you are going to

03:00:51.360 --> 03:00:55.600
like work for it we are expiring it in 365 days i believe

03:00:55.600 --> 03:01:02.360
okay once your account will be like deactivated and once you

03:01:02.360 --> 03:01:04.780
are going to renew once you run plus means you run will be

03:01:04.780 --> 03:01:06.920
we run plus will access will be gone or maybe your course

03:01:06.920 --> 03:01:10.560
access will be gone so as of now you're on plus you provided

03:01:10.560 --> 03:01:14.520
for one year is there any plan in uh which is lifetime

03:01:14.520 --> 03:01:17.400
access you will be providing lifetime is not possible in

03:01:17.400 --> 03:01:20.860
this module because it's you know like it's a too much

03:01:20.860 --> 03:01:25.100
things too much means like uh yuri avni yuri api resume

03:01:25.100 --> 03:01:28.920
system live courses recorded courses so many things so many

03:01:28.920 --> 03:01:31.840
things we are trying to build so lifetime is not possible

03:01:31.840 --> 03:01:35.040
maybe in future we'll have to increase some prices yeah very

03:01:35.040 --> 03:01:37.220
high chance because because we are we are very affordable in

03:01:37.220 --> 03:01:40.540
a market and plus like uh we are like trying to give

03:01:40.540 --> 03:01:42.680
something which is useful recently we have launched awning

03:01:42.680 --> 03:01:44.980
let's go and use our our app we will literally enjoy it

03:01:44.980 --> 03:01:49.380
right maybe if someone is going to even score 70 80 in avni

03:01:49.380 --> 03:01:52.620
for sure they can crack the interview any interview yeah

03:01:52.620 --> 03:01:56.700
okay thank you so much yeah so we'll give you more feature

03:01:56.700 --> 03:02:01.160
but uh not lifetime so that's not possible yeah so sahid go

03:02:01.160 --> 03:02:03.740
ahead after that i mean go ahead and after that i'll start

03:02:03.740 --> 03:02:07.820
like uh taking a screen sharing thank you thanks for the

03:02:07.820 --> 03:02:11.940
opportunity to talk yeah thank you for your very best class

03:02:11.940 --> 03:02:14.020
i was a small question that we had the question which

03:02:14.020 --> 03:02:14.740
question which question was the question have started the

03:02:14.740 --> 03:02:18.400
server we have deployed the server over there but did not

03:02:18.400 --> 03:02:22.780
get an opportunity to like a shut down or stop the service

03:02:22.780 --> 03:02:26.520
over there. No you can you can stop it so for example let me

03:02:26.520 --> 03:02:29.680
share my screen once again and let me go to the render so

03:02:29.680 --> 03:02:34.760
render and let's suppose I will go to my dashboard so by

03:02:34.760 --> 03:02:38.280
default if your service is inactive for like a 30 minutes so

03:02:38.280 --> 03:02:41.600
render is going to stop it because we are using a free

03:02:41.600 --> 03:02:44.620
instances if we are using a paid instances then it will up

03:02:44.620 --> 03:02:46.720
and running for the infinite team for example this is the

03:02:46.720 --> 03:02:50.180
API service right that we have deployed today right so come

03:02:50.180 --> 03:02:54.340
over here and then you will be able to check stats over here

03:02:54.340 --> 03:02:58.360
each and everything as of now it's running in a free and

03:02:58.360 --> 03:03:03.640
then there is a restart service option then setting option

03:03:03.640 --> 03:03:07.040
if you will come down there is a delete option so if you

03:03:07.040 --> 03:03:09.240
would like to delete permanently delete it if you would like

03:03:09.240 --> 03:03:11.740
to up like you know suspend it for a while for now and then

03:03:11.740 --> 03:03:14.320
in later stage you would like to keep it up then click on

03:03:14.320 --> 03:03:17.460
this one so these options are already available. Ok thank

03:03:17.460 --> 03:03:20.580
you sir. Second question is basically thank you so much sir.

03:03:20.800 --> 03:03:27.520
Yeah. Second question is in the URI API I can see that 120

03:03:27.520 --> 03:03:31.700
billion parameter model you have deployed 120 billion but I

03:03:31.700 --> 03:03:35.360
can see that this accessible through the API key but it is

03:03:35.360 --> 03:03:40.100
not accessible through the URI app basically like a chat. In

03:03:40.100 --> 03:03:42.860
API key. In API key we have given you 24-25 model in a chat

03:03:42.860 --> 03:03:45.460
we are not giving you like 24-23 we are giving you like a

03:03:45.460 --> 03:03:51.800
quality limited model over there. But whenever you normally

03:03:51.800 --> 03:03:55.660
deploy and I will able to get that I can see the results are

03:03:55.660 --> 03:03:59.340
really great for the 120 billion parameter actually. It's

03:03:59.340 --> 03:04:02.600
not like that so basically if you are going to use a GPT 4.1

03:04:02.600 --> 03:04:07.080
even 4.0 results are actually great right light-weighted

03:04:07.080 --> 03:04:10.780
model but super fast model and like a super intuitive model

03:04:10.780 --> 03:04:14.500
so you can just try to use it. See I'm like now we are

03:04:14.500 --> 03:04:17.500
living in a world where you can't say that this one is great

03:04:17.500 --> 03:04:20.980
that one is good at the end of the day I need a system which

03:04:20.980 --> 03:04:24.280
can solve my problem immediately and I believe for that we

03:04:24.280 --> 03:04:27.180
have enough number of model which we have open source other

03:04:27.180 --> 03:04:30.400
which we have like opened for the entire student that we

03:04:30.400 --> 03:04:33.900
have otherwise unnecessarily we will end up adding hundreds

03:04:33.900 --> 03:04:38.300
of models right so I think we have like a enough which works

03:04:38.760 --> 03:04:39.700
which really works.

03:04:42.260 --> 03:04:45.740
But thank you so much for my question sir yeah thanks thanks

03:04:45.740 --> 03:04:50.940
yeah Avinash go to the question. My question is regarding

03:04:50.940 --> 03:04:55.000
URI API so you show the URI with the help of GURT

03:04:55.000 --> 03:05:01.220
implementation so how to run URI API with python. How to run

03:05:01.220 --> 03:05:04.620
URI API with python we have already given you a sample code

03:05:04.620 --> 03:05:08.320
and I think now it should not be a question but fine URI API

03:05:08.320 --> 03:05:14.300
right. Now come over here code example simple copy go here

03:05:14.300 --> 03:05:20.940
let's suppose I'm going to create a new file maybe some file

03:05:20.940 --> 03:05:25.320
name dot pi file or maybe a jupyter notebook itself right

03:05:25.320 --> 03:05:29.680
and here paste it now this is a chat completion what is a

03:05:29.680 --> 03:05:33.500
like a prompt that you are trying to give this one and here

03:05:33.500 --> 03:05:36.420
this is static static static that you have it's you have to

03:05:36.420 --> 03:05:39.140
replace it with your API key. Okay. So what I will do I'll

03:05:39.140 --> 03:05:43.060
quickly go over here I'll try to create a new API key let's

03:05:43.060 --> 03:05:48.180
suppose copy it replace it this static not a BRL only static

03:05:48.180 --> 03:05:53.920
right now execute and done it is hitting my model which

03:05:53.920 --> 03:05:56.440
model this particular model it is trying to hit see I'm able

03:05:56.440 --> 03:05:58.320
to get the response yes

03:06:00.140 --> 03:06:03.460
sir got it sir yeah it's it's very simple it's like that

03:06:03.460 --> 03:06:09.160
like everything is given to you yeah got it sir got it sir

03:06:09.160 --> 03:06:13.180
yeah okay. Okay fine so now people can start sharing a

03:06:13.180 --> 03:06:16.380
screen so first of all Hemant can go then Bharadwaj then

03:06:16.380 --> 03:06:18.900
Armaan then Manish then Mohit yeah so we'll follow the

03:06:18.900 --> 03:06:22.740
sequence yeah Hemant please go ahead with your screen

03:06:22.740 --> 03:06:27.760
sharing. Yeah anyone else guys who have to share the screen.

03:06:33.230 --> 03:06:35.550
Siddhantji ji I have sent a request to share the screen.

03:06:35.870 --> 03:06:37.930
Okay yeah fine I have allowed yeah please say.

03:06:44.860 --> 03:06:48.300
So Siddhantji ji you are able to do rest of the things.

03:06:48.580 --> 03:06:54.260
Okay. Okay. Okay. So I'm still getting the error. Which one

03:06:54.260 --> 03:06:59.180
which one? Equence and when

03:07:11.050 --> 03:07:13.890
I click on this no it says

03:07:16.770 --> 03:07:19.750
detail not found. No no it's it's it's fine it's fine it's

03:07:19.750 --> 03:07:22.930
actually fine so this will give you because on your home URL

03:07:22.930 --> 03:07:25.750
right so you are not returning anything any string or any

03:07:25.750 --> 03:07:28.410
JSON so which is going to show any kind of a messages so

03:07:28.410 --> 03:07:31.070
it's giving you detail not found it simply means that it's

03:07:31.070 --> 03:07:34.650
working do slash docs it's it means it's actually working.

03:07:34.710 --> 03:07:37.710
Okay. So see at this URL we have not written anything right

03:07:37.710 --> 03:07:40.410
that return me this message or maybe return hello world kind

03:07:40.410 --> 03:07:44.250
of a things so just do this docs it will it will return it

03:07:44.250 --> 03:07:49.070
you will be able to see. So so then I so that means when I

03:07:49.070 --> 03:07:55.390
was deploying this using render it will also give the

03:07:55.390 --> 03:07:59.510
similar results then. Similar results exactly yes. So what

03:07:59.510 --> 03:08:04.890
should I do sir to give me the right results. So like this.

03:08:04.890 --> 03:08:07.130
Like you won't like to see some message this is what you're

03:08:07.130 --> 03:08:11.950
trying to say right. If I want to delete the user or okay

03:08:11.950 --> 03:08:16.850
okay okay okay so show some so okay so no so you are trying

03:08:16.850 --> 03:08:20.390
to say that it should show you the deleted user as well.

03:08:21.730 --> 03:08:26.730
Deleted user or anything it see as of now we are trying to

03:08:26.730 --> 03:08:29.430
keep our data where so we are trying to keep our data into a

03:08:29.430 --> 03:08:31.930
variable. Now what is the meaning of that variable variable

03:08:31.930 --> 03:08:36.170
means it's a in memory it's available in a ram right this is

03:08:36.170 --> 03:08:38.890
the meaning of it it's not a database that we are hitting

03:08:38.890 --> 03:08:42.710
it's basically we are trying to hit our local variable which

03:08:42.710 --> 03:08:45.950
is a part of our main memory technically a part of the ram.

03:08:46.110 --> 03:08:49.510
So you can try to do a print which you will be able to see

03:08:49.510 --> 03:08:54.270
in a console right and then maybe like you can try to even

03:08:54.270 --> 03:08:59.030
showcase those same values in a UI if you want. So you have

03:08:59.030 --> 03:09:03.930
to let me modify this. Yeah. So let's say for example. If I

03:09:03.930 --> 03:09:08.090
want to add a new user how can I do it I mean maybe it

03:09:08.090 --> 03:09:11.830
sounds a very basic question but no just a minute I'm

03:09:11.830 --> 03:09:14.690
modifying the code okay okay

03:11:14.750 --> 03:11:19.370
so just try to add one get I'm pinging you in a side of chat

03:11:19.370 --> 03:11:22.890
so maybe you can try to add one get so whenever you have

03:11:22.890 --> 03:11:27.290
modified something try to call a get URL the user and then

03:11:27.290 --> 03:11:29.790
try to pass a username it will be able to show you that

03:11:29.790 --> 03:11:34.870
basically it's another another API right. So just just

03:11:34.870 --> 03:11:38.810
modify so I have used my fake user db just changed with your

03:11:38.810 --> 03:11:41.210
user db so your variable name is user db by the way

03:11:44.380 --> 03:11:49.960
it's a user db your username is yeah now

03:11:58.250 --> 03:12:00.890
it's slash user and just try to pass the username it will be

03:12:00.890 --> 03:12:02.890
able to show you all the data or maybe if you would like to

03:12:02.890 --> 03:12:06.330
showcase the whole data then change the URL so get will do

03:12:06.330 --> 03:12:15.210
you that get will do that. Let me let me try. Yeah. So I

03:12:15.210 --> 03:12:20.550
this one. Yes. Should I just do this one? Yes. Yes. Yeah.

03:12:21.050 --> 03:12:21.890
Just this one.

03:12:27.480 --> 03:12:31.440
And now I can go to the link. You can go to the link. You

03:12:31.440 --> 03:12:34.320
can try to type like a user slash username in

03:12:38.800 --> 03:12:45.840
the in the URL yeah so slash user slash username users users

03:12:45.840 --> 03:12:49.600
USERS that is something that you have given right yes and

03:12:49.600 --> 03:12:51.720
username so whatever username which is available inside your

03:12:51.720 --> 03:12:52.840
db okay

03:12:58.560 --> 03:13:02.060
now at least I'm able to see that. Uh. Even if it is not

03:13:02.060 --> 03:13:04.900
there then I'm able to see the wrong message exactly yeah so

03:13:04.900 --> 03:13:06.980
that that is how like it will be able to give you you are

03:13:06.980 --> 03:13:09.060
sending a get request right so get see something which I can

03:13:09.060 --> 03:13:13.320
send to the URL yes so this is something which I like just

03:13:13.320 --> 03:13:16.620
call the URL and what if there is a result it will try to

03:13:16.620 --> 03:13:19.060
give you if there is no result it will not give you means

03:13:19.060 --> 03:13:21.200
whatever message that you are printing right whatever return

03:13:21.200 --> 03:13:25.700
that you are giving that so basically your variable name is

03:13:25.700 --> 03:13:29.300
not username by the way so check check that out. No no it's

03:13:29.300 --> 03:13:35.600
it's not like a username so it's basically uh user id user

03:13:35.600 --> 03:13:41.380
id yeah so user it's just just go back to your code let's

03:13:41.380 --> 03:13:47.480
modify a little bit so user db and then inside the user db

03:13:47.480 --> 03:13:53.340
bracket bracket and try to put a user id no no come down get

03:13:53.340 --> 03:13:57.660
get method get get the last one the get one yeah yes so it

03:13:57.660 --> 03:14:01.360
should be user db if username in user db and then after user

03:14:01.360 --> 03:14:04.320
db bracket right it's a dictionary right so just try to pass

03:14:04.320 --> 03:14:10.320
uh as a as a user name return the user name let's

03:14:11.980 --> 03:14:15.900
suppose I'm giving any values okay fine save it go back to

03:14:15.900 --> 03:14:18.960
your browser got it got it you have to read like a give id

03:14:18.960 --> 03:14:23.600
basically it's a one two three go back to your browser okay

03:14:23.600 --> 03:14:30.740
yes sir now it's just not true just type one it's id yes got

03:14:30.740 --> 03:14:36.240
it very first value. Okay. But it is not user id uh no it's

03:14:36.240 --> 03:14:41.720
username username so your url user slash users user slash

03:14:41.720 --> 03:14:47.700
users what is your route your route is users u-s-e-r-s yeah

03:14:47.700 --> 03:14:49.420
now hit u

03:14:51.310 --> 03:14:57.230
-s-e-r-s yeah that is what I wrote that is your url right

03:14:57.230 --> 03:15:02.230
yes sir just just go back go back show me once to the code

03:15:02.230 --> 03:15:12.990
yes so u-s come down u-s-e-r-s yeah I think line number 35

03:15:12.990 --> 03:15:18.310
line number 35 yeah line number 35 and your db is this one

03:15:18.310 --> 03:15:21.470
so it should return basically uh yeah doesn't matter user

03:15:21.470 --> 03:15:24.210
name you're passing it's a data that you're passing right so

03:15:24.210 --> 03:15:29.390
variable is fine users and then user name that's fine so u-s

03:15:29.390 --> 03:15:35.160
-e-r-s yeah hit it now uh should I should I run it once

03:15:35.160 --> 03:15:38.000
again no no it's fine you have already run run with the

03:15:38.000 --> 03:15:41.040
reload right so it will update automatically can you sign

03:15:41.040 --> 03:15:46.040
yeah this was not required okay okay slash

03:15:51.060 --> 03:15:54.360
users and

03:15:56.730 --> 03:16:02.190
one yeah it should take uh username then as id try to pass

03:16:02.190 --> 03:16:10.870
one yeah it's not it should it's 200 users one for that it's

03:16:10.870 --> 03:16:17.650
giving me 200. Okay. Which looks good to me and your even

03:16:17.650 --> 03:16:24.030
route looks good to me uh yeah it's giving me 200 so why it

03:16:24.030 --> 03:16:28.150
is not it's not returning

03:16:32.440 --> 03:16:37.120
maybe should I try this once again perhaps now route is fine

03:16:37.120 --> 03:16:45.220
slash user just type it to id2 ah slash user id2 me

03:16:56.190 --> 03:17:00.550
the terminal it is giving no in terminal it is giving you

03:17:00.550 --> 03:17:04.910
200 okay right so which is that it's a good request but in

03:17:04.910 --> 03:17:11.110
return you have written this one and let's suppose

03:17:20.120 --> 03:17:20.760
return

03:17:28.320 --> 03:17:32.880
because in the terminal it says it's all okay request it's

03:17:32.880 --> 03:17:36.560
all okay request it's actually okay request there is nothing

03:17:36.560 --> 03:17:37.660
wrong

03:17:50.150 --> 03:17:50.810
okay

03:18:01.300 --> 03:18:04.760
yeah just go up someone has added username data type was

03:18:04.760 --> 03:18:14.240
actually integer just just go up go up go up okay and but

03:18:15.780 --> 03:18:20.080
doesn't matter like it's a integer that we are trying to

03:18:20.080 --> 03:18:22.820
pass and product

03:18:27.780 --> 03:18:30.800
id then it's

03:18:33.580 --> 03:18:36.840
taking as a string want

03:18:42.890 --> 03:18:47.620
to get method next to it no no that is not an issue

03:19:13.750 --> 03:19:16.530
ideally it should work i don't see any kind of a issue in

03:19:16.530 --> 03:19:21.370
this one and you are doing just just go to your postman or

03:19:21.370 --> 03:19:26.750
maybe like just try to do a curl okay i'll do it one yeah

03:19:26.750 --> 03:19:29.890
just just do it from a postman or do it from a curl because

03:19:29.890 --> 03:19:32.850
it's a 200 right so 200 simply means that everything is

03:19:32.850 --> 03:19:39.310
working yes i don't know like why it is uh not showing but

03:19:39.310 --> 03:19:46.060
it's actually so sir help me with this command i'm not that

03:19:46.060 --> 03:19:52.480
which one curl curl then like a space then hyphen x and then

03:19:52.480 --> 03:19:59.940
space then method name get get gt get then space and then

03:19:59.940 --> 03:20:04.760
there will be a string open double quote yeah and close

03:20:04.760 --> 03:20:08.780
double quote and then in between try to write your url uh

03:20:08.780 --> 03:20:14.660
this one yeah so try to write your like uh this url yeah so

03:20:17.500 --> 03:20:20.780
here you have you are trying to like a do a curl right uh

03:20:20.780 --> 03:20:26.600
first of all curl is not recognized here uh valid request

03:20:26.600 --> 03:20:39.170
this this this no no no not about hold on this http is it

03:20:39.170 --> 03:20:43.510
catch in a browser yeah there is a possibility but uh you

03:20:43.510 --> 03:20:51.230
are writing right yes again looks

03:20:53.280 --> 03:20:59.000
good to me just do one thing so remove the method uh remove

03:20:59.000 --> 03:21:02.980

03:21:25.020 --> 03:21:27.720
basically you remove quotes yeah

03:21:30.610 --> 03:21:33.730
someone is saying he's passing id it's doesn't matter

03:21:33.730 --> 03:21:36.750
basically he's passing a variable mapping should be correct

03:21:36.750 --> 03:21:41.190
so it doesn't matter what name he's passing unable to

03:21:41.190 --> 03:21:46.170
connect to the remote server uh curl is not available it

03:21:46.170 --> 03:21:50.350
seems in your system just do one thing give me a control

03:21:50.350 --> 03:21:55.670
i'll check from my end okay um give me a control

03:22:01.320 --> 03:22:04.400
okay so here cell

03:22:19.840 --> 03:22:22.580
okay http

03:22:26.800 --> 03:22:30.120
oh and one more thing your application itself is not running

03:22:30.120 --> 03:22:35.610
how curl will work sorry sir your application is not up and

03:22:35.610 --> 03:22:37.150
running so how curl will work by the way

03:22:42.490 --> 03:22:46.690
now just try to open up a new plugin power cell if i have to

03:22:46.690 --> 03:22:56.810
do a curl do a curl a url slash users slash to get method

03:22:57.890 --> 03:23:02.650
yeah so we are able to get the response and response says

03:23:02.650 --> 03:23:07.950
that user not found okay yes fine so user not found but we

03:23:07.950 --> 03:23:10.610
are able to hit it basically it's a 200 so yes that we are

03:23:10.610 --> 03:23:14.110
able to hit it yes now it's telling me that user not found

03:23:14.110 --> 03:23:17.050
user db this this this this this okay

03:23:20.010 --> 03:23:25.410
um get you have kept it here def

03:23:34.510 --> 03:23:41.330
get underscore users then here i'll try to pass id id should

03:23:41.330 --> 03:23:48.870
be integer and then let's do the mapping return basically re

03:23:50.730 --> 03:23:56.090
return return what so return basically the user ID variable

03:23:56.090 --> 03:24:01.170
that you have user DB and then pass basically ID a very

03:24:01.170 --> 03:24:10.150
simple code and it works so here I'll pass just a ID fine

03:24:10.150 --> 03:24:18.750
and then decorate it with app dot get method and then give a

03:24:18.750 --> 03:24:25.010
route over here so slash get underscore maybe just I'll

03:24:25.010 --> 03:24:32.150
write like a user slash and then parameterize it ID so

03:24:34.290 --> 03:24:42.290
line number 19 DB yeah DB so in DB control s it must have to

03:24:42.290 --> 03:24:44.130
press itself then

03:24:47.620 --> 03:24:48.680
as

03:25:06.790 --> 03:25:10.010
users slash to

03:25:13.310 --> 03:25:18.810
got it right yeah so it was not in order I don't know what

03:25:18.810 --> 03:25:22.690
what was the mistake maybe there was a string over there it

03:25:22.690 --> 03:25:25.570
was not able to convert so it was returning a blank I don't

03:25:25.570 --> 03:25:27.730
know like it simply means that I there is a dictionary

03:25:27.730 --> 03:25:30.370
called as user DB and I'm trying to pass a key it is going

03:25:30.370 --> 03:25:34.790
to return that value simple okay I mean at this particular

03:25:34.790 --> 03:25:39.410
URL and this is how you are you can run the curl and you can

03:25:39.410 --> 03:25:43.570
test it anywhere else as well okay so now if I go to my URL

03:25:43.570 --> 03:25:48.170
it should be running correctly correct it should let me go

03:25:48.170 --> 03:25:54.110
and test it uh what is the edge so it is edge and users it

03:25:54.110 --> 03:26:01.930
should be user yes yes okay so uh I that this is okay sir uh

03:26:01.930 --> 03:26:05.830
I can see uh you had in terminal can I take the control sir

03:26:05.830 --> 03:26:11.510
you can take a control okay your system is yours now I can

03:26:11.510 --> 03:26:13.910
see this there is uvcon and power so you have actually

03:26:13.910 --> 03:26:16.850
opened two connect uh terminals uh-huh is there a specific

03:26:17.450 --> 03:26:20.650
region yeah so basically in one your service should be up

03:26:20.650 --> 03:26:23.210
and running right so if you are going to stop your apis and

03:26:23.210 --> 03:26:25.750
then if you are going to call a curl how it will be able to

03:26:25.750 --> 03:26:28.590
hit it correct correct correct correct so I'm very new to

03:26:28.590 --> 03:26:32.130
this so okay you can yeah so you can try to open up any

03:26:32.130 --> 03:26:35.190
number of terminal because most of the time when you are

03:26:35.190 --> 03:26:37.190
testing it right so your application should be up and

03:26:37.190 --> 03:26:39.290
running your bracket should be up and running should be up

03:26:39.290 --> 03:26:42.210
and running so in uvcon that you are able to see it's also a

03:26:42.210 --> 03:26:44.910
terminal and this is also a terminal in one I have kept it

03:26:44.910 --> 03:26:48.150
up and running and in second I'm testing it got it got it

03:26:48.150 --> 03:26:52.430
now and I got it yeah yeah okay last time when you were

03:26:52.430 --> 03:26:54.870
hitting a curl right so your api was not up and running so

03:26:54.870 --> 03:26:58.590
it will exactly yeah so how it will be these are very yeah

03:26:58.590 --> 03:27:02.490
these are fundamentals yeah yeah not an issue like you will

03:27:02.490 --> 03:27:05.890
you will get used to it very soon I'll get it to it I just

03:27:05.890 --> 03:27:09.950
need to practice a little more yeah yeah okay thank you so

message this this hello you are trying to give no i don't

03:28:10.880 --> 03:28:14.800
see anything wrong in this shall we create a key again uh

yeah do it once again now

03:28:26.990 --> 03:28:30.370
copy the curl copy a key in a text editor somewhere yeah

03:28:30.370 --> 03:28:35.970
yeah so just just copy everything copy the yuri api key fine

03:28:35.970 --> 03:28:41.990
copy the curl okay and replace this api key with that one

03:28:41.990 --> 03:28:47.030
yeah change the model change the model yeah gpt 4.1 what is

03:28:47.030 --> 03:28:50.790
the name of the model exactly 4.1 i believe and nano

03:28:53.610 --> 03:28:57.850
you can you can check it inside uh even the first page first

03:29:31.730 --> 03:29:32.810
change the content if you want

03:29:36.430 --> 03:29:40.290
ask any question like tell me about this that something yeah

03:29:44.040 --> 03:29:49.360
so hit it now um

03:30:04.490 --> 03:30:09.750
security context fail the revocation function was unable to

03:30:09.750 --> 03:30:15.110
anything like i need to open are you are you are you trying

03:30:15.110 --> 03:30:17.950
to use a company laptop or something no no it's my personal

03:30:17.950 --> 03:30:22.470
desktop then why is it giving us do we need to open any

03:30:22.470 --> 03:30:26.570
parcel or this thing in admin mode or something like that no

03:30:26.570 --> 03:30:30.630
not at all it works in every mode basically there is nothing

03:30:30.630 --> 03:30:34.370
to do with your admin right you are heading yuri server yeah

03:30:34.370 --> 03:30:36.710
uh even

03:30:47.400 --> 03:30:50.680
i tried with the image to diamond model as well which you

03:30:50.680 --> 03:30:52.140
and you are you i'm going to email me and the app which

03:30:52.140 --> 03:30:56.920
using good to bass right yes yes i even tried with this in

03:30:56.920 --> 03:31:02.120
here as well and it is basically checking for ssl by the way

03:31:02.120 --> 03:31:06.280
so whenever you are doing a so there is an issue with your

03:31:06.280 --> 03:31:13.920
installation okay over here uh just open up a vs code okay

03:31:13.920 --> 03:31:17.760
now open up a terminal yeah clean clean this one clean this

03:31:17.760 --> 03:31:23.100
one power cell yeah clean it hit the same no

03:31:31.740 --> 03:31:34.500
no it was not line by line so like hit

03:31:45.220 --> 03:31:50.040
no so

03:31:53.110 --> 03:31:56.490
it was expecting uh into the codes uh this url that you are

03:31:56.490 --> 03:31:59.750
trying to pass right so whenever you do a curl here so

03:31:59.750 --> 03:32:03.850
generally it expects but no no no that's just fine leave it

03:32:03.850 --> 03:32:07.070
uh just try to open up uh you're using a windows machine

03:32:07.070 --> 03:32:13.190
right windows yeah open a power cell so separately and uh

03:32:13.190 --> 03:32:19.650
inside that if you have wsl then yeah open it open it oh

03:32:25.020 --> 03:32:27.420
again not line by line because

03:32:30.820 --> 03:32:34.260
the issue that i'm able to see is with ssl so your curl is

03:32:34.260 --> 03:32:38.740
not like a in your like a git bass right so it is not

03:32:38.740 --> 03:32:44.060
working uh one more thing just just let me do one

03:32:44.060 --> 03:32:50.060
modification in your ssl then let me give me a control okay

03:32:50.640 --> 03:32:54.420
so here i can bypass your ssl because unnecessarily your

03:32:54.420 --> 03:32:59.460
system is checking ssl okay uh so i can just leave you leave

03:32:59.460 --> 03:33:05.380
your system i'm gonna yeah i left it no i am not able to

03:33:05.380 --> 03:33:09.440
actually let me okay shall i close uh this power shield no

03:33:09.440 --> 03:33:13.320
no give up remote just wait just wait and now i'm again

03:33:13.320 --> 03:33:16.040
requesting you give me a remote control just click on the

03:33:16.040 --> 03:33:20.040
button yeah click on the button yeah i approved it uh now i

03:33:20.040 --> 03:33:23.800
can get it i can get uh your control so ssl issue it is

03:33:23.800 --> 03:33:27.300
giving you right let me bypass hyphen hyphen ssl hyphen

03:33:27.300 --> 03:33:37.000
revoke the access hyphen best hyphen e w f o r t so because

03:33:37.000 --> 03:33:39.320
of some of your installation that's giving you this issue

03:33:39.320 --> 03:33:43.900
okay and shall i reinstall later after the class with the

03:33:43.900 --> 03:33:48.460
yeah that will fix the issue okay now see it's uh hitting

03:33:48.460 --> 03:33:51.700
yeah now you got that okay so basically i have written

03:33:51.700 --> 03:33:54.200
hyphen ssl remote best effort right so this was the

03:33:54.200 --> 03:33:57.660
certificate issue it was giving you over here right with the

03:33:57.660 --> 03:34:00.120
help of this command so i have just like removed that check

03:34:00.120 --> 03:34:05.720
okay okay and now you have the output sure sure yeah so like

03:34:05.720 --> 03:34:08.620
i mean yeah one motion like uh not with respect to this

03:34:08.620 --> 03:34:12.140
context maybe like uh i'm like almost like nine plus years

03:34:12.140 --> 03:34:15.400
of experience so like uh into currently into kubernetes like

03:34:15.400 --> 03:34:17.640
last couple of years i've been working with the kubernetes

03:34:17.640 --> 03:34:21.240
uh build and build automations and all so like uh

03:34:21.240 --> 03:34:24.340
transitioning to this like the topics which you're teaching

03:34:24.340 --> 03:34:27.440
right so switching in this position as a senior engineer

03:34:27.440 --> 03:34:30.200
like will we be able to like come and cope up with the

03:34:30.200 --> 03:34:34.100
things if you are like i mean easily see development wise i

03:34:34.100 --> 03:34:37.580
understand all kind of a development and tech as same it's

03:34:37.580 --> 03:34:40.280
it's not very different believe me and i think with nine

03:34:40.280 --> 03:34:42.960
years of experience you must have started realizing it in

03:34:42.960 --> 03:34:45.200
next couple of years you will be able to realize it in a

03:34:45.200 --> 03:34:48.880
better way right after some time so all texts are same it

03:34:48.880 --> 03:34:50.580
doesn't matter which you are implementing okay so okay so uh

03:34:50.580 --> 03:34:52.120
branching off with the next step which you are learning okay

03:34:52.120 --> 03:34:54.840
okay so like this background knowledge of kubernetes will be

03:34:54.840 --> 03:34:57.780
useful always always useful it will be very much useful in

03:34:57.780 --> 03:35:00.200
terms of productizing the application in terms of scaling

03:35:00.200 --> 03:35:02.760
the application and when you will go and talk about the

03:35:02.760 --> 03:35:04.580
story right that okay fine this is something which i have

03:35:04.580 --> 03:35:07.520
done for this scale for this number of users with this kind

03:35:07.520 --> 03:35:10.960
of a hit per second like attraction per second that will

03:35:10.960 --> 03:35:15.640
give you a lot of backup okay okay yeah thank you so much

03:35:15.640 --> 03:35:21.300
thank you arman please share your screen yeah the screen

03:35:21.300 --> 03:35:24.740
share issue was resolved so i have a question now apart from

03:35:24.740 --> 03:35:28.960
sharing my screen okay basically we have created two

03:35:28.960 --> 03:35:33.540
requests put and delete like the update one so for a person

03:35:33.540 --> 03:35:37.700
who doesn't know about the postman or the call part so how

03:35:37.700 --> 03:35:41.100
they will be able to test our apis regarding the update and

03:35:41.100 --> 03:35:45.380
it's okay see curl if someone is saying curl you don't know

03:35:45.540 --> 03:35:48.520
i will simply say one thing that you have never done any

03:35:48.520 --> 03:35:52.520
development that's the whole idea right if someone is saying

03:35:52.520 --> 03:35:55.820
that i don't know let's suppose postman and curl if someone

03:35:55.820 --> 03:35:58.160
don't know it's really bad that you have never

03:35:58.160 --> 03:36:01.440
productionized a real-time project in your entire life first

03:36:01.440 --> 03:36:04.880
part second part is you are not aware about the basic of the

03:36:04.880 --> 03:36:09.920
language because that should come with that right and again

03:36:09.920 --> 03:36:13.840
i don't think that like knowing about a curl or postman

03:36:13.840 --> 03:36:19.180
takes more than five minutes of time right so it's not a

03:36:19.180 --> 03:36:22.160
chapter curl is not a chapter postman is not a chapter that

03:36:22.160 --> 03:36:24.480
you have to go through right it's not a resource that you

03:36:24.480 --> 03:36:27.560
have to uh done it's just a one single command we don't know

03:36:27.560 --> 03:36:30.240
about many things right before a studies class and today's

03:36:30.240 --> 03:36:32.720
class we were not aware about like these terms called as get

03:36:32.720 --> 03:36:35.800
post put and delete we were not aware about even how to like

03:36:35.800 --> 03:36:38.700
hit the apis with the help of a urls now we are aware about

03:36:38.700 --> 03:36:42.340
it similarly colon postman you know like uh we are we are

03:36:42.340 --> 03:36:45.500
able to use it and i i think those who have done at least a

03:36:45.500 --> 03:36:46.200
little bit of work with the app is little bit of development

03:36:46.200 --> 03:36:48.880
right in any programming language any means literally any

03:36:48.880 --> 03:36:52.360
programming language any framework they must be aware about

03:36:52.360 --> 03:36:54.780
curl they must be about the postman because without that

03:36:54.780 --> 03:36:59.740
they can't do the real development so even after deploying

03:36:59.740 --> 03:37:03.460
our api on the cloud we need postman or things like code to

03:37:03.460 --> 03:37:06.940
test it right obviously whenever you will create the api you

03:37:06.940 --> 03:37:09.180
will test it right without testing how you will deploy how

03:37:09.180 --> 03:37:10.860
we'll put that in a production or any system

03:37:14.340 --> 03:37:19.520
right and to do that you have to use either curl or postman

03:37:19.520 --> 03:37:22.280
or maybe some programming language where you will write like

03:37:22.280 --> 03:37:25.160
a write an end point and then you will try to pass the data

03:37:25.160 --> 03:37:29.560
and you will get the response yeah by any sense can we

03:37:29.560 --> 03:37:33.260
having the practical example of how the api is hitting the

03:37:33.260 --> 03:37:37.620
database and displaying the data just just attend all the

03:37:37.620 --> 03:37:40.440
lectures there are like a n number of combinations you will

03:37:40.440 --> 03:37:42.820
go through we will go through all the combinations in a

03:37:42.820 --> 03:37:46.680
class itself okay one more question like if you want to fast

03:37:46.680 --> 03:37:49.620
pace the learning of generative ai of this series as we saw

03:37:49.620 --> 03:37:54.140
that you have a completed one class before so i mean that

03:37:54.140 --> 03:37:58.760
last sequence we have to follow you you can follow that

03:37:58.760 --> 03:38:01.160
sequences even you will be able to learn all this entity by

03:38:01.160 --> 03:38:07.500
concept yeah okay thank you okay fine you have to share your

03:38:07.500 --> 03:38:10.360
screen or one or more no sir i was having the energy

03:38:10.360 --> 03:38:16.640
regarding that good just just wait wait everyone okay okay

03:38:16.640 --> 03:38:19.320
so mucus please share the screen after that monies uh will

03:38:19.320 --> 03:38:21.800
share the screen after that those who are raising their

03:38:21.800 --> 03:38:25.220
hands i'll take them yeah amit sarma so you would like to

03:38:25.220 --> 03:38:30.760
share the screen amit amit no no no not sharing just two

03:38:30.760 --> 03:38:34.600
three points if you will we'll talk it we'll talk about it

03:38:34.600 --> 03:38:38.080
peacefully okay so let me like there are two people only

03:38:38.080 --> 03:38:43.180
mukes and money i want to say this okay yeah so mukes who is

03:38:43.180 --> 03:38:46.780
sharing by the way must and sharing the yeah mucus please

03:38:46.780 --> 03:38:52.800
tell me the issue yeah uh so uh here uh to uh publish this

03:38:52.800 --> 03:38:57.140
code uh i just uh missed that thing to debug the issues from

03:38:57.140 --> 03:39:02.400
my end okay just to wait for four hours but to uh do it

03:39:02.400 --> 03:39:06.160
deployment right way so okay what was the things now uh

03:39:06.160 --> 03:39:11.000
because i have uh if you see okay so fine you have to write

03:39:11.000 --> 03:39:14.660
uh like inside this render right so basically you have to

03:39:14.660 --> 03:39:19.300
write a uv corn uh just go to render yeah

03:39:22.110 --> 03:39:30.000
right yeah yeah sorry where is your screen okay go to render

03:39:30.000 --> 03:39:34.360
python is fine main is fine uh root directory is fine blank

03:39:34.360 --> 03:39:38.220
that's cool and then pip install requirement.txt you have a

03:39:38.220 --> 03:39:42.280
requirement.txt right inside your file yes okay now so

03:39:42.280 --> 03:39:45.860
inside this start command so you have to technically write

03:39:45.860 --> 03:39:54.060
uh uv corn right uv corn uvi's urn uv's urn yeah space so

03:39:54.060 --> 03:39:55.580
what is your file name can you please show me your

03:39:55.580 --> 03:39:57.640
repository yeah

03:40:02.820 --> 03:40:06.420
yeah so your file name is which one uh where

03:40:08.240 --> 03:40:09.920
you have written the actual api code

03:40:21.730 --> 03:40:28.510
no no this is ipynb you can yeah yeah this one okay so your

03:40:28.510 --> 03:40:32.030
first of all your pi file is capital dot p it should be dot

03:40:32.030 --> 03:40:35.410
py py small otherwise it will raise a conflict so correct

03:40:35.410 --> 03:40:40.210
that particular part uh second is you have a folder inside a

03:40:40.210 --> 03:40:44.050
folder so technically go back to your render it will not be

03:40:44.050 --> 03:40:47.130
able to recognize because it's it's not there right and even

03:40:47.130 --> 03:40:50.270
it will always recognize your requirement.txt so here come

03:40:50.270 --> 03:40:54.810
down come down come down so a branch is main and then like a

03:40:54.810 --> 03:40:58.470
root directory so inside root directory leave it branch is

03:40:58.470 --> 03:41:02.610
main your branch is main root directory the option yeah over

03:41:02.610 --> 03:41:09.490
here just try to type uh api no no just don't don't give a

03:41:09.490 --> 03:41:12.710
slash don't give a slash just type api what is your

03:41:12.710 --> 03:41:14.510
directory name the directory name that you have given right

03:41:14.510 --> 03:41:15.710
yeah

03:41:17.950 --> 03:41:22.990
api testing and if you underscore testing yes that one so

03:41:26.800 --> 03:41:29.280
that should be your do directory because it will go there

03:41:29.280 --> 03:41:32.560
and then it will try to like uh search yes this one all

03:41:32.560 --> 03:41:35.700
right now yeah so api testing this is this is correct leave

03:41:35.700 --> 03:41:38.880
it till this point and then you go and correct your pi file

03:41:38.880 --> 03:41:41.500
as well your pi file is not correct just

03:41:48.320 --> 03:41:50.720
do one thing give me a control i'll do it from my end within

03:41:50.720 --> 03:41:55.320
like two three seconds yeah give me a control yeah

03:41:59.670 --> 03:42:06.470
fine leave your system now so you have this this this this

03:42:06.470 --> 03:42:11.450
okay fine so you have a github just just remove a chat

03:42:11.450 --> 03:42:13.510
window and everything from your system it's it's like

03:42:13.510 --> 03:42:20.510
disturbing me yeah remove a chat yeah maybe minimize it and

03:42:22.080 --> 03:42:26.940
then the bar as well the top bar remove that let

03:42:29.340 --> 03:42:37.170
me change everything no still there is a bar remove that bar

03:42:37.170 --> 03:42:43.490
i can't control that bar by the way one thing yeah the top

03:42:43.490 --> 03:42:46.110
bar just just remove it the bar zoom bar that is visible

03:42:46.110 --> 03:42:53.370
right so just remove that bar i am not able to see uh i can

03:42:53.370 --> 03:42:56.510
see but i can't control that bar apart from that bar i can

03:42:56.510 --> 03:42:58.530
control the entire screen by the way

03:43:02.510 --> 03:43:08.790
okay just a minute then minimize okay got it huh yeah the

03:43:08.790 --> 03:43:14.750
bar that you can see right okay so dot pi file commit

03:43:14.750 --> 03:43:20.190
changes okay commit changes fine so pi file is now become

03:43:20.190 --> 03:43:24.430
testing.pi file r-e-q-u-i-r-e-a-m-a-n-t-s so fast api and

03:43:24.430 --> 03:43:30.770
unicorn is fine and then inside that fine okay good uh go to

03:43:30.770 --> 03:43:34.690
render then we have main we have this we have this api

03:43:34.690 --> 03:43:38.690
testing requirement.txt fine we have to push that changes we

03:43:38.690 --> 03:43:41.710
have to push no in our github i have already directly i have

03:43:41.710 --> 03:43:45.270
changed it so no okay okay direct file okay yeah so teres t

03:43:45.270 --> 03:43:50.890
-i-n-g this is your file name so t-e-s-t-i-n-g file name

03:43:51.170 --> 03:43:57.770
colon app and then i have to basically give a hyphen hyphen

03:43:57.770 --> 03:44:07.550
host and make it neutral so hyphen hyphen host and zero dot

03:44:07.550 --> 03:44:12.550
zero dot zero dot zero four zero port number lets me give it

03:44:12.550 --> 03:44:19.520
to ten thousand or eight thousand hmm so uvi c-o-r-n-t-e-s-t

03:44:19.520 --> 03:44:24.480
-i-n-g colon app hyphen hyphen host port number fine now

03:44:24.480 --> 03:44:25.840
select

03:44:28.080 --> 03:44:30.040
free deploy

variety this this doesn't exist please check oh so your

03:44:43.690 --> 03:44:50.010
variety doesn't exist is it api testing so under this api

03:44:50.010 --> 03:44:54.710
which is your main there is a

03:44:58.110 --> 03:45:02.650
testing and it is not even able to recognize that one he

03:45:27.640 --> 03:45:29.340
has to change yes

03:45:55.870 --> 03:45:59.630
yes now

03:46:11.370 --> 03:46:14.410
it is able to clone it was not able to reach out to that

03:46:14.410 --> 03:46:17.190
directory could not find the version that satisfy the

03:46:17.190 --> 03:46:24.830
requirement first you have written abi in your requirement

03:46:24.830 --> 03:46:30.510
dot txt file sir you have written abi not ap see it's a abi

03:46:30.510 --> 03:46:36.050
so failed okay let me change it here itself so fst it's a

03:46:36.050 --> 03:46:42.230
api api yeah commit changes commit changes and then let me

03:46:42.230 --> 03:46:45.470
push it from the latest commit so manual deploy deploy

03:46:45.470 --> 03:46:47.030
latest commit deploy

03:46:52.920 --> 03:46:57.140
latest commit deploy will start after the current deployment

03:46:57.140 --> 03:46:58.040
completes it's okay

03:49:47.210 --> 03:49:51.930
now it will work okay okay so it was taking first it was

03:49:51.930 --> 03:49:57.130
wrong name and then yeah so so in the very first phase your

03:49:57.130 --> 03:49:59.690
directory name itself was wrong you have written like a

03:49:59.690 --> 03:50:01.570
directory inside directory so we have to go inside that

03:50:01.570 --> 03:50:05.230
second one was your name was like a wrong third one was like

03:50:05.230 --> 03:50:10.390
your requirement.txt so now build successful so now it will

03:50:10.390 --> 03:50:13.450
work yeah in progress it will be live in some time deploying

03:50:13.450 --> 03:50:14.230
so

03:50:17.520 --> 03:50:22.500
the link will be uh coming here itself this is the link okay

03:50:22.500 --> 03:50:24.960
this is the link okay uh so here if you will go after

03:50:24.960 --> 03:50:28.980
deployment it will be live so as of now 502 means still

03:50:28.980 --> 03:50:33.400
process is going on okay just wait for yeah now it's live so

03:50:33.400 --> 03:50:36.520
now if i'm going to hit this link i will not see the same

03:50:36.520 --> 03:50:40.560
i'll see detail not found which is cool and i can do doc

03:50:40.560 --> 03:50:46.420
docs so now i can render the swagger ui with my own api

03:50:46.420 --> 03:50:49.680
right this one yeah got it got it yeah thank you sir yeah

03:50:49.680 --> 03:50:55.620
thank you yeah okay so so one is monies yes monies what is

03:50:55.620 --> 03:51:01.060
your issue said in deployment just so show me your screen

03:51:01.060 --> 03:51:04.300
show me your screen give me access i'll fix it is

03:51:06.190 --> 03:51:11.510
it sharing sir yeah so yet to appear what is uh issue exeter

03:51:11.510 --> 03:51:15.290
status running this this this this okay fine so testing app

03:51:15.290 --> 03:51:18.910
port this one okay uh calamity to troubleshoot exit with the

03:51:18.910 --> 03:51:21.630
status code 117 build was successfully deploy was successful

03:51:21.630 --> 03:51:25.330
okay give me control and uh today let me check so

03:51:29.620 --> 03:51:33.540
basically this is your repo you have requirement dot txt

03:51:33.540 --> 03:51:39.200
fast api uvcon fine then which one you are trying to deploy

03:51:39.200 --> 03:51:45.640
this one okay fine testing dot pi file you are trying to

03:51:45.640 --> 03:51:53.720
deploy okay so this is fine then sir i guess in visual

03:51:53.720 --> 03:51:58.380
studio i got a error i guess you can see in vs code in vs

03:51:58.380 --> 03:52:02.780
code also you got the error yeah i guess then then we'll fix

03:52:02.780 --> 03:52:07.100
it there itself we'll get to know what is the error so what

03:52:07.100 --> 03:52:10.100
is the error you have received cler

03:52:16.560 --> 03:52:19.340
so testing testing

03:52:21.480 --> 03:52:23.780
uvcon app

03:52:27.270 --> 03:52:30.270
it's running let

03:52:37.310 --> 03:52:38.910
me open up any of your browser

03:52:55.920 --> 03:53:00.120
it's up and running it looks good but in render i guess it's

03:53:00.120 --> 03:53:04.100
not getting deployed we'll see we'll fix it python

03:53:25.030 --> 03:53:26.210
3 main

03:53:28.960 --> 03:53:40.640
reqi remnts reqi remnts dot txt pip install okay so reqi tis

03:53:40.640 --> 03:53:42.440
okay ue

03:53:45.860 --> 03:53:51.300

it's like fixed okay it was it was just it was just waiting

03:55:13.180 --> 03:55:18.260
for me to you know do something in your system yeah i have

03:55:18.260 --> 03:55:24.120
another question sir right now i'm in fourth year i'm doing

03:55:24.120 --> 03:55:28.260
electronics and communication engineering okay sir i'm

03:55:28.260 --> 03:55:34.440
really like all all these are new things for me and I'm

03:55:34.440 --> 03:55:38.280
catching I'm catching to your things but is there any

03:55:38.280 --> 03:55:44.280
prerequisites I know Python and I know C++ is it enough or

03:55:44.280 --> 03:55:48.760
should I learn like about mathematics they say for just just

03:55:48.760 --> 03:55:50.960
join my class don't worry just join my class you have a time

03:55:50.960 --> 03:55:55.620
you are in fourth year right and just learn with me I think

03:55:55.620 --> 03:55:59.760
that because even I don't have much experience and I see in

03:55:59.760 --> 03:56:03.920
group many people keep texting and I guess it all those

03:56:03.920 --> 03:56:07.040
becomes new things for me so that's that's fine it should

03:56:07.040 --> 03:56:09.420
not know everything at a time right we are human being not a

03:56:09.420 --> 03:56:14.580
chat GPT so it's fine okay okay sir and another doubt like

03:56:14.580 --> 03:56:18.940
you you are running your that curl of code command in your

03:56:18.940 --> 03:56:24.420
Ubuntu right so that I can run in my power shell and in code

03:56:24.420 --> 03:56:27.740
prompt also right yes you can run it yeah so I have shown

03:56:27.740 --> 03:56:30.260
like some of the people were running it right yeah yeah for

03:56:30.260 --> 03:56:33.340
that I should install that curl package will be by the way

03:56:33.360 --> 03:56:35.700
default available by default it will be available if not

03:56:35.700 --> 03:56:39.660
that's updated okay fine thank you sir thank you thank you

03:56:39.660 --> 03:56:44.800
okay so change your role now Amit Prashant Rakesh what is

03:56:44.800 --> 03:56:46.920
your question please go ahead one by one first Amit then

03:56:46.920 --> 03:56:51.420
Prashant then Rakesh I think we have only three hands raised

03:56:51.420 --> 03:56:57.500
now yeah Rakesh Amit Prashant you have any question hello

03:56:57.500 --> 03:57:01.520
sir this is Prashant yeah Prashant tell me sir I just want

03:57:01.520 --> 03:57:06.000
to ask that in the actual today classes that API you telling

03:57:06.000 --> 03:57:11.300
so when we are mentioned this particular thing required to

03:57:11.300 --> 03:57:15.640
the ng grow so in that ng that was not a deployment that is

03:57:15.640 --> 03:57:18.020
not going to happen that is called as forwarding forwarding

03:57:18.020 --> 03:57:21.680
basically yeah forwarding public forwarding like no

03:57:22.240 --> 03:57:26.780
basically like we are trying to do a port forwarding what is

03:57:26.780 --> 03:57:30.380
that like port port port port forward that technical name is

03:57:30.380 --> 03:57:36.160
port forwarding basically okay so the postman when I checked

03:57:36.160 --> 03:57:40.380
this using post API actually I made one post API or when I

03:57:40.380 --> 03:57:43.920
check in a postman I getting a responses using ng grow same

03:57:43.920 --> 03:57:49.700
API or URL okay when I put this particular URL into that

03:57:49.700 --> 03:57:52.600
they are giving me empty response so I just want to ask for

03:57:52.600 --> 03:57:57.240
getting a response should I use slash docs then with the no

03:57:57.240 --> 03:58:00.460
no docs docs is one of the way docs basically give you a

03:58:00.460 --> 03:58:03.740
swagger UI so where inside a UI itself you will be able to

03:58:03.740 --> 03:58:06.780
test it so basically it's a coming attached with the fast

03:58:06.780 --> 03:58:10.220
api right if you have to test it in a postman you can just

03:58:10.220 --> 03:58:13.000
go ahead with the simple url and then the methods if you

03:58:13.000 --> 03:58:14.920
have to test it in a curl so all these things are different

03:58:14.920 --> 03:58:18.160
different like a way by which you can you are hitting the

03:58:18.160 --> 03:58:22.840
same apis so my question is when when i make a url using ng

03:58:22.840 --> 03:58:27.060
grok so when i paste into the website it's not giving me any

03:58:27.060 --> 03:58:30.700
response so it will give you responses just do ng doc url

03:58:30.700 --> 03:58:34.780
slash docs it will give you a response then it will be given

03:58:34.780 --> 03:58:37.680
obviously how do i how it will give you a response without

03:58:37.680 --> 03:58:40.820
like writing adults even in your local you are writing what

03:58:40.820 --> 03:58:45.180
local host port number slash docs right okay okay so that's

03:58:45.180 --> 03:58:48.720
why because slash doc is necessary right slash docs means

03:58:48.720 --> 03:58:51.480
swagger ui so that is a route for swagger ui basically

03:58:51.480 --> 03:58:55.240
swagger ui is which which is like a inbuilt inside fast api

03:58:55.240 --> 03:58:59.160
because what i taught in get when we are doing we are not we

03:58:59.160 --> 03:59:02.240
are they directly giving response but in post because we

03:59:02.240 --> 03:59:05.580
have to pass a parameter so for passing a parameters that

03:59:05.580 --> 03:59:09.800
dog required right if you are trying to do it with the

03:59:09.800 --> 03:59:15.180
swagger ui only in that case if you are doing it with like a

03:59:15.180 --> 03:59:19.460
postman then slash docs is not required basically your route

03:59:19.460 --> 03:59:22.380
is required at which your method is like available

03:59:25.420 --> 03:59:28.220
okay solve the assignment which i have given to you

03:59:28.220 --> 03:59:33.460
yesterday in that's what i'm doing yeah just just solve it

03:59:33.460 --> 03:59:35.960
solve it and then like i think things will be clear i know

03:59:35.960 --> 03:59:40.080
like you are getting stuck uh philosophically that this is

03:59:40.080 --> 03:59:43.640
happening that's fine that's fine it's all the same because

03:59:43.640 --> 03:59:47.020
the postman i'm getting i solve the assignment there's a

03:59:47.020 --> 03:59:51.420
postman i get the response but uh yeah so baseline

03:59:51.420 --> 03:59:55.240
philosophy is you have a method available at url slash docs

03:59:55.240 --> 03:59:59.560
is nothing but just like a postman postman is one of the

03:59:59.560 --> 03:59:59.820
tools

04:00:00.060 --> 04:00:04.040
by which I am able to test. So, at slash docs, you are

04:00:04.040 --> 04:00:07.700
getting another tool. Just imagine in this way. Just another

04:00:07.700 --> 04:00:10.740
tool which is helping you out in terms of testing an API.

04:00:11.300 --> 04:00:18.920
Just a tool. Got it. Yeah. Can I share my screen? Yeah,

04:00:18.940 --> 04:00:21.260
Rakesh, you would like to share the screen? Yeah. Yeah,

04:00:21.260 --> 04:00:24.240
please go ahead. Okay, so Prashant Gupta, please explain the

04:00:24.240 --> 04:00:26.800
option for working in organization without depending on...

04:00:26.800 --> 04:00:31.520
See, you have to use the Prashant API. Maybe you can use

04:00:31.520 --> 04:00:34.560
from a URI. Maybe you can use from OpenAI. Maybe you can use

04:00:34.560 --> 04:00:37.420
from a Gemini. Because even if you are working inside the

04:00:37.420 --> 04:00:40.260
organization, unless and until your organization is not

04:00:40.260 --> 04:00:43.600
hosting those model or you are not hosting those model on a

04:00:43.600 --> 04:00:46.300
GPUs, you will not be able to do inferencing. You will not

04:00:46.300 --> 04:00:49.080
be able to build the industry-grade application. So, either

04:00:49.080 --> 04:00:51.980
go ahead with the URI API or go ahead with like some other

04:00:51.980 --> 04:00:56.040
platform by paying like a PubXLit, OpenAI, CloudJay, or

04:00:56.040 --> 04:00:59.620
maybe like... like a Gemini, anywhere. But you need an API.

04:01:00.260 --> 04:01:02.740
And if you have to like host it, then I have published a

04:01:02.740 --> 04:01:05.480
video study itself. So, host your model on a GPU and then

04:01:05.480 --> 04:01:08.560
like you will be having your own model and you don't have to

04:01:08.560 --> 04:01:11.740
like call URI or anyone's API. You will be able to call your

04:01:11.740 --> 04:01:16.020
own. Hope I am able to answer your question, Prashant. Yeah.

04:01:16.140 --> 04:01:19.920
So, someone sent me... Rakesh, right? Yeah, share this with

04:01:19.920 --> 04:01:24.540
Rakesh. You have a permission. I am not able to push my code

04:01:24.540 --> 04:01:28.960
to this VS Code. Sorry, GitHub. Okay, share the screen,

04:01:28.980 --> 04:01:32.540
share the screen. I will do it. My screen is shared. No, I

04:01:32.540 --> 04:01:36.680
am not able to see your screen, by the way. Which screen you

04:01:36.680 --> 04:01:37.000
are sharing?

04:01:42.780 --> 04:01:47.420
Now it's appearing. Okay, got it. So, what is the issue? I

04:01:47.420 --> 04:01:53.360
am not able to push that code to GitHub. Hmm. Share your

04:01:53.360 --> 04:01:56.700
whole screen. I think you have shared just a single screen

04:01:56.700 --> 04:02:01.120
with me. So, share your whole screen, basically. Just do

04:02:01.120 --> 04:02:03.140
unshare. And then share your whole screen.

04:02:11.370 --> 04:02:12.570
Share complete system, yeah.

04:02:18.140 --> 04:02:22.280
How to share? So, basically, once you are going to click on

04:02:22.280 --> 04:02:25.180
share, right, so you will be able to see, like, entire

04:02:25.180 --> 04:02:26.960
screen option, the very first option.

04:02:29.570 --> 04:02:35.450
Now you will see the... Let me see. Yeah, now I can see your

04:02:35.450 --> 04:02:43.330
URL. And I think... Okay, just give me a control now. No, I

04:02:43.330 --> 04:02:46.070
don't have a control. Because you are not sharing the

04:02:46.070 --> 04:02:49.420
screen. You are sharing the whole screen. Hmm.

04:02:54.880 --> 04:02:57.560
So, have you joined through a browser or through a Zoom app?

04:02:58.560 --> 04:03:02.120
I have joined through a browser. Hmm. Then again, I won't be

04:03:02.120 --> 04:03:04.140
able to control. So, basically, to control, I need a Zoom

04:03:04.140 --> 04:03:06.440
app. Fine. Share your screen. I'll help you out from here

04:03:06.440 --> 04:03:08.740
itself. So, from next time, maybe you can join through a

04:03:08.740 --> 04:03:10.640
Zoom app. That will be better. So that I can control your

04:03:10.640 --> 04:03:17.020
screen. Yeah. Share it now? Yeah. So, what is the issue? You

04:03:17.020 --> 04:03:20.080
are not able to push your code to GitHub, right? Yeah. Okay.

04:03:20.140 --> 04:03:24.720
Not an issue. So, just open up new terminal.

04:03:28.490 --> 04:03:32.510
Hmm. Yeah. Do git. J-I-T git. Just git.

04:03:35.510 --> 04:03:38.730
Just git. Not double. Yeah. Sorry. I have my... Okay. So,

04:03:38.770 --> 04:03:42.330
git is installed. Now, show me your repository. Go to your

04:03:42.330 --> 04:03:43.250
GitHub. I

04:03:48.880 --> 04:03:54.160
was trying to push this to this repo. No, no. Fine. Go to

04:03:54.160 --> 04:03:55.280
GitHub. Go to GitHub.com.

04:03:58.580 --> 04:04:03.000
This repository? Yeah. The repository. GitHub.com. Like the

04:04:03.000 --> 04:04:06.060
browser. Where you have a GitHub repository, right? Go

04:04:06.060 --> 04:04:10.060
there. Yeah. I am in repo only. No. I can't see your screen,

04:04:10.140 --> 04:04:12.420
sir. Basically, you are sharing only one screen, I believe.

04:04:12.480 --> 04:04:15.820
I can see your like a VS code screen. You are still...

04:04:15.820 --> 04:04:18.360
Because you can share your entire screen. That is the option

04:04:18.360 --> 04:04:19.900
which is available. But you have not shared the entire

04:04:19.900 --> 04:04:22.900
screen. Okay. Please give me some time. I will share entire

04:04:22.900 --> 04:04:26.640
screen. Yeah. Meanwhile, you can take all that question. I

04:04:26.640 --> 04:04:29.720
just have only one person, I believe. I have cleared all the

04:04:29.720 --> 04:04:32.860
question. Yeah. So, Amit, what is your question? Yeah. So, I

04:04:32.860 --> 04:04:34.760
have a question. Amit, what is your question? Yeah. Anyone

04:04:34.760 --> 04:04:36.660
else, guys, who is having question for me? Otherwise, we

04:04:36.660 --> 04:04:41.020
will go for closer. Hello. Hello. Yeah, Amit. Go ahead. Go

04:04:41.020 --> 04:04:42.780
ahead, please. Go ahead. Yeah, Amit. Please go ahead.

04:04:42.920 --> 04:04:49.780
Sudhanshu sir. Hmm. Sir, only a few things. I am also

04:04:49.780 --> 04:04:52.960
working in this area, sir. Okay. So, it will be a great

04:04:52.960 --> 04:04:56.320
help, sir, if we can provide the transcript of subtitle for

04:04:56.320 --> 04:05:00.120
download purpose. So, that later we can use AI tool like

04:05:00.120 --> 04:05:02.880
notebook, LLM, and other things to make the transcript and

04:05:02.880 --> 04:05:06.600
make our notes. So, in revision time rather than going for

04:05:06.600 --> 04:05:09.960
the long video, we can take the help of transcript

04:05:09.960 --> 04:05:14.300
sometimes. It will be a great help. Transcripts I can

04:05:14.300 --> 04:05:17.340
provide but for a long term, right, because we have a lot of

04:05:17.340 --> 04:05:19.700
classes. So, it will be very difficult for us to maintain

04:05:19.700 --> 04:05:22.320
it. Anyhow, we are generating a transcript for this lecture.

04:05:22.460 --> 04:05:24.400
For entire lecture, we are generating a transcript actually.

04:05:25.260 --> 04:05:27.940
By default, Zoom is doing it. But yeah, maintaining those

04:05:27.940 --> 04:05:30.080
transcript will be very, very difficult. Very difficult.

04:05:31.920 --> 04:05:37.380
Right. Okay. So... And, sir, secondly, sir, since we are

04:05:37.380 --> 04:05:41.980
working professionals, sometimes we might miss the class.

04:05:42.320 --> 04:05:45.840
So, there might be the case, let's say, while teaching, you

04:05:45.840 --> 04:05:51.340
are referring some reference, that document, URL, and you

04:05:51.340 --> 04:05:55.100
are pasting in the chat. So, somehow, it will be missed if

04:05:55.100 --> 04:05:57.880
we are going to see the recording. So, best, basically, if

04:05:57.880 --> 04:06:02.120
we can basically make one document file in that... That is

04:06:02.120 --> 04:06:05.160
practically, sir... Sir, practically, see, practically,

04:06:05.320 --> 04:06:08.540
whatever I am teaching, everything is getting recorded. Now,

04:06:08.540 --> 04:06:10.660
when you will see the recording, you will be able to see the

04:06:10.660 --> 04:06:14.100
exact same thing. And I just go ahead, whenever I am sharing

04:06:14.100 --> 04:06:16.800
a URL, I just go ahead with a Google search approach. I do a

04:06:16.800 --> 04:06:19.300
Google search, I show you that, okay, fine, search this one,

04:06:19.360 --> 04:06:21.860
and then from there, go to the URL. Okay. Now, if you are

04:06:21.860 --> 04:06:26.200
asking me to maintain all of those URLs, right, all of those

04:06:26.200 --> 04:06:28.800
URLs maintain a transcript, I don't think that it's called

04:06:28.800 --> 04:06:31.860
as real learning. No, no, no, sir. I am not saying this. I

04:06:31.860 --> 04:06:34.760
am saying, I am saying, sir, through, on chat, sometimes,

04:06:34.860 --> 04:06:37.000
basically, casually, basically, it's... No, no, no. So,

04:06:37.000 --> 04:06:39.380
whatever I am showing in chat, I am doing it on a screen as

04:06:39.380 --> 04:06:42.800
well, right? Yeah, go through this URL. No, so, whatever I

04:06:42.800 --> 04:06:45.180
am sharing in a chat, yeah, yeah, whatever I am sharing in

04:06:45.180 --> 04:06:47.720
chat, I am trying to show it on a screen as well, right, at

04:06:47.720 --> 04:06:50.340
the same point of a time. Yeah? Everything is getting

04:06:50.340 --> 04:06:53.680
recorded in Alexa itself. So, very difficult for me to, you

04:06:53.680 --> 04:06:56.620
know, like, let's suppose I have opened up 50 different,

04:06:56.700 --> 04:06:59.160
different URL. Now, it will be very difficult for me to, you

04:06:59.160 --> 04:07:03.660
know, maintain those and upload it to, as a content. I mean,

04:07:03.680 --> 04:07:06.360
like, that's the reason I am uploading a recording, by the

04:07:06.360 --> 04:07:10.100
way. And, again, I know, like, if I am going to do that,

04:07:10.160 --> 04:07:13.940
next time, I will get another, like... No issue. No issue.

04:07:14.020 --> 04:07:17.560
No issue. Yeah. So, let's keep it... No issue. Yeah, let's

04:07:17.560 --> 04:07:20.000
keep it simple and plain. I think that, in that way, we will

04:07:20.000 --> 04:07:24.860
be able to go very, very long. And, sir, my background also

04:07:24.860 --> 04:07:30.480
are teaching, sir. So... Okay. One... I know, basically, you

04:07:30.480 --> 04:07:32.400
are teaching really good things. And, sir, basically, that

04:07:32.400 --> 04:07:34.400
giving suggestion to you, something like that. Basically, I

04:07:34.400 --> 04:07:40.080
am showing the torch to the sun. I have this... Just one

04:07:40.080 --> 04:07:42.780
suggestion, sir. Humble suggestion. Creating a code,

04:07:42.820 --> 04:07:45.980
basically, but really doing a good job, basically. You are

04:07:45.980 --> 04:07:50.100
asking us to type with us, with me. But, at the same time,

04:07:50.140 --> 04:07:52.880
sir, it will be a great... It will help in our learning

04:07:52.880 --> 04:07:56.000
journey much more better way. Sir, a mind map, basically,

04:07:56.000 --> 04:07:58.920
you know, through a pen, marker, sir, tell us that, sir, we

04:07:58.920 --> 04:08:02.420
are going to do this. These steps will be in it. And then,

04:08:02.460 --> 04:08:06.160
basically, we will code. So, a little bit of learning, sir,

04:08:06.160 --> 04:08:08.260
it will be an announcement, sir. This is my suggestion, sir.

04:08:08.520 --> 04:08:10.500
Okay. Let me tell you one thing. Okay. We have done all

04:08:10.500 --> 04:08:14.880
that. Everything. And as soon as the class starts, even when

04:08:14.880 --> 04:08:17.300
the class starts, when we do an announcement in your group,

04:08:17.300 --> 04:08:19.520
we write there that, okay, this topic is going to be

04:08:19.520 --> 04:08:23.180
discussed. Okay. First stage. It is clear to you that, okay,

04:08:23.220 --> 04:08:25.700
this is going to be discussed in the mind today. I don't

04:08:25.700 --> 04:08:27.960
feel like doing this. I know it very well. So, okay, we will

04:08:27.960 --> 04:08:29.780
not join this. Second, as soon as the class starts, we will

04:08:29.780 --> 04:08:30.020
write that, okay, this topic is going to be discussed. And

04:08:30.020 --> 04:08:32.680
as soon as the class starts, any live class, you see, what

04:08:32.680 --> 04:08:35.400
has always been discussed before and what we are going to do

04:08:35.400 --> 04:08:37.440
today. Like whatever we have discussed today, you see the

04:08:37.440 --> 04:08:40.320
first five minutes of the class, it has been told there that

04:08:40.320 --> 04:08:43.400
today we, yesterday we had basically explained about APIs.

04:08:44.320 --> 04:08:47.100
After that, what is the API for philosophy? Then what is the

04:08:47.100 --> 04:08:48.920
post method? What is the get method? What is the testing?

04:08:49.180 --> 04:08:52.460
And today we will extend that. And this topic was also told

04:08:52.460 --> 04:08:54.040
yesterday that what we are going to study today. That today

04:08:54.040 --> 04:08:56.320
we will study put. Today we will study get. No, no, sir. I

04:08:56.320 --> 04:08:59.440
am not talking about the topic, sir. Isn't that different?

04:08:59.660 --> 04:09:01.080
No, no, sir. I am talking about the topic, sir. Let's say I

04:09:01.080 --> 04:09:02.360
am saying this. Let's say we are implementing some function.

04:09:03.200 --> 04:09:06.000
So its flow is basically, it is called pseudo algorithm

04:09:06.000 --> 04:09:08.400
type. Sir, look, I am telling you a simple name. We will get

04:09:08.400 --> 04:09:11.380
the flow of that, first we will code it. No, no, no, the

04:09:11.380 --> 04:09:13.860
style you are telling, pseudo basic level, right? We all

04:09:13.860 --> 04:09:15.600
have come from college and we have come from that college,

04:09:15.880 --> 04:09:18.400
from that school where that same pseudo basic level code was

04:09:18.400 --> 04:09:21.600
taught. But we could not write code for five years, right?

04:09:22.400 --> 04:09:25.400
The pseudo basic code that was taught in your college, you

04:09:25.400 --> 04:09:27.700
were taught in every class, every master who used to come

04:09:27.700 --> 04:09:29.540
and teach you, he used to come and teach you. He used to

04:09:29.540 --> 04:09:29.760
come and teach you, he used to come and teach you. But the

04:09:29.760 --> 04:09:31.700
ones were basi, kodi padhaate, pote padhaate, unhone kobi

04:09:31.700 --> 04:09:35.040
code type nahi kiya. And ja aapki exam hoti thi, to aap paas

04:09:35.040 --> 04:09:36.880
lehenga code nahi likh pathate the. And that is a reality,

04:09:37.080 --> 04:09:41.020
right? That is a reality. Kya fayda us padhai ka? Kya fayda

04:09:41.020 --> 04:09:45.100
us pattern ka? Kuch bhi nahi, right? Exactly. Sir, aapне

04:09:45.100 --> 04:09:47.120
nahi kar raha hon sir puchthi nahi. No, no, non, argument ke

04:09:47.120 --> 04:09:48.580
baat hi nahi hai. I am just trying to make sure. Subjective

04:09:48.580 --> 04:09:51.240
qual hosaknaya hiye. I am just doing a fair discussion over

04:09:51.240 --> 04:09:55.360
here. Theki hai ki woh approach dahi sahi hai. By teaching

04:09:55.360 --> 04:09:59.460
pseudo-basic code, by writing it by hand... Actually, sir, I

04:09:59.460 --> 04:10:02.760
am saying this because the coding attempts of children fail

04:10:02.760 --> 04:10:08.020
because without making a mind map, they jump straight to

04:10:08.020 --> 04:10:13.160
coding. Wrong, wrong, wrong, again wrong. Again, the correct

04:10:13.160 --> 04:10:16.360
approach was never the correct one which we were taught in

04:10:16.360 --> 04:10:19.560
college. The correct approach was always this, solve the

04:10:19.560 --> 04:10:22.760
problem, you will get a bug, you will fix the bug and then

04:10:22.760 --> 04:10:27.240
you will learn. And you will see, you will learn. What

04:10:27.240 --> 04:10:30.620
happens in the mind? It is not a matter of knowledge then.

04:10:31.440 --> 04:10:33.360
It is not a matter of knowledge, it is a subjective quality.

04:10:33.640 --> 04:10:37.160
Okay, thank you, thank you, sir. Okay, so please share your

04:10:37.160 --> 04:10:42.280
screen, Rakesh. Yeah, I will share. As far as the suggestion

04:10:42.280 --> 04:10:44.600
is concerned, many people give suggestions. I mean like,

04:10:44.640 --> 04:10:51.180
never works. Do a practical, always works. I hope it's fine

04:10:51.180 --> 04:10:55.540
with every one of us. Right, guys? Everyone? Yeah. Go ahead.

04:10:55.720 --> 04:10:58.980
So, what is the issue, Rakesh? I am not able to push the

04:10:58.980 --> 04:11:02.760
code to GitHub. Okay, not an issue. So, just try to open up

04:11:02.760 --> 04:11:06.680
your GitHub repository. Yeah. So, I can see it now. Now,

04:11:06.680 --> 04:11:10.100
come down, come down. It's the same repository, same blank

04:11:10.100 --> 04:11:14.480
repository that you have created, right? Go there. Go to the

04:11:14.480 --> 04:11:18.080
repository, come down. Now, so we are able to see a couple

04:11:18.080 --> 04:11:21.060
of commands, right? Okay. Yeah. So, first of all, git init,

04:11:21.120 --> 04:11:24.120
git add, git commit. Now, go back. Go back to your like a

04:11:24.120 --> 04:11:26.100
VSCode terminal. Yeah.

04:11:29.800 --> 04:11:35.020
So, first of all, git init. Okay. Now, I can see your whole

04:11:35.020 --> 04:11:36.560
screen. I can control your screen as well.

04:11:39.700 --> 04:11:43.360
Can I give you control? No, it's fine. Do it. So, git init

04:11:43.360 --> 04:11:47.280
is fine. Rename the repository. Okay. Then, just I am

04:11:47.280 --> 04:11:50.800
telling you the command. Type it. Git add. Sorry, I am

04:11:50.800 --> 04:11:53.000
having some issues. No, the second one is git add.

04:12:04.020 --> 04:12:12.920
Sorry. Just type it. Type it. Git add dot. Yeah. Dot. Remove

04:12:12.920 --> 04:12:13.280
the readme.

04:12:17.120 --> 04:12:19.620
Fine. Then, git commit hyphen m.

04:12:31.950 --> 04:12:35.390
Fine. It's done. Next one. So, add the branch.

04:13:13.610 --> 04:13:16.690
It's done. Go and refresh your repository. It's available

04:13:16.690 --> 04:13:17.030
now.

04:13:22.900 --> 04:13:27.080
Oh, thanks. I think I was missing something. Yeah. Just a

04:13:27.080 --> 04:13:31.220
simple step, right? And then, you have entire code inside

04:13:31.220 --> 04:13:35.060
API testing. Okay. So, you have to give a route directory is

04:13:35.060 --> 04:13:37.360
equal to API testing. Otherwise, it will not work on render.

04:13:38.020 --> 04:13:42.720
How to? Just do one thing. Click on new. Click on new. Just

04:13:42.720 --> 04:13:48.460
create the fresh one. Yeah. New. Web service. Select the new

04:13:48.460 --> 04:13:51.360
repository. Okay. Go back to your repository. Show me your

04:13:51.360 --> 04:13:55.360
repository once. Show me your repository. First API. Click

04:13:55.360 --> 04:13:55.960
on API testing.

04:14:02.050 --> 04:14:04.110
Click. Click. Click. Click. I

04:14:09.070 --> 04:14:09.930
think it's empty.

04:14:12.690 --> 04:14:16.590
Is it? Yeah. It's not open. Go back to your VS code.

04:14:20.570 --> 04:14:24.410
API underscore testing and you are in which directory? You

04:14:24.410 --> 04:14:30.150
are in 20 25 0 8 1 0. Sorry. Hmm. No, no. That's fine. So,

04:14:30.190 --> 04:14:32.330
you have pushed the entire repository itself. Right? That's

04:14:32.330 --> 04:14:35.470
fine. Like, there is no issue with that. Go back. Go back.

04:14:35.570 --> 04:14:43.990
And you have basically created this with numbers. That's a

04:14:43.990 --> 04:14:51.090
issue. That's the reason it's empty. Okay. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

04:14:51.150 --> 04:14:52.290
Hmm. Create a new repository.

04:15:14.770 --> 04:15:18.610
Yeah. It's created. Hmm. Now do the same thing in it. Add

04:15:18.610 --> 04:15:20.830
commit. Then add the branch. Push it.

Hmm. Hmm. Get commit. Hyphen m message.

04:16:16.110 --> 04:16:19.470
Remote origin already exists. So you have to write. No, no.

04:16:19.550 --> 04:16:22.710
It will not work. It push will fail over here. So get remove

04:16:22.710 --> 04:16:27.130
remote origin. You have to write a command. So just go there

04:16:27.130 --> 04:16:30.330
and type of commands because you have already added the

04:16:30.330 --> 04:16:34.470
previous, uh, get to, uh, the more get, remove remote

04:16:34.470 --> 04:16:41.010
