WEBVTT

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.580
Hey, hi everyone, good morning. So I think I'm audible and

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:06.700
visible to all of you, right? Yep. Okay, so we are going to

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.900
start in couple of minutes.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.360
Okay, so self-start guys, everyone. Yeah.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.250
Okay, so finally everyone, good morning. Those who have

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.210
joined late and I know today is Sunday. So obviously people

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.750
are feeling lazy. That's okay. It's like pretty much normal

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:05.430
for all of us.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.230
What is the agenda for today? So yeah, guys, what is the

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.870
agenda for today? What should be the agenda for today, by

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:14.170
the way?

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.910
Obviously. So yeah, we have like a lot of agenda we have

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.510
today. So obviously we are going to build an app. We are

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.330
going to attach a lot of like services into it. So that is

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.730
the agenda for today. I think I have already discussed about

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:35.550
it today.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.860
Okay, fine, everyone. So let me share my screen and let's

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.620
start with the class. So let me show you what we are going

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.840
to do it and what we are going to achieve today, by the way.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.720
So we are going to achieve not just one, two things. We are

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.920
going to achieve a couple of things in today's class.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.660
Yesterday, obviously, we were trying to do a hosting of this

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:22.680
like entire VM, I would say, where we were trying to host

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.460
our own LM model the way we try to host it in a real time.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.740
And obviously, today class is going to be the extension of

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.580
yesterday's class. But we'll try to do a lot of things, not

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.780
just one single things, but yeah, a lot of things just to

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:41.240
make our like. Application real time. So I believe my screen

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.980
is visible to all of you, right? Yeah, yeah.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.050
Okay, now, after today's class, basically, you will be able

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.270
to attach this entire application into your resume. You will

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:56.730
be able to push it inside your GitHub repository. And

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.010
probably you can say that that, yes, I have built it. I have

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:01.710
basically worked on that because there are so many features

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.750
which I have attached in this particular app and which I'm

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:08.210
going to give you a demo in today's class. And like I said,

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:11.110
so you will be able to write it down inside your. And then

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:14.390
there is like a lot of enhancement. Obviously, there is a

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.430
lot of scope. There is a lot of features that you can add.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:19.710
But yeah, so after adding these many features, I believe

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:22.630
it's good to go ahead with the resume application.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:31.180
So here, let me show you this media app. So this app is not

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.320
the same as before, I would say. So what I have done, what

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.120
kind of changes which I have made. So let's suppose if I'm

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:42.120
going to ask that. OK, let me start my server first of all.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.820
So that I can give you a demo.

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:49.650
Just a minute, guys. I'm starting my server, basically.

00:14:56.170 --> 00:15:01.290
OK, fine. So let me just give you a demo. So what kind of a

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:05.810
feature that I have added inside this bot and now what you

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:09.330
will be able to do with this one. So and what kind of more

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:12.390
application you all will be able to build. So I have even

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.230
listed down the kind of industry. And again, so I have

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:18.390
already prepared the task for all of you. So we're with

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:20.670
respect to a health care. With respect to a legal, with

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:23.050
respect to a finance, with respect to manufacturing, with

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:26.270
respect to retail and e-commerce, with respect to HR and

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:28.790
recruiting, with respect to real estate, with respect to

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:31.230
travel and hospitality, with respect to software

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:34.510
engineering, with respect to edutech. Basically, I'm going

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:39.690
to give you like a task where you can choose your own stream

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:42.570
and then you can try to build it. That I'll discuss at the

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:45.870
end of the class, by the way. Yeah. And I have already like.

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:48.610
So let's talk about the feature addition that I have done.

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:53.510
So inside this entire application. So now nothing is running

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:56.410
except this streamlint. So nothing is running in a local

00:15:56.410 --> 00:16:01.030
system, basically. So now if I'll talk about the actual

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:06.750
feature. Right. So here what I have done. So basically all

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:14.670
the data vector data is storing it into chroma db, chroma db

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:17.770
now. So when I'm trying to store this vector data into a

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:23.370
chroma db. So basically, if data is already loaded, you

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:29.090
don't have to load the same data you can start chatting

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:36.930
with, you can start chatting with your bot directly. So

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.430
let's suppose you have already loaded the data so you don't

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:41.490
have to, like, you know, go ahead once again and then you

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:43.630
have to load the data so you can start chatting with your

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:47.070
particular bot directly. So it is it is not going to ask you

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:51.590
to load our data, by the way. Not just that. So whenever you

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:54.150
are going to upload some document or let's suppose your

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:56.850
admin is going to upload some document because there will be

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.930
a different, different kind of privileges. So as a user,

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:01.790
maybe you don't have a document access, but maybe as an

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:02.770
admin user,

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:13.570
maybe you won't be having like an admin access and you won't

00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:17.970
be having access to the raw data. So your admin can upload

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:24.150
the data and data will be persisted into S3 bucket,

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:27.470
basically. So no local. Previously, we were trying to show

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:31.470
the data into a data folder, but I have removed that part as

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:33.390
well. Previously, we were using a Facebook as similarity

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:36.530
such I have removed that as well. So it's a chroma db. It's

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:40.970
a live chroma db that we will be using, by the way. And

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:46.010
apart from that, so you will be or user will be user will be

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:55.270
able to able to to raise the support ticket, by the way.

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:57.350
Yeah. So you. User will be able to read the support ticket,

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:00.450
or maybe if they would like to send a mail to some other

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:04.830
user, they will be able to basically do it. And again, so we

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:08.190
were using elements in two places. Right. So in one places,

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:11.290
so where we have to do a chat basically, and in one places,

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:14.790
so where we have to do the embedding, so embedding,

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:19.970
embedding multimodal or multilingual, you can say, right,

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:25.450
multilingual, multilingual embedding model. Right. So this

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:25.650
is the model as you can see in the CAC table. My global

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:29.020
model is global now.

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:40.710
Global now. Now. So if I talk about like a chart model

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:49.030
chart, completion model is global now. now global now now

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:54.250
yeah so you can you can try to so basically i'm giving you a

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:56.590
feature so where you can try to upload a new document and

00:18:56.590 --> 00:19:00.330
again that document will go into the s3 bucket but yes old

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:03.830
document will always be there and anyone can come over here

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:07.150
and then anyone will be able to like a chat with those

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:09.890
document plus i have made a lot of enhancement even with

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:13.710
respect to basically the kind of a response you all will be

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:19.110
able to get from your rag system so these are the things

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:23.250
which is like which has been done and now apart from that so

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:27.010
we have to host something on a scale right on a very big

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:29.450
scale so where it should go for auto scaling automatically

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:33.710
so where it should like a even take care of the ssl and

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:37.930
security certification and everything so basically we can

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:41.990
try to host this model or we can try to dockerize this model

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:45.230
so so we can try to dockerize this model so we can try to

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:47.350
dockerize this model and we can try to push this docker

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:50.810
image into a ecr ecr is nothing but one of the aws services

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:54.410
so basically it's called as elastic container registry and

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:59.310
then inside this ecr we can try to use app runner app runner

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:03.070
so app runner is one of the best i would say like a feature

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:06.050
which is provided by aws so where you will be able to run it

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:09.450
but on a scale so auto scaling will be taken care by the

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:12.350
system itself so inbound outbound traffic and networking

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:15.230
will be taken care by the system itself your ecr is going to

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:17.350
take care of your entire password so because you will end up

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:20.790
using a lot of like a passwords basically so entire password

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:23.950
management will be taken care by this app runner itself or

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:27.710
you can try to use even a wallet basically or secret like a

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:31.010
wallet basically and where you can try to store the password

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:34.870
so technically everything will go global so nothing will be

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:37.850
available and nothing that will depend even on my system

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:43.770
basically so this is something that we have built yeah so is

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:45.350
it similar to app service in azure yeah it is similar to app

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:48.010
service in azure because every platform provides you like

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.730
these things so

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.340
basically my entire app will be like a global and anyone can

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:58.100
come anyone can you know start chatting with this entire

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.700
application the file upload feature which i am giving as of

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.840
now on a user side right this file upload feature so see i

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.360
have not even uploaded the file by the way but still i am

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.180
able to chat with this one because i have already converted

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:13.800
my data and i have already stored my data into a vector db

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.780
so by default my documents are available and i will be able

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:20.300
to you know. Chat with my document without even uploading a

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.760
file now if i am going to like a click on list all the s3

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.780
document so yeah as you can see from s3 bucket by the way

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:31.440
aws s3 bucket basically simple storage services it is able

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.740
to list down all the documents right all the documents now

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.700
let us suppose if someone has already persisted a document

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:41.280
into an s3 right so again you do not have to load it from

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.060
the local simple and let us suppose that data is not

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:49.180
available into vector db. S3 so i have also given you a

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.780
shorthand button over here so where you can just try to

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:55.260
click and then whatever document is available into an s3 so

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:59.180
basically it is going to use this embedding model right the

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:02.220
embedding model which is running on my gpu so yesterday we

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.400
have hosted basically not an embedding model a chat

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.540
completion model right but today i am going to show you two

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:10.320
one two things so i am hosting like my embedding model as

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.580
well as i am hosting my chat completion model and

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:16.320
automatically it will be able to use this s3 document. It

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.720
will read the document. So whatever document which is

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.560
available in my s3 bucket it will process it so no need to

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:24.040
load it again and again from the local and again this will

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.820
be like this will go on a admin side by the way yeah so

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:30.300
technically this entire things will go on admin side from a

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:33.840
user side the user can just come chat you know raise a

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.460
ticket and they will be able to like do the investigation

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:39.240
they will be able to send the notification user means

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.740
technically a doctor and admin means a hospital management

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:46.060
by the way right admin means a hospital management and then

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:49.500
user is going to be. Basically a doctors or any like a

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.380
medical practitioners so they would like to like do some

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:55.660
sort of a investigation they can try to do it so this is how

00:22:55.660 --> 00:23:00.480
this entire reg bot is working by the way almost near to a

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:03.220
real time you can say this entire like application is

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:07.300
working i had done couple of cleanup couple of tuning even

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:10.020
with respect to the data set and it was it was giving me a

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:12.640
good response by the way yeah it was able to understand my

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.720
query and it was able to give the good response. Still there

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:19.320
is a lot of scope. I believe. Where we can try to tune this

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:23.420
one which we will do for sure but with respect to the agents

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.940
because with the help of agents i will be able to add more

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:31.240
power to it more control self control to this entire system

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:36.280
in itself and then i have listed down basically a couple of

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:41.960
like a use cases that you can try to build yeah. So here i

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.960
have prepared the entire document so healthcare clinical

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:47.560
protocol then legal then finance. Then manufacturing and i

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:50.360
have i have listed down everything so that we can try to

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:54.020
convert this entire application not just like a with respect

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:57.880
to the medical but with respect to other domain as well and

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:03.500
we can add like a more and more features into it and make it

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:10.830
a real time yeah shall we start yes shall we start talking

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:16.490
about it yeah so this is just this is just a demo which i

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:17.410
have given to you. So this is just a demo which i have given

00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:19.450
to you. It is good and it is working well nothing i am

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:22.690
storing into my local system at all so there is not even a

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:25.630
single thing as of now yes streaming application is running

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:28.590
in my local but whatever things which stream will be using

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:32.070
nothing is local like i have mentioned and inside my

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:36.830
document that data your vector data is stored inside the

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:40.250
chroma db your raw data is stored inside the s3 bucket by

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:43.730
the way right aws and you can try to store it inside azure

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:46.930
blobs or in any other places even inside the drive. That's

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:52.510
ok. right and yeah so you can any user can come and start

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:55.470
chatting with the bot directly over here it supports a

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:58.630
multilingual embeddings as well it supports raising a

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:02.450
tickets by the way chat completion model is global and

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:06.730
multilingual embedding model is a global one right. So

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:10.890
basically now you can try to it is not just a medical bot so

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:14.170
now you can try to use it in every domain even for a support

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:17.510
and services right which is an integrated part support and

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:19.830
service which is an integrated part of any company for

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:24.230
example if someone is going to search about Euron right and

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:27.110
let's suppose if I have already given all the data all the

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:29.550
data means so whatever batches that we are launching

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:33.210
whatever batches that we have launched over here or whatever

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:36.490
upcoming things so if I am going to give all the data if I

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:38.790
am going to feed all of this data to this particular system

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:42.010
into a vector storage if I am going to convert it. So any

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:44.990
user can come any user can chat it right so let's suppose

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:47.570
entire website data is available to this one and obviously

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:51.050
my website data is available right so website data whatever

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:53.690
you are able to see on a Euron so obviously it is coming

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:56.590
from a database right so let's suppose we are using a

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:59.610
MongoDB and Postgres in a backend so obviously it is coming

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:02.410
from a MongoDB and Postgres so I can try to fetch those data

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:05.590
convert that into a vector space and then anyone can come

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:08.810
and anyone can chat with all of these document even I can

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:11.690
try to provide a user data right. So maybe I can try to

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:15.290
attach authentication on top of it yeah I can try to attach

00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:18.410
authentication so after doing a sign up just with the chat

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:21.090
you will be able to get all your information so whatever

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:24.510
information is available on a platform means in our database

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:27.670
whatever information is available so obviously we are

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:30.170
storing the information with respect to just your learning

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:33.210
right learning means how much like how many videos you have

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:36.470
watched basically what was the Mao and Dao so daily active

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:39.150
user or monthly active user from which country you are

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:40.950
trying to log in. So basically this is the information right

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:44.090
so which will be persisted inside our database basically

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:47.590
information about you so you can come over here you can chat

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:51.750
with your information and whatever information is public so

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:54.490
you will be able to access all those information so in this

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:58.830
way maybe like a user is not supposed to even like ask a

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:01.170
question that okay fine so when this patch is going to start

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:03.890
or what will happen this that kind of a question so

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:07.890
similarly every industry right without support none of the

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:11.130
industry works basically let's suppose. There is a like a

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:13.930
Amazon order if you have to track you can just chat with the

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:16.350
bot it is going to give you all the detail just while

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:19.450
chatting and if you are looking for some recommendation some

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:22.370
suggestions with respect to the product it will be able to

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:25.170
give you a recommendation and some suggestions as well right

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:28.670
so eventually you will end up converting this entire system

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:33.190
for all the industry and in reality yes we are doing it

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:36.590
right in reality yes we are doing it plus we can try to add

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:40.950
the agents agents means more self-control. More self-control

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:44.110
to the bot that we will try to learn from next week onwards

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:47.290
that how we can try to attach an agent and after attaching

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:50.530
an agent so what is the kind of you know differences that

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:53.430
you will be able to see and what kind of a power you will be

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:59.670
able to give to a similar kind of a system basically yeah so

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:03.970
now one by one can we deploy a stimuli in a production in

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:06.510
general you should not do it in general you can convert this

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:09.950
entire things into no one is stopping you to. Like a deploy

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:13.210
into a production so if I am happy with this kind of a UI

00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:16.150
interface if I am not looking for something glamorous in

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:18.610
that case I can go and deploy if I am looking for something

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:21.210
glamorous if I am looking for some more features inside the

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:25.290
UI interface which for sure we will be right more control or

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:28.690
more like a user experience driven things in that case I can

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:31.850
try to convert the same application to a next js or react

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:35.810
simple right is streamlit is at the end of the day one

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:38.170
simple library for a front end so there is no question like

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:45.390
we can deploy it or not. Okay now so here let us start

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:48.810
talking about it right that how this things is been done and

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:52.990
one by one one by one so let us do it so here the very first

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:58.490
thing is that that let me stop this server and this one yeah

00:28:58.490 --> 00:28:59.450
so

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:48.940
basically we have to run two server two separate server

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:52.220
basically so in one server so as you can see I have like a

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:55.740
running two machine over here. So in one machine again

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:58.920
procedure is same I think we already like we are aware about

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:01.840
it so we are running two machines over here so in one

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:06.120
machine so I am running basically my chat completion and in

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:09.940
other machines so technically I am trying to run a like a

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:14.400
embedding models right again code is very simple so in terms

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.260
of running either of these machines so I believe I have

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:19.920
already shared a document document is already available

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:24.600
inside your like a dashboard. So you can run it. You can try

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:28.420
to go ahead with that documentation and you have to add just

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:32.260
a little bit of things so till this point everything is

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:35.160
going to be same right even like a till this point

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:37.640
everything is going to be same there is not no changes at

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:40.920
all so means still creating the environment and keeping your

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:44.360
system ready everything is going to be exactly same. Now

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:48.660
once you your system is ready then obviously to host this

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:51.620
chat completion model so generally you try to call this one

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:55.500
this is what you have done yesterday right. Now in terms of

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:58.980
chat completion so whenever you have to you know host this

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:02.200
particular whenever you have to use this particular model so

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:07.580
you are supposed to call basically this much only this much

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:11.860
yeah only this much so pip install vllm so just install a

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:16.200
vllm and then this is the model which I am trying to use so

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:19.360
basically this is a multilingual one of the best model it is

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.600
going to give you a dimension of vector dimension of 1 0 2 4

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:27.840
right. You can say plus it is a multilingual one and again

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:31.860
so just like execute this vllm so automatically it will be

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:35.240
able to host this embedding model and it will start running

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.480
it and then with the help of your IP address you all will be

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:42.980
able to access it. So just use this one guys and spin your

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:44.980
machine and let me know yeah

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:53.100
so pip install before that right. Shall I show you command

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:56.640
from the beginning by spinning a new machine because

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:03.940
today it will just take like okay so yeah these are the

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:06.660
people who have not done the installation study I know those

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:09.820
who are saying yes yes yes okay

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:17.200
not an issue I will do it so that will take like a couple of

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:21.600
minute for me I will do it I know there are some people who

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:24.400
just come here to watch as a movie okay

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:32.910
let's do it where is my machine I have too many system open

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:34.450
okay okay

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.200
fine. So let's do it. So let me deploy a new virtual machine

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.680
I will be using the same key the key which I have used

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:54.060
yesterday so I am going to use this H180G PCI oh sorry I

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:59.060
have clicked on deploy I have to do other settings no I

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:03.000
don't want to deploy okay so deploy a virtual machine H100

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.840
and then after that so basically I can try to choose this

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:10.100
environment I can try to choose this OS image everything is

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:13.920
same so SSH access enable public IP address enable right

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:17.060
config on a additional setting I am not using a Jupyter

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:20.160
notebook so it is not required inbound rule so you just have

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:23.520
to add your IP like a port range you can try to add 1 to

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:27.100
9000 that will be like a safer side to do any kind of

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:30.560
experimentation so inbound is done inbound traffic and then

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.340
for outbound traffic you just have to do the exact same

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:36.640
thing right so inbound and outbound is done now once this is

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:40.200
done just click on deploy it will take like a couple of

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.720
second and then it will be able to deploy and then with the

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.720
help of my putty I will be able to access this particular

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:50.540
machine so hardly it will take like a 30

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:51.820
second maybe 45 second

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:03.820
can we use same machine for both the model deployment no one

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:06.380
is already using 90 percent so there will be a conflict in a

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:10.020
resources you have to reduce the like a consumptions and

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:14.380
then you will be able to use like another one but that is

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:19.460
not advisable basically and yeah you have to change the port

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:22.920
number by the way because in single machine so two

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:27.380
application can't use the same port number. So just to like

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:31.760
a do it in a safer way go ahead with separate machine two

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.260
machines okay

00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:49.450
so one is active by the way fine

00:34:55.880 --> 00:35:02.280
so I am able to obtain this joyful Darbin public VM and let

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:08.020
me delete the previous one which I am not going to like use

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:18.430
delete machine and delete machine yeah. Okay. So here just

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:23.670
copy it right and again go to your putty let me close my

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:24.970
previous session

00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:32.990
okay so go to putty paste this IP address and then give the

00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:37.250
credentials so basically a private key so I am using the

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:39.550
same key I am not I have not created the new key basically

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:42.570
so I am using the same key like which I have used yesterday

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:47.990
so I am going to hit the machine accept and then u b u n.

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:53.770
Right. Ubuntu is a ID and now I am able to access my machine

00:35:53.770 --> 00:36:00.050
by the way so change setting appearance change 20 okay apply

00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:06.730
fine now so if you are going to do Nvidia hyphen SMI you

00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:09.890
will be able to see the configuration simple so your h100

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:13.650
you will be able to see it over here so this is one of the

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:16.430
machine a joyful Darwin so I am going to use it for a chat

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:19.210
completion let's suppose. Right. Now I am going to spin one

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:21.630
another machine so which I will be using for a embedding

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:28.330
model so here h100 and then oh sorry once again I clicked on

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:30.870
deploy virtual machine

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:36.900
h100

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:38.360
yeah

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:49.990
and here same credential OS image Ubuntu fine SSH enable IP

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:56.170
public enable. Okay. And I have to set the inbound so

00:36:56.170 --> 00:37:03.910
inbound traffic add and outbound traffic add okay now

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:06.950
everything is same deploy yeah

00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:15.970
so genius Franklin I will

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:22.130
be using for a embedding let me delete the another one fine

00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:25.090
so joyful Darwin is a machine that I have so I will be using

00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:28.990
this machine for my basically LLMS chat completion. And then

00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:32.350
genius Franklin so this machine I will be using it for the

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:35.850
embedding so just wait for a couple of like a second and

00:37:35.850 --> 00:37:38.730
this machine will be up and then quickly I will try to show

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:41.310
you the setup technically it will take like a three to four

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:45.330
minute time not more than that yeah yeah

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.480
you can use the same command in red rules so basically it's

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.760
like a doesn't matter right at the end of the day it's a

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:58.440
Ubuntu that you are using so doesn't matter from where you

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.440
are going to access the machine. Same thing is going to

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:01.660
work.

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:26.360
$100 is free which one no this $100 no not at all it's it

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:29.460
they are not giving you even a single dollar as a free okay

00:38:55.760 --> 00:39:00.400
just wait once this machine will be up these

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:16.660
exercises will eat up a lot of money is it four or five

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:22.110
dollars is a lot of money yeah so the kind of a you know

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:25.090
expense that we used to do on a daily basis on a tea coffee

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:28.370
and pizza and burger is it not more than that. Yeah. And

00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:30.610
when you are trying to learn something in real and when you

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:33.690
are trying to use something real in a life and when it is

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:37.730
going to give you a 200% hike is it more than that that

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:40.550
that's a mindset basically that's a mindset like a problem I

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:44.010
see in almost everyone right so we never hesitate to spend

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:47.390
you know a lot of money on x y g things to give a gift to a

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:51.990
girlfriend maybe to like spend something like on a some

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:55.830
betting app by the way which government has banned recently.

00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:59.610
But. But when they have to learn right so they just hesitate

00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:02.770
to you know spend even a single dollar on something they

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:05.190
keep on looking for a free machine free services which is

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:08.750
not free eventually right which is not free and basically

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:11.110
this is going to give you the real life right this is going

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:14.030
to give you the hike a good job a good opportunity but

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:17.790
people will not spend over there and I think that's a real

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:20.330
problem that's a real mindset problem I see it's not a money

00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:26.520
problem it's a mindset problem by the way yeah because this

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:30.040
kind of things will give you a real hike 200% hike. And it

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:31.940
will give you a leverage where you will be able to spend

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:36.480
more on your girlfriend more on a real money game more on

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:41.480
your family friends and everything right so change your

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:45.680
mindset I think that that's like that's a very first thing

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:48.320
that we all should do if you are not changing it you will

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:51.300
not be able to learn believe me because just by using some

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:54.700
free services and some dummy resources right your learning

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:57.540
will be limited and sometime at some point of time in an

00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:59.860
interview you will get stuck. Your interviewer will get to

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:02.700
know that you have just run some like a sort of a dummy

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:07.460
things not a something in a real so be ready for that yeah.

00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:18.910
Just wait my machine okay my second genius Franklin is also

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:21.290
ready so now

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:26.580
we just try to open up putty browse

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:33.230
the credentials except

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.560
Ubuntu

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:41.100
okay

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:56.640
so my second machine is also ready so I have basically two

00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:00.160
machine as you can see. One is a joyful Darwin and one is a

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:04.820
genius Franklin right I am able to login so anyone guys who

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:07.480
is doing with me anyone yeah

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:15.310
okay so many people great do it guys do it I don't think

00:42:15.310 --> 00:42:17.670
that it's a big money that anyone is charging you including

00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:19.970
your own and including these platforms that's the reason so

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:22.490
I have not selected some platform like you know which will

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:25.470
charge you double triple for the same resources these are

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:28.150
the optimized one right which is going to charge you the

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:31.250
minimal but yeah you have to invest otherwise like if you

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:33.430
just want me to discuss. Something with the dummy resources

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:36.450
I can do that I don't have any kind of a issue but yeah you

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:39.330
will be like far far away from the reality which I believe

00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:42.170
everyone is doing in a market yeah everyone else is doing in

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:43.010
a market by the way.

00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:49.140
My previous key is not working so attach the new key simple

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:52.420
go to puttygen or maybe from there itself from the

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:55.860
hyperstack cloud itself create a new key and then attach it

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:59.060
convert that into a private one. I have already shown you

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:03.280
the way both the ways right again now so once this system is

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.680
ready so quickly. Let's run the document which I have

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:08.420
already shared with all of you yesterday right this document

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:12.040
so run all of this command one by one the very first command

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:15.300
is this one so let's suppose joyful darwin so I'm running

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:18.900
this command here and as well as I will try to run this

00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:22.180
command in my genius Franklin both the both the places same

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:27.180
command yeah because I have to keep my machine or like a up

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:30.880
and running and updated basically so document is already

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:32.900
available guys with all of you I believe.

00:43:57.130 --> 00:44:02.450
Now sudo update. So second command in both the machine

00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:03.490
quickly

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:12.300
guys do it everyone now sudo app install python so this is

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:14.180
going to install python in both the machine.

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:34.130
Okay so this is done now create a virtual environment in

00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:35.690
both the machine done

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:42.260
and

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:49.230
then activate the virtual environment so machine number one

00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:56.030
joyful darwin and machine number two franklin. Okay. Yeah so

00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:59.730
in both the places my machine is ready as you can see right

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:05.840
let me clean the screen yeah so my machine is ready and now

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:09.860
I'm good to like go ahead with the vllm right so vllm

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:13.140
configuration so in one machine you can try to follow the

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:16.140
same stuff like I have already shared with all of you yeah

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:20.040
so this upgrade is required so let's do the upgradation of

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:23.760
pip setup tool and wheel it is a small upgrade in both the

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:29.680
machine. Okay. Okay. So done in both now

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:39.540
so in one machine we have to install a GPT OSS so basically

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:43.800
just call this one and in one machine so for example in

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:46.900
joyful darwin so I am going to install this it will take

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:51.080
some time and in second machine right the genius franklin

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:54.400
that I have so in the second machine what I will do so I

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:59.380
will try to run this command pip install vllm so everyone in

00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:02.100
second machine not in first so in one machine I am already

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:05.800
running like a vllm so in second machine just try to do pip

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:11.370
install vllm the command which I have pasted then

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:45.320
everyone in

00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:00.200
second machine basically in first machine so you should like

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:06.560
a run this one in the first one in second machine vllm so

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:09.240
let me check this is my still download is going on

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:49.820
putty is rejecting the private key generated I have told you

00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:53.660
yesterday itself so the private key that hyperstack tried to

00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:55.760
generate so basically it will be available into our txt

00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:57.940
file. So with the help of partition you have to convert that

00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:00.560
into a PPK file I have already shown you that part as well

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:01.580
after

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:08.350
partition so if you have attached the same key it will not

00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:10.650
reject so maybe you have done some sort of a mistake with

00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:13.990
respect to a reason so by default you have selected some

00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:17.170
different reason while creating the key because it selects

00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:20.010
the first reason by default and Canada will come into a

00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:23.150
middle one so that is another mistake that you might have

00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:28.090
done because it's a very easy thing like it never gives a

00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:31.030
problem it's a hundred percent. Like a. Sure sort of things

00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:38.900
that works all the time okay so here now in one machine what

00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:42.800
I can do I can try to run this GPT OSS 20B right same model

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:48.280
that we have executed yesterday and leave it so in my joyful

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:52.740
Darwin I am learning this one it will be up in some time and

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:56.580
then in other machine right the genius Franklin which I can

00:49:56.580 --> 00:50:01.800
see so over here I will be like a running this one. So this

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:05.880
is a multi lingual VLM serve BAI BGE M3 so basically this is

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:11.140
a multi lingual LLM mod sorry embedding model with embedding

00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:16.640
size of 1024 and which is also like if I am using a VLM so

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:21.740
obviously it will be a open AI compatible so in one machine

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:25.940
I am running this VLM in other one I have already pinged you

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:30.320
the code guys so people saw VLM and then just execute this

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:33.760
one. one, just like install this particular like a model.

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:46.060
So now our entire system will be like a independent of any

00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:49.600
external model, even independent of URI APIs or any third

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:53.280
party things. Now you have everything on your own by the

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:58.830
way. So no security concerns should come with respect to our

00:50:58.830 --> 00:51:02.890
models, which is one of the biggest like a concern everyone

00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:05.590
will be having every client or every like, you know,

00:51:05.610 --> 00:51:06.630
managers will be having.

00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:24.720
Why we use two machines for one application? We have two

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:27.120
models, right? One embedding and one chat completion,

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:50.420
bgm3 is a model name, yes.

00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:08.710
Okay so looks like both of this system is ready, no, one is

00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:11.430
still preparing my system, so download is going on.

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:32.840
Command is not different, command is exactly same, so I have

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:35.380
not changed any kind of a command. Same command I was using

00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:38.220
yesterday, same command I am using today. So it's exactly

00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:41.160
same, vlm serve command is not changed. The only thing is I

00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:42.740
have changed the model, so I have done some sort of a

00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:45.940
research, found out that which is a multilingual model as

00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:48.980
per my use cases and then I have used it. Simple.

00:52:54.350 --> 00:53:00.270
Okay, so both of this machine is ready by the way. Now one

00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:06.110
more thing, so I would like to share with all of you. So

00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:09.450
basically just download this code base, yeah,

00:53:13.770 --> 00:53:16.670
so which is available on this location, the updated code

00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:19.710
base. It's the same one Medichat Pro, but yeah. So I

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:21.310
updated. I have updated so many things inside this code

00:53:21.310 --> 00:53:22.570
base. Download it.

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:47.300
Finally everyone, are you able to download, everyone?

00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:54.580
Yes just download it and unzip it, keep it inside your

00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:54.880
system.

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:53.600
So once you are able to do this, now just open up a code

00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:56.340
base guys, the code base which I have shared with all of

00:54:56.340 --> 00:55:00.640
you, so that we can try to like see that where we can try to

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:05.900
attach these things. So here, let's suppose the code base

00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:08.040
which I have shared with you, so I am just going to open up

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:11.740
the same code base. So this was the code base which I have

00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:15.400
shared. Now you will be able to find out these many like

00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:20.460
directory inside this one, yeah and let me remove this zip

00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:26.220
file from here, fine. So you will be able to find out these

00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:29.520
many directory over here and forget about all of this docker

00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:32.560
file as of now, like we are not doing contrivation as of

00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:34.760
now. I have done that in my local, but yeah, you are not

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:38.720
supposed to do it, you will be able to find out all the

00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:42.320
files over here. So some of the files, not some of the files

00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:45.320
like 3 to 4 files are coming from the previous class itself,

00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:49.000
right. So for example, we have written a chat utils file, we

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.800
have written a pdf utils file. So we have written vector

00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:55.680
store files. So most of the files are coming from the

00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:58.900
previous one. Some of these files basically I have attached

00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:02.520
once again, just to keep my entire code modular. So I have

00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:06.040
created a different file for a different feature. Now here

00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:09.680
you will be able to find out a configuration.py file. By the

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:13.640
way, now, so I am able to hold this embedding model, right.

00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:16.220
I'm able to hold this embedding model. So let's suppose if I

00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:18.940
have to test this embedding model, so how I will be able to

00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:22.360
test it. Let me do a testing for my embedding model first

00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:26.340
and then let's go ahead with these files. So here what I can

00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:29.840
do, I can try to create maybe one of the file called as test

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:34.520
.ipynv. Yesterday we have already done the testing for the

00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:37.220
chat completion model. So let's do a, like a testing for the

00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:39.800
embedding model. And let's see whether everything is like a

00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:42.900
working or not. Yeah, everything is working or not. So just

00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:47.520
create test.ipynv and let's run the test for my embedding

00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:50.580
model. So it's not going to be different by the way, it's,

00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:54.580
it's actually going to be like a same. So we have to like

00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:57.700
give what, so API key is dummy. There is no API key

00:56:57.700 --> 00:57:00.120
production, which I have given. And then here you have to

00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:03.740
replace it with your base URL, base URL of your machine. So

00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:08.220
URL of this genius, frankly, machine. So where my embedding

00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:11.360
is up and running. So what I will do, I'll just go over

00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:15.240
there, right? Genius Franklin. Sorry. So we have genius

00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:19.200
Franklin. Yeah. So here in this machine, I'm running my

00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:22.000
embedding model. So I'll just copy this IP address. This is

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.740
the only thing which is required for me, right? So I'll just

00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:30.200
copy this IP address and then I will try to paste

00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:37.040
it here. Yeah. So just change the IP address. Nothing else

00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:37.700
is required.

00:57:42.810 --> 00:57:47.070
Yeah. So this is my IP address and then I'm trying to call

00:57:47.070 --> 00:57:50.110
my embedding model. As you can see BGEM3, this is the model

00:57:50.110 --> 00:57:53.670
and explain the vector search in two lines. Okay. Cool. So

00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:58.310
just hit this model dimension is equal to 1024. Now if

00:57:58.310 --> 00:58:01.650
you'll go and check, so yeah, it is able to get a hit and a

00:58:01.650 --> 00:58:05.170
response is basically 200, right? Now if I have to see the

00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:08.190
response, if I have to see the vectors, you will be able to

00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:10.950
call the response. Just call the response. The response gave

00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:15.010
a model. And here is the vector, right? Here is a embedding

00:58:15.010 --> 00:58:17.490
vector, which I'm able to see. And what is the length?

00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:22.590
Length of this vector 1024. So I'm able to test my model as

00:58:22.590 --> 00:58:25.930
well. So here, if you have to test it, procedure is same.

00:58:26.070 --> 00:58:28.130
Even yesterday we were able to test our chat completion

00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:32.170
model, right? Now I'm testing my embedding model. So just

00:58:32.170 --> 00:58:34.950
instead of chat completion, you have to call like OpenAI

00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:39.990
embedding, sorry, chat embedding APIs and then just give a

00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:43.710
URL. So wherever your model is running and you will be able

00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:46.890
to use it. So the way I'm able to use it. So are you able to

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:51.490
test it guys now? And you don't have to worry about even a

00:58:51.490 --> 00:58:54.670
token limit because now you have an infinite token limit,

00:58:54.890 --> 00:58:59.330
right? A trillions, not trillions, billion trillions of like

00:58:59.330 --> 00:59:02.230
as long as your machine will be up and running. So your

00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:05.350
token is not going to exhaust by the way. So it doesn't

00:59:05.350 --> 00:59:08.470
matter like how many documents you are going to process.

00:59:09.250 --> 00:59:12.870
It's just up to you. Right? Process as much as possible

00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:16.210
because see embedding is a one time job. So whenever I need

00:59:16.210 --> 00:59:20.230
a embedding, I will spin the machine, do the embedding,

00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:24.630
store it into a Google chroma DB or somewhere else and then

00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:27.330
close the machine. So technically I just need only one

00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:30.490
instances for a chat completion, which should be up and

00:59:30.490 --> 00:59:33.190
running all the time. I don't need an embedding machine,

00:59:33.350 --> 00:59:36.410
which should be up and running all the time. Yeah. So this

00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:38.950
machine technically should not run all the time. So

00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:41.490
whenever. And again, so maybe I can try to write a cell

00:59:41.490 --> 00:59:44.570
script so it will spawn the machine once again. So maybe in

00:59:44.570 --> 00:59:47.170
between, so I'll try to keep my machine inactive or maybe

00:59:47.170 --> 00:59:51.210
I'll hibernate the machines. So are you able to test it

00:59:51.210 --> 00:59:55.210
guys? Your own, not my URL is fine. You will be able to hit

00:59:55.210 --> 00:59:58.910
my URL. I can, yeah, I can see the hits over here. People

00:59:58.910 --> 01:00:04.330
are hitting it. But are you able to test it? Not mine. Yeah,

01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:07.010
you can, you can use my, because it's not costing me

01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:11.370
anything by the way, it just costing me like $1.52 per hour.

01:00:11.550 --> 01:00:14.610
Apart from that, doesn't matter how many of you are using

01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:18.110
this machine. I'm happy because I just have to pay how much?

01:00:18.170 --> 01:00:22.050
$1.52 itself. It doesn't matter like a hundred people are

01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:25.330
using it or you are processing the whole bunch of library

01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:27.990
with this one. It's okay with me.

01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:34.490
Any dependency, same version 0.28 OpenAI version.

01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:41.350
Okay. So we are able to test our embedding models and I

01:00:41.350 --> 01:00:44.070
believe we were able to test our chat completion model. Yes,

01:00:44.070 --> 01:00:47.050
everyone, those who are not able to test it. So I have

01:00:47.050 --> 01:00:49.870
already attached that into your documentation. So it's

01:00:49.870 --> 01:00:53.190
already available again, code wise. It's nothing, same thing

01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:55.870
like a, instead of embedding. So we are calling a chat

01:00:55.870 --> 01:00:59.670
completion. So let's do the testing once again. So here chat

01:00:59.670 --> 01:01:02.090
completion, right? A chat completion.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:09.560
So here we have to basically replace with our IP address. So

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:12.800
IP address of the machine where my chat completion is up and

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.780
running. So it is running inside a join.

01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:22.440
So I will just copy this IP address, I'll replace it over

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:25.220
here and then I'll try to hit it.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:37.600
Yeah. And I'm able to see the content, right? I'm going to

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.560
see the content. So both of my machines are up and running.

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:43.880
Even you can test it if you want with your own query. So

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:46.980
both the machines are up and running. Now technically I need

01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:50.280
this IP address, this, this URL, basically this, this URL

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:54.420
will be my area of interest and just download the code. And

01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:58.860
then inside this app directory, go to config.py file. Yeah.

01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:01.720
Go to config.py file. And I have done so many configuration

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:05.980
because we have to attach so many XYG system and here just

01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:10.000
change this one. So you have to change like this one and you

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.720
have to change basically this one. So one for our embedding,

01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:17.180
as you can see, I'm using and one for the chat completion

01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:20.520
I'm trying to use. So just replace this URL. So let's go

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:26.140
ahead and let's replace this chat completion URL. Right? So

01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:29.080
this is my chat completion URL with this one. Only IP

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:32.720
address will change, nothing much, right? And then for our

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:37.740
embedding, let's change this URL because yesterday I was

01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:40.540
using a different machine. So today I have like stopped it

01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:44.400
and used it once again, right in front of you. So this in

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:49.540
this way, your open AI key for your, so key for this

01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:52.780
embedding and key for your chat completion will be fixed. As

01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:56.540
you can see over here, right? As we can see and LLM model

01:02:56.540 --> 01:03:00.740
wise, so we are using basically OSS 20 B for our like a chat

01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:03.200
completion and we are using chat completion or streaming and

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:08.360
for embedding we are using BGEM3. Okay. Now URI API key is

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:12.300
not required. I have just removed all the URI API key by the

01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:16.680
way, right? URI API key. Now we have to go ahead with the

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:19.900
email configuration. Yeah. We have to go ahead with the

01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:25.000
email configuration over here. So let's go ahead and

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:30.550
I think somewhere, yeah.

01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:46.280
So if you will look into your, this one, basically instead

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:48.760
of config, right, it will be better. I have removed it in a

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:51.140
later stage. So again, you will have to remove it in a later

01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:56.020
stage. Just go to the, just go to .environment file guys and

01:03:56.020 --> 01:04:00.760
change it, change everything there. So .environment. Oh, I

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:03.360
have, I have like, yeah, I was using initially like this

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:06.300
one, config.py. Okay. But yeah, when I was trying to check

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:08.800
in into, checking a code into a GitHub, it will not allow.

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.900
So I have changed it to the, so

01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:15.760
go to .env, 70,

01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:19.310
I have changed.

01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:29.140
So not to .config, go to like .env, fine. And one by one I

01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:32.960
start changing it. Sorry, my bad, yeah.

01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:40.320
So I have changed basically for my chat completion and I

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:42.720
have changed basically for my embedding. So this is done.

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:48.720
LLM model. This one, embedding model, BGEM3. Now so this

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:52.240
setup is done with respect to the models. Now my models are

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:57.380
global. Now I have to do a preparation to send a mail by the

01:04:57.380 --> 01:05:00.780
way, yeah, to send a basically mail by the way. So how we

01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:04.720
will be able to do that configuration? So basically, so I

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:07.720
can, I can do that configuration again by using a couple of

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:11.960
a step. Let me teach you that. So just go to Google and

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:19.240
Google mail app. So mail app for windows, you can try to, or

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:24.760
like a Gmail mail app, basically you can try to open up, not

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:29.840
this one. Let me give you a direct URL so

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:32.520
that you will be able to configure your own mail.

01:06:31.350 --> 01:06:36.170
Yeah. So just do one thing. I'm giving you the link, just

01:06:36.170 --> 01:06:38.710
follow along with that link so that you will be able to

01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:42.030
access your mail programmatically. So that's our intention.

01:06:42.030 --> 01:06:44.870
So we have to access our mail programmatically.

01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:30.990
Okay. So there is something called as guys, Gmail app

01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:35.070
basically. So just to go to Google, anyone, right? So

01:07:35.070 --> 01:07:37.690
everyone must be having a Gmail account. So just go to

01:07:37.690 --> 01:07:41.370
Google and just try to search Gmail app password. Yeah. Just

01:07:41.370 --> 01:07:44.650
try to search for that Gmail app password and then what it

01:07:44.650 --> 01:07:48.130
will do. So it will try to pop up a new page and here it is

01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:51.430
going to give you the whole instruction. Now to create this

01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:55.270
app password. You have to enable a two step or two factor

01:07:55.270 --> 01:07:58.170
verification or two step authentication. You have to enable

01:07:58.170 --> 01:08:01.990
means so password plus you can try to enable it through your

01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:05.390
numbers, phone numbers basically. So where you can try to

01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:07.890
add a phone numbers and we'll send you the SMS. So basically

01:08:07.890 --> 01:08:10.670
two step verification is required. Then only it is going to

01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:13.830
allow you to create the app password. Now what is this app

01:08:13.830 --> 01:08:16.610
password? What it is going to do by the way. So with the

01:08:16.610 --> 01:08:20.490
help of this app password, you will be able to access your

01:08:20.490 --> 01:08:24.010
mail, right? Your mail programmatically and you will be able

01:08:24.010 --> 01:08:27.630
to do like any kind of activities that you want. Yes. Any

01:08:27.630 --> 01:08:30.370
kind of activities that you want, you all will be able to do

01:08:30.370 --> 01:08:36.290
it and you will be able to basically so and you will be able

01:08:36.290 --> 01:08:38.870
to basically like a send a mail, you will be able to receive

01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:41.530
a mail or whatever activities, right? Whatever activities

01:08:41.530 --> 01:08:44.270
that you would like to do it, you would, you can do it. So

01:08:44.270 --> 01:08:48.050
here as you can see, so email sender, you have to set couple

01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:50.350
of things for this one. So you have to send a sender. That

01:08:50.350 --> 01:08:53.550
means for this account, I'm creating the app password,

01:08:53.730 --> 01:08:56.690
right? For this account, I'm creating the app password. This

01:08:56.690 --> 01:08:59.070
is my email password. This is something that you will be

01:08:59.070 --> 01:09:02.470
able to generate and basically I'm using a protocol called a

01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:04.830
simple mail transfer protocol, which is called as SMTP,

01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:07.690
which is a protocol that we used to study since our

01:09:07.690 --> 01:09:10.430
childhood, right? So to send a mail because this is the

01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:13.210
protocol which has been used to send a mail from one to

01:09:13.210 --> 01:09:16.390
another one, right? Simple mail transfer protocol and this

01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:18.790
is the port number which will be used by this one. So now

01:09:18.790 --> 01:09:21.850
these things are required. Now out of these things, you just

01:09:21.850 --> 01:09:24.570
need to generate this password because you must be having a

01:09:24.570 --> 01:09:27.310
Gmail account. So you must be having this one. This is not

01:09:27.310 --> 01:09:29.550
going to change. This is not going to change. It's going to

01:09:29.550 --> 01:09:31.930
be same, right? So we have to generate this particular

01:09:31.930 --> 01:09:34.810
password. How I can generate this password by the way? So

01:09:34.810 --> 01:09:38.150
there are like a simple way to generate the password. So for

01:09:38.150 --> 01:09:40.610
example, if you're going to this URL or just go to Google

01:09:40.610 --> 01:09:45.790
and search for Gmail app password. So here Gmail app

01:09:45.790 --> 01:09:49.350
password. Okay. And then here you will be able to see a

01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:52.290
link, right? So create and manage your app password. So

01:09:52.290 --> 01:09:55.770
click over here, click on manage your app password, give an

01:09:55.770 --> 01:09:58.850
app name. So any name I can give, maybe I can give a test X,

01:09:58.930 --> 01:10:01.670
Y, G, whatever I want, right? Doesn't matter at all. And

01:10:01.670 --> 01:10:05.810
then click on create. Now this is my new app password. So

01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:09.010
which I'm showing you as of now. Yeah, this is my new app

01:10:09.010 --> 01:10:12.790
password, which I'm showing you as of now, which is going, I

01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:15.330
have already disabled the previous one. So you can't use my

01:10:15.330 --> 01:10:19.510
previous password. Now this is the new password, right? This

01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:24.170
is the new password, uh, for my application basically new

01:10:24.170 --> 01:10:27.070
password. Now if I have to delete it as I have already

01:10:27.070 --> 01:10:31.070
exposed my password. So now you know my like a sender email

01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:34.150
ID and this one. So what I can do, I can just go ahead and I

01:10:34.150 --> 01:10:37.110
can try to delete it. Now you will not be able to use my app

01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:39.950
password. You will not be able to access my Gmail by the

01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:43.490
way. So I'll create it. I'll create it basically, uh, in the

01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:46.610
meantime. Right? So first of all, like, uh, so this is how

01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:49.350
you will be able to create your app password guys. A very

01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:53.110
simple step, a standard step, which we try to use. Now this

01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:56.050
is one of the way by which you will be able to send a email,

01:10:56.150 --> 01:11:00.230
right? Uh, there are other ways as well. So maybe I can try

01:11:00.230 --> 01:11:03.830
to like, uh, go into a Google cloud console and from there I

01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:06.730
will be able to access the key and I will be able to like

01:11:06.730 --> 01:11:09.870
open up my entire like application. So that is another way,

01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:13.970
but that way will be a little bit lengthy. So this is one of

01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:16.770
the. The easiest possible way. Now you can send as many

01:11:16.770 --> 01:11:20.850
mails as possible to anyone from this mail ID, right? For

01:11:20.850 --> 01:11:24.170
this mail ID. So I can configure it for any mail ID. So for

01:11:24.170 --> 01:11:27.510
every mail ID process is going to be exactly same. So are

01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:29.950
you able to get your app password guys, everyone email

01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:30.370
password?

01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:35.050
Yes, yeah, okay,

01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:53.960
fine. So this is something that is done. So email

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:56.900
configuration is done. So now I will be able to, you know,

01:11:56.920 --> 01:12:00.720
send our reports. I will be able to send a support ticket or

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:03.220
anything to anyone basically, right? Because sender is

01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:06.400
ready. Receiver can be anyone, right? Sender is ready. So

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:10.300
receiver can be any, anyone over here. Now once this one is

01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:12.960
done, right? So email configuration is done. Means my

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:16.220
communication is done. I was thinking of even teaching you a

01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:18.900
WhatsApp configuration. Then in later stage I have decided

01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:21.680
that, okay, fine. So let's just go ahead with the email. Uh,

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:24.860
we'll see WhatsApp. I have already configured WhatsApp in

01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:28.120
some of the other application in some other program. Uh. So

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:30.320
I was thinking about that, that, okay, let's go ahead and

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:32.760
talk about a WhatsApp configuration as well so that you can

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:36.840
send a message directly. Uh, but uh, maybe we'll discuss

01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:40.320
later, like in some other application we'll discuss about

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:47.160
it. Yeah. Now, uh, so once we are done with this one, then

01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:51.440
go ahead with our next one, right? Go ahead with the next

01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:54.620
one. What is the next one? So basically our next one is our

01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:59.160
vector database. Yeah. Vector database. Again, easy peasy

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:02.940
kind of approach. Uh, so here for a vector database, we can

01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:05.480
try to use basically what, so we can try to use maybe a

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:09.320
chroma DB. We can try to use a pine cone, anything, uh, that

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:12.040
we want, we can try to use it. So I'm going to use a chroma

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:17.820
DB. Yeah. I'm going to use a chroma DB, C-H-R-O-M-A, chroma

01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:23.040
DB, fine. So just log into a chroma DB and then over here,

01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:26.640
come, click on create database and then create a database.

01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:33.300
So create a database is over here. Once you are going to

01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:35.720
create the database quickly, it will be able to create the

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:39.840
database. Now go into the configuration, Chrome SDK. Yeah.

01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:45.100
And then click on create API key and copy code. So this is

01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:48.140
going to be your API key, right? This is going to be your

01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:50.640
API key and this is going to be your tenant. This is going

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:54.400
to be your database. So just copy your API key, right?

01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:58.360
Because I need this API key. Uh. From this one and then

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:03.620
replace it over here. Fine. Then I can try to replace my

01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:09.460
tenant. So I can copy this tenant from here, replace this

01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:14.580
tenant. Okay. Then try to replace with the database name. So

01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:17.120
what is my database name? Medibot prod, right? This is my

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:22.600
database name. So Medibot prod and then collection name. So

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:25.260
I have already given in a program. So by default, it will

01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:27.760
try to create the medical document. Collections inside this

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:31.080
database. So these things you have to change by the way to

01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:35.120
make it yours, right? To make it yours. So just change it.

01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:36.800
Everyone done.

01:14:42.290 --> 01:14:49.180
Yeah. Everyone done. Chroma DB configuration. So model

01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:52.440
configuration, email configuration and then vector database

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:55.640
configuration. Yeah. Just copy and paste. Chroma DB is one

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:58.580
of the easiest one to use. Just have to like click create.

01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:00.840
That's it. I think we have already done that, right? I have.

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:02.460
I already taught you that part as well.

01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:10.930
Please show the steps once again. Which one? Which step?

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:30.020
Yes. That will go same. That is not going to change.

01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:36.690
Okay. So pass this one.

01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:44.660
So basically app password, right? Just go to Google, search

01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:47.720
for Gmail app password, right? So click on Gmail app

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:50.900
password and then here you will be able to see the link. A

01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:53.620
very first one. Click over here. But before that you have to

01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:57.800
enable two factor authentication app name. Just give like a

01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:01.220
anything. So like S U D S something like that. Just give it

01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:05.120
and then click on create simple done. It will be able to

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:07.580
create it. And if I would leave it, I can just go over here.

01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:10.940
I can delete it. I can create as many app password as

01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:13.220
possible. So I can create even a hundreds of app password at

01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:20.320
a time. Done everyone. App password. So once this app

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:23.300
password is done again, Chroma DB, if I have to create maybe

01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:27.100
like some different databases, click, give a database name,

01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:30.340
any X, Y, Z. It will end up creating the database and then

01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:34.820
like click on this database, create API key. This is the API

01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:37.520
key. This is the tenant. This is the database name. As

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:42.200
simple as that. Okay. So database I have already created

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:45.440
Medibot prod, right? This database as of now, there is

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:48.740
nothing inside this database. I'm not keeping anything and

01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:54.120
app also created, right? So you have to make those changes

01:16:54.120 --> 01:17:00.340
inside this files. Change it. Now the last one. So we have

01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:03.240
to store our raw data, right? We have to store our raw data

01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:06.860
because I'm not storing any raw data in my local system. So

01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:09.460
there should not be anything which will be stored inside my

01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:13.260
local system at all. And obviously admin should be able to

01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:17.280
upload a document into S3 bucket and a system must be able

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:19.840
to read a document. Let's suppose if I have uploaded

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:22.820
hundreds of documents, my admin has uploaded hundreds or

01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:26.920
maybe a millions of documents. So obviously, uh, I, I can, I

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:29.360
can do that. I can access, if someone has given me like a

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:33.720
access of this entire document, uh, and if I can try to

01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:37.060
process it just with one click, it will be better. So

01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:41.140
keeping that in a mind, we are going to create a bucket

01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:46.080
inside a S3 AWS, which many people are using and then we can

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:49.780
try to access it for a reading and for a writing operation

01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:52.760
so that we can write more files and we can read our files.

01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:56.540
We can convert those data into a vector DB by the way. Yeah.

01:17:57.020 --> 01:18:01.380
Vector DB by the way. So here what I can do, I can try to

01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:06.120
like a go to AWS and then I can try to create a bucket. Now

01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:08.520
how to create a bucket? Let me show you the steps in a very

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:12.060
neat and clean way. It's again easy, not a big deal to, you

01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:15.240
know, understand this one. So first of all, like I told you

01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:19.180
in a group last day that you have to have a AWS account,

01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:23.620
right? So I believe you all have created AWS account and

01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:28.340
keep all of this account handy all the time, right? So let

01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:33.720
me log in into my AWS account because if you are doing an

01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:36.920
experimentation, obviously you need all of these accounts up

01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:37.380
and running.

01:18:56.580 --> 01:19:00.000
So let me put my auth, okay.

01:19:17.310 --> 01:19:21.790
So basically you have to log in into your AWS account, done

01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:25.510
guys, everyone. Now I'll show you how to create a bucket and

01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:27.170
how to give an access to the bucket.

01:19:31.670 --> 01:19:35.090
Yeah. Login is done. Anyone?

01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:42.470
So no one is having AWS account. Okay.

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:51.830
Log in then. So those who is having AWS account, so please

01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:52.350
try to log in.

01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:06.400
Okay. Now, so once you are able to log in, so basically you

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:09.080
will be able to find out multiple services and even in real

01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:12.560
time. So I will be using a lot of services from AWS. I can

01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:15.860
use this Streamlink cloud deployment. I can use a render

01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:20.140
deployment from a digital ocean, but those are not going to

01:20:20.140 --> 01:20:23.360
be the efficient one in a real time. At the end of the day,

01:20:23.380 --> 01:20:26.820
you have to use Azure, AWS or GCP, right? Okay. So just not

01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:29.080
be using Azure. even across our industry. So you must be

01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:33.640
familiar with all of these cloud platform. And again, so if

01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:36.880
you're following this entire lectures, all of this lecture

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:40.360
till end, obviously you will be able to learn a lot by

01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:43.700
default with respect to a cloud without even like focusing

01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:47.320
on the cloud, you will be able to learn it. If you are

01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:50.700
thinking that I will be using something free out there and

01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:54.760
then I will be able to deploy and say, wow, in reality it's

01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:56.940
not going to happen because they're not going to be give you

01:20:56.940 --> 01:21:00.680
all the features which is actually required for to build any

01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:03.860
kind of application on a scale. It is not available. They do

01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:08.380
not have that like facilities and again so AWS Azure GCP are

01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:12.580
giving you some free credit. You can try to use it but be

01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:17.040
ready to spend couple of more dollars like I said. So when

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:19.140
you are trying to learn which is going to give you maybe 200

01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:24.000
% hike. So if something is like giving you a 200% hike, you

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.280
must be ready to do an investment and maybe you can cut

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:29.900
short those expenses so which is not giving you a return

01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:30.500
immediately.

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:36.980
Many influencers keep on saying that right. So invest in

01:21:36.980 --> 01:21:43.120
yourself, invest in upskilling. This investment will like

01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:45.980
you know grow exponentially.

01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:54.630
Now please say it is going to be fixed. I have already said.

01:21:54.630 --> 01:21:56.350
I have already said that. So why you want like a

01:21:56.350 --> 01:21:59.170
reconfirmation four times from my side, okay.

01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:07.540
So now just search over here S3 right, S3 bucket, try to

01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:14.480
search, introducing resource search what happened, okay. So

01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:17.420
just like a search for S3 over here. So you will be able to

01:22:17.420 --> 01:22:20.380
see S3 bucket. It is a very easy step to create a S3 bucket.

01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:24.260
So basically S3 is a storage. Its full form is SSS, simple

01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:27.660
storage services by the way, right and then you can come

01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:31.260
over here. And you can try to create a bucket, simple, it is

01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:34.080
very, very easy. So let's suppose I am here. By default you

01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:37.300
will be able to see this particular page and just click on

01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:40.500
create bucket and I am going to create basically a general

01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:43.020
purpose bucket. I can try to give a bucket name which should

01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:46.460
be unique and before that select your region. So let's

01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:48.380
suppose I am selecting Mumbai region which is like very

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:52.420
close to me, AP South one region, Mumbai, Asia Pacific,

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:57.080
that's a full form AP. So here I can try to give my bucket

01:22:57.080 --> 01:23:00.020
name. Means a place where I am going to store the file. So

01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:10.020
here I can say that my bucket hyphen medi chat hyphen Euron

01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:14.900
hyphen 2025. So this is the bucket name which I can try to

01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:20.100
give. Now leave everything as it is. Leave everything as it

01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:22.780
is. So you are not supposed to do any kind of changes in

01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:26.620
anything. Just give a bucket name as of now. And then click

01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:29.080
on create bucket. That's it. This is the only thing that you

01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:31.520
have to do guys. Nothing means literally nothing.

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:37.540
So as you can see, it has created my bucket, right? It has

01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:39.760
created my bucket. So this is my previous one which I have

01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:41.620
already created like yesterday when I was like running the

01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:44.960
code. This is the bucket which I have already created. Now

01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:48.720
here I can try to upload a files. I can like download a

01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:52.980
files from here. But I have to do it programmatically. So I

01:23:52.980 --> 01:23:55.840
have already logged in through my like a admin console,

01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:59.760
right and because of that, I can upload a file directly. Any

01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:03.520
number of file if I want, I can try to upload any number of

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:06.740
file and I can download a number of file directly from here

01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:09.240
itself. The way you do it in your local system or maybe a

01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:13.220
Google drive. But I would like to access this entire bucket,

01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:15.720
right? I would like to access this entire bucket

01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:18.600
programmatically. Now to access this bucket programmatically

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:23.260
or to access any resources, right? Any resources on AWS

01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:28.340
programmatically, you have to have a authorization unless

01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:31.100
and until you don't have authorization, you will not be able

01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:34.360
to access any of these resources, maybe a bucket, maybe a

01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:37.720
compute, maybe something different. So how you will be able

01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:40.660
to create the authorization so that programmatically I will

01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:43.180
be able to access this particular bucket? Let me show you

01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:47.040
that part. So here again go to search part. So are we able

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:50.000
to create the bucket? Creation of bucket is a very simple

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.140
step. Just go give a bucket name, create, done. That's the

01:24:54.140 --> 01:24:56.780
only thing that you have to do and from this console, you

01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:58.800
will be able to even upload, download. You can do

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:01.940
everything. But the problem is that, that you will not be

01:25:01.940 --> 01:25:04.280
able to do it programmatically, unless and until you don't

01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:07.660
have a access basically. So how I will be able to create the

01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:10.820
access? So inside AWS, you will be able to find out a

01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:14.740
service called identity management, IAM basically, right? So

01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:18.700
IAM, so just try to search for IAM, yeah? Search for IAM,

01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:26.000
simple, right? Search for IAM, now, so once you are going to

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.540
search for IAM, you will land into IAM, IAM dashboard right

01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:32.240
identity access management dashboard you will be landing

01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:34.840
identity and access management dashboard you will be landing

01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:38.500
into. Now once you are here inside this identity access

01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:41.120
management you will be able to find out something called as

01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:43.880
users on your left hand side yeah on the left hand side you

01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:46.100
will be able to find out something called as users. So

01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:48.720
basically you have to create the user a user who will be

01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:51.440
able to access you can create 1, 2, 10 whatever number of

01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:54.040
users that you want. So let's suppose in your company there

01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:56.080
are like so many different different user and you would like

01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:58.140
to give a different different permission to a different user

01:25:58.140 --> 01:26:00.860
you can do that. So all these controls are already available

01:26:00.860 --> 01:26:05.380
as AWS is one of the like a global cloud platform majority

01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:08.260
of people is using it whether it's a big company or small

01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:12.100
company everyone uses that right. So here you can try to

01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:16.020
click on a users right you can try to click on users I

01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:18.260
already have a user but you will not be able to find out any

01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:21.040
user by default. So maybe I can go ahead and create the new

01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:24.340
user yeah. So create the new user over here. So user name I

01:26:24.340 --> 01:26:31.940
can give like a. This is my new user right and here so I can

01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:38.040
try to click on next yeah I can try to click on next and I

01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:42.200
can try to attach a permission because I have just created

01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:45.480
the user name right but what kind of a permission this

01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:49.500
particular user will be having yeah this particular user

01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:52.380
will be having so I can try to assign this user to a

01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:53.980
particular group means I would like to. So I can try to give

01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:58.280
a same access to a bunch of people it simply means that a

01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:01.120
group right so there is a provision where I can try to go

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:05.080
ahead so if I will go to IEM let me continue and I will be

01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:08.040
able to create a groups and I will be able to basically user

01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:10.760
group bunch of user basically that is mean meaning is bunch

01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:13.600
of user and I can add multiple user in a one single group

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:15.920
and on a group label I can give a permission that okay

01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:19.000
everyone in this group will be having this access everyone

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.800
in that group will be having that access something like this

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:26.720
right something like this. Now so otherwise for an

01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:30.360
individual user also I can like assign the rule without even

01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:32.080
going ahead with the group. So I will be using individual

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:35.560
user this concepts are very logical and very simple to

01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:38.900
understand by the way with respect to cloud platform and

01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:42.140
once you will be able to understand believe me you will feel

01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:46.060
like I know entire AWS so if you know like 10 to 20 services

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:49.380
right somewhere around 10 to 20 services believe me you will

01:27:49.380 --> 01:27:53.200
feel like I can use all this 270 services from AWS. Because

01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:56.600
this is how it is actually right it's just like using some

01:27:56.600 --> 01:28:00.560
global system system which is hosted somewhere else instead

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:03.580
of my local system. So this is how a kind of a feeling that

01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:05.980
you will be able to get many people say that I will go and

01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:08.440
learn AWS I mean like there is nothing called as learning in

01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:11.460
AWS it's just like a platform right so you have to practice

01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:13.940
more you will practice more you will get used to it and

01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:16.660
everything is very much pretty much logical and then go and

01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:19.820
give a certification exam get a certificate from AWS itself

01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:23.320
it's it's it's that easy. If you start learning then you

01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:29.220
will feel like a burden on you. So username Medipro maybe

01:28:29.220 --> 01:28:33.340
sudh you're on this is like username I have given Medipro so

01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:38.220
the you're on and then add a username copy permission attach

01:28:38.220 --> 01:28:40.620
policy directly so I'll be calling this attach policy

01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:45.280
directly right and then here there are multiple policies I

01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:48.920
think thousand something policies. Yeah 1389 policies are

01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:52.600
there. Policies are nothing but. Okay. There is a provision

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:55.540
like okay so this user will be having this access for

01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:58.500
example there is a administrator access if I'm going to

01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:02.000
click on this one so means this user will behave like an

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.960
admin this user can do anything this user can spin any

01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:08.840
services any machine they can try to choose or like this

01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:13.320
user can remove anyone add anyone everything can be done by

01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:16.080
this user admin access you can give a lot of different

01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:18.580
permissions right so let's suppose I would like to give an

01:29:18.580 --> 01:29:21.080
admin access to this user that okay fine so you can do

01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:26.160
everything in my account so now click on next right click on

01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:30.600
next and then admin access this user is already having right

01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:35.180
permission summary this is the username now create user so

01:29:36.710 --> 01:29:39.470
as you can see user has been created Medipro sudh you're on

01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:44.310
has been created right and this is the username which you

01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:47.650
need right this is the username that you need now once you

01:29:47.650 --> 01:29:53.070
have this username go to your code base. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:29:53.110 --> 01:29:56.930
You have to get access key and secret key so user I have

01:29:56.930 --> 01:30:01.170
created access I have given to this user right but how

01:30:01.170 --> 01:30:04.310
program will be able to access it right I need some key

01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:08.270
basically thus so once you will come to this user you will

01:30:08.270 --> 01:30:11.730
be able to see an option called as create access key this

01:30:11.730 --> 01:30:15.610
option create access key option right so and you can try to

01:30:15.610 --> 01:30:19.230
add even more permission to it if you want so create access

01:30:19.230 --> 01:30:22.390
key click on create access key and it is giving you a use

01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:24.830
case that for which use case you are trying to create the

01:30:24.830 --> 01:30:27.750
access key so basically application running outside AWS

01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:30.470
let's suppose I am creating access key for this one so I can

01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:34.290
select this one and then click on next yeah tag value you

01:30:34.290 --> 01:30:38.090
can just leave it just click on create access key so now

01:30:38.090 --> 01:30:41.910
this is the access key yeah this is the access key ID and

01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:45.550
this is the secret key which system has created so I can

01:30:45.550 --> 01:30:47.950
copy and this is something which is required this is the

01:30:47.950 --> 01:30:52.490
only thing which is required for me. Yeah. And I can try to

01:30:52.490 --> 01:30:56.410
paste it here so access key ID the new one and secret key

01:30:56.410 --> 01:31:00.070
what is secret key by the way so secret key is basically

01:31:00.070 --> 01:31:05.690
secret access key yeah secret key is basically secret access

01:31:05.690 --> 01:31:12.010
key so here this is the access key and this is the secret

01:31:12.010 --> 01:31:15.910
key now with the help of this access key and secret key and

01:31:15.910 --> 01:31:18.310
bucket name bucket name I have already replaced and then

01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:21.250
where is my reason. So in which reason I have created my

01:31:21.250 --> 01:31:25.430
bucket. So like Asia Pacific South region South one I have

01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:28.630
created this bucket so now with the help of this credentials

01:31:28.630 --> 01:31:33.050
I will be able to access my S3 bucket programmatically I

01:31:33.050 --> 01:31:36.150
will be able to perform my read and write operation because

01:31:36.150 --> 01:31:39.490
this access key right the access key which I have already

01:31:39.490 --> 01:31:43.250
created it gives me an admin control right it gives me admin

01:31:43.250 --> 01:31:45.670
control I can restrict to a just a read operation just a

01:31:45.670 --> 01:31:47.970
write operation I can attach more and more policies over

01:31:47.970 --> 01:31:51.630
there but that's okay. As of now. Let's keep it very simple.

01:31:51.630 --> 01:31:54.490
Let's try to attach the admin access to this one and with

01:31:54.490 --> 01:31:56.730
the help of admin access obviously I will be able to do

01:31:56.730 --> 01:32:01.550
everything. So now my S3 bucket is ready where I am going to

01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:05.150
store my raw file my vector database is ready where I will

01:32:05.150 --> 01:32:09.510
be storing a processed file my email credentials are ready

01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:12.490
so by which I will be able to send a notification to the

01:32:12.490 --> 01:32:16.690
user and my machines are up and running. So the major part

01:32:16.690 --> 01:32:19.950
which is a LMS and embeddings LMS for chat completion and

01:32:19.950 --> 01:32:23.590
for embedding. So even those things are running in a global

01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:27.930
machine and technically it's running in a GPU right. So once

01:32:27.930 --> 01:32:31.270
these credentials are ready then we are good to go ahead

01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:34.970
with the program. Are you able to do it guys all of this

01:32:34.970 --> 01:32:37.990
anyone anyone who is able to do all of these things

01:32:41.230 --> 01:32:41.750
yes

01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:53.980
yeah okay. So this is not just the only use of is like a AWS

01:32:53.980 --> 01:32:57.300
so for example if you are going over the deployment. Right.

01:32:58.380 --> 01:33:00.500
If I am going over the front end deployment let's suppose if

01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:03.820
I am using the amplify services so it was amplify so I can

01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:07.800
try to like again use these credentials I can try to like

01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:13.560
you know spin ECR registry basically or like elastic

01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:18.400
container registry basically. So again I will need these

01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:21.920
credentials programmatically if I am doing it if I am going

01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:25.800
to deploy my app on an app runner again I need this

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:27.940
credential the same credential can be used multiple times.

01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:31.660
This one bucket is one of the way bucket bucket is one of

01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:34.900
the resources right bucket is one of the resources but at

01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:37.820
the end of this entire lecture so we have to use multiple

01:33:37.820 --> 01:33:40.640
resources basically we have to even go to a deployment again

01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:43.980
same deployment can be done even on a render but like I said

01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:47.860
you should come closer to a reality right. Now if you would

01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:50.320
like to like come closer to a reality so obviously you have

01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:54.360
to use these standard platform because on this platform you

01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:58.080
will be able to map your own URL URL means you will be able

01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:00.920
to map your own domain basically as a let's suppose I am

01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:02.940
like creating the entire product and I have to host it on my

01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:05.680
own domain. It's very easy it's very easy over a these these

01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:08.940
like these platform they are giving you like even other

01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:11.100
platforms are giving you those provision if I have to like

01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:15.100
launch something on auto scale mode if I have to secure

01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:18.900
something on another label everything you will be able to

01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:24.840
get it on these platforms. Once again how to create the

01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:28.440
access key nothing. So see I'll tell you one thing. Once

01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:33.480
again so let's suppose my user is ready right so for example

01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:36.220
my user is ready let's suppose this is my user which I have

01:34:36.220 --> 01:34:39.960
created so click over here one access key is already active

01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:42.500
I can create multiple access key for the same user so just

01:34:42.500 --> 01:34:45.840
click on create access key select application running

01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:50.760
outside AWS and then click on next create access key done it

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:54.700
will like it will create it yeah so for single user you can

01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:58.040
try to like create a multiple access key. And you can even

01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:04.720
download it and keep it. So okay so access key is done for

01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:08.860
me I am able to create it as you can see now let's go ahead

01:35:08.860 --> 01:35:12.520
with the application yeah one by one one by one one by one.

01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:18.200
So see even my previous class I was able to use this open AI

01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:21.420
sorry I was able to use a embedding model I was able to use

01:35:21.420 --> 01:35:25.580
a chat model yeah I was able to use this chat model. So

01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:27.880
nothing is going to change. The only thing which I have

01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:32.520
changed over here is. The end point right so previously for

01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:36.560
a chat completion we were using URI and for embedding so we

01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:40.000
were doing a local embedding by using a hugging face what I

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.740
have done code wise right code wise what I have done nothing

01:35:43.740 --> 01:35:47.220
technically so code wise basically I have used almost a

01:35:47.220 --> 01:35:50.200
similar kind of a code and I have just changed the end point

01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:54.120
that instead of using a URI use this instead of using a

01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:57.860
hugging face local model use this one yeah that that's the

01:35:57.860 --> 01:36:00.120
only changes that you will be able to find out nothing much.

01:36:02.260 --> 01:36:06.060
So this is sorted that this is particularly sorted by the

01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:09.400
way you can delete this config.py file okay so for local

01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:13.040
testing no so even for local testing I am using a dot

01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:16.140
environment so you can delete this config file if you want

01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:22.700
remove this test okay this one. So now one by one let's go

01:36:22.700 --> 01:36:26.140
inside the file of file which is available inside my app

01:36:26.140 --> 01:36:28.340
folder because these are the major files. These are the

01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:31.200
major file and then I am calling all of this file inside the

01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:36.080
main.py file which is my final application. So here URI.py

01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:39.260
file I am not doing anything so I am like this is this is

01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:41.040
the piece of the code which I have already discussed in my

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:43.740
previous class. So this is having only one function a small

01:36:43.740 --> 01:36:47.600
one PDF uploader function so anyone can click on UI and they

01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:50.860
will be able to upload a PDF file right they will be able to

01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:54.620
upload. So let's close it yeah close it now come from here

01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:58.240
first file chat utils so let's start talking about this one

01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:03.380
so chat utils is nothing but same same code base the only

01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:06.040
changes which I have made over here is that that I am

01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:11.770
pointing to a this one right so previously I was pointing

01:37:11.770 --> 01:37:14.870
towards a URI API so that it will be able to do a chat

01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:17.830
completion but now I am pointing towards the model which is

01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:23.210
running in my GPU basically yeah GPU so get a chat model so

01:37:23.210 --> 01:37:25.790
I am loading all the variables right and all the like

01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:29.090
parameters and here as you can see. So I am trying to load

01:37:29.090 --> 01:37:33.070
open AI like this one base so which will like try to read

01:37:33.070 --> 01:37:37.150
out from here right and it is it is like a trying to read it

01:37:37.150 --> 01:37:40.230
from here then open AI key so again it will try to read it

01:37:40.230 --> 01:37:44.490
from here as simple as that then there is a temperature

01:37:44.490 --> 01:37:47.630
which I am trying to set and then this will try to configure

01:37:47.630 --> 01:37:52.950
my chat model and then ask chat model so whenever we have to

01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:55.890
ask so I am using the same open AI chat completion I am

01:37:55.890 --> 01:37:57.190
trying to pass a prompt.

01:37:59.850 --> 01:38:01.570
So I am trying to pass a prompt and then I will be able to

01:38:01.570 --> 01:38:04.890
get the response simple so same thing that we have done in

01:38:04.890 --> 01:38:09.590
test.py file this this piece of code yeah we have already

01:38:09.590 --> 01:38:12.510
tested this piece of code right so just try to pass your

01:38:12.510 --> 01:38:15.070
prompt so this is the parameterized one just try to pass

01:38:15.070 --> 01:38:17.490
your prompt and then it will be able to give you the output

01:38:17.490 --> 01:38:20.510
same piece of the code so I do not think that it will be

01:38:20.510 --> 01:38:24.170
difficult for any one of us to understand and rest is just a

01:38:24.170 --> 01:38:27.250
handling like error handling which I am doing over here

01:38:27.250 --> 01:38:31.330
right. Error handling which I am trying to do over here now

01:38:31.330 --> 01:38:35.050
so here I have mentioned couple of more functions so that I

01:38:35.050 --> 01:38:39.950
can make my response even better for any human being that

01:38:39.950 --> 01:38:43.070
for any human being I can make a response better so

01:38:43.070 --> 01:38:46.850
basically what I am trying to do so I am trying to access a

01:38:46.850 --> 01:38:49.850
data from the document vector database with respect to our

01:38:49.850 --> 01:38:53.350
patients but I am not just relying on those data so

01:38:53.350 --> 01:38:57.170
basically I am like trying to ask my LLMs that okay so what

01:38:57.170 --> 01:39:01.250
you can. Then what can be done what can be the cure or like

01:39:01.250 --> 01:39:04.230
what kind of a steps which I am supposed to take what is the

01:39:04.230 --> 01:39:07.310
symptom what is the recommendation all of these things so

01:39:07.310 --> 01:39:10.350
here I am just trying to create my like dictionary key value

01:39:10.350 --> 01:39:14.910
key value key value pair and then based on the like patterns

01:39:14.910 --> 01:39:19.970
it will it will try to like send this entire information to

01:39:19.970 --> 01:39:23.710
the LLMs and then LLM will try to generate the response

01:39:23.710 --> 01:39:27.970
eventually right. So that my medical. Medical responses will

01:39:27.970 --> 01:39:31.450
be enhanced medical response so these are the separate

01:39:31.450 --> 01:39:33.970
separate separate separate basically a independent function

01:39:33.970 --> 01:39:37.790
I have created but I am not using it so far yeah I will be

01:39:37.790 --> 01:39:40.690
using it inside main.py file so technically it is the same

01:39:40.690 --> 01:39:42.310
piece of the code like I said it is the same piece of the

01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:44.270
code that I have like I have already discussed in my

01:39:44.270 --> 01:39:47.930
previous lecture now so chat completion is done chat

01:39:47.930 --> 01:39:51.190
completion is one of the part config already we know now

01:39:51.190 --> 01:39:55.330
come to the email utility right email utility so we have to

01:39:55.330 --> 01:39:58.910
send a mail. Basically right we have to send a mail and we

01:39:58.910 --> 01:40:01.710
have to send a mail with respect to the analytics analytics

01:40:01.710 --> 01:40:04.330
means how many messages we have configured how many messages

01:40:04.330 --> 01:40:07.210
we have processed who was the last one so this is something

01:40:07.210 --> 01:40:09.910
called as analytics and maybe I have to raise a ticket

01:40:09.910 --> 01:40:15.670
basically so eventually I have to send a mail and even I am

01:40:15.670 --> 01:40:18.950
like trying to build this application in such a way that

01:40:18.950 --> 01:40:25.190
without like a entering this mail id into a mailbox. Just by

01:40:25.190 --> 01:40:29.430
using a chat you will be able to send a mail that okay send

01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:31.870
a mail to this user send a mail to that user so it will be

01:40:31.870 --> 01:40:34.670
able to send it but yeah it's sometime it's working sometime

01:40:34.670 --> 01:40:37.610
it's not working because of the LLM but with respect to

01:40:37.610 --> 01:40:40.010
agentic it will work for sure because that's a role of

01:40:40.010 --> 01:40:42.450
agentic but yeah as of now let's try to understand what we

01:40:42.450 --> 01:40:44.950
are doing so we are just trying to like we have written

01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:47.310
couple of functions some functions we are using some

01:40:47.310 --> 01:40:51.370
function we are not using so validate our email id so this

01:40:51.370 --> 01:40:53.070
is just a regex. We have written. We have written which will

01:40:53.070 --> 01:40:56.150
be able to eventually validate my mail id that's it right so

01:40:56.150 --> 01:40:59.650
any kind of a mail id it will be able to validate then this

01:40:59.650 --> 01:41:03.370
is just a mail template I am trying to create and where you

01:41:03.370 --> 01:41:07.010
will be able to see a lot of HTML CSS kind of a things

01:41:07.010 --> 01:41:11.370
because at the end of the day let me show you so see I am

01:41:11.370 --> 01:41:14.910
like a sending you this kind of a beautiful template right

01:41:14.910 --> 01:41:20.770
so this is technically I would say it's a HTML CSS right

01:41:20.770 --> 01:41:23.570
with the help of HTML CSS. So we are like trying to create

01:41:23.570 --> 01:41:26.370
this kind of a beautiful template so that I can send this

01:41:26.370 --> 01:41:30.070
template and inside that I will try to fill the data I will

01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:33.750
try to fill the data and then send it to you so majority of

01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:36.410
like a lines you will be able to find out with respect to

01:41:36.410 --> 01:41:38.690
that and again you can you can try to change it you can try

01:41:38.690 --> 01:41:41.450
to change it with respect to your own mail format or the

01:41:41.450 --> 01:41:45.250
template that you are going to send to any user so generate

01:41:45.250 --> 01:41:49.010
HTML email content generate text email content right so I am

01:41:49.010 --> 01:41:52.310
calling these functions generate HTML. And here so you will

01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:55.830
be able to find out all of this styling HTML CSS background

01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:59.310
colors right so this is just a HTML CSS you don't have to

01:41:59.310 --> 01:42:04.350
worry about anything just HTML which I am trying to maintain

01:42:04.350 --> 01:42:08.350
and this is mostly occupying the space right so throughout

01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:10.990
this entire page you will be able to find out the same thing

01:42:10.990 --> 01:42:16.130
and then what will go as a content in a like a mail

01:42:16.130 --> 01:42:19.310
basically right so what will go as a content inside the mail

01:42:19.310 --> 01:42:21.770
so I am just preparing the content so that I will be able to

01:42:21.770 --> 01:42:24.770
send if you would like to change the content you can just

01:42:24.770 --> 01:42:27.490
use a vibe coding say that okay fine change this change that

01:42:27.490 --> 01:42:30.450
it will be able to change it very simple I have just added

01:42:30.450 --> 01:42:35.350
it as per my like a own now send mail function is one of the

01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:37.710
smallest function you will be able to find out and this is

01:42:37.710 --> 01:42:40.390
the actual function right this is the actual function so

01:42:40.390 --> 01:42:43.170
which is going to call your email configuration so this

01:42:43.170 --> 01:42:45.830
entire email configuration this is the part of email

01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:49.470
configuration it is going to call. And then it is going to

01:42:49.470 --> 01:42:53.510
like. Create the context and then it is going to send a mail

01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:57.790
simple so this is the smallest function but this is the

01:42:57.790 --> 01:43:00.550
actual function which is sending a mail that's just like a

01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:03.270
two three line of a code two three piece of the code and it

01:43:03.270 --> 01:43:07.510
is sending the mail to one server to another server again so

01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:10.930
medical analytics support ticket creation all of these

01:43:10.930 --> 01:43:14.330
things are just a configuration and like HTML file as you

01:43:14.330 --> 01:43:17.390
can see a lengthy one I have created so that my things will

01:43:17.390 --> 01:43:19.770
look beautiful. But yeah. Like I said you can do a vibe

01:43:19.770 --> 01:43:21.870
coding and then you can try to change this entire template

01:43:21.870 --> 01:43:25.370
if you want if you don't like my template that's completely

01:43:25.370 --> 01:43:30.610
fine PDF utils again same PDF utils I have not actually made

01:43:30.610 --> 01:43:33.070
any kind of a changes so it's it's same I am not doing

01:43:33.070 --> 01:43:35.510
anything with respect to the PDF utils whatever I have used

01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:38.990
last time I am using the same thing even now. Now come to

01:43:38.990 --> 01:43:43.430
the S3 utils so S3 utils means store the data into a S3

01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:47.510
bucket right so first of all it is going to like a take the

01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:51.550
configuration. Yeah. S3 configuration right whatever like a

01:43:51.550 --> 01:43:53.590
name that you are going to give so based on that

01:43:53.590 --> 01:43:57.150
configuration it is going to like take all of these things

01:43:57.150 --> 01:44:02.090
once it will be able to get the configuration it will try to

01:44:02.090 --> 01:44:05.270
create a client so it will try to create a client by using

01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:08.830
access key secret key and reason the key that you are

01:44:08.830 --> 01:44:12.450
already maintaining over here access key secret key and the

01:44:12.450 --> 01:44:18.670
reason basically it will try to get where is my S3. Yeah. So

01:44:18.670 --> 01:44:23.250
it will try to like create a client so that it's code wise

01:44:23.250 --> 01:44:28.390
it will be able to send it and then right then it will start

01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:32.930
sending these documents right so basically it will try to

01:44:32.930 --> 01:44:36.730
start sending this entire document one by one so there is a

01:44:36.730 --> 01:44:39.710
generate document key to send any kind of a document you

01:44:39.710 --> 01:44:42.010
have to generate a key for document you basically it's a

01:44:42.010 --> 01:44:45.670
hashing that you have to do and then there is a upload

01:44:45.670 --> 01:44:48.170
document so where I am starting with the client. As you can

01:44:48.170 --> 01:44:51.250
see right so just call this function this function will

01:44:51.250 --> 01:44:53.950
return the client S3 client and then with the help of this

01:44:53.950 --> 01:44:58.590
client just put object that's it so client dot put object

01:44:59.210 --> 01:45:01.830
and in whatever bucket you would like to put you will be

01:45:01.830 --> 01:45:04.710
able to put it whatever type of the content that you would

01:45:04.710 --> 01:45:07.410
like to put you can try to put it so this is the actual

01:45:07.410 --> 01:45:10.730
method create a create a client and put the object simple

01:45:10.730 --> 01:45:16.230
and done yeah so create a client put the object and rest is

01:45:16.230 --> 01:45:19.590
just a error handling. Now I have also created one function

01:45:19.590 --> 01:45:22.510
so which is going to list all the document which is

01:45:22.510 --> 01:45:26.650
available inside my bucket so again client just like a

01:45:26.650 --> 01:45:30.010
database is right so we have to create the client and that

01:45:30.010 --> 01:45:33.890
was the like a key to create the client and once my client

01:45:33.890 --> 01:45:38.630
is ready simple call list object v2 and it will be able to

01:45:38.630 --> 01:45:41.890
list all the data all the like files from that particular

01:45:41.890 --> 01:45:44.750
bucket whatever bucket name that you are going to give so

01:45:44.750 --> 01:45:46.890
this is one of the function which is going to list the

01:45:46.890 --> 01:45:50.290
entire bucket. bucket for me yeah now if you have to

01:45:50.290 --> 01:45:54.470
download a document from s3 so again client same client

01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:58.790
right client dot get object so put object get object list

01:45:58.790 --> 01:46:02.210
object these are the inbuilt function and just like we use

01:46:02.210 --> 01:46:05.590
to communicate with the databases right this is how easy it

01:46:05.590 --> 01:46:08.870
is to communicate with even a s3 bucket very very easy right

01:46:08.870 --> 01:46:12.030
very very easy only one line and you will be able to put the

01:46:12.030 --> 01:46:14.870
object you will be able to get the object and you will be

01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:17.110
able to even list the object and many more other functions

01:46:17.110 --> 01:46:19.910
which is also available right with respect to these buckets

01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:23.810
just just up to you so this is how this s3 is working this

01:46:23.810 --> 01:46:26.250
code looks very long because i was getting a lot of errors

01:46:26.250 --> 01:46:30.110
so i had to handle a lot of like a exception handlings i had

01:46:30.110 --> 01:46:32.870
to do so because of that like this looks lengthy but

01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:35.950
actually it's not lengthy now check the document exists in

01:46:35.950 --> 01:46:38.870
s3 so there is something called a check like head object

01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:41.730
with the help of that you will be able to check if you have

01:46:41.730 --> 01:46:45.410
to delete something so in that case bucket the client dot

01:46:45.410 --> 01:46:48.770
delete object right delete object and you will be able to

01:46:48.770 --> 01:46:52.510
delete it if you have to like upload the file so process

01:46:52.510 --> 01:46:55.550
upload file with s3 so simple you have to create the client

01:46:55.550 --> 01:46:59.890
so first of all we are trying to check whether document is

01:46:59.890 --> 01:47:04.090
available into a s3 or not and yeah so if document already

01:47:04.090 --> 01:47:07.050
available so in that case we will not upload it if document

01:47:07.050 --> 01:47:09.230
is not available then we'll call the above function the

01:47:09.230 --> 01:47:12.250
upload document function we are going to call and then we

01:47:12.250 --> 01:47:16.650
are going to upload it simple so this entire file is written

01:47:16.650 --> 01:47:20.190
in a very very configurable way as you can see right if you

01:47:20.190 --> 01:47:23.150
would like to change one of the function in your own way you

01:47:23.150 --> 01:47:25.610
can you can just do it right everything is pretty much

01:47:25.610 --> 01:47:29.190
configurable and very very clean and just by reading out its

01:47:29.190 --> 01:47:31.670
function you will be able to understand that what this

01:47:31.670 --> 01:47:34.390
function is trying to do and you will be able to you know do

01:47:34.390 --> 01:47:38.110
everything everything or any kind of changes in this one so

01:47:38.110 --> 01:47:40.570
this is the approach which i have followed so that even in

01:47:40.570 --> 01:47:44.930
future when you will try to update something it should not

01:47:44.930 --> 01:47:47.650
give you a pain even in terms of understanding it should not

01:47:47.650 --> 01:47:51.770
give you the pain so this is my s3 util by the way ui.py

01:47:51.770 --> 01:47:54.670
nothing i have done over here and then there is something

01:47:54.670 --> 01:47:57.610
called as vector again over here i'm not doing anything i'm

01:47:57.610 --> 01:48:01.350
just changing the endpoints yeah endpoints so vector restore

01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:04.450
previously i was using a facebook as similarity search right

01:48:04.450 --> 01:48:09.030
if you remember uh now i'm using a chroma db right so i'm

01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:13.430
just trying to call the chroma client the url which chroma

01:48:13.430 --> 01:48:16.730
provide by the way so where chroma tenant chroma database

01:48:16.730 --> 01:48:22.170
will be available and then uh get embedding so i will try to

01:48:22.170 --> 01:48:26.670
use my open ai model to get the embeddings once i will be

01:48:26.670 --> 01:48:30.350
able to get the embeddings then it is going to create the

01:48:30.350 --> 01:48:33.410
chroma collection so whatever collection that you are going

01:48:33.410 --> 01:48:35.750
to give collection name you are going to give inside a

01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:39.090
particular database it will create it and once it will be

01:48:39.090 --> 01:48:43.750
able to get it so once collection will be already right so

01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:46.150
if collection exists this is just a check box which i have

01:48:46.150 --> 01:48:53.610
written so again this is for a retrieval but before that we

01:48:53.610 --> 01:48:57.030
have a again so this is this is basically the previous one

01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:59.130
the legacy one right this is something that i have written

01:48:59.130 --> 01:49:02.970
last time now on top of this this is something which will

01:49:02.970 --> 01:49:06.490
come into a picture yeah so retrieve a relevant document or

01:49:06.490 --> 01:49:09.390
maybe like storing something into a collection so this is

01:49:09.390 --> 01:49:12.270
something which has been added but again in a very

01:49:12.270 --> 01:49:15.170
simplistic way very simplistic and like a progressive way

01:49:15.790 --> 01:49:18.430
everything is added over here so these are the only file

01:49:18.430 --> 01:49:21.490
guys and what we are doing so we are calling all of this

01:49:21.490 --> 01:49:27.470
file in a main.pi file right so main.pi file is a main file

01:49:27.470 --> 01:49:31.390
so where you will be able to see the all the calls by the

01:49:31.390 --> 01:49:34.810
way yeah you will be able to see all the calls and you will

01:49:34.810 --> 01:49:37.970
be able to see so again nothing much i have changed with

01:49:37.970 --> 01:49:40.910
respect to at least chat i have not changed much uh yeah

01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:44.350
with respect to a side buttons i have added couple of more

01:49:44.350 --> 01:49:47.790
buttons because i have to give you an option to download uh

01:49:47.790 --> 01:49:51.630
basically like a data to check a data or maybe like to raise

01:49:51.630 --> 01:49:54.930
a support ticket keeping that in a mind so i have given you

01:49:54.930 --> 01:49:58.050
a couple of controls inside your sidebar which is your left

01:49:58.050 --> 01:50:03.810
hand sidebar so code wise a little bit of addition but yeah

01:50:03.810 --> 01:50:07.450
almost everything is going to be same i have just like made

01:50:07.450 --> 01:50:10.970
everything public basically so there is no local

01:50:10.970 --> 01:50:13.710
dependencies this is this is something that i have done

01:50:13.710 --> 01:50:17.490
there is no local everything is like a public so there is no

01:50:17.490 --> 01:50:20.370
facebook as a matter such in local in Memory there is no

01:50:20.370 --> 01:50:25.850
vector DB in my local there is no URI or like a is like a

01:50:25.850 --> 01:50:29.530
Hugging Face embedding API which I am using so everything is

01:50:29.530 --> 01:50:31.370
everything is global yeah

01:50:34.020 --> 01:50:35.260
wow

01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:39.980
html CSS can be written within the Python file that's great

01:50:39.980 --> 01:50:43.980
yeah python file yes always we always used to write it so

01:50:43.980 --> 01:50:45.580
that can be written

01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:53.140
yes so just you have to go through a code once but I don't

01:50:53.140 --> 01:50:55.640
think that you will feel any kind of like a difficulties and

01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:58.500
once I am going to upload this code so I am going to create

01:50:58.500 --> 01:51:00.720
a proper readme file and then I am going to upload it so

01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:05.120
don't worry about that one and then eventually we are able

01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:08.620
to build all of these services so now it's time to you know

01:51:08.620 --> 01:51:12.900
test this one right it's time to test this one but before

01:51:12.900 --> 01:51:19.580
testing I have to make a couple of changes so that it should

01:51:19.580 --> 01:51:20.920
work this

01:51:37.780 --> 01:51:42.000
is fine now rest looks good yuri

01:51:45.140 --> 01:51:50.200
api key not required your app password ok

01:51:54.710 --> 01:51:58.310
so once everything is done right so maybe you can go ahead

01:51:58.310 --> 01:52:02.410
with a new environment creation for this particular project

01:52:02.410 --> 01:52:05.450
to run this entire project so or else just run this

01:52:05.450 --> 01:52:08.650
requirement or txt in the existing environment and then try

01:52:08.650 --> 01:52:14.070
to run your main dot py file so here if I have to do this. I

01:52:14.070 --> 01:52:17.750
am going to create a new environment so I can try to call

01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:20.790
conda create hyphen n but let's do it in a local environment

01:52:20.790 --> 01:52:23.170
because we already know how to create the environment right

01:52:23.170 --> 01:52:26.390
so pip install requirement

01:52:30.940 --> 01:52:35.380
dot txt yeah so almost all the requirements requirement dot

01:52:35.380 --> 01:52:37.440
txt I have already mentioned everything which is required

01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:43.740
for this project so just for you so you can try to like you

01:52:43.740 --> 01:52:48.640
know just run this things once requirement dot txt yeah so

01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:54.380
requirement dot txt. And once this is done now if I have run

01:52:54.380 --> 01:52:59.760
this application I can try to call a stream lint run main

01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:05.080
dot pi file so now if everything is going to work if there

01:53:05.080 --> 01:53:09.400
is no issue then it is going to open up my like a stream

01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:14.200
lint in a local and it will start running it right so as of

01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:16.980
now it is showing me that no existing document found in

01:53:16.980 --> 01:53:19.400
chroma db because I have changed the endpoint of the

01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:21.520
application. chroma db by the way yeah so there is no

01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:27.160
existing document i have also changed so list s3 document so

01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:33.180
i think there is no s3 document okay so i think i have not

01:53:33.180 --> 01:53:37.840
changed the end point for this one okay fine so there is a

01:53:37.840 --> 01:53:41.580
document it is still pointing to my previous one right so it

01:53:41.580 --> 01:53:45.380
is able to list all the document from this one now let's

01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:48.860
suppose i don't want to you know drag and drop a file from

01:53:48.860 --> 01:53:52.120
the local so this is basically for a local or admin you can

01:53:52.120 --> 01:53:54.440
say let's suppose if admin would like to upload something

01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:57.400
they can use this option and again you can remove this

01:53:57.400 --> 01:53:59.520
option from the user side user will not be able to see

01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:03.120
anything user will be able to see only this window yeah user

01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:05.600
will be able to see only this particular interface by the

01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:08.580
way not this particular interface user will be able to use

01:54:08.580 --> 01:54:12.540
for example so if i have to upload a new file i can try to

01:54:12.540 --> 01:54:15.400
use this option and once you are going to upload this new

01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:19.240
file it will go into a vector data database as well as it

01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:22.800
will go into where into our S3 bucket basically right it

01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:28.180
will go into S3 bucket let's suppose if there is already a

01:54:28.180 --> 01:54:31.600
vector which is already available inside my DB so in that

01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:33.960
case you can start chatting but as of now it is showing me

01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:38.260
that in my databases which I am pointing to right my chroma

01:54:38.260 --> 01:54:43.020
DB let me show you that part so in my chroma DB where I am

01:54:43.020 --> 01:54:47.300
pointing to so there is no record which is available so

01:54:47.300 --> 01:54:50.580
Medibot pro I think this is the point this is a DB where I

01:54:50.580 --> 01:54:53.720
am pointing to and there is no file inside this one right

01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:57.280
there is no file inside this one what I can do so I have a

01:54:57.280 --> 01:55:01.160
file already like it's pointing to my S3 bucket right so I

01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:03.900
can I have given you a command over control over here

01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:06.680
process all S3 document means without even uploading a

01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:08.860
document from the local you can upload it from the local

01:55:08.860 --> 01:55:12.180
that's okay but if there is a document which is already

01:55:12.180 --> 01:55:15.520
available admin has already done that right so click process

01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:19.380
and then it will start processing it and now if you will go

01:55:19.380 --> 01:55:24.120
and observe right now if you will go and observe so now as

01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:27.360
you can see it is using my joyful Darwin which is nothing

01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:34.940
but my embedding model right so my embedding model so it is

01:55:34.940 --> 01:55:39.580
basically trying to use my joyful and it is able to convert

01:55:39.580 --> 01:55:44.800
into all the embeddings and successfully stored 0 to 12

01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:49.480
document okay processing failed okay failed processing batch

01:55:49.480 --> 01:55:52.960
there is some cred issue by the way successfully processed

01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:54.140
successfully

01:55:57.560 --> 01:56:01.480
processed 12th of 13 document S3 document using existing

01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:07.140
collection medical document okay processing batch one of two

01:56:07.140 --> 01:56:10.140
document failed to get embedding for batch one skipping okay

01:56:10.140 --> 01:56:13.860
so maybe there is a issue with the pointing I have like

01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:18.560
created everything new right so let me change the points let

01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:20.580
me check the points yeah

01:56:29.810 --> 01:56:35.450
it is not able to call my embedding it says so I

01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:25.700
think I have altered let me check altered the machines 70

01:57:42.750 --> 01:57:45.730
for embeddings okay so

01:59:04.900 --> 01:59:10.340
list the document okay process all S3 document and let's see

01:59:10.340 --> 01:59:16.100
whether it is able to process it or not joyful Darwin this

01:59:16.100 --> 01:59:17.040
one it should call

01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:39.900
somebody so I don't know that it is there a connection issue

01:59:39.900 --> 01:59:40.520
error so this is hunker indexingonds so there is a click

01:59:40.520 --> 01:59:44.480
connection issue I have changed all the cred right so

01:59:44.480 --> 01:59:47.960
because of that it's

01:59:50.420 --> 01:59:53.040
confused by the way embedded

01:59:59.920 --> 02:00:09.360
fine so we are grating from 70 machines then embedding this

02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:11.660
fine broma

02:00:18.130 --> 02:00:19.890
data base dice

02:00:43.470 --> 02:00:46.210
bought brother okay

02:01:41.380 --> 02:01:42.820
so let's see Come Introduction okay so let's see whether

02:01:42.820 --> 02:01:45.000
it's able to process this online to process or not so

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:50.720
downloading fine still processed 12 or 13 so downloading and

02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:55.800
processing is done storing batch one ok so now it is able to

02:01:55.800 --> 02:01:59.480
store successfully stored 12 of 12 so now yeah there was a

02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:02.500
issue with the chroma db basically database mapping i have

02:02:02.500 --> 02:02:05.360
not done correctly the new database it was like referring to

02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:09.240
my previous one so successfully stored 12 of 12 document

02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:12.780
into a chroma db collection ok that's cool i will go to my

02:02:12.780 --> 02:02:19.800
chroma db medibot prod right and yes all the documents are

02:02:19.800 --> 02:02:23.080
available to me right all these documents are available to

02:02:23.080 --> 02:02:26.960
me so whatever documents and for every document embeddings

02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:30.400
are available to me so for embedding i am using basically

02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:33.520
this machine right for embedding basically it is using my

02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:38.040
like embedding model a gpu hosted model which i am trying to

02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:41.760
use. and now i am like free i am basically like i can try to

02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:45.000
use any number of documents maybe a millions of document i

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:50.100
can try to process just in like a couple of hours and it is

02:02:50.100 --> 02:02:53.100
not going to cost me anything extra by the way and i will be

02:02:53.100 --> 02:02:56.600
able to store it over here so we are able to store the

02:02:56.600 --> 02:03:01.400
embeddings into this one and again as you can see so i am

02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:05.720
not loading any document from my like you know i am not

02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:09.640
loading any kind of a document from the local yeah so any

02:03:09.640 --> 02:03:13.380
can anyone can go here inside a aws for example my admin

02:03:13.380 --> 02:03:17.200
right my admin can go here and they can simply upload the

02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:21.680
document main bucket medichat you are on it is still not it

02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:25.240
is still focusing here so anyone can go over here and then

02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:27.920
upload all of this document and anyone will be able to read

02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:31.680
it right just just from like without even having the access

02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:34.500
they they can just read it from the ui interface itself this

02:03:34.500 --> 02:03:37.520
is what i am doing so i have all the document over here and

02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:40.460
if i would like to upload more and more document that is

02:03:40.460 --> 02:03:44.600
also fine right i can try to click or browse files i can try

02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:48.060
to upload more so let's

02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:55.260
suppose i am like uploading so process the document yeah so

02:03:55.260 --> 02:03:58.760
now even if i will show you my bucket you will be able to

02:03:58.760 --> 02:04:03.680
basically see ok so it is telling me that it is already in

02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:07.180
s3 so if it is already in s3 don't try to push this entire

02:04:07.180 --> 02:04:10.000
document so document processed successfully document stored

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:13.960
in both s3 and chromatic model. So now if I will go and

02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:18.120
refresh my S3 document was already available so it has not

02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:22.560
uploaded I have written the logic to like avoid it. So here

02:04:22.560 --> 02:04:27.620
as you can see so yes I can like upload a document here I

02:04:27.620 --> 02:04:30.220
can try to even upload a document inside the vector

02:04:30.220 --> 02:04:34.820
databases and anyone can pull those document just from the

02:04:34.820 --> 02:04:38.640
UI without having a code access. So any layman user or any

02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:42.360
like a non-tech user they can see all the original documents

02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:45.160
they can even process the document. Let's suppose I have

02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:47.720
only processed it they don't have to even worry about the

02:04:47.720 --> 02:04:50.340
processing by the way right. If they would like to add more

02:04:50.340 --> 02:04:53.520
document your admin would like to add more document I have

02:04:53.520 --> 02:04:56.140
given you option here right I have already given you option

02:04:56.140 --> 02:04:59.580
over here if your admin is having a direct S3 access they

02:04:59.580 --> 02:05:02.140
can upload it even from here. So multiple options right

02:05:02.140 --> 02:05:05.840
multiple options for the same thing I'm talking about in

02:05:05.840 --> 02:05:08.420
this particular document. Multiple places and once this

02:05:08.420 --> 02:05:12.220
documents are available so maybe I can simply come over here

02:05:12.220 --> 02:05:16.880
and then I can initiate a chat that tell me about all the

02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:25.540
patients in your database yeah so now you will be able to

02:05:25.540 --> 02:05:30.920
see that it has started using my embedding so first of all

02:05:30.920 --> 02:05:33.940
it is converting my query into embedding and it has started

02:05:33.940 --> 02:05:38.480
using even this one right as you can see. So it has started

02:05:38.480 --> 02:05:42.340
using my chat completion as well. So as you can see chat

02:05:42.340 --> 02:05:46.320
completion right so chat completion is also invoked and my

02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:50.160
embedding is also invoked both is basically both it is

02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:53.040
trying to invoke and same thing you will be able to see it

02:05:53.040 --> 02:05:56.340
even in a log. So I am printing everything right I am

02:05:56.340 --> 02:05:59.480
printing everything that processing batch one of one this

02:05:59.480 --> 02:06:01.520
this this and then like successfully it is trying to

02:06:01.520 --> 02:06:03.480
convert. So whatever query that you are trying to send

02:06:03.480 --> 02:06:06.100
technically it is trying to convert that query into

02:06:06.100 --> 02:06:09.140
embeddings so for that I need a embedding server up and

02:06:09.140 --> 02:06:12.800
running so if someone is trying to query so maybe a small

02:06:12.800 --> 02:06:16.400
instance I can keep it up and running now it is able to give

02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:19.820
me like a details about these patients by the way so I said

02:06:19.820 --> 02:06:21.780
that okay fine tell me about all the patients in your

02:06:21.780 --> 02:06:26.100
database it is giving me all of these detail so what is the

02:06:26.100 --> 02:06:29.780
issue what is like a issue with Janice Smith John Dewey or

02:06:29.780 --> 02:06:35.060
maybe Emily Clark general points again. So let's suppose if

02:06:35.060 --> 02:06:38.040
I am looking. I am looking more about a Emily Clark that

02:06:38.040 --> 02:06:48.330
okay give me more detail give me more detail about Emily

02:06:48.330 --> 02:06:52.570
Clark so it will try to process right it will try to process

02:06:52.570 --> 02:06:55.890
based on the available information and here so you will be

02:06:55.890 --> 02:06:58.490
able to see a session analytics as well so I am just trying

02:06:58.490 --> 02:07:00.790
to show you like a session analytics plus I will show you

02:07:00.790 --> 02:07:03.990
how to create a support ticket so yeah it is giving me more

02:07:03.990 --> 02:07:06.870
detail about in a very like comprehensive way as you can see

02:07:06.870 --> 02:07:10.290
right it is trying to give a suggestion from its side all of

02:07:10.290 --> 02:07:12.990
these most of things are not available in document but yeah

02:07:12.990 --> 02:07:15.570
it is able to refer and this is how I have configured the

02:07:15.570 --> 02:07:19.850
prompt so that it will be able to use the LLMs right it will

02:07:19.850 --> 02:07:22.950
be able to use the LLMs and then it will be able to do all

02:07:22.950 --> 02:07:27.270
of these things so beautiful like beautifully it is able to

02:07:27.270 --> 02:07:30.730
like give me anything and then let's suppose if I would like

02:07:30.730 --> 02:07:34.050
to like a create a support ticket so maybe I can try to feed

02:07:34.050 --> 02:07:37.930
my email address over here. I can try to say that sudh nshu

02:07:37.930 --> 02:07:43.770
at the rate you are on dot one right so this is the email id

02:07:43.770 --> 02:07:48.550
I can send maybe a analytics report if I want oh this is

02:07:48.550 --> 02:07:52.790
failing I will check this one send a test mail I

02:07:55.280 --> 02:07:58.820
just have to check this function so send a test mail create

02:07:58.820 --> 02:08:05.180
a support ticket creating a support ticket now yeah so send

02:08:05.180 --> 02:08:07.820
support ticket I can I can change this mail id over here. I

02:08:07.820 --> 02:08:10.920
can even chat. I can put a mail id into a chat and then I

02:08:10.920 --> 02:08:12.940
can say that okay fine send a support ticket to this one

02:08:12.940 --> 02:08:16.500
create a support ticket or send a mail to this one now if I

02:08:16.500 --> 02:08:18.200
will go back yeah

02:08:22.480 --> 02:08:25.400
so as you can see there was one test mail which I have

02:08:25.400 --> 02:08:28.000
received and one support ticket and it is giving me all the

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:31.520
information right so it is giving me all the information

02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:33.620
whatever I have mentioned I have mentioned that okay fine so

02:08:33.620 --> 02:08:36.960
give me all the chat history 10 chat history just try to

02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:39.720
give it to me and it is able to create it though whatever

02:08:39.720 --> 02:08:43.040
way I would like to configure. I can just configure it in

02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:45.860
that way this is what I am trying to say over here right so

02:08:45.860 --> 02:08:48.980
in a beautiful manner I am able to receive even a mail if I

02:08:48.980 --> 02:08:52.480
would like to send someone as a SMS I can send SMS to some

02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:56.500
user that is also okay right that is also okay so I can send

02:08:56.500 --> 02:09:02.820
it I can do it as per my requirement so everything is

02:09:02.820 --> 02:09:07.440
working as we have tested and only this streamlint app is

02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:10.220
running in my local apart from that nothing is running in my

02:09:10.220 --> 02:09:14.340
local. I would say everything I have distributed right so

02:09:14.340 --> 02:09:17.840
now let me draw the complete architecture diagram of this

02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:23.580
entire application that what we are doing over here a

02:09:23.580 --> 02:09:27.780
beautiful architecture I will try to draw yeah

02:09:31.750 --> 02:09:40.070
midi bot let's call it as a pro yeah now so what we are

02:09:40.070 --> 02:09:44.530
trying to do. So user wise. We have a beautiful user. User

02:09:44.530 --> 02:09:46.350
interface and

02:09:50.130 --> 02:09:55.630
we are giving a panel over here on left hand side and then

02:09:55.630 --> 02:09:59.990
we are like giving you a permission to upload a document

02:09:59.990 --> 02:10:07.050
right upload a document from the local basically local then

02:10:07.050 --> 02:10:15.090
a support then processing

02:10:18.830 --> 02:10:21.970
S3 basically right so you can like check what is documents

02:10:21.970 --> 02:10:25.850
available. What is not and then over here you can try to

02:10:25.850 --> 02:10:30.270
basically chat so this is my chat interface not technically

02:10:30.270 --> 02:10:34.830
what is happening right what is happening so whenever you

02:10:34.830 --> 02:10:38.550
are going to call this local right so whenever you are going

02:10:38.550 --> 02:10:41.130
to call this local whenever you are going to upload a fresh

02:10:41.130 --> 02:10:45.970
document from the UI interface it will go where it will go

02:10:45.970 --> 02:10:50.510
to two places right we go to two places. First place is

02:10:50.510 --> 02:10:54.170
basically what is three. S3. And the second place is

02:10:54.170 --> 02:10:58.210
basically what vector db in our cases it is a chroma db

02:10:58.210 --> 02:11:00.490
basically right it will go to two places when you are going

02:11:00.490 --> 02:11:03.170
to upload a new document a pure new document you are going

02:11:03.170 --> 02:11:06.670
to upload so I am storing this document into S3 bucket so

02:11:06.670 --> 02:11:09.550
that my original document will be retained right my original

02:11:09.550 --> 02:11:12.910
document will be retained and then I am trying to like a

02:11:12.910 --> 02:11:16.970
convert that into a vector db now to convert this things

02:11:16.970 --> 02:11:20.910
into a vector db sorry to. When I am trying to store.

02:11:20.910 --> 02:11:24.730
Something into a vector db right so here I am trying to

02:11:24.730 --> 02:11:27.370
store what kind of a document so here I am trying to store

02:11:27.370 --> 02:11:31.830
the raw document raw document but here inside a vector db

02:11:31.830 --> 02:11:36.390
what I am trying to do so I am trying to basically convert a

02:11:36.390 --> 02:11:39.710
data means whatever data that you are going to upload from

02:11:39.710 --> 02:11:45.090
the local so I am trying to convert those data into what so

02:11:45.090 --> 02:11:48.650
I am trying to convert those data into a embedding of size

02:11:48.650 --> 02:11:53.970
1024. Yeah. Now where this embedding model is available by

02:11:53.970 --> 02:11:57.890
the way so this embedding model is actually available on my

02:11:57.890 --> 02:12:03.130
h100 cloud GPU I am converting it and then I am finally

02:12:03.130 --> 02:12:07.170
trying to store the embedding over here into a vector db so

02:12:07.170 --> 02:12:09.970
this is the flow that we are trying to follow so whenever I

02:12:09.970 --> 02:12:12.950
get a new document okay fine so let's try to convert into

02:12:12.950 --> 02:12:16.770
embeddings with the help of this h100 and then where my

02:12:16.770 --> 02:12:19.250
embedding model is up and running and then I store it into a

02:12:19.250 --> 02:12:23.030
vector db. So once data will be available into a vector db

02:12:23.030 --> 02:12:25.670
it will be there permanently so it's not like a Facebook as

02:12:25.670 --> 02:12:28.050
similarity search in local right where data will be wiped

02:12:28.050 --> 02:12:31.310
out no data will be available so I don't have to process a

02:12:31.310 --> 02:12:34.730
data again and again and again right same data I can try to

02:12:34.730 --> 02:12:41.090
use it multiple times okay fine now so here I have one

02:12:41.090 --> 02:12:44.230
option so if I will talk about this process S3 so I have an

02:12:44.230 --> 02:12:49.350
option inside a S3 basically so where you will be able to

02:12:49.350 --> 02:12:57.130
list the document. So basically list document yeah so you

02:12:57.130 --> 02:12:59.750
will be able to see like our user will be able to see like a

02:12:59.750 --> 02:13:03.690
list of all the documents over here not just that right not

02:13:03.690 --> 02:13:07.470
just that so let's suppose there is a document available

02:13:07.470 --> 02:13:10.790
over here and you are pointing to a new database new vector

02:13:10.790 --> 02:13:13.830
db by the way yeah so basically like in a new vector db

02:13:13.830 --> 02:13:16.490
there is no data which is available for example right or

02:13:16.490 --> 02:13:19.430
maybe there is another situation another edge cases where

02:13:19.430 --> 02:13:22.230
your admin has uploaded document directly. Okay. Let it was

02:13:22.230 --> 02:13:25.490
three they don't want to give you this option they don't

02:13:25.490 --> 02:13:28.590
want to give this option to a user so I will hide this UI

02:13:28.590 --> 02:13:31.230
this UI will not be available this button itself will not be

02:13:31.230 --> 02:13:34.250
available let's suppose admin would like to do it okay so

02:13:34.250 --> 02:13:37.430
they will upload into a S3 bucket maybe programmatically or

02:13:37.430 --> 02:13:41.010
maybe directly by using a S3 bucket itself they will be try

02:13:41.010 --> 02:13:44.430
to upload it over there and then you can list all the

02:13:44.430 --> 02:13:46.890
document you can check okay fine these are the document and

02:13:46.890 --> 02:13:49.050
then you can call the process so you don't have to do

02:13:49.050 --> 02:13:53.810
anything as a user right. So basically process it process

02:13:53.810 --> 02:13:56.810
means what so again the process will try to hit this

02:13:56.810 --> 02:13:59.590
embedding model this is going to hit this one and this is

02:13:59.590 --> 02:14:02.250
going to again restore this data into a vector database this

02:14:02.250 --> 02:14:05.350
is the meaning of the process so it will process so user is

02:14:05.350 --> 02:14:08.210
not supposed to worry about any documentation basically so

02:14:08.210 --> 02:14:10.710
document is available in S3 and it's fine I will try to like

02:14:10.710 --> 02:14:15.210
process it over there okay support ticket wise so whatever

02:14:15.210 --> 02:14:18.210
chat is going on so you will be able to generate the support

02:14:18.210 --> 02:14:20.910
ticket you will be able to see the analytics by the way and

02:14:20.910 --> 02:14:26.770
you will be able to you know basically like send anything

02:14:26.770 --> 02:14:29.210
whatever you want you can just send it now when I am trying

02:14:29.210 --> 02:14:31.850
to initiate a chat right when I am trying to use this

02:14:31.850 --> 02:14:35.350
particular option what will happen technically so it will

02:14:35.350 --> 02:14:38.770
never wait for anyone right if data is available into a

02:14:38.770 --> 02:14:41.730
vector db it will start interacting so user is not supposed

02:14:41.730 --> 02:14:43.910
to worry that okay fine data is available or not if data is

02:14:43.910 --> 02:14:45.890
available it will start chatting simple as simple as that

02:14:45.890 --> 02:14:49.810
right. So in terms of chatting what it will do. So whenever

02:14:49.810 --> 02:14:53.490
you are trying to enter any like a text over here right

02:14:53.490 --> 02:14:55.770
let's suppose you are trying to enter some text now what

02:14:55.770 --> 02:14:58.710
will happen as we all know it's a reg application so it will

02:14:58.710 --> 02:15:03.810
call what it will call my embedding model which I am hosting

02:15:03.810 --> 02:15:10.970
into h100 and then it will try to retrieve the data which we

02:15:10.970 --> 02:15:14.230
call like a context it will try to in or embedding it will

02:15:14.230 --> 02:15:18.870
try to like retrieve this is my query let's suppose right.

02:15:19.490 --> 02:15:22.770
So just a normal reg approach it will try to extract this

02:15:22.770 --> 02:15:25.270
one now once it will be able to extract the embedding it

02:15:25.270 --> 02:15:28.890
will try to add these two things so basically it will try to

02:15:28.890 --> 02:15:34.950
add query and the retrieval right and then this it will try

02:15:34.950 --> 02:15:38.310
to send where so this it will try to send again to my h100

02:15:38.310 --> 02:15:42.250
chat completion so basically it is going to send to my llms

02:15:42.250 --> 02:15:45.490
now llm is going to give a response and the response I will

02:15:45.490 --> 02:15:49.230
be able to say it over here as simple as that. Now with

02:15:49.230 --> 02:15:52.630
respect to this llms I have done a lot of like I have given

02:15:52.630 --> 02:15:55.050
a lot of instruction to this llms that okay fine so whenever

02:15:55.050 --> 02:15:57.830
you are trying to generate the response don't just try to

02:15:57.830 --> 02:16:01.650
generate a response from the document apart from that do lot

02:16:01.650 --> 02:16:07.510
of the stuff so this is technically it is going to do. Hope

02:16:07.510 --> 02:16:10.910
after these many discussions everything is clear yes

02:16:10.910 --> 02:16:12.550
everyone yeah

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:20.120
many times we have discussed the same thing right guys. I

02:16:20.120 --> 02:16:22.320
think five to six times. More than five six times we have

02:16:22.320 --> 02:16:25.800
discussed so this is nothing new I think we all are aware

02:16:25.800 --> 02:16:28.960
about it I have just reiterated the entire stuff once again

02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:32.700
and okay nothing is running in my local except this app now

02:16:32.700 --> 02:16:36.500
I can try to migrate this app I can try to change this url

02:16:36.500 --> 02:16:40.600
maybe I would like to hold this one in my own url in my own

02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:45.040
domain right I can do that now which services I will be

02:16:45.040 --> 02:16:48.720
using so I can try to use maybe a apply I can try to use

02:16:48.720 --> 02:16:51.900
maybe a app runner over here. There are so many tons of

02:16:51.900 --> 02:16:55.600
services which is available on AWS Azure and GCPs right I

02:16:55.600 --> 02:16:58.160
can try to use any of the services and I will be able to use

02:16:58.160 --> 02:17:03.460
it but I think it's a time now it's 11 or 18 so I will just

02:17:03.460 --> 02:17:06.840
stop this class I will show you deployment in some other one

02:17:06.840 --> 02:17:09.820
because to do a deployment I was running the deployment

02:17:09.820 --> 02:17:12.400
actually in a morning itself I was testing that deployment

02:17:12.400 --> 02:17:15.800
so I was like creating this entire things into a docker I

02:17:15.800 --> 02:17:19.640
was pushing this entire things into a ECR and then like from

02:17:19.640 --> 02:17:22.800
ECR so through an app or app runner I was like testing this

02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:26.800
deployment and is working well for me but yeah so I think

02:17:26.800 --> 02:17:29.900
it's time for your class so and next class I will start

02:17:29.900 --> 02:17:33.660
agents I will not wait much because in the same one what we

02:17:33.660 --> 02:17:37.280
are going to do now we will try to make it smart now right

02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:40.700
as of now RIG is working well maybe I can try to work on

02:17:40.700 --> 02:17:43.480
some like indentation and formatting and all those things

02:17:43.480 --> 02:17:46.140
maybe I can try to tune all of the services little bit more

02:17:46.140 --> 02:17:51.160
but I will try to make it more intelligent right. Okay.

02:17:51.180 --> 02:17:53.780
Instead I will try to make it more and more intelligent this

02:17:53.780 --> 02:17:57.200
entire stuff so that it will be able to take a mature

02:17:57.200 --> 02:18:01.060
decision it can go to even a web search it will mean lot of

02:18:01.060 --> 02:18:04.180
things I will try to add those things inside your class so

02:18:04.180 --> 02:18:05.920
all of these things it will be able to do it automatically

02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:09.480
and that is possible how with the help of agents this is

02:18:09.480 --> 02:18:12.780
where agents will come into a picture so which I am going to

02:18:12.780 --> 02:18:16.100
start from next week like a Saturday right so what is agent

02:18:16.100 --> 02:18:19.200
then lang chain lang graph all those story is going to start

02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:23.960
so so far. I believe my only intention was to cover this

02:18:23.960 --> 02:18:27.680
part by the way so if you will go to your own my intention

02:18:27.680 --> 02:18:31.420
was to cover a vector database by the way and hopefully we

02:18:31.420 --> 02:18:33.840
are able to cover the vector database in a well manner yes

02:18:33.840 --> 02:18:38.520
in every possible manner yes everyone so I have not started

02:18:38.520 --> 02:18:43.860
this we have just completed this part so far so we are able

02:18:43.860 --> 02:18:46.700
to cover it we are able to even do it something which I have

02:18:46.700 --> 02:18:50.820
not mentioned not even close mentioned inside my syllabus

02:18:50.820 --> 02:18:54.800
right so I have not mentioned about these kind of

02:18:54.800 --> 02:18:59.520
application I just mentioned the vector DB so but yeah we

02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:02.220
have covered a lot in this one now from next class this

02:19:02.220 --> 02:19:05.680
portion I will try to start and now we have a knowledge that

02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:08.660
how to use a vector database what is RAG what is the base

02:19:08.660 --> 02:19:11.620
concept how I can try to use a elements from a URI

02:19:11.620 --> 02:19:15.700
embeddings from a URI if URI is not available how to even

02:19:15.700 --> 02:19:19.120
host which is the major part right I think we are now

02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:21.840
available lot of things. So far yeah

02:19:28.690 --> 02:19:33.530
now what is your part now yeah what is your part so I have

02:19:33.530 --> 02:19:36.470
prepared a document basically right I have already prepared

02:19:36.470 --> 02:19:40.510
the document and in this document right in this document I

02:19:40.510 --> 02:19:42.850
have mentioned application so healthcare clinical protocol

02:19:42.850 --> 02:19:46.170
and drug finder internal use so now listen it listen up

02:19:46.170 --> 02:19:49.550
carefully for next five minute yeah so there are lot of

02:19:49.550 --> 02:19:52.510
application that you can build not just one and that too in

02:19:52.510 --> 02:19:55.310
a real time and maybe you can tomorrow itself you can go and

02:19:55.310 --> 02:19:57.050
showcase this things to your manager that okay we are okay

02:19:57.050 --> 02:19:59.310
fine I have built this one it is working right it is

02:19:59.310 --> 02:20:01.850
technically working now give me the access of all of this

02:20:01.850 --> 02:20:04.890
data I will do it even better maybe you can try to showcase

02:20:04.890 --> 02:20:07.930
this like a kind of application to your client that yes it

02:20:07.930 --> 02:20:10.290
is working right everything is working and you do not have

02:20:10.290 --> 02:20:12.670
to worry about the data breach or anything I have handled

02:20:12.670 --> 02:20:16.730
all those things by myself. So in a healthcare again there

02:20:16.730 --> 02:20:19.830
can be hundreds of use cases this is one of the use cases

02:20:19.830 --> 02:20:22.530
which I have mentioned so user is going to be doctor nurse

02:20:22.530 --> 02:20:25.730
pharmacist and then like in a hospital network basically.

02:20:25.910 --> 02:20:29.510
Okay. Then they will be like able to get this access this

02:20:29.510 --> 02:20:33.250
one this is the old SOP right so try to create a data try to

02:20:33.250 --> 02:20:35.530
build this application which is nothing but same application

02:20:35.530 --> 02:20:37.810
which we have already built right which we have already

02:20:37.810 --> 02:20:43.550
built basically over here then some of you try to accumulate

02:20:43.550 --> 02:20:47.230
some legal document and change this media chat pro change

02:20:47.230 --> 02:20:49.810
the color change the UI interface change the sidebar and

02:20:49.810 --> 02:20:52.790
everything and make it as a legal advisor let's suppose

02:20:52.790 --> 02:20:56.350
generally what happens. So we try to do a lot of. Basically

02:20:56.350 --> 02:20:59.990
legal documentation so for example every company even we as

02:20:59.990 --> 02:21:02.570
a company so let's suppose I'm onboarding someone or maybe

02:21:02.570 --> 02:21:05.310
if I'm trying to award something if I'm trying to change

02:21:05.310 --> 02:21:08.270
some sort of a policy if I'm introducing some policy every

02:21:08.270 --> 02:21:12.990
everyone try to do a lot of you know a documentation and we

02:21:12.990 --> 02:21:16.370
try to generate a lot of legal documentation on nothing can

02:21:16.370 --> 02:21:20.450
be better than chat GPT or GPT's basically right these LLM

02:21:20.450 --> 02:21:23.710
models right so because this can this can be done

02:21:23.710 --> 02:21:25.870
everything. And again. So if I'm going to pass my own

02:21:25.870 --> 02:21:29.330
context which is eventually the RIG so just try to build

02:21:29.330 --> 02:21:32.930
this kind of a system a legal system and again inside the

02:21:32.930 --> 02:21:35.490
legal there are multiple use cases I have mentioned my use

02:21:35.490 --> 02:21:39.310
cases right so where you can try to find out you can do a

02:21:39.310 --> 02:21:41.650
research about the cases you can you can try to give your

02:21:41.650 --> 02:21:44.270
own context and you can say that okay fine so can you please

02:21:44.270 --> 02:21:46.690
give me a detail about this kind of a case which has

02:21:46.690 --> 02:21:50.510
happened in a past in my country in some other country what

02:21:50.510 --> 02:21:55.650
was the IPC which was like a used over there or what was the

02:21:55.650 --> 02:21:57.710
proceeding which has been done with respect to this

02:21:57.710 --> 02:22:00.810
particular case so again it will be very very helpful for a

02:22:00.810 --> 02:22:04.930
legal students right or any lawyer even in a real time

02:22:04.930 --> 02:22:07.970
because it's very difficult to keep ourselves updated with

02:22:07.970 --> 02:22:11.670
all the law recently government has changed a GST law GST

02:22:11.670 --> 02:22:14.090
reform government has done right so many people are not

02:22:14.090 --> 02:22:16.670
aware about it maybe you can try to document it or maybe you

02:22:16.670 --> 02:22:18.910
can try to you know a strap it from the internet and then

02:22:18.910 --> 02:22:22.910
like send it inside your RIG people will be able to get all

02:22:22.910 --> 02:22:26.790
those details right. So, a lot of application over here so

02:22:26.790 --> 02:22:31.330
just try to build one of these application and then close it

02:22:31.330 --> 02:22:34.670
then again finance side again lot of documentation right

02:22:34.670 --> 02:22:37.410
with the structured data with the unstructured data everyday

02:22:37.410 --> 02:22:41.050
we face so finance controller policy controller everyone try

02:22:41.050 --> 02:22:44.910
to use it so just try to build one over here then

02:22:44.910 --> 02:22:48.110
manufacturing and maintenance again right so lot of

02:22:48.110 --> 02:22:50.550
architecture we are going to use lot of policies lot of

02:22:50.550 --> 02:22:53.470
regulations lot of guidelines safety procedure we try to

02:22:53.470 --> 02:22:58.090
follow. So, you can try to build one then retail and e

02:22:58.090 --> 02:23:03.070
-commerce again HR and recruiting again right so real estate

02:23:03.070 --> 02:23:07.810
again travel hospitality so again lot of like a lot of like

02:23:07.810 --> 02:23:10.950
a customer support and lot of internal team. So, again this

02:23:10.950 --> 02:23:13.010
kind of application you can try to build for internal as

02:23:13.010 --> 02:23:15.450
well as external team software engineering again lot of

02:23:15.450 --> 02:23:18.490
things we try to do educational and edtech maybe you can for

02:23:18.490 --> 02:23:21.250
your kids right for your kids you can try to create one like

02:23:21.250 --> 02:23:25.450
a amazing bot basically. You can just send them a URL that,

02:23:25.530 --> 02:23:28.190
okay, fine. So you can ask any kind of a question with

02:23:28.190 --> 02:23:30.690
respect to your own curriculum or out of your curiosity.

02:23:30.990 --> 02:23:35.730
Many, many things can be done. So just out of this 10

02:23:35.730 --> 02:23:38.750
application which I have listed down over here, right, out

02:23:38.750 --> 02:23:42.210
of this 10 application, try to choose at least two to three

02:23:42.210 --> 02:23:44.770
application, right? Try to choose at least two to three

02:23:44.770 --> 02:23:51.210
application. Try to accumulate a data, right? Make a lot of

02:23:51.210 --> 02:23:56.850
changes in a UI side. Yeah? So try to make as much changes

02:23:56.850 --> 02:23:59.510
as possible from the UI side, right?

02:24:03.660 --> 02:24:07.740
Maybe drop a stimulant. Try to use Next.js. Just do a vibe

02:24:07.740 --> 02:24:09.700
coding. Vibe coding I have already introduced in the

02:24:09.700 --> 02:24:12.360
beginning itself. So I believe you should use it now. Yeah?

02:24:12.440 --> 02:24:16.240
Vibe coding. Just open up cursor and say that, okay, this is

02:24:16.240 --> 02:24:20.020
my code base. And like add this feature. So see, guys.

02:24:20.340 --> 02:24:23.000
Generally what people do is they try to give all the

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.400
requirements at once. And this is where your cursor, your

02:24:25.400 --> 02:24:28.960
vibe coder will fail. If you are going to give an option one

02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:31.640
by one, one by one, one by one, that, okay, add this button,

02:24:31.720 --> 02:24:34.780
add this button, connect this with this one, right? So you

02:24:34.780 --> 02:24:37.020
should be very, very clear with the ideation. You should be

02:24:37.020 --> 02:24:39.600
very, very clear with the flow. And if you are clear that,

02:24:39.640 --> 02:24:41.400
okay, I'm going to use. So let's suppose I'm very clear

02:24:41.400 --> 02:24:43.960
that, okay, I have to create a, I have to push my Docker

02:24:43.960 --> 02:24:47.700
image into an ECR. And then from ECR, I'll try to call it

02:24:47.700 --> 02:24:50.840
inside the app runner. Then inside app runner, I will try to

02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:55.060
set all my credentials, right? So if I'm clear with all the

02:24:55.060 --> 02:24:58.080
thought process, all the ideas. One by one, one by one, one

02:24:58.080 --> 02:25:01.800
by one, one by one, I will do a vibe coding and then I will

02:25:01.800 --> 02:25:04.440
try to make it better and better. And you have a good base,

02:25:04.560 --> 02:25:06.380
right? You have a good base. Everything is written in a

02:25:06.380 --> 02:25:09.980
modern fashion. So change this entire UI interface, make it

02:25:09.980 --> 02:25:13.420
responsive, make it better, right? By default in a stream,

02:25:13.460 --> 02:25:18.240
it will be responsive. But yeah, so make it better, make it

02:25:18.240 --> 02:25:21.900
compatible and then derive multiple use cases out of this

02:25:21.900 --> 02:25:24.520
one. Drive multiple use cases, which I have already listed

02:25:24.520 --> 02:25:31.440
down. And then. Keep it inside your GitHub making sense

02:25:31.440 --> 02:25:37.200
guys, so how these apps are helpful in real time when like

02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:39.840
purpose really see purpose really is also one of the

02:25:39.840 --> 02:25:42.520
application where they are using a third party, like a

02:25:42.520 --> 02:25:45.760
models must be aware about it. Right? So publicity is having

02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:48.140
its own model, but yeah, they are not using it because it's

02:25:48.140 --> 02:25:50.740
not that great. They're using a chat GPT, cloud is on it and

02:25:50.740 --> 02:25:53.480
all those models. Uh, the only thing that they have attached

02:25:53.480 --> 02:25:57.800
is that, that, uh, uh, the real time search, right? You can

02:25:57.800 --> 02:26:01.960
use a server API. You can use a Gemini 2.5 flash to attach a

02:26:01.960 --> 02:26:04.820
real time search. And then once you are able to do a search,

02:26:04.980 --> 02:26:08.800
you can try to go ahead with a summarization. Someone has

02:26:08.800 --> 02:26:13.300
sent me the support ticket by the way. Yeah. Akash Gupta,

02:26:13.420 --> 02:26:16.900
Akash Gupta has sent me the support ticket. I can see it. I

02:26:16.900 --> 02:26:21.800
have received a support ticket Akash. Okay. So basically,

02:26:22.060 --> 02:26:25.400
uh, yeah. Uh, so you can, you can try to add a real time

02:26:25.400 --> 02:26:28.120
search. You can try to give more knowledge, for example, a

02:26:28.120 --> 02:26:30.540
stock. Market knowledge, which is also available in a public

02:26:30.540 --> 02:26:32.960
domain. So publicity is not doing anything different.

02:26:33.120 --> 02:26:35.620
They're just trying to, you know, fetch all the data from

02:26:35.620 --> 02:26:38.380
the public domain. And then they're trying to show you in a

02:26:38.380 --> 02:26:42.100
beautiful manner from a UI side. So user experience wise, it

02:26:42.100 --> 02:26:44.840
looks, wow. But technically it's using a third party model,

02:26:44.980 --> 02:26:49.440
right? Opacity is not using their own model by the way. So

02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:52.400
by mistake, it went to you. Okay. Not an issue. Uh, it's

02:26:52.400 --> 02:26:58.740
fine. Now I can see that someone is using it. Okay. So just

02:26:58.740 --> 02:27:04.900
try to add more on this one, and then I will, when I will

02:27:04.900 --> 02:27:08.860
start agents, believe me, I'll make it more intelligent

02:27:08.860 --> 02:27:13.220
system. Yeah, not, I, we all will be able to make a more

02:27:13.220 --> 02:27:17.000
intelligent system, which I'm going to start from next week

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.940
onwards. And then obviously hosting deployment, I'll show

02:27:19.940 --> 02:27:24.020
you all these things even till the boy in mapping. So if you

02:27:24.020 --> 02:27:26.120
will not be able to see some X, Y, G random one. So maybe

02:27:26.120 --> 02:27:28.480
you have purchased your own. Your own domain, I'll show you

02:27:28.480 --> 02:27:30.780
how to do a domain mapping and everything. So technically

02:27:30.780 --> 02:27:34.100
you will be having a complete product in your hand and

02:27:34.100 --> 02:27:37.720
which, which you can like, maybe add some like a payment

02:27:37.720 --> 02:27:41.780
gateway, monetize it, or maybe sell to some B2B client, or

02:27:41.780 --> 02:27:44.240
maybe like, uh, do the freelancing and say that, okay, fine.

02:27:44.340 --> 02:27:47.280
I have built this entire application and, uh, it is going to

02:27:47.280 --> 02:27:49.500
be useful because everyone nowadays need it. Right.

02:27:49.540 --> 02:27:53.540
Everyone, right. Every restaurant, every hospital sell it to

02:27:53.540 --> 02:27:56.520
some small restaurant, sell it to someone. Right. Maybe

02:27:56.520 --> 02:27:58.380
they're going to. They're going to give you maybe like a 5

02:27:58.380 --> 02:28:03.580
,000, 10,000 to be that that's okay, but every restaurant,

02:28:03.740 --> 02:28:07.340
every hospital, everything, uh, you see in this entire

02:28:07.340 --> 02:28:10.680
world, everyone needs it. Maybe your society, right? Maybe

02:28:10.680 --> 02:28:13.220
your society, you must be living in some society, right? And

02:28:13.220 --> 02:28:16.180
there are like a lot of rules and regulations, and there are

02:28:16.180 --> 02:28:19.360
a lot of norms we try to follow inside our society. And

02:28:19.360 --> 02:28:22.900
generally on a app, or then we on some migrate app, we will

02:28:22.900 --> 02:28:25.360
be able to find out all those documents, right? Maybe create

02:28:25.360 --> 02:28:28.700
a bot and then keep on updating it. So. So let's suppose

02:28:28.700 --> 02:28:30.740
there is a new festival which is going to come and you are

02:28:30.740 --> 02:28:33.980
trying to like, uh, form the community so people can chat

02:28:33.980 --> 02:28:38.040
with that bot, maybe call that bot into a mobile. So people

02:28:38.040 --> 02:28:40.360
will just do slash and then they will be able to call that

02:28:40.360 --> 02:28:43.380
bot. It will be able to respond automatically, right? Maybe

02:28:43.380 --> 02:28:47.160
call it inside the telegram. So, so many, so many things are

02:28:47.160 --> 02:28:50.400
possible and which is going to solve the real time problem,

02:28:50.520 --> 02:28:56.200
right? Real time problem. So just do it, right? At least sit

02:28:56.200 --> 02:28:59.580
tight for next three to four weeks. And believe me, you will

02:28:59.580 --> 02:29:02.900
be able to build many application, many application, and

02:29:02.900 --> 02:29:07.640
then you will be ready. Simple. Yeah. For any kind of a job,

02:29:07.700 --> 02:29:09.420
no one, no one can beat you in an interview at all.

02:29:13.290 --> 02:29:15.870
I'm working in a tax day company, so I'll try to build it in

02:29:15.870 --> 02:29:18.650
that domain. Yes, yes. Yeah. So build something for your

02:29:18.650 --> 02:29:21.430
kids, build something for your society, right? Build

02:29:21.430 --> 02:29:24.510
something for your neighborhood and believe me, that will

02:29:24.510 --> 02:29:27.550
change your perspective. Yeah. And you will be able to build

02:29:27.550 --> 02:29:30.930
for the world. So solve your local problem first. And God

02:29:30.930 --> 02:29:34.670
knows. Like you will get some sort of a good idea, right?

02:29:34.710 --> 02:29:38.910
Make a beautiful UI, make an app and then like push it for a

02:29:38.910 --> 02:29:41.610
monetization. As simple as that, right? This is how a

02:29:41.610 --> 02:29:44.250
startup starts, by the way. So if I'll talk about publicity,

02:29:44.610 --> 02:29:48.090
see it like it's at the first like a mover advantage, right?

02:29:48.130 --> 02:29:50.270
Even in India, many people have tried, but because of

02:29:50.270 --> 02:29:53.870
funding, because we know there's like a kind of a, you know,

02:29:53.890 --> 02:29:58.950
funding and all those like a lot of, lot of like headaches

02:29:58.950 --> 02:30:02.270
and a lot of hurdles comes in between. But yeah, so if, if

02:30:02.270 --> 02:30:04.110
you have a startup and if you have a good connects,

02:30:04.150 --> 02:30:06.830
obviously you will be able to bring a funding and then you

02:30:06.830 --> 02:30:10.150
can, you can just do whatever you want. You must be aware

02:30:10.150 --> 02:30:13.630
about this push AI, right? Nowadays it's getting some sort

02:30:13.630 --> 02:30:18.230
of popularity. Yeah. Push AI. Anyone? Yeah. I mean like what

02:30:18.230 --> 02:30:22.130
it is, by the way, in your language, it is going to give a

02:30:22.130 --> 02:30:25.490
response. Now the embedding model, which I'm using the LM,

02:30:25.570 --> 02:30:28.430
which I'm using, it's also multilingual, right?

02:30:30.390 --> 02:30:35.270
It's also multilingual. And then try to add RIG means RIG

02:30:35.270 --> 02:30:37.710
means you are giving a more capability, right? More

02:30:37.710 --> 02:30:39.790
capability, more power from a private data.

02:30:42.830 --> 02:30:45.170
Who already is startup is the best example here. This is the

02:30:45.170 --> 02:30:48.070
wrapper example, obviously, right? So if you have a

02:30:48.070 --> 02:30:50.730
distribution, if you can try to build a wrapper, sell it

02:30:50.730 --> 02:30:57.490
simple. So there are multiple ways again, like a leverage

02:30:57.490 --> 02:31:01.330
AI. I believe now you are able to get the idea and the next

02:31:01.330 --> 02:31:03.710
one to two month, you will be able to get more and more

02:31:03.710 --> 02:31:06.990
ideas. Not idea practically, we'll do it again. It's up to

02:31:06.990 --> 02:31:09.350
you. So how you are going to use those practical knowledge,

02:31:09.430 --> 02:31:12.410
practical understanding. Again, there are so many countries,

02:31:12.510 --> 02:31:15.130
right? There are so many countries where like things are not

02:31:15.130 --> 02:31:18.630
available. Maybe you can try to like, uh, get a market over

02:31:18.630 --> 02:31:23.410
there. Yeah. So do something. The only like conclusion,

02:31:23.530 --> 02:31:26.550
which I'm trying to draw over here, that, that do something

02:31:26.550 --> 02:31:28.910
don't sit ideal, but

02:31:32.300 --> 02:31:35.100
he isn't providing API model like Yuri. Yeah. He will not

02:31:35.100 --> 02:31:37.840
provide. I know he's just like, uh, giving a chat.

02:31:37.940 --> 02:31:47.130
Interface. Uh, so yeah, so does the server need to be

02:31:47.130 --> 02:31:49.650
running all the time because it gives a DNS name to, uh,

02:31:49.810 --> 02:31:52.990
someone to show it, uh, how, yeah, obviously servers should

02:31:52.990 --> 02:31:54.610
be up and running all the time.

02:31:58.350 --> 02:32:00.170
Also the back end, all you're going to say completely, maybe

02:32:00.170 --> 02:32:02.030
there's some rigorous practice. I'm confident that I can

02:32:02.030 --> 02:32:04.230
understand much more. Yeah. Just go ahead with the ones I

02:32:04.230 --> 02:32:06.730
have kept all the function name in such a way that just by

02:32:06.730 --> 02:32:08.790
reading out the function name, you will be able to

02:32:08.790 --> 02:32:11.670
understand it. So code is not a scary at all. It's, it's

02:32:11.670 --> 02:32:13.550
very easy. Yeah. Actually, it's

02:32:16.430 --> 02:32:22.030
literally Yuri with the paid package, not even a API. It's a

02:32:22.030 --> 02:32:24.970
Yuri chat system. Only Yuri has two systems. If you remember

02:32:24.970 --> 02:32:29.610
one chat multi-model, you can do the chatting on all those

02:32:29.610 --> 02:32:32.650
other operations, generator images, and everything that you

02:32:32.650 --> 02:32:36.190
can do with any paid one second system. Yuri is having Yuri

02:32:36.190 --> 02:32:39.170
API. So technically Yuri is having two system, not just one.

02:32:43.420 --> 02:32:45.940
Meanwhile, so it says it made. Okay.

02:32:50.160 --> 02:32:52.140
So I'm going to show you the configuration setting in case

02:32:52.140 --> 02:32:54.200
we deploy into the cloud. So once I'll show you the

02:32:54.200 --> 02:32:58.340
deployment, then I think you will get to know. So for

02:32:58.340 --> 02:33:01.340
example, if I'm trying to use, maybe there is something

02:33:01.340 --> 02:33:05.220
called an app runner. So in app runner, if I'm going to

02:33:05.220 --> 02:33:11.600
create a service, so let's suppose if I'm going to browse an

02:33:11.600 --> 02:33:15.200
image. So by default, it is giving you an option. Okay. Let

02:33:15.200 --> 02:33:21.700
me use some IAM. I'm just showing you. So here, basically,

02:33:21.740 --> 02:33:26.700
it is giving you an add environment variable. So you can add

02:33:26.700 --> 02:33:29.160
any number of environment variable, as you can see, right?

02:33:29.480 --> 02:33:32.400
Or else you can try to use a secret manager. So inside a

02:33:32.400 --> 02:33:34.760
secret manager, you can try to keep all the secrets. I'm

02:33:34.760 --> 02:33:37.640
using that, by the way. So I'm using this. There are

02:33:37.640 --> 02:33:39.880
multiple options. So I'm using like a secret manager option

02:33:39.880 --> 02:33:43.080
as well. So where I'm keeping all the secrets, which is also

02:33:43.080 --> 02:33:47.860
a standard approach of like, you know, storing our secrets.

02:33:48.220 --> 02:33:52.580
On a cloud platform. And again, inside a GitHub, you will be

02:33:52.580 --> 02:33:55.900
able to manage a secret. So there are multiple places where

02:33:55.900 --> 02:33:58.020
you will be able to manage the secret. Once I'll show you

02:33:58.020 --> 02:34:00.800
the real-time deployment, then I'll show you this part as

02:34:00.800 --> 02:34:04.480
well. But this is just a step. Not tough at all. Easy to

02:34:04.480 --> 02:34:04.740
implement.

02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:12.760
Can we do some experiment with Salon BI? Yeah, do it. See,

02:34:12.780 --> 02:34:14.660
at the end of the day, it's just a model, right? So whatever

02:34:14.660 --> 02:34:16.800
experiment that you would like to do, do it. Because now you

02:34:16.800 --> 02:34:19.360
know how to host the model, how to do the inferencing,

02:34:19.420 --> 02:34:21.820
everything you are aware about, right? So do it.

02:34:25.950 --> 02:34:28.870
If we keep on running completely for a month, how much

02:34:28.870 --> 02:34:31.570
approach it may add up? Just do the math. I think now you

02:34:31.570 --> 02:34:37.590
know the hourly cost, right? Do the math. Just hours into 24

02:34:37.590 --> 02:34:40.210
into 30. That's it. And two system minimum.

02:34:44.910 --> 02:34:48.170
Can you please add session-based conversation history? So as

02:34:48.170 --> 02:34:50.930
of now, I have just like showing the analytics, session

02:34:50.930 --> 02:34:53.810
-based analytics. But yeah, in the future, so obviously with

02:34:53.810 --> 02:34:57.470
respect to langchain, it's easy to add the memory. I'll be

02:34:57.470 --> 02:34:59.570
adding that. By the way. So

02:35:02.510 --> 02:35:04.910
costing wise, it will be costlier solution to the client,

02:35:05.010 --> 02:35:08.370
right? No, it is not going to be the costlier solution for

02:35:08.370 --> 02:35:13.370
any client. The reason is very simple. So let's suppose if

02:35:13.370 --> 02:35:18.250
you are accessing API token for embeddings, right? Now, what

02:35:18.250 --> 02:35:21.610
other platforms are charging you? Token wise, right? Yeah.

02:35:22.530 --> 02:35:25.390
Other platforms are charging you token wise, by the way.

02:35:25.590 --> 02:35:31.130
Yes. So technically, you have to pay per tokens. Yes. Yes.

02:35:31.130 --> 02:35:34.010
So let's suppose if you have a 10 million document or maybe

02:35:34.010 --> 02:35:37.270
1 million document, 10 lakh document. Just imagine how much

02:35:37.270 --> 02:35:41.110
and every document is having a 25, 30 MB of size, 400, 500

02:35:41.110 --> 02:35:45.370
pages. Just now calculate the cost in terms of API token.

02:35:45.870 --> 02:35:49.070
Now, same thing if you are using it within this mode where

02:35:49.070 --> 02:35:52.790
you have hosted it, it will be a fractional cost. Believe

02:35:52.790 --> 02:35:57.610
me, a fraction of cost. Right. Maybe in one, two hour, two,

02:35:57.650 --> 02:35:59.630
three dollar, you will be able to process it over there. It

02:35:59.630 --> 02:36:04.490
is going to cost you in crores. Yes. API token wise. Same

02:36:04.490 --> 02:36:09.730
goes for LLM inferencing, chat completion. Yeah. So just do

02:36:09.730 --> 02:36:11.810
the math. Actually, it is not costly. It is a cheaper

02:36:11.810 --> 02:36:16.960
approach. Yeah. It is actually cheaper approach. But yes,

02:36:17.040 --> 02:36:20.020
after certain scale, let's suppose I just have only one

02:36:20.020 --> 02:36:23.180
document and obviously in that case, you will feel like,

02:36:23.280 --> 02:36:27.680
okay, why I am wasting like a $1, $1.5 per hour. But think

02:36:27.680 --> 02:36:29.600
about millions of document you are processing. Think about

02:36:29.600 --> 02:36:33.640
the big organization. Right. Think about the big community

02:36:33.640 --> 02:36:37.080
for which you are. Think about the product. If you are

02:36:37.080 --> 02:36:38.880
building a product and that product has been used by

02:36:38.880 --> 02:36:42.260
hundreds of people, right. Actually, it is way more cheaper.

02:36:44.290 --> 02:36:47.750
It is a fractional cost that you will have to pay and you

02:36:47.750 --> 02:36:50.430
will be able to generate maybe like a 95%, 99% margin.

02:36:54.230 --> 02:36:57.270
Yeah. Open AI token. And again, the second part is security.

02:36:57.770 --> 02:37:00.350
Now, everything is running in your environment. You have

02:37:00.350 --> 02:37:03.430
full control. Right. So there won't be any kind of a

02:37:03.430 --> 02:37:07.670
headache in your mind that. Uh. Uh, uh, so because some for

02:37:07.670 --> 02:37:11.730
some of your client, even cost will not be a major concern.

02:37:11.950 --> 02:37:14.530
It will not be a bottleneck. The bottleneck will be

02:37:14.530 --> 02:37:17.270
security. And I think it's a bottleneck for all of us.

02:37:17.290 --> 02:37:23.080
Right. All of us basically, this bottleneck will be removed

02:37:23.080 --> 02:37:27.240
because now you are in control of everything. You can do the

02:37:27.240 --> 02:37:29.940
fine tuning. You can try to like, you know, build a pipeline

02:37:29.940 --> 02:37:32.640
and then you can, uh, keep on hosting your own model

02:37:32.640 --> 02:37:38.300
embedding or anything. Right. So. So even cost will be very

02:37:38.300 --> 02:37:40.960
much cheaper if you're going on a scale. And yes, if

02:37:40.960 --> 02:37:43.360
security is your concern, which will be a concern for any

02:37:43.360 --> 02:37:46.340
clients, right, you are going to work. And especially if

02:37:46.340 --> 02:37:48.640
you're working for any US client or European region client,

02:37:48.800 --> 02:37:52.380
security will be the very, very first one. They will never

02:37:52.380 --> 02:37:55.960
compromise with it. And in that situation, this is the only

02:37:55.960 --> 02:37:57.360
solution solution that you have.

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:04.080
How to go with a smaller client. First, I have given you a

02:38:04.080 --> 02:38:08.300
10 application, right? Build 10 into two means in every

02:38:08.300 --> 02:38:10.640
domain. Two, three. Two, three, two, three, every time

02:38:10.640 --> 02:38:13.020
change the UI and believe me, use a vibe coding. I'm not

02:38:13.020 --> 02:38:16.320
saying that no, just go and like, you know, uh, write a code

02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:18.620
from the sketch. No, I have given you the base code, right?

02:38:18.840 --> 02:38:22.420
Do the vibe coding, change the UI, maybe write the rewrite

02:38:22.420 --> 02:38:26.480
the entire UI into a next Jace, right? Build it 10, 20

02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:30.240
application, upload those application on a GitHub and the

02:38:30.240 --> 02:38:33.580
daily create a post on LinkedIn that I have built this. I

02:38:33.580 --> 02:38:36.080
have built that. Believe me, you will be able to get a lot

02:38:36.080 --> 02:38:38.560
of followers just for the GitHub account where people will

02:38:38.560 --> 02:38:41.560
come and watch. Your code, right? They will see your code.

02:38:41.660 --> 02:38:44.900
They will fork your code. So this is how you get a organic

02:38:44.900 --> 02:38:48.920
cloud. People will now know about you that, okay, there is a

02:38:48.920 --> 02:38:51.480
person who is creating it and obviously everyone is not

02:38:51.480 --> 02:38:53.460
doing it. Believe me, it's not normal, right? It's not

02:38:53.460 --> 02:38:55.940
normal. It's not like you will see this kind of application

02:38:55.940 --> 02:38:58.420
every day over the social media platform. No, everyone is

02:38:58.420 --> 02:39:01.220
talking about AI. Everyone is talking about RG. That's a

02:39:01.220 --> 02:39:04.600
another story. But yeah, everyone is not building. Believe

02:39:04.600 --> 02:39:08.040
me, majority of people are just giving some sort of fun

02:39:08.040 --> 02:39:12.140
knowledge. It means technically again over the social media

02:39:12.140 --> 02:39:15.340
platform, but it's it's basically tough to, you know, sit in

02:39:15.340 --> 02:39:18.200
front of system and even do a live coding because even that

02:39:18.200 --> 02:39:21.480
takes and like a time and that takes a lot of energy that

02:39:21.480 --> 02:39:24.240
consumes a lot of energy. So if you are doing it, obviously

02:39:24.240 --> 02:39:26.300
people will start following you. People will know that,

02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:29.360
okay, fine, this is the person and maybe some people and

02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:31.960
believe me, if you're doing it for 10 days, 15 days itself,

02:39:32.060 --> 02:39:34.700
right, you will start seeing the result. Some people will

02:39:34.700 --> 02:39:37.140
come and say that, okay, I'm working on this application in

02:39:37.140 --> 02:39:39.880
my company. I'm not. I'm not able to do it, so can you

02:39:39.880 --> 02:39:44.600
please help me out, charge them hourly, yeah, charge them

02:39:44.600 --> 02:39:47.200
hourly. There are so many people. There are so many senior,

02:39:47.280 --> 02:39:50.360
junior and middle level people, right, who is like afraid of

02:39:50.360 --> 02:39:53.120
losing their job and they just want to impress their bosses

02:39:53.120 --> 02:39:56.080
and like everyone in their team, right, and they're willing

02:39:56.080 --> 02:39:59.620
to pay you 10,000, 20,000 rupees per hour. So if you are

02:39:59.620 --> 02:40:03.940
like charging them for 10 hours, they will pay you. And it's

02:40:03.940 --> 02:40:04.340
a big market.

02:40:08.980 --> 02:40:12.540
So monetize guys. See, but you will get the real. Happiness

02:40:12.540 --> 02:40:15.100
when you will get some return, unless you're not getting a

02:40:15.100 --> 02:40:18.360
return. Believe me, you feel demotivated and I never suggest

02:40:18.360 --> 02:40:21.580
that kind of a learning. My that is not my style of like,

02:40:21.660 --> 02:40:24.980
you know, teaching people or like training people since the

02:40:24.980 --> 02:40:28.620
beginning itself, the last eight year. So just just do it.

02:40:28.740 --> 02:40:32.420
Believe me, just do it. Do the wife coding upload like I'll

02:40:32.420 --> 02:40:34.400
give you the document. I'll post the document inside your

02:40:34.400 --> 02:40:39.100
like, uh, what's a group, right? Ten into two different,

02:40:39.160 --> 02:40:41.400
different application, right? Change the UI. Change the

02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:43.500
buttons. Then so the flavor, so the flavor that, okay, I had

02:40:43.500 --> 02:40:47.820
done this. I have done that all this flavor, right? And

02:40:47.820 --> 02:40:50.400
solve, solve someone problem because people are going to pay

02:40:50.400 --> 02:40:52.500
you if you're solving their problem. See, I'm solving your

02:40:52.500 --> 02:40:54.420
problem, right? That's the reason you are paying me like a 5

02:40:54.420 --> 02:40:57.200
,000 rupees or 3000, whatever it is, right? Whatever is my

02:40:57.200 --> 02:41:00.520
fees. So you are paying me because I'm solving your problem.

02:41:00.640 --> 02:41:03.620
Your problem is what you wanted to learn, right? I'm here to

02:41:03.620 --> 02:41:08.800
teach. You're paying me, right? I'm able to, so see, I just

02:41:08.800 --> 02:41:11.260
have a knowledge, right? I'm able to monetize my knowledge.

02:41:11.880 --> 02:41:14.300
And they said the entire world is trying to monetize their

02:41:14.300 --> 02:41:17.280
knowledge. So why can't you do it? Do it.

02:41:20.830 --> 02:41:26.610
Yeah. Up to six K six K. Peace. Let this go to the company

02:41:26.610 --> 02:41:29.070
for the six K we bought come here. Matlab who is, who is

02:41:29.070 --> 02:41:32.070
giving you in six K even these main number of life classes

02:41:32.070 --> 02:41:35.610
and courses. Six K Matlab, just show me one person in a

02:41:35.610 --> 02:41:38.930
world or one organization in a world who is doing it with

02:41:38.930 --> 02:41:40.810
life classes. Again, not a recording. Recording is

02:41:40.810 --> 02:41:43.670
different. It's just a one-time game, right? Life classes.

02:41:43.710 --> 02:41:46.790
Takes a lot of. Energy. Energy and effort. No one, no one in

02:41:46.790 --> 02:41:50.990
this entire world. I would say that these main classes. So

02:41:50.990 --> 02:41:53.970
yeah, I'm able to monetize it. Do it for yourself.

02:41:58.450 --> 02:42:01.130
Can you guide us on building APK? I'll guide you on so many

02:42:01.130 --> 02:42:03.830
things, but first come first, whatever I'm asking you, just

02:42:03.830 --> 02:42:06.990
do it. Otherwise you will just keep on asking me and then

02:42:06.990 --> 02:42:10.410
tomorrow you will keep on asking someone else. So whatever I

02:42:10.410 --> 02:42:14.550
say, if you're going to follow, believe me, your level will

02:42:14.550 --> 02:42:18.910
change in one or two months. If you're not doing it. Then no

02:42:18.910 --> 02:42:21.270
one can help you on simple, right? You will just end up

02:42:21.270 --> 02:42:23.990
asking some random question to some random people like

02:42:23.990 --> 02:42:25.930
you're asking me tomorrow to someone else.

02:42:29.540 --> 02:42:34.400
URI is ultra-promising domain here, how to get a WhatsApp

02:42:34.400 --> 02:42:38.340
access, which WhatsApp access, uh, like to configure it in a

02:42:38.340 --> 02:42:41.880
app or your group WhatsApp access group.

02:42:46.890 --> 02:42:50.330
So, okay, just go inside your dashboard and from there you

02:42:50.330 --> 02:42:51.010
can access it

02:42:57.320 --> 02:43:00.880
entire year. You deliver at least 10 life classes. Uh, yeah.

02:43:00.880 --> 02:43:04.040
And more than that, more than, more than that, like in our

02:43:04.040 --> 02:43:06.820
last stretch itself, I think we have launched 14, 15 life

02:43:06.820 --> 02:43:10.080
classes, me and other mentor. And then like, uh, again, we

02:43:10.080 --> 02:43:12.780
have started the life classes. Five is already live. So in a

02:43:12.780 --> 02:43:15.620
year itself, in less than a year, in like eight to 10 months

02:43:15.620 --> 02:43:19.480
itself, we have launched almost 15, 16, not 15, 18, 18 plus

02:43:19.480 --> 02:43:22.060
life classes. Forget about recording and all the other

02:43:22.060 --> 02:43:25.800
services now calculate the cost who is giving you life

02:43:25.800 --> 02:43:31.140
classes in this place. In majority of places, mentors are

02:43:31.140 --> 02:43:32.880
not even picking up your call. And they're not even

02:43:32.880 --> 02:43:35.940
responding back in a WhatsApp group. I think you are aware

02:43:35.940 --> 02:43:39.500
about it. That's a reality, right? But here, I'm just trying

02:43:39.500 --> 02:43:42.340
to assist so that all of us can grow and do something,

02:43:42.420 --> 02:43:45.660
monetize your skills, right? It's, it's a very high time for

02:43:45.660 --> 02:43:48.420
all of us. So finally, I think it's enough for motivation

02:43:48.420 --> 02:43:52.100
for today. I'll keep on giving you this motivation, right?

02:43:56.140 --> 02:43:58.800
Uh, I'll start taking some doubts and then I'll close the

02:43:58.800 --> 02:44:01.280
lecture. Yeah. So those who is having a doubts, you can

02:44:01.280 --> 02:44:04.520
raise your hand. Uh, I'll share all the material and the

02:44:04.520 --> 02:44:07.460
code code. I think I have already shared in a drive. So

02:44:07.460 --> 02:44:09.800
everything will be available inside your dashboard plus a

02:44:09.800 --> 02:44:12.840
problem statement, which I've already prepared. So even that

02:44:12.840 --> 02:44:15.100
problem statement will be available inside your dashboard.

02:44:15.260 --> 02:44:19.000
So you can just like, uh, solve it, but yes, solve it.

02:44:20.040 --> 02:44:24.520
Things are not tough, right? The only problem is we are not

02:44:24.520 --> 02:44:27.380
able to sit for a very long time. That's the only problem

02:44:27.380 --> 02:44:30.480
which I see, right? I don't see any technology stuff.

02:44:30.660 --> 02:44:34.460
Learning anything is tough. The only thing, uh, which is

02:44:34.460 --> 02:44:38.800
stuff is to being a disciplined person and avoid

02:44:38.800 --> 02:44:42.560
procrastination and sit on your chair for a very long time.

02:44:43.040 --> 02:44:46.100
That's a problem. Actually, learning was never been a

02:44:46.100 --> 02:44:50.840
problem by the way. Okay. So go ahead. Mohit, then HP, then

02:44:50.840 --> 02:44:53.120
Ganesh and then Vinton. Yeah. Go ahead with the question.

02:44:56.020 --> 02:45:01.480
Hello, sir. Yeah. I'm going to go ahead. So there are how

02:45:01.480 --> 02:45:06.300
companies are adapting agent decay. Because, uh, so much of

02:45:06.300 --> 02:45:11.620
confidential data and, uh, is there having, they are having

02:45:11.620 --> 02:45:17.100
like, uh, servers and all, yeah, obviously they are creating

02:45:17.100 --> 02:45:19.840
a server without that. What they will do. So obviously they

02:45:19.840 --> 02:45:25.580
are creating. Okay. Okay. That's my question. Okay. Okay.

02:45:25.660 --> 02:45:27.640
Next one is like a Mohit. Go ahead with the question.

02:45:30.960 --> 02:45:36.020
Yeah. Mohit. No question. Okay. What curse question, please.

02:45:40.950 --> 02:45:44.470
I'm audible guys. Yes, sir. Yes. Okay. So yeah, the

02:45:44.470 --> 02:45:48.810
question. Yeah, go ahead. Good morning, sir. Yeah. Good

02:45:48.810 --> 02:45:51.990
morning. Good morning. Go ahead. Uh, sir, actually, uh, the

02:45:51.990 --> 02:45:56.950
question is like out of, uh, the context, uh, so like

02:45:56.950 --> 02:46:01.250
yesterday, I got to know that I am laid off and, uh, I have

02:46:01.250 --> 02:46:04.290
just over three months of experience. I have just passed out

02:46:04.290 --> 02:46:09.490
from the college. I have, uh, some experience with mon stack

02:46:09.490 --> 02:46:14.490
development. Okay. So I need some guidance, uh, from you,

02:46:14.570 --> 02:46:19.490
like how I can approach like coming one or two months, uh,

02:46:19.550 --> 02:46:22.270
in order to get a better package or a better opportunity

02:46:22.270 --> 02:46:23.750
using this.

02:46:26.760 --> 02:46:29.260
Sorry. Can you please repeat once again, some, uh, like, uh,

02:46:29.460 --> 02:46:32.540
I was not able to get your entire point last last two, three

02:46:32.540 --> 02:46:38.080
lines. Uh, like I have, uh, some experience in mon stack

02:46:38.080 --> 02:46:42.300
and, uh, mobile application development. So how can I

02:46:42.300 --> 02:46:44.740
integrate that? How can I integrate this generative AI, uh,

02:46:44.860 --> 02:46:48.300
along with my, uh, current skillset in order to get

02:46:48.300 --> 02:46:51.060
Converting, converting anything into a real time application

02:46:51.060 --> 02:46:54.840
requires a final user interface. And I believe if you are

02:46:54.840 --> 02:46:57.680
coming from that background, it's a very big plus point,

02:46:57.820 --> 02:46:59.980
right? It's a very big plus point because you are aware

02:46:59.980 --> 02:47:01.880
about the wire app development. You are aware about the

02:47:01.880 --> 02:47:05.660
complete like a UI development. So just like I said, like I

02:47:05.660 --> 02:47:08.300
have already like, uh, told you, right? So sit tight for

02:47:08.300 --> 02:47:11.300
next one month. Or I think it is not going to take one month

02:47:11.300 --> 02:47:14.260
for you because you are already aware of the Just try to

02:47:14.260 --> 02:47:17.120
convert this application into a beautiful app. Keep on

02:47:17.120 --> 02:47:19.860
sending me like, keep on updating me inside a group as well

02:47:19.860 --> 02:47:22.080
so that we all can see, we all can like, uh, give you a

02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:26.480
feedback, build up best off user interface, build up best

02:47:26.480 --> 02:47:29.500
off like, uh, you know, small, small, uh, features inside

02:47:29.500 --> 02:47:32.920
this one, and then start circulating it from today onwards

02:47:32.920 --> 02:47:36.120
over our GitHub and our overall LinkedIn continuously,

02:47:36.480 --> 02:47:39.340
right? Continuously, I start doing it without any kind of a

02:47:39.340 --> 02:47:43.080
stoppage in every day, maybe two, right? Do it. And then let

02:47:43.080 --> 02:47:45.500
me know. Then I'll guide you for the next step. Do it for

02:47:45.500 --> 02:47:50.940
next 15 days at least. Okay. Got it. Yeah. And then keep on

02:47:50.940 --> 02:47:53.420
posting inside the group. I want like everyone to be active

02:47:53.420 --> 02:47:56.540
inside the group and as well as on a GitHub and LinkedIn,

02:47:56.660 --> 02:48:01.260
two places at least. Okay. Got it. Yeah. Show me, show me

02:48:01.260 --> 02:48:03.600
something better. Something big, something good while our

02:48:03.600 --> 02:48:08.240
web application at least. Okay. Yeah. Got it. Got it. And

02:48:08.240 --> 02:48:11.800
then maybe like, uh, we can work together. Okay. That's it.

02:48:11.800 --> 02:48:15.140
There is a chance. Right. Let's, let's see your skill in our

02:48:15.140 --> 02:48:18.800
file and the web and that too, with respect to this AI.

02:48:19.560 --> 02:48:26.820
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Fine. Next one is just, I'll call out the

02:48:26.820 --> 02:48:30.700
name. Yeah. Vinton. Go ahead. Yeah. Hi sir. Sorry. My PC, I

02:48:30.700 --> 02:48:33.580
don't have the name registered with it. This is because of a

02:48:33.580 --> 02:48:39.440
windows key. Yeah. Myself. I think last time when during the

02:48:39.440 --> 02:48:41.440
interview bootcamp, I spoke to you, right? You remember sir?

02:48:41.500 --> 02:48:45.700
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. On the next day I took this rag example

02:48:45.700 --> 02:48:49.380
and, uh, what they wanted to, uh, looking for is like, uh,

02:48:49.900 --> 02:48:52.920
to build a chat bot, uh, kind of thing for the internal, we

02:48:52.920 --> 02:48:57.100
have a kind of internal, I mean, uh, like w they call it a

02:48:57.100 --> 02:49:00.560
village. So where we post the internal team documents and

02:49:00.560 --> 02:49:03.660
all. So whoever application team comes all like me direct to

02:49:03.660 --> 02:49:06.300
that, like whatever related to Kubernetes and all. So like,

02:49:06.400 --> 02:49:10.800
uh, and after like we, uh, I actually, uh, I mean, we, uh,

02:49:10.880 --> 02:49:13.200
like, uh, went, went, went through the chat GPT and search

02:49:13.200 --> 02:49:16.480
for, uh, like what, what could be the solution and all. So

02:49:16.480 --> 02:49:19.660
the thing is like the migrating to confluence. So from

02:49:19.660 --> 02:49:22.380
confluence, like, uh, what I thought is like, uh, with the

02:49:22.380 --> 02:49:26.520
curiosity and excitement, uh, I created a like architecture

02:49:26.520 --> 02:49:29.260
diagram, like hosting, okay. Since I'm from AKS. Thank you.

02:49:29.460 --> 02:49:32.040
You went into the background. I thought to host, uh, there

02:49:32.040 --> 02:49:34.440
is a, there seems to be a solution, uh, hosting the Chroma

02:49:34.440 --> 02:49:38.840
DB as a microservice and, uh, okay. Some solution I found

02:49:38.840 --> 02:49:41.640
out, like it could read, uh, through exploit.

02:49:44.180 --> 02:49:48.500
So I'm just like with the rag example that you told, that's

02:49:48.500 --> 02:49:50.860
only, that's the knowledge I have. This I found out that,

02:49:50.920 --> 02:49:53.240
but later with the exact, my excitement got disappointed

02:49:53.240 --> 02:49:56.080
saying that like, there is a team already, which has already

02:49:56.080 --> 02:49:59.100
across the organization they have implemented. Uh, I mean,

02:49:59.100 --> 02:50:02.760
uh, uh, once you approach, like, uh, we need to give our use

02:50:02.760 --> 02:50:06.040
case and all. So based on that, they'll provision the chart

02:50:06.040 --> 02:50:08.260
board itself for us. So things are already been automated

02:50:08.260 --> 02:50:11.200
and been provisioned. So I don't have a chance to provision

02:50:11.200 --> 02:50:14.540
vector. DB and all like, uh, from scratch. So they, they

02:50:14.540 --> 02:50:17.340
will assign a chart board for us. So when, um, based on

02:50:17.340 --> 02:50:20.780
that, we're like, they will give an API as well with the

02:50:20.780 --> 02:50:24.060
unique client idea and, uh, uh, group ID with the team. So

02:50:24.060 --> 02:50:27.780
you need to just, uh, I think there are agents and also

02:50:27.780 --> 02:50:32.740
inside that, uh, API itself. Uh, yeah. So that's where I was

02:50:32.740 --> 02:50:35.260
a bit disappointed. I thought I will get a chance to end

02:50:35.260 --> 02:50:39.300
implement from end to end. Uh, yeah. And, uh, so yeah. Do it

02:50:39.300 --> 02:50:41.860
by yourself then. Do it by yourself. Simple. Build something

02:50:41.860 --> 02:50:45.140
better. Yeah. I thought like, at least in the, not in the

02:50:45.140 --> 02:50:47.900
organization, maybe personally, I can exactly. Yeah. So see

02:50:47.900 --> 02:50:52.240
at the end of the day, uh, organization is fine, but you are

02:50:52.240 --> 02:50:54.180
looking for, you're working for your own personal growth,

02:50:54.320 --> 02:50:56.920
right? So if, if organization is not going to give you a

02:50:56.920 --> 02:50:58.920
benefit, obviously you will not be a part of our nation next

02:50:58.920 --> 02:51:02.660
year or maybe next two months itself. Right. So build it,

02:51:02.660 --> 02:51:07.820
build it for yourself. Simple. I mean, it's a, I mean, a

02:51:07.820 --> 02:51:10.080
product based company. So things are like bit more

02:51:10.080 --> 02:51:13.600
automated. Yeah. And look, uh, it's like, uh, a bit like,

02:51:13.700 --> 02:51:16.800
uh, obviously it will be a structured, right? So you can't

02:51:16.800 --> 02:51:20.540
like jump into some development directly. Exactly. Like we

02:51:20.540 --> 02:51:23.740
don't get the chance from scratch to build everything. Yes.

02:51:23.780 --> 02:51:26.440
Yeah. But you can, you can build it for your own. I think it

02:51:26.440 --> 02:51:28.640
will be a very good experience when you, and along with

02:51:28.640 --> 02:51:31.040
maybe a couple of people are able to build some product. We

02:51:31.040 --> 02:51:33.840
have like a, so many people inside the group, right? Maybe

02:51:33.840 --> 02:51:37.460
you can try to like, uh, do some sort of a bonding with some

02:51:37.460 --> 02:51:40.420
other team member if you want. Or maybe. Maybe even from

02:51:40.420 --> 02:51:43.200
your company, like if someone is available, you can try to

02:51:43.200 --> 02:51:46.120
like, or maybe you can go alone. Whatever. Yes. Right.

02:51:46.580 --> 02:51:48.780
Because like, uh, with the background of these things, I'm

02:51:48.780 --> 02:51:51.280
just like, uh, the class of these classes hold, uh, they

02:51:51.280 --> 02:51:53.400
don't have any background of these concepts as well as

02:51:53.400 --> 02:51:56.800
whatever you're telling in the class. I'm just keeping in

02:51:56.800 --> 02:51:59.600
the system and trying to do these things. So like with the

02:51:59.600 --> 02:52:03.200
last class of the rag bar, I chat about thing. So I'm able

02:52:03.200 --> 02:52:05.660
to relate what you told today. Uh, completely. Uh, yeah.

02:52:05.680 --> 02:52:08.560
With the things, uh, it would look clumsy now. But yeah.

02:52:09.460 --> 02:52:12.260
Completely. And, uh, with, uh, some practice, yeah, I'm able

02:52:12.260 --> 02:52:15.340
to figure out, uh, uh, I'm confident about it. Exactly.

02:52:15.520 --> 02:52:18.840
Exactly. And with the only thing is I'm able to understand

02:52:18.840 --> 02:52:21.880
this, uh, backend thing, sir, but, uh, with, uh, I mean,

02:52:21.940 --> 02:52:24.580
friend and things like, uh, is it, we need to have an opera

02:52:24.580 --> 02:52:27.360
strong knowledge on this? Not at all. Not at all. Just do a

02:52:27.360 --> 02:52:30.680
vibe coding. Yeah. Just do a vibe coding and then front end,

02:52:30.700 --> 02:52:33.140
it will be able to generate even better than the front end,

02:52:33.200 --> 02:52:35.540
which I have generated maybe in the next upcoming relations,

02:52:35.820 --> 02:52:40.000
I will show you even a very impressive front end. Right. The

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:42.140
way we have designed the front end for your own and URI and

02:52:42.140 --> 02:52:45.060
all those things, right. A luxurious one. So funded is

02:52:45.060 --> 02:52:47.960
nothing. It can be done like a easily. Okay. Okay. Yeah.

02:52:48.020 --> 02:52:50.920
Sure. And, and, uh, my like, uh, with respect to this

02:52:50.920 --> 02:52:54.060
service, like, uh, if you have built these things and maybe

02:52:54.060 --> 02:52:57.400
took a domain and map with these things. So like, if we can,

02:52:57.500 --> 02:52:59.780
we keep this whole service hold and up and running, because

02:52:59.780 --> 02:53:02.520
I think this could be a spot instances, right? So maybe the,

02:53:02.520 --> 02:53:04.800
anytime they could take us from a, does the reason maybe

02:53:04.800 --> 02:53:09.260
they are giving us for cheap, right? Yeah. This. These are

02:53:09.260 --> 02:53:12.440
these instances, right? Hmm. Yes. Hmm. Yeah. So you can, you

02:53:12.440 --> 02:53:14.400
can, you can keep it up and running for the very, very long

02:53:14.400 --> 02:53:18.960
time. And, uh, yeah, so that is possible. Won't they be

02:53:18.960 --> 02:53:22.860
taken away because no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

02:53:22.860 --> 02:53:24.580
no, no, no, no, no, It will, it won't be taken away. It's IP

02:53:24.580 --> 02:53:26.840
address is not going to change by the way. Okay. Okay. Okay.

02:53:26.840 --> 02:53:29.540
Because since the spot instances, like I heard, like, uh,

02:53:29.800 --> 02:53:31.820
they will cloud vendors will be taking whenever they want

02:53:31.820 --> 02:53:36.100
and, uh, no, no, no, no. Okay. Okay. Yeah. These are the

02:53:36.100 --> 02:53:38.820
dedicated ones that they are giving you. Sure. Like, uh,

02:53:38.880 --> 02:53:41.600
yeah, I'll, uh, because my team, like who are my managers,

02:53:41.640 --> 02:53:44.560
they're like, they're kind of good people only luckily. So

02:53:44.560 --> 02:53:48.280
maybe I thought to tell them about what I'm gaming, like

02:53:48.280 --> 02:53:50.380
attending the training and all, but okay. I thought like

02:53:50.380 --> 02:53:52.740
sold for some time and learn something and show after

02:53:52.740 --> 02:53:55.220
building a thought to sort. Yeah. Show them, show them. And

02:53:55.220 --> 02:53:57.640
then they don't have to tell anything. They will do it. They

02:53:57.640 --> 02:54:00.740
will, they will come and ask you. Yes. Yes, sir. Thank you.

02:54:00.760 --> 02:54:05.140
Thank you so much. Thanks. Go ahead, please. Yeah. Yeah. So

02:54:05.140 --> 02:54:09.780
this medical jet that we have created where we are using,

02:54:09.920 --> 02:54:16.500
uh, chroma DB API key models posting S3 email services. So

02:54:16.500 --> 02:54:20.020
what would be the approximately cost for these, for any

02:54:20.020 --> 02:54:23.940
organization for an entire year or a month? We see. We see

02:54:23.940 --> 02:54:28.300
cost depends upon, uh, like, uh, the number of, uh, users

02:54:28.300 --> 02:54:33.160
again in this situation. So see, uh, cost calculation is

02:54:33.160 --> 02:54:36.340
going to be very, very simple. So if I'm like, uh, just

02:54:36.340 --> 02:54:39.900
having a hundreds of users. So in that situation I can do a

02:54:39.900 --> 02:54:46.700
math. So 1.5, let me share my screen. So cost calculation,

02:54:46.960 --> 02:54:48.200
uh,

02:54:51.120 --> 02:54:55.060
calculator approximate

02:54:55.060 --> 02:55:01.660
cost calculation. So 1.5, 1.5 into two instances, let's

02:55:01.660 --> 02:55:07.060
suppose I'm hosting into like, uh, uh, 24. So for one day

02:55:07.060 --> 02:55:12.720
into 30, so basically for a month. So into 365, I can say,

02:55:12.820 --> 02:55:15.760
so this is basically these many dollars, everything is in

02:55:15.760 --> 02:55:17.940
dollar by the way. So, because I have multiplied with $105,

02:55:18.100 --> 02:55:23.760
so $26,280 for a entire year for two machine one, one. So

02:55:23.760 --> 02:55:27.280
two H 100 basically. Right. If I will be having one, so the

02:55:27.280 --> 02:55:32.340
cost will be half and then, uh, almost a similar or even

02:55:32.340 --> 02:55:36.060
less than that, like, uh, per month, you can say, uh, you

02:55:36.060 --> 02:55:40.240
will end up getting hardly a hundred dollars of cost or $150

02:55:40.240 --> 02:55:45.460
of cost for AWS for a hundred user. So it will be

02:55:45.460 --> 02:55:51.360
approximately 26,000 plus maybe at 2000, uh, 28, or maybe

02:55:51.360 --> 02:55:56.640
back to my $30,000 for like, uh, uh. You know, this, this

02:55:56.640 --> 02:55:59.920
entire system, which, which can even take a load of not a

02:55:59.920 --> 02:56:03.160
hundred people, I would say throughout the year. So even

02:56:03.160 --> 02:56:06.860
like a thousand people can hit on a regular basis, right.

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.560
That is approximate cost. If number of users are going to

02:56:09.560 --> 02:56:11.920
increase. So obviously like, uh, the cost is going to be

02:56:11.920 --> 02:56:15.220
constant or cost will increase, but by fraction. So let's

02:56:15.220 --> 02:56:16.980
suppose I'm going to spend two machine, three machines,

02:56:17.020 --> 02:56:19.200
something like that. So cause we've been increasing by

02:56:19.200 --> 02:56:22.980
fraction, but yeah, so, uh, it is like a going to give you a

02:56:22.980 --> 02:56:26.200
lot of benefit. But yeah, this is the approximate cost. $28

02:56:26.200 --> 02:56:34.080
,000, $30,000. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. Next one.

02:56:37.920 --> 02:56:41.740
Today, whatever you have showed us, right. So end to end,

02:56:41.780 --> 02:56:48.080
can we deploy into AWS, including your, uh, the GUI,

02:56:48.080 --> 02:56:50.760
whatever you suggested? Yeah. Yeah. So obviously I was

02:56:50.760 --> 02:56:53.100
planning to deploy. I was even, I have already tested it,

02:56:53.160 --> 02:56:56.200
but, uh, because of time constraints. So today I have not

02:56:56.200 --> 02:56:57.200
shown this one. So, uh, so, uh, so, uh, so, uh, so, uh, so,

02:56:57.200 --> 02:56:58.020
uh, so, uh, so, uh, so, uh, so, uh, so, uh, so maybe in our

02:56:58.020 --> 02:57:00.480
future. So with some other apps, I'll show it to you. So

02:57:00.480 --> 02:57:03.520
I'll try to show you ECR app runner, all this real-time

02:57:03.520 --> 02:57:08.600
deployment. Yeah. Even domain mapping. It's, it's easy. It's

02:57:08.600 --> 02:57:11.340
just a one single, uh, two or three, a step more. I have to

02:57:11.340 --> 02:57:14.560
like a take from here, right. In terms of configuration. And

02:57:14.560 --> 02:57:17.040
then eventually I will be able to deploy it, but it will

02:57:17.040 --> 02:57:19.780
like, uh, take time, maybe one, one and a half hour for me

02:57:19.780 --> 02:57:23.580
to explain it to class. Okay. And whatever you have deployed

02:57:23.580 --> 02:57:26.320
today. Right. So cost wise, if we compare with the AWS.

02:57:26.540 --> 02:57:28.920
Yeah. This one will be lesser, right? Like two days

02:57:28.920 --> 02:57:32.160
deployment or actually this one is lesser. So as come, so if

02:57:32.160 --> 02:57:36.300
we are trying to go ahead with the GPU from AWS, right. So

02:57:36.300 --> 02:57:38.980
in that case, I think you will have to check the price, but

02:57:38.980 --> 02:57:42.040
I believe it will be costlier. It will be costlier as per

02:57:42.040 --> 02:57:46.720
this one. Okay. Understood. But there we have option, right?

02:57:46.820 --> 02:57:51.460
We can create the EC2 instance and whenever it's, uh, it's

02:57:51.460 --> 02:57:54.180
not, uh, it's not getting any request, right? Automatically

02:57:54.180 --> 02:57:57.740
it can go in ideal. Minimum instance. You have to keep it up

02:57:57.740 --> 02:58:00.360
and running. It's not like, uh, so see when we go ahead with

02:58:00.360 --> 02:58:04.140
the scaling. So obviously on auto scale, the machine, which

02:58:04.140 --> 02:58:06.760
it is going to spin, you can try to put only those machine

02:58:06.760 --> 02:58:08.760
on auto scale, but where minimum machine will be up and

02:58:08.760 --> 02:58:10.640
running, right? Minimum one, one machine will up and

02:58:10.640 --> 02:58:14.500
running. Right. Right. Right. So for that, AWS will charge

02:58:14.500 --> 02:58:20.540
you continuously 24 by seven it's paper use, but after bare

02:58:20.540 --> 02:58:24.780
minimum. Got it. Right. So you can launch EC2. Right. Yeah.

02:58:24.780 --> 02:58:28.760
At least one instance must be up and running. Understood.

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:34.500
Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So next

02:58:34.500 --> 02:58:39.960
question, guys. Maybe I can ask. Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead,

02:58:40.040 --> 02:58:45.320
please. Yeah. It's very interesting. So, uh, the, my

02:58:45.320 --> 02:58:50.560
question was also on the cost because I intend creating some

02:58:50.560 --> 02:58:55.200
products and, uh, now. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, the cost you have

02:58:55.200 --> 02:59:00.420
already explained that almost we are looking at $30,000 or

02:59:00.420 --> 02:59:06.300
if I want to take this risk, right? Not as a risk, if you

02:59:06.300 --> 02:59:08.980
are building a, see to build something, you don't have to

02:59:08.980 --> 02:59:11.860
risk your $30,000. So as soon as you will start getting some

02:59:11.860 --> 02:59:15.840
client then, because you will not like a $30,000 for an

02:59:15.840 --> 02:59:20.440
entire year, right? Let's suppose if it is taking $1,000,

02:59:20.580 --> 02:59:23.300
one and a half thousand dollars for me to build a final

02:59:23.300 --> 02:59:26.360
production, get application and that much money, you will be

02:59:26.360 --> 02:59:29.160
able to burn it in like next two months. Maybe. Right. Or

02:59:29.160 --> 02:59:31.620
maybe three months because 24 by seven, you will not write

02:59:31.620 --> 02:59:34.880
the code part number one. Right. Even you will go for a

02:59:34.880 --> 02:59:38.780
sleep. Right. So max to max, your machine will run for 10

02:59:38.780 --> 02:59:42.520
hour per day. Right. So try to like estimate the cost

02:59:42.520 --> 02:59:45.020
accordingly, like 10 hour per day. Let's suppose for two

02:59:45.020 --> 02:59:47.600
months, if I'm working on the product or even my team is

02:59:47.600 --> 02:59:49.660
working on my product, right. Same machine they will be

02:59:49.660 --> 02:59:53.000
using by the way. Yeah. So it will not be even a final

02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:54.580
product. It will be a fraction of cost. You will be able to

02:59:54.580 --> 02:59:56.740
build a product and now once you will be able to build the

02:59:56.740 --> 02:59:58.940
product, make it configurable. When someone is going to like

02:59:58.940 --> 03:00:02.340
a pay you a spin the machine, now you're getting payment,

03:00:02.500 --> 03:00:06.700
right? Yeah. Yeah. So then you can, yeah. Then they can use

03:00:06.700 --> 03:00:11.100
the machine. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Now I have a use case here.

03:00:11.240 --> 03:00:18.140
Hmm. And this use case is a law company. Uh, for example, a

03:00:18.140 --> 03:00:26.140
lawyer has a number of cases. Maybe. Yeah. Same, same. I

03:00:26.140 --> 03:00:28.500
have, I already talked about it. Right. So just, just pass

03:00:28.500 --> 03:00:32.500
all the document, do the RAG. Uh, I was going to teach you

03:00:32.500 --> 03:00:35.080
the, like a agents basically tried to attach some sort of a

03:00:35.080 --> 03:00:38.820
more intelligence with this one, not some sort of so many

03:00:38.820 --> 03:00:41.600
intelligence. Then it's done. It will be able to analyze the

03:00:41.600 --> 03:00:44.200
cases. It will be able to give you even the verdicts. It

03:00:44.200 --> 03:00:46.840
will be even like able to take all the reference from the

03:00:46.840 --> 03:00:49.600
past. What was the verdict which was given? What was the

03:00:49.600 --> 03:00:51.700
evidence which was presented? Everything. It will be able to

03:00:51.700 --> 03:00:54.040
do it. What was the cost? Uh, whatever is available in the

03:00:54.040 --> 03:00:56.820
public domain, whatever data that you are going to pass. So

03:00:56.820 --> 03:00:59.020
even with the millions of cases, it will be able to do the

03:00:59.020 --> 03:01:04.500
analysis. It's fine. Okay. Now here is, uh, uh, there are

03:01:04.500 --> 03:01:08.300
other things with this. Okay. Uh, whatever you are saying.

03:01:08.460 --> 03:01:12.840
Okay. That's there. But then in addition, so what we are

03:01:12.840 --> 03:01:20.360
looking is maybe prepare a case based upon what cases he

03:01:20.360 --> 03:01:26.220
already has. Plus, uh, go ahead and look into, uh, for

03:01:26.220 --> 03:01:30.160
example, Supreme court of the United States. Okay. Some of

03:01:30.160 --> 03:01:35.240
the information, which, uh, he may not have been, he may not

03:01:35.240 --> 03:01:39.020
aware, but, uh, but the similar cases may have been there.

03:01:39.480 --> 03:01:42.400
So this is where RIG comes into picture, right? This is what

03:01:42.400 --> 03:01:45.800
RIG does. So if you have adjusted some data into a vector DB

03:01:45.800 --> 03:01:48.320
or any other database data is available. If it is available,

03:01:48.480 --> 03:01:52.160
it will be able to understand it is aware about it. Okay.

03:01:52.160 --> 03:01:55.220
No, no, no. Okay. And RIG, I understand very well. Okay.

03:01:55.820 --> 03:02:01.020
What I am talking about is not RIG party, RIG, RIG, which he

03:02:01.020 --> 03:02:05.280
has already the cases which he has done it. Okay. So that

03:02:05.280 --> 03:02:10.020
will be part of RIG, but now there is some current just now,

03:02:10.020 --> 03:02:15.020
suppose, uh, uh, Supreme court has, uh, given verdict on

03:02:15.020 --> 03:02:19.380
something which he is not aware of. Okay. So now, but the

03:02:19.380 --> 03:02:23.560
case may be. So he will, so it will not be able to answer

03:02:23.560 --> 03:02:28.980
simple answer system. It's a system, right? Not a human. So

03:02:28.980 --> 03:02:31.400
if you are providing a data, it will be able to answer. If

03:02:31.400 --> 03:02:33.300
you're not able to provide the data, it will not be able to

03:02:33.300 --> 03:02:37.620
answer as simple as that. Okay. No. Okay. Maybe I'm not able

03:02:37.620 --> 03:02:41.540
to explain you. Uh, you can, you can ask LMS for the

03:02:41.540 --> 03:02:45.200
suggestions. That's okay. Right. I'm like, uh, in case of

03:02:45.200 --> 03:02:47.820
this medical, so I'm asking, uh, like a patient, the

03:02:47.820 --> 03:02:50.120
patient's history. So I'm asking for the station. LMS is

03:02:50.120 --> 03:02:52.800
able to give it to me. Right. So you can ask for the

03:02:52.800 --> 03:02:56.480
solution, but if system is not having a data, it will not be

03:02:56.480 --> 03:03:01.600
able to answer as simple as that. That is correct. But the

03:03:01.600 --> 03:03:06.680
case, which is there in Supreme court and case, I just, uh,

03:03:07.520 --> 03:03:10.940
uh, Supreme court has given the verdict. So, uh, so the

03:03:10.940 --> 03:03:17.820
question is that our, um, uh, our application need to look

03:03:17.820 --> 03:03:22.380
the information in other areas, like this Supreme court,

03:03:22.480 --> 03:03:27.560
because they have their own database. Okay. So obviously,

03:03:27.720 --> 03:03:29.920
sir, this is all about the giving a data, right?

03:03:29.940 --> 03:03:33.800
Integration. So technically you have to give a integration,

03:03:34.080 --> 03:03:37.480
right? If you are doing an integration, simply means that it

03:03:37.480 --> 03:03:39.760
is having a data access, then it will be able to answer

03:03:39.760 --> 03:03:44.720
again, same question, same answer. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay.

03:03:44.720 --> 03:03:48.460
But, but then, uh, but then we can create, uh, uh, prepare a

03:03:48.460 --> 03:03:50.780
case. Okay. That's going to be based on a template. Suppose

03:03:50.780 --> 03:03:54.340
we have a template like you showed one template here today.

03:03:54.600 --> 03:03:59.100
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So, so that can help, uh, the lawyer,

03:03:59.260 --> 03:04:04.400
uh, reduces work instead of instead of doing an

03:04:04.400 --> 03:04:07.520
investigation for hours and hours and days with a fraction

03:04:07.520 --> 03:04:11.700
of second, the whole investigation can be done right. Just

03:04:11.700 --> 03:04:13.720
within a fraction of a second. So with this kind of

03:04:13.720 --> 03:04:18.500
application, yeah, maybe I will look into that kind of a use

03:04:18.500 --> 03:04:25.000
case. and create some product along with others so I have

03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:28.640
not done any exercises of your work today and yesterday but

03:04:28.640 --> 03:04:33.000
I will do because I was just first wanted to see what you

03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:38.060
are trying to show and then go dig deeper into the AWS and

03:04:38.060 --> 03:04:46.400
because I intend using AWS okay okay next one is like Nares

03:04:46.400 --> 03:04:47.940
go ahead please yeah

03:04:50.950 --> 03:04:57.050
Asit go ahead yeah good morning there is two questions one

03:04:57.050 --> 03:05:02.750
is so for medical right what are the best state of the art

03:05:02.750 --> 03:05:09.870
LLMs that I can use see the best LLMs is obviously GPT and

03:05:09.870 --> 03:05:12.870
the Sonet that you can try to use or Gemini series or

03:05:12.870 --> 03:05:17.010
Mistral series there is nothing called specific to a medical

03:05:17.010 --> 03:05:20.750
basically so these are the general purpose LLMs which is

03:05:20.750 --> 03:05:23.750
having all the information all the knowledge of the entire

03:05:23.750 --> 03:05:27.010
world and again maybe tomorrow you will get something better

03:05:27.010 --> 03:05:29.750
but yeah as of now these are the things these are the models

03:05:29.750 --> 03:05:34.730
which is available on this planet in terms of LLMs now if

03:05:34.730 --> 03:05:37.310
you are looking for something specific then you have to

03:05:37.310 --> 03:05:40.210
collect the data and then you have to do a fine tuning okay

03:05:42.300 --> 03:05:48.360
and is the chroma db is enough to do in the production yes

03:05:48.360 --> 03:05:50.360
yes yeah chroma db is basically meant for production

03:05:50.360 --> 03:05:56.220
actually okay so and in chroma db once I process this 100

03:05:56.220 --> 03:06:01.620
documents so then next time when I I mean those data will be

03:06:01.620 --> 03:06:04.780
purchased right those data will be purchased this is what I

03:06:04.780 --> 03:06:06.900
have shown you right so without even like uploading a data

03:06:06.900 --> 03:06:09.780
from my local because last time I was uploading a data again

03:06:09.780 --> 03:06:11.780
and again right so let's suppose if I am running my

03:06:11.780 --> 03:06:14.320
application 10 times again again I was uploading my data but

03:06:14.320 --> 03:06:17.820
this time I have not even uploaded my data right so it's

03:06:17.820 --> 03:06:20.300
available into a chroma db I have started chatting with it

03:06:20.300 --> 03:06:22.520
this is a this is what user want right at the end of the day

03:06:22.520 --> 03:06:26.020
user don't want to like upload the data yeah today upload

03:06:26.020 --> 03:06:33.260
100 data next time again I got another 50 right so how

03:06:33.260 --> 03:06:36.940
incrementally I upgrade and I have to put some mechanisms to

03:06:36.940 --> 03:06:41.200
once those document process is moved to some archive

03:06:41.200 --> 03:06:45.260
something right yeah I am doing it like a S3 basically so I

03:06:45.260 --> 03:06:49.640
am storing it into S3 yeah that you showed to us my original

03:06:49.640 --> 03:06:53.280
document I am trying to store it into S3 right so you can

03:06:53.280 --> 03:06:58.640
say it's kind of an archival for me okay S3 cost will be

03:06:58.640 --> 03:07:01.700
very very less anyhow S3 doesn't charge you much how much

03:07:01.700 --> 03:07:05.400
Sudhanshu S3 doesn't charge you much by the way S3 cost is

03:07:05.400 --> 03:07:08.760
very very less if you are not doing much of like a transfer

03:07:08.760 --> 03:07:11.200
operation and working operation with S3 it is not going to

03:07:11.200 --> 03:07:14.240
charge you for a storage it's technically a storage right so

03:07:14.780 --> 03:07:17.960
storage anyhow charges are very less I am using that as a

03:07:17.960 --> 03:07:23.400
warehouse okay so here for the experiment we did only with

03:07:23.400 --> 03:07:27.940
the text data so think only if I get images or the kind of

03:07:27.940 --> 03:07:32.900
videos right so what are the in case of images so you can

03:07:32.900 --> 03:07:35.200
try to use a version transformer which can understand the

03:07:35.200 --> 03:07:38.300
images and then convert that into a text format and then you

03:07:38.300 --> 03:07:41.360
can try to store it that is way number one part number one

03:07:41.360 --> 03:07:44.100
part number two I can directly convert my images into a

03:07:44.100 --> 03:07:47.060
vector and then I can try to store it part number three

03:07:47.060 --> 03:07:50.160
let's suppose there is something like you know text which is

03:07:50.160 --> 03:07:52.520
available or number which is available and I would like to

03:07:52.520 --> 03:07:54.840
extract that and then I have to store it then in that case

03:07:54.840 --> 03:07:57.560
you have to call OCR optimal character recognition over

03:07:57.560 --> 03:08:01.280
there and then store it into a vector databases so depends

03:08:01.280 --> 03:08:05.240
upon the nature of the data even as a image you can try to

03:08:05.240 --> 03:08:08.440
store it as far as video is concerned so videos are nothing

03:08:08.440 --> 03:08:11.460
but it's a frame technically it's an image sequence of

03:08:11.460 --> 03:08:15.100
frames yeah technically it's images so again in the same way

03:08:15.100 --> 03:08:19.260
you can try to do a processing okay but for the time varying

03:08:19.260 --> 03:08:22.520
will be different images will be different obviously so you

03:08:22.520 --> 03:08:26.160
can try to do image embedding directly again you can try to

03:08:26.160 --> 03:08:28.340
use a vision transformer for that one that is already

03:08:28.340 --> 03:08:31.940
available a good one nowadays I would say for OCR purposes

03:08:31.940 --> 03:08:34.580
obviously you have to use maybe a pie tracer act or maybe a

03:08:34.580 --> 03:08:38.800
easy OCR or maybe a amazon like a OCR something you can you

03:08:38.800 --> 03:08:42.560
have to use it basically to extract the relevant data from

03:08:42.560 --> 03:08:47.300
the document so yeah depends upon the extraction basically

03:08:47.300 --> 03:08:50.840
but everything can be doable yeah so so thank you very much

03:08:50.840 --> 03:08:58.440
for the uh so I already have it created a few uh actual data

03:08:58.440 --> 03:09:00.960
sets so when I will make it ready I will show you actually

03:09:00.960 --> 03:09:08.280
yeah sure anytime yeah okay so uh Naresh yeah Naresh go

03:09:08.280 --> 03:09:14.280
ahead yeah so this multilingual is bit confusing do we need

03:09:14.280 --> 03:09:18.320
to upload documents in multiple language and ask

03:09:19.380 --> 03:09:22.240
multilingual means it understand the multiple languages

03:09:22.700 --> 03:09:27.700
technically and it will be able to convert those into a

03:09:27.700 --> 03:09:29.900
embedding so let's suppose if I'm trying to upload something

03:09:29.900 --> 03:09:33.960
in Hindi maybe Gujarati maybe Tamil or Telugu right so it is

03:09:33.960 --> 03:09:37.020
already been trained on those data set all those language

03:09:37.020 --> 03:09:40.360
data set right so it will be able to retain the semantics

03:09:40.360 --> 03:09:43.060
and semantics of those data and then it will try to convert

03:09:43.060 --> 03:09:46.640
the embeddings this is what let's say let's say if I my

03:09:46.640 --> 03:09:50.460
document is in English and I ask the question in Hindi lippy

03:09:50.860 --> 03:09:54.980
not in English still it is able to understand if it is able

03:09:54.980 --> 03:09:58.600
to understand what percentage any matrix is there like how

03:09:58.600 --> 03:10:01.500
much for every model so there will be another blue score you

03:10:01.500 --> 03:10:03.820
will be able to find out so you can just check with the

03:10:03.820 --> 03:10:06.400
models that how much language understanding it will be

03:10:06.400 --> 03:10:09.020
having and language after one language comes another

03:10:09.020 --> 03:10:11.700
language conversion yeah so bluer score you will be able to

03:10:11.700 --> 03:10:19.720
find out bilingual conversion and its matrixes okay and my

03:10:19.720 --> 03:10:23.560
this is not a question it is a suggestion from now onwards

03:10:23.560 --> 03:10:28.740
since we need to run multiple VMs right one or two VMs for

03:10:28.740 --> 03:10:32.160
practice no not at all like you can use URI practice

03:10:32.160 --> 03:10:35.180
practice this kind of systems we need one for embedding

03:10:35.180 --> 03:10:39.040
model and one for of course we can use URI we will be using

03:10:39.040 --> 03:10:41.340
URI basically we will be using this is something which I

03:10:41.340 --> 03:10:45.840
have shown you now we will be using fallback to URI sure

03:10:45.840 --> 03:10:49.740
sure thank you because I don't want to you know burn three

03:10:49.740 --> 03:10:51.660
dollar four dollar every year yeah that's what my concern

03:10:51.660 --> 03:10:54.800
was if that is the case we can group up the people and you

03:10:54.800 --> 03:10:58.740
know I just I just wanted to show you that okay so you can

03:10:58.740 --> 03:11:01.740
use URI but yeah this is something which you should do in

03:11:01.740 --> 03:11:04.720
real like whenever there is a security concern or you are

03:11:04.720 --> 03:11:07.200
building some of your own product now we all are able to

03:11:07.200 --> 03:11:10.820
understand that part right I am able to understand the game

03:11:10.820 --> 03:11:14.360
so if I want to consume more than one lakh tokens I will

03:11:14.360 --> 03:11:17.180
group up the people and make the system up and then I can

03:11:17.180 --> 03:11:20.220
use a number of tokens exactly yeah that that was something

03:11:20.220 --> 03:11:22.100
which I was trying to explain that if you have one million

03:11:22.100 --> 03:11:25.900
data so obviously URI you will not be able to use if you are

03:11:25.900 --> 03:11:29.580
using OpenAI token again you have to pay bomb of money right

03:11:29.580 --> 03:11:33.260
or any other token so do what spin the machine and then do

03:11:33.260 --> 03:11:38.640
the work close the machine and then simple right that that

03:11:38.640 --> 03:11:40.640
was the whole that was that was the whole purpose behind

03:11:40.640 --> 03:11:46.460
showing you this one yeah yeah yeah Gala go ahead with your

03:11:46.460 --> 03:11:50.640
question I should answer sir yeah go ahead please sir I have

03:11:50.640 --> 03:11:54.100
a use case can you please suggestion for that there is a

03:11:54.100 --> 03:11:59.040
marriage bureau I want build the chat but how I can how I

03:11:59.040 --> 03:12:04.360
can proceed with this RAC system sir so what marriage bureau

03:12:04.360 --> 03:12:08.140
is trying to achieve by the way they are like they are what

03:12:08.140 --> 03:12:10.440
is the use cases that you are trying to achieve actually

03:12:10.440 --> 03:12:15.200
they don't know they want some sometime they have use data

03:12:15.200 --> 03:12:21.000
right okay they want get the data from by data birth okay

03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:25.640
depends on the designations like doctors these kind of use

03:12:25.640 --> 03:12:29.240
cases they want okay immediately they want get the data

03:12:29.240 --> 03:12:34.960
these kind of matches okay okay okay let's say doctor they

03:12:34.960 --> 03:12:38.640
want doctors match with the doctors only let's say doctors

03:12:38.640 --> 03:12:42.200
match with okay got it got it got it got it got it yeah so

03:12:42.200 --> 03:12:45.120
that can be done so basically a marriage bureau basically

03:12:45.120 --> 03:12:48.840
where anyone can come and anyone can basically search bride

03:12:48.840 --> 03:12:52.600
and grooms yes yes like a require based on chat and

03:12:52.600 --> 03:12:55.420
requirement right yes that's literally an amazing use case

03:12:55.420 --> 03:13:01.560
see sadhi.com founder is sitting in a sack tank right yes so

03:13:01.560 --> 03:13:04.640
this is this is just going to be the amazing use cases

03:13:04.640 --> 03:13:07.680
because see everyone has to just upload some document or

03:13:07.680 --> 03:13:11.460
maybe chat and then send the data from user side right from

03:13:11.460 --> 03:13:14.360
let's suppose someone's daughter or maybe someone's like a

03:13:14.360 --> 03:13:18.000
son and they are like looking for a bride and grooms they

03:13:18.000 --> 03:13:21.920
can just come and there upload the data simply like maybe

03:13:21.920 --> 03:13:24.240
just by chatting they can upload the data and maybe just by

03:13:24.240 --> 03:13:26.920
one document upload they can upload the data and then other

03:13:26.920 --> 03:13:30.180
person will come right who is searching for bride and grooms

03:13:30.180 --> 03:13:34.780
they can just chat and again search yeah right one more i

03:13:34.780 --> 03:13:38.380
want return back to the image also let's say they want yeah

03:13:38.380 --> 03:13:41.720
yeah obviously obviously see even images so see what what

03:13:41.720 --> 03:13:44.500
you can do over here so you can you can try to create two

03:13:44.500 --> 03:13:47.500
parallel process so one process so where try to keep some

03:13:47.500 --> 03:13:50.640
structured data okay the user will give unstructured data

03:13:50.640 --> 03:13:53.420
also the time so let's suppose from a document i'm trying to

03:13:53.420 --> 03:13:56.800
extract maybe a age birth all those things uh like uh this

03:13:56.800 --> 03:14:01.340
one and then even images right so let's suppose if image is

03:14:01.340 --> 03:14:04.300
available if someone is uploading images that's okay if

03:14:04.300 --> 03:14:06.520
someone is not uploading their document itself there is a

03:14:06.520 --> 03:14:09.360
image i'll try to extract those image person image bride and

03:14:09.360 --> 03:14:11.760
grooms images and then i'll try to keep those images

03:14:11.760 --> 03:14:14.740
separately into a vector as well as into s3 right so

03:14:14.740 --> 03:14:18.780
basically i'm keeping image document into s3 and information

03:14:18.780 --> 03:14:21.940
even into a structured database and in formation even into a

03:14:21.940 --> 03:14:26.060
vector dv right now if anyone is going to search so anyhow i

03:14:26.060 --> 03:14:29.360
will be able to get the citation yes then source of the

03:14:29.360 --> 03:14:33.460
document i will be able to get it right in case of rsgs now

03:14:33.460 --> 03:14:36.500
with the reference of this citation i will even search into

03:14:36.500 --> 03:14:41.340
s3 i will even do a search into not not a vector dv vector

03:14:41.340 --> 03:14:43.660
dv is returning the citation i'll search into a structured

03:14:43.660 --> 03:14:46.600
database equal data or something yes i will be able to pull

03:14:46.600 --> 03:14:51.180
all the information at the end of the day i have to do a

03:14:51.180 --> 03:14:53.920
matching right maybe someone is going to upload the kundali

03:14:54.580 --> 03:14:59.660
yeah someone someone has not uploaded kundali let's suppose

03:14:59.660 --> 03:15:02.340
i have uploaded my kundali but someone has not uploaded my

03:15:02.340 --> 03:15:06.080
kundali nice but with the help of llms i can generate

03:15:06.080 --> 03:15:09.200
kundali easily because when you are uploading your document

03:15:09.200 --> 03:15:11.980
so you are uploading your birth date birth year timing and

03:15:11.980 --> 03:15:14.080
all those things and the three four things are required to

03:15:14.080 --> 03:15:17.220
generate a kundali right generally basically right generally

03:15:17.220 --> 03:15:20.760
so let's suppose for some of them kundali is not available

03:15:20.760 --> 03:15:24.100
for some kundali is available but still i will be able to do

03:15:24.100 --> 03:15:26.760
a matching even if both of these persons have not uploaded

03:15:26.760 --> 03:15:29.060
the kundali but still i will because this matters a lot

03:15:29.060 --> 03:15:32.240
right yes sir so i will not just match based on doctor or

03:15:32.240 --> 03:15:35.340
like a profession or something uh right or maybe a cast or

03:15:35.340 --> 03:15:38.600
something but i will also try to match it based on kundali

03:15:38.600 --> 03:15:41.960
so i'll give like a couple of more like usps to my user and

03:15:41.960 --> 03:15:45.500
charge it yes sir one more thing i want to add this is a

03:15:45.500 --> 03:15:47.700
very easy application but yeah it solves a real problem

03:15:47.700 --> 03:15:50.160
believe me all the application will solve the real problem

03:15:50.180 --> 03:15:54.280
yes sir so many so many brokers are facing this kind of

03:15:54.280 --> 03:16:00.720
issue fetching the data matching is very difficult just go

03:16:00.720 --> 03:16:04.420
to chat gpt try to put your uh date of birth your place of

03:16:04.420 --> 03:16:09.720
birth your uh this one uh timing of birth right and believe

03:16:09.720 --> 03:16:13.460
me just go and talk to any pandeyji and whatever conclusion

03:16:13.460 --> 03:16:16.040
that pandeyji will give you your chat gpt will give you

03:16:16.040 --> 03:16:19.720
better conclusion just let's try this out today right so

03:16:19.720 --> 03:16:20.980
this is how we are going to talk about how powerful your llm

03:16:20.980 --> 03:16:23.940
is because see it's all about this birth chat and

03:16:23.940 --> 03:16:27.760
calculation right uh so pandeyji is also doing the same

03:16:27.760 --> 03:16:30.180
thing there are enough data which is available lm has

03:16:30.180 --> 03:16:32.580
already been trained you can people can try this out go to

03:16:32.580 --> 03:16:35.120
publicity go to chat gpt now you can try this out today

03:16:35.120 --> 03:16:38.680
itself and then match that one so maybe you can ask about

03:16:38.680 --> 03:16:41.500
your financials your like you know family life friends life

03:16:41.500 --> 03:16:44.640
your love life your girlfriend boyfriend whatever right just

03:16:44.640 --> 03:16:47.100
just go ahead and ask and ask the same thing to pandeyji

03:16:47.820 --> 03:16:52.040
believe me you will love the chat gpt answer sir i have one

03:16:52.040 --> 03:16:57.480
more question yeah i want to wise uh wise uh why is our kind

03:16:57.480 --> 03:17:00.840
of input prompt uh give to the disease case how i can do

03:17:00.840 --> 03:17:04.540
that voice prompt right yes yes i have already done that

03:17:04.540 --> 03:17:08.900
just go and check my uh this one uh uh previous batch for

03:17:08.900 --> 03:17:12.240
generative ai right i think i think i think last last week i

03:17:12.240 --> 03:17:14.700
have shown that application so where see it's it's actually

03:17:14.700 --> 03:17:17.860
nothing you don't have to even check that one so just try to

03:17:17.860 --> 03:17:21.040
search for speech to text and sts to space tts and like a

03:17:56.880 --> 03:17:59.020
those who are unmarried so by default they will use your app

03:17:59.020 --> 03:18:02.640
and you can you can charge charge them heavily right thank

03:18:02.640 --> 03:18:05.940

03:18:09.300 --> 03:18:12.100
astrology and with respect to this marriage right and again

03:18:12.100 --> 03:18:14.640
in marriage so india is a country so where we have so many

03:18:14.640 --> 03:18:17.740
like a religion and we have so many continent and like you

03:18:17.740 --> 03:18:22.840
know the state it's a lot of the data in itself and so a lot

03:18:22.840 --> 03:18:26.780
of scope believe me a lot of scope in india you will be able

03:18:26.780 --> 03:18:29.400
to find even outside india there is a lot of scope right in

03:18:29.400 --> 03:18:32.520
every country so but yeah in india so one state is equal to

03:18:32.520 --> 03:18:36.100
one country in europe some some states are even bigger than

03:18:36.100 --> 03:18:41.360
that so basically a lot of like a scope that if you are able

03:18:41.360 --> 03:18:44.040
to build a beautiful ui interface which again you can do it

03:18:44.040 --> 03:18:48.900
with the white coding right then it will be bingo i think

03:18:48.900 --> 03:18:51.500

required. That is fine. Uh, it, it should work. Client

03:24:23.630 --> 03:24:26.130
simply means that it is not able to find out the

03:24:28.010 --> 03:24:31.270
installation. Basically. That's a, that's the only issue

03:24:31.270 --> 03:24:34.770
with respect to the client. Okay. Just do one thing. Uh,

chroma. Run the previous command.

03:26:39.930 --> 03:26:47.390
Now install it. pip install chroma DV is equal to 0.4.1.8 or

03:26:49.540 --> 03:26:53.080
maybe okay let's let's try this because this is the only

03:26:53.080 --> 03:26:59.760
issue which I can see with this 0.4.1.8 yeah equal

03:27:04.300 --> 03:27:05.540
equal to run

03:27:14.440 --> 03:27:14.920
the app now

03:27:26.080 --> 03:27:31.200
process just just wanted to even list it process it yeah

03:27:31.200 --> 03:27:33.360
directly now show me the console.

03:27:43.000 --> 03:27:47.480
No, it is not able to find the cloud client. Just do one

03:27:47.480 --> 03:27:49.400
thing. Go to chroma copy

03:27:53.300 --> 03:27:57.620
the client copy the client code all three four line yeah

03:27:57.620 --> 03:27:59.200
this one copy

03:28:01.860 --> 03:28:06.890
it and then like a test it does this code in the same

03:28:06.890 --> 03:28:08.390
environment yeah

03:28:10.530 --> 03:28:13.010
click on this IP only file Medichat right environment is

03:28:13.010 --> 03:28:16.810
same right okay fine then test it now

03:28:22.120 --> 03:28:29.300
this is the issue he missed the 5 at the end 5 he has just

03:28:29.300 --> 03:28:33.440
copied right he has just copied everything as it is. there

03:28:33.440 --> 03:28:35.340
is a five see yeah

03:28:38.160 --> 03:28:40.520
so it is not able to understand the installations i'll tell

03:28:40.520 --> 03:28:42.380
you right the client issue is basically installation issue

03:28:42.380 --> 03:28:45.100
it's not a key issue it will otherwise it will give you

03:28:45.100 --> 03:28:50.400
authentication issue so um do one thing just create the new

03:28:50.400 --> 03:28:52.860
environment and run the requirement.txt i think because of

03:28:52.860 --> 03:28:56.000
cache it is not able to like a call it after the system

03:28:56.000 --> 03:28:59.220
started will be fixed but yeah just to avoid it create a new

03:28:59.220 --> 03:29:00.900
environment fresh new environment because this is the issue

03:29:00.900 --> 03:29:04.380
see uh in in a testing itself right so basically it is not

03:29:04.380 --> 03:29:09.760
able to connect everything is fine yeah just conduct create

03:29:09.760 --> 03:29:11.440
hyphen n okay

03:32:00.050 --> 03:32:03.410
so yeah i think it will work uh you can try this out and if

03:32:03.410 --> 03:32:05.750
you're facing any this is the only issue i don't see any

03:32:05.750 --> 03:32:08.930
