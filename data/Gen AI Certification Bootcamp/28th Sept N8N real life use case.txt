WEBVTT

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.950
Okay, so hi everyone. Good morning. Happy Sunday. I believe

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.510
I'm audible and visible to all of you, right guys. So just

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:18.170
bring me a snow if I'm audible or visible or not. Yeah, so

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.270
good morning. Good morning everyone. So by the way, just a

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.770
quick announcement for today. So today I'm not going to take

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.870
your class. Then you will say why you have started this

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.650
lecture then, right? If you're not going to take the class.

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:38.930
So today, basically your class will be taken care by your

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.450
batchmate, one of your batchmate. His name is Dhruv, by the

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:47.430
way, right? So he has shown me like yesterday night. So he

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.410
has shown me like a very, very amazing workflow and it was

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.610
literally impressive. Believe me, it was literally

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.190
impressive. If I'm going to show you a glimpse of it, I

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:01.690
think you all will be amazed by the kind of a work that he

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.850
is doing. Right? And basically he's a sales person. He's

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.550
working as a sales representative. I'm going to share his

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.850
LinkedIn ID as well with all of you, right? So that all of

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.350
you can check out his profile that what he does and like,

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:19.070
you know, so basically he's he's a sales lead. He's working

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.930
as a sales lead. He's like a quite experienced person and

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.690
the kind of a job that he has done with respect to anything.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:30.790
I think you all are able to see my screen, right? So this is

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.230
a kind of a workflow. And which really impresses anyone,

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.110
right? So if you look into this one for the very first time,

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.950
you will say, wow, I mean, like this is something real,

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:44.630
right? And it's working in a real time. So I thought that

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:48.190
that, okay, I was supposed to take your class because yeah,

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.870
it's my class, Sunday class, right? But I thought that,

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.830
okay, fine. So I think instead of like taking me a class, I

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.950
have already talked about a basic of anything. I'll take my

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:00.710
class next Saturday because I have to discuss a couple of

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:04.570
like automations with all of you. Like a working real time

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:06.930
automation, which you can use into a day to day life.

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.130
Yesterday, we have learned like a basic and I believe we all

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:12.890
are able to understand in it. And it's not tough to

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:16.130
understand, by the way, right? So today Dhruv is going to

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.950
take your class and he has prepared not just this. He told

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:20.830
me that he has prepared a couple of other things like

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.850
LinkedIn automation. So where you can try to schedule all

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:28.090
the posts on a LinkedIn and generate many more things,

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.090
right? Many more things he has he's like doing.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:33.510
He has a lot of things he's got to do and he's going to tell

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:35.470
you that in the next few minutes. So yeah. So let me invite

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:41.450
Dhruv. Let me make him as a panelist. So that you know

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:43.850
Dhruv, I'm just promoting as a panelist, you will be

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:49.630
rejoining. Yeah. So Dhruv is going to take your class. Dhruv

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.990
has joined and let me make him as a co-host. Yeah. Dhruv,

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:56.030
now you are a co-host Dhruv, you have, you

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:05.050
must have all the control. Make co-host. Yes. So. Here is

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:07.570
Dhruv, I think Dhruv is audible and visible. Yeah, Dhruv, so

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:11.910
you have all the control, just like me, right. So, please

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:16.190
welcome guys, Dhruv, and yes, like I said, so I had a plan

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.530
to take class, but after looking into this, like a glimpse

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:21.690
of this entire demo, I thought that I think I should not.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:25.550
Maybe, like, Dhruv is a better person, at least for today,

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:29.030
like, he can take class, because obviously we'll try to

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:34.170
learn a lot from him, and, yeah, so, it is going to be an

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.110
amazing experience for all of us, and if you are going to

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.310
prepare a project, at the end of today's class, I'm going to

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:43.150
give you a couple of tasks as well, with respect to Ennit,

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:47.290
and basically with respect to agentic AI, so you can try to

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:50.010
use Ennit, and or maybe some other tool, I don't care about

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.570
it, but yeah, so if you are going to complete it, so you are

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:55.390
welcome, you can come and you can try to discuss about it. A

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:59.270
task which I'm going to post it inside your group, which you

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.190
can try to complete. And it will be better if you can do it

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.710
with respect to Ennit, because it's easy to do it, right?

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:07.610
It's a configuration, so step by step, just break down the

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:10.370
problem statement, and then configure it, and then make it

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.210
working, and make it active, so that, like, it will be in a

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.150
production, by the way. So, yeah, I'll not say much. Dhruv,

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:19.090
over to you, and, yeah, the entire class is yours. I think

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:23.690
you are able to see, like, a chat as well, right? Yes, yes,

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.590
I can, I can see. I think I'm perfectly audible, right?

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:29.190
Yeah, you are perfectly audible. Your audio and video is

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.810
awesome, so, yeah. Okay, yeah, yeah, great, and, like, thank

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:35.490
you for giving me this opportunity. This is the first time

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:39.650
I'm in front of so many people, so this is really great, and

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:44.290
excitement also. So, it's sometimes I kind of hesitate, and

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:49.750
also just ignore. But, yeah, it's really good, and I am

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:53.970
feeling good. So, I think how I can start to, if you can

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:57.110
give me a little bit idea, but how I'm planning. Yeah, so,

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:00.090
first of all, yeah, first, okay, just to give you a little

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:01.190
bit of an idea, just to give you a glimpse of this, so,

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:03.710
first of all, let's start with, let's suppose you are

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:06.530
supposed to showcase maybe two or three, or, like, n number

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.570
of, basically, use cases, right? So, first of all, maybe you

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:11.730
can just talk about the use cases, that what you have

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:14.730
solved, what was the final objective of this one, and then

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:18.310
component by component, node by node, so, because, see, at

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:20.270
the end of the day, we are just supposed to know the

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.110
configuration of it, right? For example, if you have

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:25.890
corrected the telegram, so, we just know that, we just have

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.650
to know that, that, okay, fine, so, how you have created the

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:30.210
bot father, you must have created the bot father, and with

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:33.730
bot father, you must have corrected that. So, just that kind

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:36.890
of a context for every node, right? Then, okay, so, if for

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:38.950
telegram, you have to connect with the bot father, for,

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:40.990
like, a Gmail, if you are connecting, so, obviously, you

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:44.410
have to authenticate it, drive, again, it goes with the same

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:47.490
thing, right? If you have added, I can see some code, like,

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:50.530
a node as well, so, obviously, what kind of a code that you

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:53.250
have written over there, so, just a glimpse of it, and I

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:55.290
think we all are mature enough, we'll be able to get some

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:58.730
idea, and if you'll be having any kind of a doubt, so, we'll

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:03.090
fire back that question, and you'll... Okay, yeah, yeah, got

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:07.210
it, totally understand. Fine, so, just, I'll give a brief

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:11.050
idea of how I did it, then I'll start, okay? So, I started

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:14.130
two and three months ago, so, I have been into this for the

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:18.330
last five or six months. Last year, I also tried make.com

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.590
JPR, but those were just drag and drop, then I came up to

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:26.330
edit it. So, here, even currently, I do not have in-depth

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.510
coding knowledge and all, that's why I joined this

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:30.850
particular batch, so, I can enhance my... my in-depth

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:33.390
knowledge. So, how I did all these things? Of course, by

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:37.330
using some resources, some videos, some content. So,

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.630
basically, my whole idea is to create any kind of use cases.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:45.750
So, it can work in a real time, and now, how I'm doing, of

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:49.090
course, by using other tools, sometimes ChatGPT, sometimes,

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:51.710
you know, even I don't know how to write those JavaScript,

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:55.090
but yeah, I know how to fix it by using ChatGPT, that's how

00:12:55.090 --> 00:13:00.690
I have corrected all those things, okay? So, just let me

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:05.770
share my screen, I think. You have a permission, you have a

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:08.170
share permission. Yeah. I

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.980
hope so my screen is visible, right? Yes, yeah, it's

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:28.520
visible, yeah. Okay. So, and after discussing all these

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.500
things, then I have to think for also for the all the

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:35.640
audience, which can save them a lot of money also, because

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.340
that's how I have gone through, okay? Initially, I invested

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:43.500
a lot over anything, and then I have, now, I'm posting this

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:48.680
on Hostinger. Basically, it is a virtual place, which is

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:52.500
almost one-fifth of the cost of actual edit in. So, but

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:57.680
yeah, the interface is almost same. Yeah, so Dhruv, if you

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.340
can share all the working agent that you have, I can see

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:03.300
LinkedIn, Telegram, sub-agent, some lead agent, email follow

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:07.340
-up, and this lovable agent that you have created. So, yeah,

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.700
maybe like, you know, later stage, if you are ready, you can

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:14.260
share the JSON file, and I will, I will. Yes. Maybe you can,

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.440
in a group itself, you can drop it, and then in later stage,

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.780
I'll just upload it in a dashboard, so that, you know, in a

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:23.600
later stage also, people can access it. Perfectly fine,

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:27.600
perfectly fine. So, then let me start with Telegram, because

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.700
that's one of the something that is very easy right now,

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:35.560
without saying anything to anyone. We can simply integrate

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.240
by using these things. So, I'll start from here, and I'm

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:43.840
taking the use cases, of Google Banana, because that is, you

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.740
know, trending also, people are creating so many things. So,

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:52.200
basically, what it is, I have created this. So, what it

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:56.380
does, I'll just show you. Yeah, sorry to stop you last time,

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.400
right, just for the last time. So, basically, like Prasad is

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.820
asking you about your brief introduction, and I think

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.400
everyone would be interested to, like, know a little bit

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.260
about you, your background. I have already, let me, I will

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.580
share again your LinkedIn profile. So, even in my post, I'll

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.200
share the LinkedIn profile. But yeah, if you can, like, talk

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:18.120
about yourself a little bit, yeah. Yes, yes, I'll give you

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:22.620
an idea that people can relate. So, I have completed my

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.660
mechanical in 2020, and after that, I have been totally into

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:29.460
sales. When I say sales, hardcore sales. It means, I've

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:32.480
worked in Yajur, so I've worked from 8 to 11, kind of, that

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.460
kind of hours. But right now, I'm working in one of the

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.220
startups as a sales set. So, there I'm leading a team of

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:41.480
more than 20 people. That is also full-time work. But yeah,

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:44.600
because of interest and all, I'm doing work from home. I'm

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.640
getting more time now. So, I'm able to do all these things.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.100
This is just a kind of, you can say, side hustle or part

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:54.880
-time or kind of interest. So, which arises from the work

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.660
itself, because I'm into sales. So, my whole sole focus is

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:01.940
to saving company's time, company's money, and helping them

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:05.120
to generate leads and all, right, which I can later on, if

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.020
I'm able to generate kind of those solutions, so I can sell

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:09.800
it also. That was the main thing. That was the main purpose.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.360
So, I have gone through so many videos of like automation

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:17.620
and all. I'll suggest some channels also, right? So, that's

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:21.180
how I started. So, I built some real huge cases first.

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.440
Instead of doing so many things and learning so many other

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:28.780
things, I just focused on building real use cases, which can

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.540
really create an impact, because there are so many things in

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.240
AI that I have been doing last two, three years, since

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.800
ChatGPT came. Doing coding, doing these things, doing like

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.740
creating so many things, and I have created websites also

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:47.960
using AI only, hosting itself. So, instead of just doing all

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.040
those things now, I thought, let's create some impact also.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.480
So, it might be not today, but in future, I have something

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.620
that I can sell directly, and I ask company money, and they

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:00.720
will love to pay, because anyhow, I'm helping them to save

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.720
their money, time, and helping them to generate the revenue.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.960
So, this is the whole focus right now I'm doing. And of

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.820
course, later on, I just want to... make in-depth knowledge

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:14.100
in AI and machine learning. Right now, I do not have coding

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:18.620
knowledge. But yeah, if you give me a problem, I know how to

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:21.980
make it happen. Okay, so I don't know how to write a Python

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.800
code, but I can create a game or create any kind of

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.820
calculator, ROI calculator using Python, using ChatGPT or

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:33.420
any other AI tool. So, that kind of knowledge I have. So, I

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:36.820
have connected so many things over here. And if you see, if

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:41.140
you ask me to do, how you... So, if each and everything, of

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:44.300
course not, right? But yeah, I can tell you the logic behind

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:50.400
that, and I can tell you how you can do that, right? So,

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.020
it's been more than six months, three and six months, I have

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:55.500
been fully working on anything, because this is the kind of

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.160
platform which can enhance your in-depth knowledge also,

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.700
because I think Sudhanshu sir also told in this class as

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.420
well and other classes as well, because I have gone through

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:07.940
the overview videos. See, yeah, this is the kind of no-code,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.420
no-code tool, but not exactly too much no-code. You need to

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:16.800
correct so many HTTP requests, APIs and all. So, either you

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.260
have a lot of interest, you can sit a month and two months

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.120
like me, I sit, every single time you will be getting an

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.560
error, an error, then you have to search on GPT, you have to

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.900
go on YouTube and all and all. So, that's how I learned

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:30.580
basically, because no one was there who can tell me

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:35.120
directly, but I have idea right now. Then I learned so many

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:41.140
things. So, how I'm learning AI, just I'm totally focusing

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:45.320
on making an impact if I can. If I'm making with the help of

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:49.500
that, any impact, so I go into learning. If not, that is

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:53.660
fancy, so just I try to avoid. So, right now just I'm

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:59.420
working full on this, and on my full-time job. Even before

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:02.520
joining this class, I assigned lead to my sales reps also.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:06.300
So, that kind of job I am, but yeah, this is something

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.600
really interesting. And because it is, it is, it is, it is,

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:08.600
it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:08.600
is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is,

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:08.700
it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is. It

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.520
is creating a real-time impact. And about anything, this

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.680
will also have been in the market for more than like, I

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.980
think six, seven, eight years, 2020 to 2018, but now it's

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:20.660
even high, more and more high because we have more tools.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:28.840
We, it's easy to do that, right? So, yeah. I think everyone

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:33.020
got any, someone want to ask more, you guys can ask, it's

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:38.450
fine. So, I'm here, I'm here just from the learning

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:42.310
perspective. Right now, like, there is no such thing to get

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:45.090
a job and all. Of course, if I get a good salary package,

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:47.490
that I can think of later, but yeah, right now, just to

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:48.230
enhance my knowledge.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.280
Do I need to also answer this chat or I can just? Yeah, you

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.700
can start, you can start. We can, we can take up questions

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.820
in later stage, yeah. We can start with the use case that,

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:12.100
what we are trying to solve. Okay, fine. So, let's start

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:15.420
with this particular use case. So, this will tell you

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:19.040
exactly how to connect with Telegram because there are a lot

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.460
more use cases using Telegram. We all have Telegram in our

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:26.980
phone. So, we can use it as our personal own agent. It can

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:29.240
tell you about your events. It can tell you about your

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.440
emails. It can generate images, whatever you want it, from

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:39.000
your control. Okay, you do not need to go another platform

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.060
and all. So, just I'll tell you. So, if here you can see, I

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:46.060
have this connected trigger note. I think yesterday, Raghav

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:50.260
sir also told you, okay, whenever we are going to create any

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:54.640
kind of flow, we need a trigger, right? That works in each

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.360
and every case. And whether it is, whether it is a Telegram

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.780
or chat trigger or schedule trigger, whatever trigger, even

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.840
the way book also, whenever we need to create a connected

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:07.640
website, then we needed a kind of pay book and all. So,

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.500
that's how it works. Just I'll show you how it works live.

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:18.760
Then I'll explain one by one. So, right now you can see

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:23.320
here, just I generated two days. So, let me give it a

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.900
process. From let me

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:33.410
show you live as well. Right now it is live. So, it is on a

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:36.230
real time, but just I'll show you by executing how it works.

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:41.050
So, you all can relate. So,

00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:00.670
anything you can type, basically just I'm giving a prompt.

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:07.510
You can simply type in simple language also. Why? Because I

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:11.830
have added things over here. So, you can see. Once I execute

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:12.550
this workflow,

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:19.120
you can see it has took all the things. Now, if it was

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:22.700
voice, it has been gone over here, but it was just that one.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.940
Now, it is creating an image in this form. Okay. So, it is

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:29.020
generating a prompt right now. Once it is generated, it is

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:32.160
also creating a file name. Why? Because if I save in my

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:36.380
drive, so I can see. Now, it is creating exactly an image

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:41.020
using nano banana. And then I have connected to open router,

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:46.860
API again. Also, HTTP request. It's created and it did. Now,

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:53.640
I received the photo also over here. You can see. Right? So,

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.300
like that, you can generate image, you can share, you can

00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:00.980
ask any kind of questions. And the best part over here, if

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:07.640
you can see, it's also uploaded in my drive. If I just take

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:10.660
you to my drive over here. So,

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.500
just take you over here. So, I have created some file over

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:21.900
here. Folders. And, yeah.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:28.060
Image generated. So, all these files, whatever I am

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:31.020
creating, it is getting updated in my drive. In future

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:33.380
references, I can use. Okay.

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:39.720
Here, if you can see, this is the image that we have created

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.140
right now. Okay. You are able to see.

00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:53.750
And this is, we are using, you know, real time. I think,

00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:58.330
because we are doing everything in real time. There is no

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:04.270
back end. Just, and if I just show you my LinkedIn, the

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:06.850
sheet that I have connected to here, if you can see, I have

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:09.630
connected the sheet also. So, what it does,

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:19.330
here, you can see. Okay. Yeah. So, first of all, the prompt

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:22.850
that I generated through AI, I have written just in layman

00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:25.350
language, a simple English. This is that I know, right? But

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:28.430
it generated a great prompt. That prompt is also copy pasted

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:31.670
over here. So, for the future reference we can use. It is

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:35.770
giving the file name also. And it is giving, you can see,

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:38.990
the frame drive link. It is just copy pasting over here.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:43.090
How? Because I have connected. All right. So, now I think

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:46.810
you guys got to see how it works in a real time. And if you

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:49.510
want to work in a real time, just make it active. That's

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:53.690
all. Instead of inactive, once we live it, now we can,

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:58.630
whenever I ask anything inside the telegram, it will answer

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:05.270
automatically. Even if my laptop is dead. Right? So, that's

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:06.170
how things works.

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:15.650
Yeah. You again, of course, if you just type over the, so

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:21.470
let me show you also that, and you guys can get an idea.

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:25.810
Right now, I have made it live. Okay. So,

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:40.260
and then I'll just take you to see how you guys can do it.

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:44.160
And I'll also share the JSON file for the same, which you

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.580
can import directly inside your NATN.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.680
So right now it is live. And if you want to see in a real

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:57.280
time, how it works, you can see over here, execution tab.

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.020
You can see it's running. Right? I haven't did anything

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.280
because now it's time. It will trigger automatically.

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:23.490
So just taking time of course, because that's how it

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:30.310
succeeded. Okay. So let's see over here. Yeah. Can you got,

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:34.630
and the best part, this is super realistic. Right now, I'm

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:39.270
just paid a full. This is, this is chargeable. It costs

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:44.910
three and four rupees and 0.004 cents in, in dollars. But

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:48.230
this is super realistic. That chat GPT is charging somewhere

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:53.090
around 20 rupees. That is 0.4 or 0.5 cents something. Okay.

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:57.150
Because this is a nano banana updated version. So I think

00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:03.760
you guys got the how things works live. Right? So now let me

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:09.640
take you through step by step, how you guys can generate. So

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:13.600
yeah, someone is asking what is agenda today. So just, I'm

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:17.860
giving a brief, how you, how we can create an workload

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:22.680
inside the NITN. Yeah. Agenda for today is your mentor has

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.020
changed.

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:29.360
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Please go ahead. Yeah. With the node

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:39.260
explanation. Right. Right. Yes. So over here, we have to add

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:42.260
telegram node over here. Okay. Once we have added, so let me

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:46.680
explain to you how it works. So even before that, so over

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.660
here, if you can see, this is a,

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:59.040
okay. It listens all the incoming messages. All right. And

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:02.360
here, if you can see, I have added all these kind of

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.380
credentials. So this is one of the very major, important

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:07.660
thing, whatever you want to get it, you need to add a

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:11.260
credential. Okay. But the best part, once you have added,

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:15.740
this will work throughout your, all the, so it gets saved.

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.760
Okay. So for that, we need to click on create new

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:22.220
credentials. And this is the main thing that we need to

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:26.840
understand. It required access token and how we can get

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:33.800
that. So, let us again come to the telegram to get the

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.940
access token. Okay. The simple telegram that we already

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:41.580
using who are mobile to our laptop. Okay. You can use it on

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:46.640
a laptop also. So here you can see, I have bought father.

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:52.500
All right. So here, you guys can also start as a bot father.

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:57.280
Once you go here, just write anything. It will give you

00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:01.700
option. What do you want? I want to create a new bot. So

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:06.980
every single time we need to create a new bot. Uh, if you,

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:10.200
if you want something new, otherwise we can use old one

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.460
also. So new bot. All right. And you want, how are we going

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:16.060
to call it? Please choose a name for it. So now we can

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:19.640
choose a name. So let me choose Iran,

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:28.910
then AI bot. All right. So it will choose a name. Now it

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:32.950
needs a user name. So we must need to, to be, you know, uh,

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:39.690
kind of specific, like our IDs, Gmail IDs. And then at the

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:43.330
end, we have to add underscore bot. So this will create a

00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:48.330
link. Okay. Yeah. So now you can see, we got an access

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:53.070
token. This is all we needed. All right. This is all, all we

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:56.770
needed access token over here. We can sleep over here. It

00:29:56.770 --> 00:30:01.110
will be copy and pasted. Once this is done. So here, if you

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:06.370
can see it has also been, uh, yeah, it has also given a chat

00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:12.070
over here. So now I have new bot that I can chat and see.

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:16.610
Yeah. Can you see right now? Yeah. It, it won't respond

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:18.850
right now because it's not yet connected with any node or

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:20.870
something automation. So we need to make it happen.

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:27.940
So we'll go over here. Just, we have to copy and paste.

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:35.820
Simple. Name it, whatever, what you have created. So that's

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:39.880
how you will remember. Okay. How, how things happen. And

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:43.420
let's save it. So now you can see it. It's a green sign.

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:46.640
This is where you guys will be facing so many, so many

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:49.440
times. This was an all. If it is in red, it's not yet fixed.

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.540
Basically just, you have to check and you have to clarify,

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:55.480
but if it is connected, tested successfully, that's where it

00:30:55.480 --> 00:31:02.260
is done. All right. And every single listening is happening.

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:07.800
This happens once in a telegram. So we can not do 10 bots at

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:12.500
a time because there is only single channel, right, right

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:17.220
now, because we are not paying anything to telegram. It is

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:20.640
free of cost. That's why just a single channel later on we

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:27.620
can use. All right. So yeah, right now, if I say over here,

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:32.820
now, if I say hi, it will execute. So let me, instead of

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:33.380
doing this,

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:41.550
let me do something for you. So something new. Okay. Instead

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:44.270
of creating these so many things, how you can create

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:47.030
firstly, simple chat bot, then you can convert into the

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:50.550
agent. You can convert into the Gmail events and all that

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:54.330
image creator also. So gen AI.

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:04.050
All right. Yeah. So here, if you can see, I'm getting all

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:11.350
the options. Let me, yeah, it's now inactive. So once I

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:15.650
click on trigger, you can see right now, there is no

00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:22.790
message. Let me say now, hi, and you will see. Yeah, done

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:29.550
one item, but okay. So that's how it's, it's saying, okay,

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:35.130
uh, we received a request that we came from telegram. That's

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:40.850
what it is doing right now. All right, guys. So you might

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:44.890
know how to connect to your, you know, telegram bot, how to

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:51.080
create access token to bot father. Okay. Can you move next?

00:32:55.230 --> 00:33:00.050
Okay, great. Great. So let us create simple chat bot first.

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:02.950
That will excite you also. That will give you a little bit

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:06.290
more boost and confidence because doing these things, of

00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:08.850
course, I'll tell you how to do that, but let me give you an

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:12.630
idea of how you can create a simple agent using telegram

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:14.290
that you have created. So for example, I can connect to

00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:15.150
Instagram. I can connect to YouTube and all of those things

00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:20.470
also fancy thing. I call it fancy thing. Okay. Yeah. So here

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:24.230
we have AI agent, which you can click over here and you can

00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:30.030
add. Now you need some chat model, which can response. So

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:33.470
you did. Google Gemini chat model. And of course, I think

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:36.870
it's very, uh, so that was also told how you can connect to

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:42.710
all those things to that. We can also do that. Okay. I use 2

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:45.810
.5. We can connect to this, because this is free almost free

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:50.590
so we do not need to pay anything as of now this particular

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:54.650
chat model so we can test and try once now i execute this

00:33:54.650 --> 00:34:05.120
and let me directly make this happen live in front of you

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:25.050
okay here i am right now okay yeah so now i just say hey

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:25.990
okay

00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:38.980
there is a problem in node so no form is specified okay why

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:42.840
why it is happening now so these kind of errors will get i

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:46.680
can code because it was connected to chat figure but we need

00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:51.220
to define what you want what your ai agent will listen then

00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:55.100
only it can respond it hasn't got any kind of input so how

00:34:55.100 --> 00:35:04.550
it can respond so in that case uh that is fixed we can

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:07.890
simply drag and drop okay if you do not know how to write

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:11.490
even i i don't know also but i know how to drag and drop now

00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:13.330
let us test again and

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:19.120
say hey okay

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:29.650
now it's you know what so what happened till here it has so

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:32.890
if you go over here you can see output also hey there how

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:39.310
can i i'll fix today okay but now we need input also the

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:45.870
output in our telegram itself okay so for that again we need

00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:51.310
to connect over here the telegram right send

00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:57.470
the text message and

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:02.740
here again we need to connect the same telegram bot that we

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:13.960
connected at first so yeah there will be a chat id You can

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:16.340
just drag and drop. There will be a text.

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:25.050
What do you want in output?

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:36.990
Let us see. Okay. Can you see? We got a response. We started

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:40.970
from scratch. Now we are getting response in our, you know,

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:44.730
under telegram. Now you have a smart telegram bot that works

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:51.330
in your, with your instructions. Okay. Let us again get

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:55.730
right. How can you help? How can you help me? And

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.620
once I execute and

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:10.660
this can work in a real time output. Just thinking and this

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:11.640
will give you an output.

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:17.950
Okay. So there is an error. From

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:47.350
here, we can give prompt also to the AI agent to this

00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:49.590
AiAgent. will give you some structured output because right

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:54.990
now it's totally unstructured keep answer short

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:28.160
okay now you got so why the error was at that time because

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:31.400
everything has its own capacity even if we are posting

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.300
something online there is some character right if we are

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:37.780
adding title under the youtube there is some character

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:41.060
maximum there there are some format for each and everything

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:44.540
so we need to modify it so you can see info answer text

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:49.740
ideas so now the the next part the same right now i have

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:53.140
given system message so you can make it the way that you

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:55.340
want this is the modification that you can do and this is

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:59.080
the benefit you can make it a drew ai assistant okay you can

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:04.840
make it to say every single time that yeah uh hey i'm you're

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:10.820
on ai okay you're on how can i help you so that that kind of

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:17.580
thing okay and it can also give you timing also there is and

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:32.720
one more thing you can see right now we are getting this

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:36.240
message was sent automatically with anything so for to

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:40.380
remove this because this not looks good what we can do we

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:43.800
can click over here and you can see append and attend

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:48.100
attribution we will click and we will off it so once this is

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:51.160
done now let's say okay

00:39:52.540 --> 00:40:00.160
can you tell me some joke and once i trigger over here now

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:07.600
it won't come with this okay why did this scarecrow win an

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:11.180
award because he was outstanding in this field so it's not

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:15.060
that much amazing or you know joke apart but yeah we can

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:19.560
make it more better fine so the main idea was to remove this

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:21.940
particular thing now we have remote now you have proper

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:26.000
interface like we are using and the more you want you can

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:26.600
prompt it you can prompt it you can prompt it you can prompt

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.660
it you can prompt it the level of form that you want to give

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:34.100
it okay so i'll show you because uh like the same method i

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:37.500
have used to create my auto post generator over the linkedin

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:40.500
the same method is going to work because this is something

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:43.980
that this is something you all might have doing last two and

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:47.780
three years in the chat gptk right you are giving some text

00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:51.680
uh you are giving some messages to that particular agent so

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:55.460
if you go in my chat gpt also that what i was doing for last

00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:59.660
so many times so i had this deep chat okay this chat money

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:02.320
freedom through life flow all side the company that i'm

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:05.820
working editing so we kept asking same and same question

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:11.000
with the same system so it remembers right who what we have

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.920
what we want to talk about it but here the best part we can

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:19.940
pre-define the response of that particular agent okay using

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:25.100
chat model and here few things i just also want to add and

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:28.180
then we can just go through with this so here we have memory

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:34.520
here we have tools so right now if i ask can you tell what i

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:41.320
asked if i ask this it won't remember why because it's not

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:45.320
used any kind of memories and all so we can use the memory

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:51.880
also okay so it's just replying this one so we have memory

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:56.480
to add uh tab over here okay which we can define simple

00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:03.760
memory over here and we need to define over here at

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:11.250
what context we want so now whenever we talk to it it will

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:15.350
remember your last five status something like that okay and

00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:18.290
from here we can add so many tools so that's how the simple

00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:21.890
agents we can create using telegram this is what i told this

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:28.050
will work your entire now telegram kind of thing okay so now

00:42:28.050 --> 00:42:32.030
let me directly take you through this how this one this is

00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:34.770
being created so this was the main important thing over here

00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:39.210
now resting it just connect the dot all right so once i give

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:44.430
you this particular json file what you can do you can just

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:48.270
import file and you can you will get all these things by

00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:53.370
default prefix do not need to do anything okay but yeah uh

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:57.050
if you will understand that that will help later to fix the

00:42:57.050 --> 00:43:01.150
box and error so fast otherwise you need to do loadfile of

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:06.390
things so now what is happening now there might be two type

00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:10.690
of message the first one is the text message i can also send

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:14.330
to our my voice as well so what it will do it will switch

00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:18.450
from over here okay if if it is a text it will go directly

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:23.470
if it is not this will go over here as well so the same

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:28.890
telegram i can say over here let

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:33.380
me open

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:39.540
my app telegram and let me ask okay

00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:56.370
thanks for your reply can we discuss later okay by the way

00:43:56.370 --> 00:44:00.230
it won't work because i haven't yet attached over here okay

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:05.570
i have just attached the text so if i want i can just copy

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:09.030
and paste and i can do this also over here okay so let me

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:13.070
just take you through over here it will listen the same way

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:18.650
it listen this one now it will see it is voice or text based

00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:22.290
on that it will go next so

00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:50.440
okay i wanted a realistic image of uh children's playing

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:56.040
over the cloud so once this is gone now again i'll just

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.500
trigger it okay

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:11.160
so this is what happens sometimes you cannot use you know

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:15.780
simultaneous two different words because it just listen once

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:16.680
it

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:28.600
might work in this case but it's not working here save

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.460
and let me refresh okay

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:19.060
so okay so see these kind of things you guys will feel also

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:23.720
once you are doing real-time project so by mistake what i'm

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:28.080
doing i'm sending over here the message but what i have

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:31.200
chosen credentials i have chosen the another more pretty

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:35.620
skills right that's why it's not listening so in that case

00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:42.860
let's stop it let's go here let's change it okay now you see

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:46.920
let me send the audio let

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:52.110
me execute you

00:46:56.330 --> 00:47:02.010
got so now it came over here it transcribing my voice

00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:07.510
converting it piece to text using open ai and let's stop it

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:14.170
over here so now what exactly happened i just send a voice

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:17.810
message it went over here voice or text it went into if

00:47:17.810 --> 00:47:22.150
condition also if it is true if it is true true means if it

00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:27.630
is a text directly go uh in to my agent if it is not it will

00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:31.510
go uh come over here so right now i have two condition only

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:38.350
either image okay either image and it has also given me the

00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:43.750
output also so if you guys see yeah this input because we

00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:49.490
had to stop it for a time fine so here i i got my text voice

00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:54.630
over here so here we can add this particular thing as a file

00:47:54.630 --> 00:48:01.710
operation is get okay over here and the file id file id

00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:06.470
basically the same one this one listening for upcoming uh

00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:10.570
items on this voice id file so here you can see we have

00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:14.470
while file id okay

00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:25.120
this is something that we can copy and paste over here and

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:28.640
by the way the same the same json prompt i'll give you so

00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:31.040
you guys can copy and paste like import and you will get all

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:34.040
these things just you have to set up a credential resting is

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:38.860
already a setup okay once it's converted into speech to text

00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:44.600
so just for the test purpose again okay

00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:04.820
so what it does now first of all let me just change the

00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:06.680
seating info from thisでしょう here you can see that is input

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:10.640
for each and everything that is mid part and then there is

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:13.520
output all right now

00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:22.540
from previous message previous chat what you got it got the

00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:27.220
input the image prompt okay now how we can connect we can

00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:32.700
again connect from over here So this is the exact image form

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:36.100
that the agent I have added to create just a prompt.

00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:40.900
Whatever text we are giving, take that text as a reference.

00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:43.920
So here you can see this is something I have written as a

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:46.800
prompt. Write a high quality image font for an AI image

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:49.700
generator to generate a super high quality image, super

00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:53.000
realistic according to this description, json.txt, make it

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.840
super detailed. This json.txt is the same. The text that we

00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:01.720
are sending, you know, to our telegram and it will create

00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:05.720
something good output, hyper realistic image of a children

00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:08.660
playing because this is taking from the last one basically

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:14.160
over here. And then this will go through over here. The file

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:18.560
name created for drive. Now what it will do, it is again

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:22.300
doing the summarization. Okay. Summarize this as sort as a

00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:26.800
Google drive file name. Because I cannot save this file

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:30.940
name. This particular, you know, this many words. So to

00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:34.160
create a simple file name, that's why I have added, because

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:36.960
this is going to call my, this problem. Every single time I

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:40.060
have to upload file, I want to name it. What you will do.

00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:44.720
This will come PNG1, MS2, MS3, unlike, you know,

00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:49.340
unstructured. So for that, just, I have added this, so this

00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:56.100
is connected over here. Okay. So, so the answer, anything I

00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:59.820
need to add more over here. No, I think, I think, I think we

00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:01.600
are going good. I believe guys, we all are able to

00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:04.440
understand, right? So I believe it's a very simple node and

00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:06.880
then everywhere we are connecting. And if you will see the

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:09.700
flow, right flow itself is pretty much logical, right?

00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:13.960
Everyone. Yeah. I think, uh, if you guys are facing any kind

00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:16.540
of issue, I believe, uh, you can ask a question to Dhruv,

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:20.760
but I believe for me, it's like a pretty much good. And for

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:23.460
everyone, this is how like, uh, this, and again, this

00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:25.820
editing is literally very powerful tool, like at least for

00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:29.540
your day to day work. Right. Yeah. Uh, believe me, uh,

00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:31.780
whatever fees that you have paid to your own, right. Maybe,

00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:35.180
uh, if you want to recover that fees, uh, you can do it

00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:38.360
within like a week of time. Uh, if you ha if you have the

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:40.860
skill, so by doing some sort of freelancing project outside,

00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:45.280
yeah. Yeah. There are so many people looking for that.

00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:49.540
Believe me. So many people. Yeah. Yeah. We are getting so

00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:52.080
many things. I'll just give you the picture. Clarity people

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:55.060
for teaching the same thing. They are charging a hundred

00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:57.600
dollars per month because they have some YouTube channel and

00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:00.260
all. Yeah. So just to teach anything, nothing more than

00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:07.780
that. So it's cool community. So yeah. Okay. Okay.

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:14.200
Only automation. Yeah. Okay.

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:21.580
So then, so everything is here based on the requirement that

00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:26.080
we needed. Okay. And then here. We need to connect the nano.

00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:30.580
The API. Yeah. How I'm doing it over here. So yesterday

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:34.780
also, so thank you, sir. Everything properly. The model, we

00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:37.640
have the content that we have that it needed. And the kind

00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:42.080
of input needed. Just I'll tell you how you guys can do over

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:47.420
here. Okay. So. Yeah. So how people are saying that, how to

00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:50.420
use a UD API agent? Uh, see in an agent, you can't use it

00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:53.480
because for an agent. So already in it and has given a

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:56.060
couple of options. You can go ahead with that option. But

00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:58.200
for example, he was using a non over on a model. Right. To

00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:01.740
generate an image. Yeah. And even in, uh, you're on UD, you

00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:04.720
will be able to find out you like a imagination model. So

00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:08.120
basically he is technically doing a CDPS call, right? So the

00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:10.740
nano banana tab that you are able to see. So over there you

00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:13.860
can use like, uh, uh, UD and, uh, the model which provides

00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:16.980
you a image generation because inside a UD API system, we

00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:19.620
have a image generation or nano banana. Obviously it's a

00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:22.840
latest one. It's the best one you can try to use. But even,

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:25.440
uh, our image generation system will give you a very, very

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:28.660
decent high quality 4k images. Right. Uh, but yeah,

00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:32.040
technically he's, he's not calling a model directly by using

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:35.880
a model a node that is not available. He's just doing a CDPS

00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:39.080
request, right? So this is, and again, in majority of time

00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:41.680
you will call either a Bebhook or a STTP request because

00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:44.700
when you will end up connecting with the outer world, or

00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:47.680
maybe let's suppose if you have like a written a code, a

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:50.580
custom code, right? Obviously you will not be able to find

00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:52.660
out like for those custom code, you will not be able to find

00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:56.140
out any kind of a predefined node inside any systems and it

00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:58.800
in system or maybe in any system. In the world. So what you

00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:01.260
will do, you will try to expose that as a API and then

00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:04.700
consume it as a CDPS request. Simple. And for that, like a

00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:08.660
nano, sorry, not nano. This Eniten has given you a node, a

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:11.120
CDPS request. So he's doing the same. So over there you can

00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:15.760
use it. Nano banana. Yes. Yes. Well, the same thing I have

00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:18.940
now, I'll just tell you for the nano banana. I think for the

00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:21.880
URI also we can do the same because we just need a STTP

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:26.080
request to take from the system and that's done. Okay. Okay.

00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:32.840
So you can do a direct image. So for that, let's

00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:36.160
take you open router. So open router is a kind of platform

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:40.340
that you all might aware already. Okay. Just like a group. I

00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:45.440
would say basically, or you can say a URI API ecosystem. You

00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:49.140
will be able to find out all the models, technically a

00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:54.360
group, open open router. And then like this one URI API

00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:57.840
system. Right. Basically. a multi-model provider in one

00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:00.720
place with one API. This is the system and they're just

00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:05.580
selling you that part. Yes, yes, yes. But that's the same

00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:09.020
way. Actually, just URI AI just came very new for me. Of

00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:12.240
course now, because I'm getting free of cost, so I'll start

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:15.340
creating something on that so I can test and try because

00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:18.740
this cost a lot. This cost a lot. Right now we have this

00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:22.180
particular Gemini, but before that I used to pay 20 rupees

00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:26.620
for single emails to chat GPT, right? Now I'm paying 3 and 4

00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:30.380
rupees to nano banana, but next time now I'll create new and

00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:35.940
I'll pay zero rupees using URI AI and all. Something like

00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:39.020
that. So yeah, I think that we need to keep updating our

00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:42.720
model based on the market because that's how it happens,

00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:47.840
right? There will be some great updates in the market. We

00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:50.860
just need to be aware just to add and grow on all those

00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:54.760
things. So how we can do that over here? Once you go, here

00:55:54.760 --> 00:56:00.490
we have eight API calls. Okay. All right. So here you can

00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:05.810
see the curl option. Okay. So, uh, but I'm sorry, I just, I

00:56:05.810 --> 00:56:09.570
want to add how I did. And this is something I'm, I face the

00:56:09.570 --> 00:56:12.310
issue also. So, so

00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:18.420
right now what I did basically, because I was so many other

00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:22.300
YouTube videos and all. So I take this particular, uh, JSON

00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:24.920
file from there and I copy and paste it. So now whenever I'm

00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:28.720
creating a city, we're just using nano banana, by the way, I

00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:31.600
have walked you to study. So now I have more clarity about

00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:35.620
these kind of HD and all and all it hit it and all right. So

00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:39.640
how I used to create, I was just doing copy and paste. So

00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:46.300
over here, I have this particular question. So the style of

00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:50.920
doing copy and paste, that's how I used to do it. I don't

00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:54.280
have idea what we are saying, but I know how to connect. So

00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:57.680
just, I was going over here and just, uh, you know,

00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:03.800
connecting. So, uh, input curve. Now not like this, but I'll

00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:09.920
tell you how, how, how I did the things. Okay. So, so you,

00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:13.920
you guys can relate this. It is not something I have done

00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:19.900
this. I imported. Now I will go here and then I just copy

00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:24.240
and paste of fame on the previous. That's how I used to

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:28.580
connect all these things. So if, if you just want to add

00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:32.420
again, if you want to revise for the day. i think this will

00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:37.000
be helpful for them also and for me as well so yeah now it's

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.700
done now i'll connect the node and of course for that we

00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:43.740
need this kind of tokens and also for that i have used the

00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:49.820
already over here that is basic one so so this is the

00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:54.340
credential that we needed to add the apis okay either we can

00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:59.920
do in in this method okay authorization we are opening i uh

00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:07.140
the api key that we can get to over here from here we can

00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:12.700
create new api key or the best part we do not need to do

00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:19.260
again and again for that we can do generic credentials type

00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:26.520
and from here think this will be uh so here i just i wanted

00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:30.480
to know uh every single time whenever we need to connect

00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:34.820
over here authorizer it is saying bearer right but here i

00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:38.840
have created everything under header auth so just if you

00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:44.860
just want to add two things uh which one which one so right

00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:48.280
now if you see whenever we are going to header parameter it

00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:51.680
is saying we are and then we need to copy paste our apis

00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:54.120
right yeah yeah yeah so here

00:58:56.940 --> 00:58:59.860
yeah by default if you have certain b or auth right then you

00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:02.140
don't have to define it header header means basically like

00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:05.580
it will try to pass it as a string by the way or like normal

00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:08.580
you can say text it will try to pass but if you said already

00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:11.160
that okay fine it's a bearer so you don't have to like write

00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:13.620
a bearer that you have written down uh in our boxes

00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:16.820
basically one of the boxes so in this error so just directly

00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:20.460
try to pass the api key it will work means bearer it will

00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:23.900
try to append automatically your whole api if you'll check

00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:24.740
the whole api it will work i choose the in the in the key

00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:27.720
even on uri right technically whenever we try to expose

00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:30.720
anything as an api key right so we try to define a bearer

00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:35.120
and then we try to generate the key basically that we try or

00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:37.800
haski that we try to generate so if you're selecting bearer

00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:40.060
by default it will happen if you're not selecting bearer if

00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:42.560
you're selecting header header means just try to consider as

00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:45.780
a plain string kind of things so in that case write bearer

00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:48.040
and then you have to like pass the api key that that's the

00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:51.560
difference so yesterday you must have seen me that i have

00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:54.620
already selected a bearer because i know that that my key

00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:58.120
was holding a bearer entity right so i have just copy and

00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:01.860
pasted yes yes so before that i used to do this i was just

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:04.520
writing over here authorization then bearer and then copy

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:08.440
and pasting but right now like i have more clarity so what

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:12.160
we can do we can go over here also and from here if we go so

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:15.060
right now you can see just asking for the token so now i can

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:17.580
just copy and paste api right instead of citing

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:20.680
authorization and bearer and this will connect automatically

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:22.400
like so

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:34.210
once i'll create just i'll copy and paste and

01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:44.710
i'll just save it yeah so you can see now it's it's get

01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:49.150
selected and then we can off it we do not require now

01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:51.590
because this is the same thing that we did over here right

01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:55.230
we do not require these things either you can define by

01:00:55.230 --> 01:01:00.790
default so let's off it okay and here we have all the things

01:01:00.790 --> 01:01:03.130
all right so

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:09.860
this particular json file will tell the model what you want

01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:11.720
to create so

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:21.740
let us add a chat viewer also okay

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:32.200
so this can tell here you have so by the way you guys got

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:37.500
right how to connect your nano banana api or any other httpr

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:39.900
if with that's how the http request gets connected just just

01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:43.140
do one thing no drawer go to yuri uh go to yuri and then try

01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:46.100
to use this one uh the gen imagination module you're looking

01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:48.800
for imagination right so we already have friends So just go

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:55.420
there, go to your own, go to URI API, go to endpoint, yeah,

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:57.580
so instead of like a nanobrana, we can try to use here

01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:01.100
itself, go to endpoint, side, yeah, right hand side,

01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:05.860
endpoint, yeah, that one, yeah, come down, the last part,

01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:08.420
yeah, click over there, the image generation, right, yeah,

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.460
click there, so it's one of the best model that we have

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:14.620
given to all of you, copy the curl, fine. Okay, same thing,

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:20.880
so paste it, paste it there, yes, so instead of going over

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:27.640
here, let it paste this one, import, yeah, now pass the

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:33.350
bearer, so just generate one key, generate credential type,

01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:38.290
yeah, just select bearer, okay, now like go to API key, side

01:02:38.290 --> 01:02:44.030
tab again, yeah, API key, go up, generate one, give

01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:50.120
any random name. Any random name will work, yeah, copy, yes,

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:59.280
yeah, go back, fine, bearer auth, fine, click bearer auth,

01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:03.320
create new credential, paste, done, and everywhere, like for

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:06.260
any API, not just this one, so for any API key, it's the

01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:08.440
same story, right, bearer will be there, just select the

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:11.120
bearer auth, copy, paste, done, right, curly you have,

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:16.060
already have, right, yeah, so, yeah, now, yeah, no need to

01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:19.080
send a header, send a body, simple, so header is not even

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:23.020
going to be just a string, right, so everything is like it

01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:24.860
has already filled, it has already filled each and

01:03:24.860 --> 01:03:28.700
everything, right, right, and maybe you can like not test

01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:33.180
it, so input,

01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:37.040
I

01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:41.310
think you have not mapped the input part, right, the prompt

01:03:41.310 --> 01:03:47.690
part, got it, so let me do one thing over here, from a

01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:50.450
follow-up telegram node, from a telegram node, just, just

01:03:50.450 --> 01:03:53.910
drag one telegram node there, right, and from telegram or

01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:58.030
maybe just, just, do one thing, attach a chat node, attach a

01:03:58.030 --> 01:04:00.790
chat trigger, attach a chat trigger, we just need a trigger,

01:04:00.890 --> 01:04:04.910
right, yeah, attach a chat trigger over there, fine, now,

01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:09.650
with chat, so just send one like a message, prompt, maybe hi

01:04:09.650 --> 01:04:13.970
or something else for now, yeah, yeah, send hi, fine, now go

01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:20.010
there, yeah, go to the HTTPS node, hmm, now, so you, you

01:04:20.010 --> 01:04:23.570
receive the hi, right, click on JSON, right, and then drag

01:04:23.570 --> 01:04:27.150
it to the prompt part, yeah, drag it to the prompt part, so,

01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:30.470
hey, beautiful, like, this one, below, below, below, below,

01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:33.670
below, below, below, below, below, below, below, the prompt

01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:36.190
is what, value is what, value, value, value, yeah, value

01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:39.890
part, drag it, yeah, remove that part, make it

01:04:39.890 --> 01:04:44.110
parameterized, only hi, no, no, no, the name is, name is

01:04:44.110 --> 01:04:46.050
chat input and then value is basically hi.

01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:55.390
OK, chat input, right, yeah, value is hi, no,

01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:02.580
no, no, no, not, the drag, drag, right, drag. It will take

01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:06.060
the JSON automatically. Means it will take that p-value pair

01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:10.140
automatically. You have dragged just over here. Hi, it is

01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:12.420
returning, right? Yeah. Name you can give anyhow anything.

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:16.960
Name doesn't matter at all. Name can be my name as well.

01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:21.360
That will work. Right. Yeah. Okay. Back to canvas. Now send

01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:21.540
hi.

01:05:27.070 --> 01:05:30.830
Bad request. Please check your parameter. Prompt is

01:05:30.830 --> 01:05:34.290
required. It's saying prompt is required. Drop hi actually.

01:05:34.350 --> 01:05:36.970
You have dropped chat input. I believe that's the reason

01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:39.390
JSON not chat input is showing. Drop hi. Hi is a prompt,

01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:42.950
right? Basically hi is a prompt. Remove the value part.

01:05:43.350 --> 01:05:47.690
Value part. Value, value, value. Not name. Remove it. Yeah.

01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:52.690
Drag hi. Yes. Okay. Got it. Got it. Okay. But yeah, again

01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:55.550
it's the same thing, right? It's a hi itself. JSON not chat

01:05:55.550 --> 01:05:55.770
input.

01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:06.200
Check your parameter. It's saying black

01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:13.980
forest flux is fine. Do I have? Do I have? Do I have? Do I

01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:13.980
have? Do I have? Do I have? Do I have? Do I have? Do I have?

01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:16.080
Yes. Do I have? Yeah. Yes. Okay. . Yeah. Okay. Uh let us do

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:21.800
it. Do I have access of all those API for free in URIs?

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.200
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's already available. So with the URI

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:29.040
API it's already available to all of us actually. Okay. And

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:34.300
it should return basically a JSON file in general. Everyone

01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:37.560
is having an access. It's a URI system. It's inside a URI

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:40.080
system itself. Maybe some parameter mistake we are doing.

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:43.020
That's a different story. Just convert that to a JSON,

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:47.720
alright? specify the body right so just no no the body part

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:48.980
okay

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:54.240
this

01:06:56.250 --> 01:07:02.290
one and it end yeah paste it as yes all just

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:06.240
adjust the body part no

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:19.000
this is not the example request go below end point yeah end

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:25.760
point the last part we have a image this is the curl right

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:26.680
hand side one is curl

01:07:32.210 --> 01:07:35.670
yeah before coat yes this is the body part and then instead

01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:40.590
of like a prompt yeah so i think fine got it uh there was a

01:07:40.590 --> 01:07:45.110
fine paste it paste it here now remove a beautiful sunset

01:07:45.110 --> 01:07:48.770
over mountain just that part just just remove the string

01:07:48.770 --> 01:07:52.590
part inside that yeah remove the string yeah now inside that

01:07:52.590 --> 01:07:56.470
drag high high high high yeah drag high uh

01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:06.230
i think yeah just cut it now paste it there hmm

01:08:10.010 --> 01:08:14.050
hmm now it's generating see so it is giving you like a

01:08:14.050 --> 01:08:17.470
together api right uh so yeah so basically returning the

01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:21.470
image url now so basically uh even in your uri so you have

01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:24.190
that image generation capability you can use that part this

01:08:24.190 --> 01:08:29.150
is what i was trying to say right that's the same thing even

01:08:29.150 --> 01:08:31.170
for like a speech to text that you are using right i think

01:08:31.170 --> 01:08:34.250
in a uri you have a speech to text model as well so for a

01:08:34.250 --> 01:08:37.370
speech to take the chat gpt that you are using right uh the

01:08:37.370 --> 01:08:43.150
node yeah so even for that we have like uh apis okay so uh

01:08:43.150 --> 01:08:46.270
just just i have question that because uh i'm paying for

01:08:46.270 --> 01:08:48.770
this whether i'm paying three five or ten rupees so what if

01:08:48.770 --> 01:08:51.810
i started using the whole jury for all these things see one

01:08:51.810 --> 01:08:54.090
lakh token is more than enough i don't think that you can

01:08:54.090 --> 01:08:57.010
even check the token number of token uh which is going to go

01:08:57.010 --> 01:08:59.430
to uri part you have generated the image right you have so

01:08:59.430 --> 01:09:04.090
go to a big uses yeah go to users see what was the use for

01:09:04.090 --> 01:09:09.070
one image generation so basically like uh yeah go to go to

01:09:09.070 --> 01:09:11.650
logs go to logs that will show you the actual like a token

01:09:11.650 --> 01:09:15.490
number of tokens yeah see how many tokens you have used yeah

01:09:15.490 --> 01:09:19.130
exactly and again latency will be very very low for this one

01:09:19.130 --> 01:09:24.910
so you can try to use that and so at least uh 50 images uh

01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:29.430
basically you will be able to generate right yeah 50 or 500

01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:35.090
2000 right yeah 50 50 50 yeah 50 images 50 images too much

01:09:35.090 --> 01:09:40.210
yes right yeah so what do you do with images by the way so

01:09:40.210 --> 01:09:44.450
one like is literally see on a regular basis even to serve a

01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:48.650
substantial number of your customer right or to create a

01:09:48.650 --> 01:09:50.690
substantial number of the post because i don't think that

01:09:50.690 --> 01:09:53.570
anyone will do anything with the 50 number of like images

01:09:53.570 --> 01:09:55.730
right where you will post you need that many number of

01:09:55.730 --> 01:09:58.150
social media account as well you will you will not keep on

01:09:58.150 --> 01:10:00.450
just posting it right you will post one or twice in a day

01:10:00.450 --> 01:10:03.650
and right right couple of like a you know token for the chat

01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:08.730
it's more than more than literally more than enough yes yes

01:10:08.730 --> 01:10:11.630
so don't have to like go and pay yeah with agents so you

01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:14.770
can't directly use it because uh anything has not given you

01:10:14.770 --> 01:10:17.610
the custom compatibility in a future you can expect that

01:10:17.610 --> 01:10:20.750
from in it in itself that with the agent that they will give

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:24.350
you a custom compatibility that directly the like like a

01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:27.250
model that you are attaching the standard one so maybe you

01:10:27.250 --> 01:10:30.010
can try to attach your custom one as well but as a separate

01:10:30.010 --> 01:10:34.050
model for example for this image generation for text-to

01:10:34.050 --> 01:10:37.250
-speech or even for embedding directly go ahead and use yuri

01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:41.150
like yes and i think this is this is more than enough

01:10:41.150 --> 01:10:44.110
because that's how we we will be using so many other models

01:10:44.110 --> 01:10:47.010
because everything is not over here right so as a ctp

01:10:47.010 --> 01:10:50.310
request is something that we can do anything so even

01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:53.970
initially even over here i'm already using the same as ctp

01:10:53.970 --> 01:10:57.170
request i'm using i'm just using all these other things just

01:10:57.170 --> 01:11:02.090
to create prompt and all and all right so okay so i think i

01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:06.790
think with with my clearance also other also got the clarity

01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:09.010
because that's how things happen once they are going to work

01:11:09.010 --> 01:11:11.910
in the real time still they will say same issue so it is a

01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:14.810
great thing now you have to all the things how how it

01:11:14.810 --> 01:11:17.490
happens sometimes a little bit error sometimes string error

01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:22.350
sometimes the quotes error right and and just wanted to know

01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:27.050
from here i think why was we getting error previously uh

01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:31.770
when we not basically the key value the key value the body

01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:34.730
that you were passing right body is something called as

01:11:34.730 --> 01:11:37.470
payload in case of api payload means you are sending this

01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:40.310
that okay fine so just like a give this is an input because

01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:42.770
model is nothing but some function execution you can say

01:11:42.770 --> 01:11:44.790
right so function will take an input and then it will give

01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:47.330
you the output that input was not correct the input

01:11:47.330 --> 01:11:49.930
parameter was not correct so that is that is the only reason

01:11:49.930 --> 01:11:54.070
so basically see it's my api so i have defined my own style

01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:56.890
now you have to follow if you're using my api you have to

01:11:56.890 --> 01:11:59.990
follow the same thing symbol and again like a style is curl

01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:03.610
style is same but yeah there was some mismatch in the key

01:12:03.610 --> 01:12:06.590
value pair the payload so we have corrected it we have not

01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:10.130
done anything copy and paste it right and it is working so i

01:12:10.130 --> 01:12:14.130
think let me also help you like if you can help over here

01:12:14.130 --> 01:12:16.830
let us do this also because we have created now so they will

01:12:16.830 --> 01:12:20.890
also get an idea because whenever any email is being created

01:12:20.890 --> 01:12:24.010
they cannot see and all all those things then we need to

01:12:24.010 --> 01:12:27.550
download it in in some format binary format and all right by

01:12:27.550 --> 01:12:31.570
default by default uri api if you go and check the output it

01:12:33.330 --> 01:12:33.950
will tell you that this is the json so just click on json

01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:37.250
output tab yeah just on so technically this is the json now

01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:41.210
this is returning you image as a url basically so just copy

01:12:41.210 --> 01:12:47.930
the url paste it somewhere in a tab in a browser yeah okay

01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:50.630
this is the image it has generated right this is the image

01:12:50.630 --> 01:12:53.250
and this image is available where this image is available as

01:12:53.250 --> 01:12:57.310
a at a url right so now what you can do so maybe you can try

01:12:57.310 --> 01:12:59.710
to download this image so maybe you can try to use a

01:12:59.710 --> 01:13:02.970
download node and download it and then send it because see

01:13:02.970 --> 01:13:06.710
the basic principle for any 10 what they are following uh

01:13:06.710 --> 01:13:10.270
since the beginning is they always return json as an output

01:13:10.270 --> 01:13:14.010
now depends on what i have to showcase to my user we just

01:13:14.010 --> 01:13:16.570
parse it so now what you have to pass it just you have to

01:13:16.570 --> 01:13:19.850
take out the url part and send it back to telegram or any

01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:23.850
anywhere you want right so now what you will do maybe try to

01:13:23.850 --> 01:13:28.290
call the set over there try to call set over there yeah set

01:13:28.290 --> 01:13:31.930
fields at all set just search set yeah field set this one

01:13:32.970 --> 01:13:37.290
now so basically like uh map it with the previous node let

01:13:37.290 --> 01:13:38.690
me remove this one yeah

01:13:41.970 --> 01:13:46.250
remove this uh just connect the connect the set part now

01:13:48.650 --> 01:13:54.750
go to the set now input is this right now what you just want

01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:57.550
you just want uh double click on add field double click yeah

01:13:57.550 --> 01:14:01.570
double click fine now name and string just drag url and

01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:05.710
string so url has a name and string as a value this entire

01:14:05.710 --> 01:14:08.410
json what i am able to filter out i am able to filtering i

01:14:08.410 --> 01:14:11.890
can write even a code node over there uh but see now my this

01:14:11.890 --> 01:14:14.650
is the data return right out of that created id and all

01:14:14.650 --> 01:14:17.450
those things i have just removed right and this is the final

01:14:17.450 --> 01:14:21.290
one now i you can send this url to anyone anyone you want

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:23.730
maybe you would like to store it in a like a google drive

01:14:23.730 --> 01:14:26.690
that you are doing already right so store it into a google

01:14:26.690 --> 01:14:29.470
drive or maybe send it back to the telegram over there it

01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:31.930
will render automatically because telegram is having a

01:14:31.930 --> 01:14:34.910
nature so whenever you paste some like a link it will render

01:14:36.030 --> 01:14:39.390
okay right so it is having basically a og and that is

01:14:39.390 --> 01:14:42.310
something that feature is actually called as og feature or

01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:46.010
og image feature whenever you paste some link right uh so

01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:48.690
you must have seen that on every social media it try to

01:14:48.690 --> 01:14:51.410
render the image or thumbnail basically so that is something

01:14:51.410 --> 01:14:55.970
so in a technical term it's called og og images uh so like

01:14:55.970 --> 01:15:00.130
uh telegram is having that feature okay so will it show in

01:15:00.130 --> 01:15:04.470
telegram with file or just the link it will share i think

01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:07.490
the link it will link link basically yeah so just just like

01:15:07.490 --> 01:15:10.050
send it back so previously you were sending a text right

01:15:10.050 --> 01:15:14.470
just return an image simple no no correct telegram connect

01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:18.750
telegram and test it yeah yeah yeah that's connect the end

01:15:18.750 --> 01:15:25.810
point yes same same here okay it's

01:15:31.090 --> 01:15:32.910
not required let

01:15:36.850 --> 01:15:41.130
me send a message uri the

01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:46.910
same

01:15:49.570 --> 01:15:52.130
flow is running right if you have if you can check yes yes

01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:56.590
yes okay okay yeah now just we need to refix this because

01:15:56.590 --> 01:15:59.890
before before we have taken something else over here as an

01:15:59.890 --> 01:16:03.930
input oh okay fine so now drag and drop your chat text oh

01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:14.860
yeah done yeah now all will work

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:26.140
we got it and let's okay let us again fix it so these things

01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:28.680
are not error because we are fixing new things that's why

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:32.500
it's coming again and again so for for the people i think we

01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:36.460
all are matured understand okay right right everyone i

01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:39.000
believe we all are able to understand now right uh i think

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.920
we all can build any anything in like i think after a couple

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:44.760
of like classes uh because we are coming from the coding

01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:47.480
background by the way and for coder it's pretty much easy to

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:51.920
understand not a hardcore coder i would say even as a like

01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:54.620
you know a basic developer i would like who has taken couple

01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:59.020
of classes in python or something so some people are saying

01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:02.000
yes like baves joel and what about others guys are you guys

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:07.060
sleeping yeah we we need a lot of response in a group from

01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:11.640
every one of you yeah can we continue yeah even next week is

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:14.020
an 810 by the way and i'm going to show you like a lot of

01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:15.660
like steps okay

01:17:20.430 --> 01:17:24.970
so basically now i received in my telegram also if i just

01:17:24.970 --> 01:17:26.410
show you over

01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:34.490
here here yeah we got a link you have returned the image

01:17:34.490 --> 01:17:37.230
maybe you can refresh it in your mobile and maybe you can

01:17:37.230 --> 01:17:41.430
see the rendering or maybe like close the desktop app and

01:17:41.430 --> 01:17:43.910
then open it up again it will show you the rendered one

01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:46.290
technically we are returning the images right we are

01:17:46.290 --> 01:17:49.810
returning the images got it so if if you want to download it

01:17:49.810 --> 01:17:52.750
and send either image file as a binary basically you can

01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:55.350
send it as a binary file right so you can write a binary

01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:58.910
file as well so like basically url to image that is

01:17:58.910 --> 01:18:00.750
something that you have to do but yeah we are able to send

01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:04.950
the data to the diagram got it yes yes so now if we have to

01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:10.110
send it binary then what to do now uh sorry yeah we have to

01:18:10.110 --> 01:18:13.910
use a use a code basically use a code like a basically uh

01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:18.070
image url technically that is a url it will download it code

01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:20.630
will download it and convert that into a binary and then

01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:22.950
send it back to the diagram that's a whole step that you

01:18:22.950 --> 01:18:29.610
have to follow okay so i basically and just just try to

01:18:29.610 --> 01:18:35.010
check uh url to directly image is not available as a node so

01:18:35.010 --> 01:18:38.070
basically just call the code code part code node you have to

01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:41.450
call Right now basically I have used this which is

01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:45.170
converting, base 64 is fine, see if model is returning base

01:18:45.170 --> 01:18:48.790
64 then only you can convert. Ok one more thing, one more

01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:52.370
thing, model will return base 64 as well, go to URI API, as

01:18:52.370 --> 01:18:55.810
of now basically it is returning your URL, right, response

01:18:55.810 --> 01:18:58.370
is a URL, we have given you other feature as well. So

01:18:58.370 --> 01:19:06.070
basically response format and default is basically a URL, I

01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:14.750
think we have, it takes also base 64, I do not know whether

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:18.870
we have opened it up or not, yeah. So just try to keep

01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:27.990
response format default is URL. Let me check together API.

01:19:28.010 --> 01:19:30.710
Let me check API endpoint that we are using because we have

01:19:30.710 --> 01:19:34.550
given a nature is equals to, we just have to open it up,

01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:37.110
that's it. So instead of URL it will return you base 64,

01:19:37.330 --> 01:19:39.890
base 64 is an image binary format by the way, those who do

01:19:39.890 --> 01:19:42.710
not understand, those who understand like those who have

01:19:42.710 --> 01:19:45.270
done some sort of a computer vision class something, they

01:19:45.270 --> 01:19:48.450
all know that ok, it is a base 64 for images, very simple.

01:19:49.190 --> 01:19:54.410
Let me check with my URI, I think I have asked my team to

01:19:54.410 --> 01:19:58.630
open it up long back but I am not able to recall. Ok. Let me

01:19:58.630 --> 01:20:01.990
check, yeah,

01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:22.630
Rupik is saying send photo instead of text, but again, we

01:20:22.630 --> 01:20:24.770
need a binary form to send a photo as well.

01:20:28.850 --> 01:20:33.170
Yeah so just try to take a base 64 JSON response format,

01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:38.550
that is possible. So just go to your, like this one, by

01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:41.310
default we have given you URL, you can try this out with

01:20:41.310 --> 01:20:49.850
base 64 underscore JSON. Just go back to any time. Ok. Click

01:20:49.850 --> 01:20:55.210
on that node, HTTP, yes, come to the payload, expand, now

01:20:55.210 --> 01:20:58.430
instead of URL, right, remove the URL part and just write b,

01:20:58.510 --> 01:21:05.470
b small, b 64, 64 underscore JSON, JSON, try this out.

01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:10.790
Right. Yeah, try this out, just test this node, like what is

01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:11.730
the return that we are getting.

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:22.680
I think we got, no, no, no. We got not executed

01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:26.420
successfully, say. Then it's not a compatible format, then

01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:29.560
you have to write a code, basically. So you have to use the

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:32.500
code node, remove the base 64 keypad URL, we have not opened

01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:36.420
it up. Ok. We can open it up, basically. It's on my control,

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:38.880
basically. It's under your own control, because we are

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:42.280
maintaining this API, right, API request. It's under our

01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:45.240
control. Yeah, so URL you are getting, and then you have to

01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:48.940
basically like write a JavaScript code to convert URL into a

01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:52.200
base 64, and then same flow, same flow that you have to do.

01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:55.720
are using okay so can we uh if we have time can we test it

01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:58.440
on a real time because how i did it i'll just show you i

01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:01.640
think anyone can do that because i don't know how to write

01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:04.600
code someone people might know but they don't know how to

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:07.420
write code so if we can use chat gpd and all and just write

01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:09.760
them simple code so

01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:14.180
it's just

01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:07.650
so uh this is this is what i did over here yeah it's good

01:23:07.650 --> 01:23:10.370
it's taking an image url and then like uh in a first line

01:23:10.370 --> 01:23:12.890
constant is equal to image url and then it is trying to call

01:23:12.890 --> 01:23:16.010
basically buffer form buffer to a string base 64 format

01:23:16.010 --> 01:23:18.470
right so yeah looks good it

01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:27.090
was just yeah attached like a code you can write a python

01:23:27.090 --> 01:23:29.470
code as well although python is in beta but yeah python will

01:23:29.470 --> 01:23:34.310
also work okay yeah but both are same like javascript python

01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:36.550
looks same to me like not like very much different

01:23:41.890 --> 01:23:45.770
now let's just connect the urls which

01:24:18.030 --> 01:24:24.850
is not defined into a line number four oh which which

01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:30.190
do

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:46.240
i need to copy paste link over here also in under the url or

01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:48.480
somewhere no no fetch is not defined means it is not able to

01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:50.760
understand the import for the fetch just add one line

01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:53.940
constant fret just like we do an import right in java sorry

01:24:53.940 --> 01:24:58.740
in a python so just like that uh just uh write paste this

01:24:58.740 --> 01:25:01.060
one in the very first line judah line basically you know

01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:05.210
very first one i've just pinned in a chat basically it's an

01:25:05.210 --> 01:25:07.510
import that we are doing so this is how import works in a

01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:12.170
javascript okay just stop side right yeah i've just pinned

01:25:12.170 --> 01:25:14.670
you yeah in a chat copy and paste you know above above that

01:25:14.670 --> 01:25:16.950
yes in a first yeah.

01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:27.100
Now could not cannot find a module node fetch ok what is the

01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:38.040
where is a node fetch ok requires node fetch so buffer from

01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:44.540
buffer ok copy and paste in chat GPT it will give you the

01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:48.220
resolution so like code and error both buffer

01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:05.880
dot to string there is a issue with the buffer from ok you

01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:08.360
have to remove this one buffer dot to string will come

01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:12.020
directly not from yeah remove the from part line number 8

01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:15.620
yeah remove the from part line number 8 yeah from buffer you

01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:19.220
have to remove that part total from buffer all right yeah

01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:24.220
from buffer yes remove this part there is a error there I

01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:30.680
think it should be ok. Buffer dot to string b small still

01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:34.900
there is a buffer b small buffer b same line it

01:26:37.270 --> 01:26:42.670
not fixed yeah test it cannot find the module node fetch ok

01:26:42.670 --> 01:26:46.290
the import that we have done ok in

01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:11.670
any time node fetch is not available ok so maybe you can go

01:27:11.670 --> 01:27:19.200
with buffer dot to state the build sдtp itself incquer wait

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:23.280
fine hmm there is a issue with got it got it got it why it

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:26.160
is giving an issue so basically you like it is not instaling

01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:32.750
into any Tom use this piece the code yes which one code I

01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:35.970
have obtained in a chat ok basically it is independent of

01:27:35.970 --> 01:27:38.550
your node fetch fetch fetch means fetch I am not using

01:27:38.550 --> 01:27:41.470
because fetch library but it is not available in not

01:27:41.470 --> 01:27:45.270
installing entering by the way ok use this piece of the code

01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:46.950
which I have sent it to you ok I am not able to change the

01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:51.810
code no copy and paste over here and go up map the image

01:27:54.530 --> 01:27:56.790
you are done

01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:09.720
yeah invalid fix

01:28:41.690 --> 01:28:45.770
now done yeah worked right yeah so you are now getting base

01:28:45.770 --> 01:28:49.390
uh now you you know the process right you can follow yeah

01:28:49.390 --> 01:28:53.330
yeah so this is what i wanted to tell others also like i

01:28:53.330 --> 01:28:56.350
don't know i do not understand all these things but just i

01:28:56.350 --> 01:29:00.270
went 10 people i just needed to fix and it it fixed like so

01:29:00.270 --> 01:29:03.170
but it's good to understand it's not that hard to understand

01:29:03.170 --> 01:29:06.350
so i'll logically able to connect right that see we just

01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:11.050
have to know uh most of the time what to do how to be able

01:29:11.050 --> 01:29:14.410
to explore but problem with the people are uh most of us

01:29:14.410 --> 01:29:17.250
don't even know what to do then what how they will be able

01:29:17.250 --> 01:29:21.430
to find out how to do it how to do it was even possible

01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:24.690
before right we had a google we have a stack overflow so if

01:29:24.690 --> 01:29:26.770
obviously we were able to find out how to do it we don't

01:29:26.770 --> 01:29:29.350
remember i don't remember all the piece of the code or

01:29:29.350 --> 01:29:31.850
anything right i just know what to do that's it

01:29:35.010 --> 01:29:39.650
okay yeah go ahead go ahead next so now let's convert into

01:29:39.650 --> 01:29:40.910
the base

01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:51.180
now use the same converter that you were using yes i think

01:29:51.180 --> 01:29:54.240
drag and drop that edit file no yeah just okay the image

01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:55.920
part yes mapping

01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:02.320
mapping mapping

01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:31.780
here what it will come mmi

01:30:35.300 --> 01:30:41.360
data mimi type file name file name can be anything mime type

01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:46.260
should be go down go down go down what what was the

01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:51.960
parameter that you have passed before just click on the node

01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:57.880
yeah click on image node mime or json.mime and it is coming

01:30:57.880 --> 01:31:02.540
from where can you please run the step area

01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:08.980
you have to run the previous one right or previous to

01:31:08.980 --> 01:31:09.520
previous one

01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:48.320
yeah so mime is nothing but like what kind of output that

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:52.100
you are looking for so basically file type identifier so

01:31:58.540 --> 01:32:04.120
you can even hard code it if you want so like you can write

01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:11.100
like a base64 mime type as but it will be better if you can

01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:20.860
drag it from before so mime type it will not be able to let

01:32:20.860 --> 01:32:24.000
me see if it is working again

01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:50.280
mime type you have to provide so just try to provide for now

01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:56.360
like image slash png or maybe jpg under uh yeah hard code it

01:32:56.360 --> 01:33:00.400
hard code it yeah remove the parameter remove everything

01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:09.960
remove everything yeah image slash png yeah test now base

01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:15.600
is the value base is not set so let's try to provide for now

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:15.600
like image slash png yeah test now base is the value base is

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:17.020
not set image fine

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:25.720
okay so basically for input field that you have to provide

01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:26.940
input

01:33:34.650 --> 01:33:36.430
field we

01:33:43.470 --> 01:33:48.110
got it here we now we can directly send it back

01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:00.360
so now but

01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:09.620
we are not able to open so if if i do jpg jpg jpg or jpg

01:34:09.620 --> 01:34:12.640
yeah png is also fine like png

01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:32.560
it's creating that not giving me um yeah basically

01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:18.580
like your previous step uh is not giving returning a photo

01:35:19.060 --> 01:35:22.120
so that that's correct so you can see the error right so

01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:25.420
there is a error with the file name the previous step is

01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:27.920
having an issue this is step image 2 is having the issue

01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:53.740
no no issue with the previous one let me i'm just checking

01:35:53.740 --> 01:35:54.900
what is the input it will take

01:36:00.750 --> 01:36:06.350
okay so go back uh base64 you have written over there uh so

01:36:06.350 --> 01:36:12.800
here code node as base64 okay

01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:20.940
so just do one thing a drag uh input field right you just

01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:24.000
change the input field input field is equal to base64 yeah

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:28.640
remove this base64 part drag yeah yes

01:36:33.590 --> 01:36:37.990
then uh this uh output one no no the previous one input

01:36:37.990 --> 01:36:43.170
should be the input should be sorry no no so yeah input

01:36:43.170 --> 01:36:50.100
should be the value uh variable base 64 variable input now

01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:50.540
this one i just changed to the value okay remove that part

01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:56.900
remove it a little bit yeah delete now drag yeah so this

01:36:56.900 --> 01:37:01.620
will be the input it's coming the same no it should not it

01:37:01.620 --> 01:37:04.560
should it should take basically like a json

01:37:06.540 --> 01:37:11.540
yeah it should take json by the way okay now now yeah remove

01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:14.740
the output field output field i mean mention it as an image

01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:26.620
yeah even i small capital anything will work okay yeah image

01:37:26.620 --> 01:37:29.940
and then file name right so it is asking for file name so

01:37:29.940 --> 01:37:33.580
just try to give file name as a any file name like xyg file

01:37:33.580 --> 01:37:37.160
name dot txt or any variable you can try to drag and then

01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:41.740
say right so dot dot dot you have to give file name

01:37:41.740 --> 01:37:44.340
extension as well then only that's the issue with the

01:37:44.340 --> 01:37:47.300
telegram it is not able to now you can give png jpg whatever

01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:51.820
you want give png for example dot yeah dot png yeah that

01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:54.600
will be the file name and then mime type so if you have

01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:57.700
written png here right mime type is equal to png so that

01:37:57.700 --> 01:38:02.260
will be able to understand the file type only same same same

01:38:02.260 --> 01:38:06.780
just just like image slash yeah slash png now do it

01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:14.440
data image is not set input

01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:23.660
field is fine output field is uh just output field make it

01:38:23.660 --> 01:38:29.180
as data d small remove remove remove yeah remove the image

01:38:29.180 --> 01:38:32.800
word from the output just like data data the

01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:45.750
value in problem in node image 2 it should work name

01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:55.080
so you have given just name wise hard code problem in node

01:38:55.080 --> 01:39:00.200
image to the value this and expand the other info part let

01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:05.200
me check the see the error other info other info yeah detail

01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:11.260
error so what is the error the value in data okay go down

01:39:11.260 --> 01:39:16.400
down down the last part yeah just just last so that i can

01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:18.080
see the base

01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:25.520
this is this node module in it and okay go up no

01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:34.080
no this is the value right so workflow execute yeah here

01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:40.080
somewhere so yeah create binary from json uh create binary

01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:46.320
from json okay Okay. So binary from, Oh,

01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:58.720
this is fine. Basically for a string to, and we are passing

01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:00.920
basically for a string here. Oh,

01:40:04.020 --> 01:40:08.340
okay. Put output field in field

01:40:14.830 --> 01:40:18.170
is

01:40:18.170 --> 01:40:22.030
you do all that. Yes. Before that they fall there on the

01:40:22.030 --> 01:40:29.910
data and base and data. And base was basically data. Oh,

01:40:30.090 --> 01:40:35.110
that's, but how do we understand the input? It will not be

01:40:35.110 --> 01:40:37.750
able to understand the input, right? Maybe your value

01:40:37.750 --> 01:40:41.530
variable name was like a base. So that could be the, because

01:40:41.530 --> 01:40:44.010
it has to understand the input node.

01:40:49.450 --> 01:40:53.630
Code node as base 64. Okay. Just, yeah. Click it once again,

01:40:53.710 --> 01:40:58.070
click once again, just write base 64, just input as a base

01:40:58.070 --> 01:41:04.430
64 and output as a data. Base 64 is a name, right? Yeah. And

01:41:04.430 --> 01:41:05.410
then this has a data.

01:41:10.430 --> 01:41:11.490
Now click on view,

01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:21.200
downloads, still giving you. Okay. Just check. Okay. Move

01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:27.930
it. Now hard code it. Hard code this one. Oh yeah. So just

01:41:27.930 --> 01:41:29.570
write something like my image dot PNG.

01:41:32.900 --> 01:41:37.340
Yeah. Anything like no, no space, no space, no space. Yeah.

01:41:42.550 --> 01:41:42.950
Download.

01:42:01.340 --> 01:42:04.260
Everything, everything seems to be correct. I think click on

01:42:04.260 --> 01:42:05.860
download and check once JPEG.

01:42:10.820 --> 01:42:15.640
Yeah. My image could not be opened. It may be damaged or use

01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:19.140
file format that previous doesn't preview doesn't recognize.

01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:23.480
Okay. MIME type you have to change again, right? If you are

01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:26.500
using this, MIME

01:42:30.710 --> 01:42:33.270
MIME type, you have to change MIME type should be like JPEG

01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:34.410
image

01:42:36.970 --> 01:42:37.650
slash yeah.

01:43:18.450 --> 01:43:21.430
No no, it's the same thing. Right? So if there is a file

01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:24.290
MIME in a variable, then it will take it. Otherwise we will

01:43:24.290 --> 01:43:24.850
not take it.

01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:41.680
Go to your like download folder, download folder.

01:43:48.460 --> 01:43:52.040
Okay. My image, it has generated fine. Just check the

01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:52.320
property.

01:43:55.420 --> 01:43:58.300
Yeah, I can see the data into this one. No,

01:44:34.210 --> 01:44:38.590
no, that's fine. It's having issue with the internal one.

01:44:38.710 --> 01:44:39.250
Okay. Yes. Yeah, So

01:44:58.740 --> 01:45:02.220
I think for now we can also do, no, no, no, just, just add

01:45:02.220 --> 01:45:06.000
one more code, one more code layer, add it. It's facing

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.300
issue with the MIME type, add one more code layer, after

01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:12.440
this code layer add one more. We are getting raw base 64

01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:15.060
right, in a code itself will try to like, yeah,

01:45:20.740 --> 01:45:22.520
add code,

01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:43.620
paste

01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:51.180
this one and I'm pinging you more. So basically it's

01:45:51.180 --> 01:45:53.800
conversion from MIME, paste

01:46:02.850 --> 01:46:08.130
this one below that and paste this one below that. Three

01:46:08.130 --> 01:46:12.890
block I have pasted, so three again I have to paste, yeah,

01:46:12.890 --> 01:46:15.570
all three, all three, just, just yeah, down, down this one,

01:46:15.670 --> 01:46:16.570
three blocks,

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:27.480
paste, then the third one. So just trying to handle, because

01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:31.520
raw base 64, anyhow we are able to get it, it's just like we

01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:35.440
have to like handle the. Clean MIME here.

01:46:38.340 --> 01:46:38.860
The

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:54.240
value base 64 is not set, okay. So just drag and drop, yeah,

01:46:56.870 --> 01:47:02.950
remove that base 64. Not from this, I think from another

01:47:02.950 --> 01:47:06.230
one, right? From second, second node, second node of code.

01:47:07.710 --> 01:47:08.230
No

01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:42.130
value conversion I can see like, not giving me PNG or

01:47:42.130 --> 01:47:44.610
something, but input

01:48:07.110 --> 01:48:12.450
field base, base, just give a base. Base is your name,

01:48:12.550 --> 01:48:15.390
right? Yeah. Now still.

01:48:17.780 --> 01:48:22.680
Okay. Okay. I think like we can, we can leave this part, got

01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:25.060
the issue, basically it's a base 64. So got the issue and

01:48:25.060 --> 01:48:29.040
then move to the next part, fixed anyhow, like it's just a

01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:32.360
formatting issue that we are facing. Yeah. Let's go with it.

01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:37.180
Okay. So I think, by the way, from here we got an idea, URL

01:48:37.180 --> 01:48:39.360
we are getting, just we are trying to convert into the

01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:42.200
downloaded file that we can already download, like through,

01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:46.060
through link. But later on we can, I think, fix it. But if

01:48:46.060 --> 01:48:49.760
we want to direct as a file, we wanted as a URL and we can

01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:51.860
download, we can do that. Yeah. You are in the, how we are

01:48:51.860 --> 01:48:54.740
able to send it. So we can render it from there itself.

01:48:56.360 --> 01:48:59.220
Done. So we can, that's fine.

01:49:02.180 --> 01:49:02.560
Okay.

01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:19.180
Fine.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:25.300
So, okay. So I think this is, this is the part that we can

01:49:25.300 --> 01:49:29.340
do. And one more thing I had done over here. That is. Once

01:49:29.340 --> 01:49:33.200
it is converted, it will be sending to my telegram. Along

01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:35.920
with that, I have done two things. First, I have connected

01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:38.860
through Google drive and second, I have connected to sheet

01:49:38.860 --> 01:49:48.260
also. Okay. So if you see over here, so for this, we need

01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:52.780
credentials. Okay. And once we need to set client ID and

01:49:52.780 --> 01:49:58.490
client secret, you connect with Google drive, Gmail, or

01:49:58.490 --> 01:50:01.650
connect with sheet. So for the other now here, again, we

01:50:01.650 --> 01:50:03.950
need to take them on a Google cloud server.

01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:11.220
Because one time it is required over here to add a client ID

01:50:11.220 --> 01:50:15.680
and client secret. Just go with the auth no, just go with

01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:19.580
the second one service account. Instead of going auth two,

01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:24.740
just go with the service account. Okay. So this year we can

01:50:24.740 --> 01:50:26.420
choose a reason or

01:50:29.050 --> 01:50:34.810
we can keep it. Okay. And then we can go

01:50:45.020 --> 01:50:49.560
where we'll find a private key. Okay. You have to log in and

01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:52.240
then you have to create a private key. Basically public key

01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:54.420
or private key, you will be able to, you will have to

01:50:54.420 --> 01:50:58.240
generate basically from your account. Okay. Got it. Similar

01:50:58.240 --> 01:51:03.180
to auth two. So like. Okay. I don't know. I only worked on

01:51:03.180 --> 01:51:06.480
this. So I app link and all, and all those things over here,

01:51:06.620 --> 01:51:10.220
service account, I think we can create.

01:51:25.650 --> 01:51:28.570
So do I need to do right now? I'll teach them. I'll teach

01:51:28.570 --> 01:51:31.510
them. Forget about it. Like I'll teach them. It's very like

01:51:31.510 --> 01:51:34.610
a simple step. One or two step. And if we have like a Google

01:51:34.610 --> 01:51:39.370
cloud console, we can do just with like two clicks. Okay.

01:51:39.590 --> 01:51:43.430
Just like, I think people have already seen, right? So

01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:46.730
whenever we were using a hyper stack, so in case of hyper

01:51:46.730 --> 01:51:49.370
stack cloud where we have deployed, right guys, everyone, I

01:51:49.370 --> 01:51:51.910
think you remember. So we have created a public key. Then we

01:51:51.910 --> 01:51:54.630
have used a party gen. We have like, you know, generated a

01:51:54.630 --> 01:51:57.730
private key. So basically it's like a key value pair that we

01:51:57.730 --> 01:52:00.370
have generated and which we were using for a login. Right.

01:52:00.990 --> 01:52:03.810
Similar kind of a thing. So you have to create a key, maybe

01:52:03.810 --> 01:52:06.710
externally or maybe there itself in a Google cloud console.

01:52:06.850 --> 01:52:09.410
And then you have to just attach it so that your console

01:52:09.410 --> 01:52:11.170
will be able to understand that. Okay, fine. This is the

01:52:11.170 --> 01:52:14.190
password. And then you can use that user ID and password

01:52:14.190 --> 01:52:16.690
anywhere. It means your email ID and that key private key

01:52:16.690 --> 01:52:20.650
anywhere to access any of your Google services. I hope you

01:52:20.650 --> 01:52:23.890
remember from the hyper stack, right? Everyone. Yeah. Same

01:52:23.890 --> 01:52:26.290
thing we have done, right? Same thing we have done. So

01:52:26.290 --> 01:52:28.350
similar kind of a thing. We have to do it here. I'll, I'll

01:52:28.350 --> 01:52:30.750
show you in a later stage. It's just like a one, two clicks

01:52:30.750 --> 01:52:33.790
and then the entire Google, like most of the services you

01:52:33.790 --> 01:52:36.330
will be able to access it just by calling the service name.

01:52:36.750 --> 01:52:42.030
But yeah, leave it like we can move ahead. Done. So then of

01:52:42.030 --> 01:52:44.730
course we can link over a Google drive to upload the photos

01:52:44.730 --> 01:52:48.470
and files. So just like I did it as a add on thing. So I can

01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:52.570
upload, we can choose it from over here. So we can once

01:52:52.570 --> 01:52:57.250
account is added over here. Take an example. AI, we do all

01:52:57.250 --> 01:53:01.410
the detail. You will able to see. That is inside your, you

01:53:01.410 --> 01:53:04.730
know, drive and all. And here you can see, I have created

01:53:04.730 --> 01:53:07.190
some folders also. So this will appear automatic,

01:53:07.470 --> 01:53:11.150
everything, whatever folder we have inside our drive. So

01:53:11.150 --> 01:53:15.850
here you can see, I have folder inside my drive, the same

01:53:15.850 --> 01:53:18.950
image generator on that, that one I selected over here.

01:53:19.570 --> 01:53:23.330
Okay. So it can also, what it is doing, it is just taking

01:53:23.330 --> 01:53:28.870
the same, uh, you know, the file as a binary, as a

01:53:28.870 --> 01:53:31.770
directory. And it is uploading also. It is sending me also

01:53:31.770 --> 01:53:35.470
in telegram, which I can see as a photo file, which you have

01:53:35.470 --> 01:53:38.170
seen as well. All the file that we have created over here,

01:53:38.310 --> 01:53:44.470
all these ones. Okay. That's outstanding all. And the same

01:53:44.470 --> 01:53:47.410
file, it is also uploading over here. And then I have

01:53:47.410 --> 01:53:50.610
connected with Google seat also just to keep the data is

01:53:50.610 --> 01:53:56.550
structured at one place. Okay. So Google state is something

01:53:56.550 --> 01:53:59.790
that, uh, you might need to connect. Again and again, so

01:53:59.790 --> 01:54:04.950
many use cases and email also drive also. So authentication

01:54:04.950 --> 01:54:08.810
part, I think we need to see properly because that is

01:54:08.810 --> 01:54:11.830
important that only you will able to connect all the file

01:54:11.830 --> 01:54:16.430
and everything. So right now, what I'm doing to Google seat,

01:54:16.530 --> 01:54:23.630
I'm just appending the data. Okay. What I'm doing, just

01:54:23.630 --> 01:54:28.190
updating all the files. So it will check. It will check over

01:54:28.190 --> 01:54:31.110
here. Right now. You can see. It will check the image from

01:54:31.110 --> 01:54:35.110
file name, image link. It will check if it is empty. It will

01:54:35.110 --> 01:54:40.210
copy paste. That's all. All the things. So what, what it

01:54:40.210 --> 01:54:44.550
will copy paste image from that it's taking from this

01:54:44.550 --> 01:54:48.770
particular agent, image prompt agent. It will copy paste

01:54:48.770 --> 01:54:53.210
file name that again, it is taking from over here and how we

01:54:53.210 --> 01:54:56.030
are to connect. Like we have to just drag and drop all the

01:54:56.030 --> 01:55:00.090
file name and that will be connected and it is also taking a

01:55:00.090 --> 01:55:03.110
Google drive link because once it's uploaded, the drive link

01:55:03.110 --> 01:55:07.010
will be created. So all I'm saying just also upload here.

01:55:07.150 --> 01:55:10.050
Yes. On dot web view dot link. This is a basically drive

01:55:10.050 --> 01:55:13.090
link that will be created. This is also copy pasting over

01:55:13.090 --> 01:55:20.370
here. And finally, this particular agent is ready. Okay. So

01:55:20.370 --> 01:55:27.310
yeah, so that's how it's being created. All right. So let

01:55:29.450 --> 01:55:30.250
me remove this.

01:55:36.540 --> 01:55:39.220
Yeah. So if you can drop a JSON into like a group, I think

01:55:39.220 --> 01:55:42.020
that'll be better. And let's quickly go ahead to the another

01:55:42.020 --> 01:55:45.020
flow. Like you have so many other flows. Right. So let's go

01:55:45.020 --> 01:55:48.040
ahead with that. Yeah. So now I think the basic part is done

01:55:48.040 --> 01:55:50.900
almost because everything is the size. So how it works

01:55:50.900 --> 01:55:54.040
directly. So they can implement it.

01:56:00.790 --> 01:56:04.970
I can drop in chat also or should I drop in? Drop in group

01:56:04.970 --> 01:56:06.250
itself. Yeah. That'll be better.

01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:24.930
Yes. So I dropped in the chat. Okay.

01:56:27.710 --> 01:56:32.270
So this is all done. Let me take you through directly. You

01:56:32.270 --> 01:56:38.770
know, few cool part that all people can do as a real life

01:56:38.770 --> 01:56:41.850
use cases. So we all are into LinkedIn and because we are

01:56:41.850 --> 01:56:44.950
all into corporate world and we are trying to make money,

01:56:45.050 --> 01:56:47.390
whether it is to do, whether it is all the things. So

01:56:47.390 --> 01:56:49.790
LinkedIn is something that is very important for everyone.

01:56:50.030 --> 01:56:53.290
Right. Like the Instagram and all those things is important

01:56:53.290 --> 01:57:02.690
for personal branding. As a like family and all. So here, if

01:57:02.690 --> 01:57:09.130
you go inside my LinkedIn here, okay. Just tell it. So you

01:57:09.130 --> 01:57:14.250
all the posts that I have generated. So these posts is

01:57:14.250 --> 01:57:17.050
getting posted automatically. It is doing each and

01:57:17.050 --> 01:57:21.150
everything you can see. This is the 17 hours ago. This was

01:57:21.150 --> 01:57:24.130
posted automatically without my manual intervention. So if I

01:57:24.130 --> 01:57:27.130
go and sleep for next one month, this will kept posting.

01:57:28.470 --> 01:57:34.030
Okay. You can see one day ago, two days ago. This is one of

01:57:34.030 --> 01:57:37.710
the most useful like automation that we all need actually.

01:57:38.210 --> 01:57:43.070
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I also tried to send some founders also

01:57:43.070 --> 01:57:45.710
because this is a very huge case for companies and for the

01:57:45.710 --> 01:57:48.350
founders. Everyone, everyone on a social media, right.

01:57:48.370 --> 01:57:52.330
Everyone like it's very much important. Right. Right. Yeah.

01:57:52.430 --> 01:57:55.930
This is something, of course, I added my, some manual

01:57:55.930 --> 01:58:00.250
skills, but yeah, the post and all content. And yeah, this

01:58:00.250 --> 01:58:07.730
is just a video. Let me show you something. Also, which I,

01:58:07.810 --> 01:58:10.990
so yeah. So this one, this one is being directed fully

01:58:10.990 --> 01:58:16.790
against two AI. Why ROI? Very detailed. A lot of details.

01:58:17.090 --> 01:58:20.090
Whatever text we are giving, it is also giving you the

01:58:20.090 --> 01:58:23.890
references like a consultant. No one can say. Okay. You are

01:58:23.890 --> 01:58:26.530
just posting randomly. That is the references for each and

01:58:26.530 --> 01:58:29.810
everything. Salesforce just to radius. But this was a post

01:58:29.810 --> 01:58:32.470
by, I don't care about your numbers, something like that.

01:58:33.070 --> 01:58:37.950
Okay. And it also got a big impression as well. This was too

01:58:37.950 --> 01:58:42.930
much, but that's fine. And, uh, here itself also, you can

01:58:42.930 --> 01:58:48.130
see this goes almost 1258 increases doing the thing. Just

01:58:48.130 --> 01:58:51.330
it, it was posted automatically again with links, references

01:58:51.330 --> 01:58:57.190
and all. Okay. Okay. So this is what I have built something,

01:58:57.290 --> 01:59:00.730
the really which case that I'm still using and I kept using,

01:59:00.870 --> 01:59:05.630
I'll, I'll, I'll keep using this or my company as this, this

01:59:05.630 --> 01:59:08.590
is not only identical my branding. So because in the company

01:59:08.590 --> 01:59:12.030
I'm working every single time, I have to talk to my founders

01:59:12.030 --> 01:59:14.910
and show something that I'm doing. So apart from the sales

01:59:14.910 --> 01:59:18.830
part, I can ask them a better hike at the time of time. Yes.

01:59:19.310 --> 01:59:23.270
I kept impressing. They also be doing so many things. So

01:59:23.270 --> 01:59:29.670
this is our ID at all site also, so here, so the thing I

01:59:29.670 --> 01:59:33.610
wanted to say, we can customize it, what kind of post it

01:59:33.610 --> 01:59:36.530
must be now, because I'm into the construction software

01:59:36.530 --> 01:59:42.530
management of the task service, this AI will post everything

01:59:42.530 --> 01:59:46.310
related to construction only, everything nothing anything

01:59:46.310 --> 01:59:49.890
and very realistic images and all people can relate it,

01:59:49.970 --> 01:59:53.450
optimize your projects and these all thing is being done

01:59:53.450 --> 01:59:59.550
just to AI only, see, okay, so this is also being posted in

01:59:59.550 --> 02:00:10.110
different ID, in my company ID, okay, so I'll give you the

02:00:10.110 --> 02:00:13.730
JSON file of course, so here the Tanya, the another one,

02:00:13.790 --> 02:00:18.530
here the LinkedIn post that I have, so just I'll tell you

02:00:18.530 --> 02:00:22.110
how you can connect to this, so here the main important

02:00:22.110 --> 02:00:25.370
thing, everything we have to work, almost so many things we

02:00:25.370 --> 02:00:29.410
have to work, okay, so first I'll tell you the flow, how it

02:00:29.410 --> 02:00:30.690
works, so

02:00:33.190 --> 02:00:36.070
you can schedule it, like I have to do it, I have scheduled

02:00:36.070 --> 02:00:39.790
trigger and it is active, basically 2 p.m. but it went some

02:00:39.790 --> 02:00:45.550
5 or 6 p.m. something, so it will automatically trigger this

02:00:45.550 --> 02:00:49.310
time, it will go in my seat, so here again, I connected my

02:00:49.310 --> 02:00:55.070
seat also, so how it works, if you go over here in my sheet,

02:00:55.170 --> 02:00:55.850
it

02:00:59.140 --> 02:00:59.140
will go in my seat, so here again, I connected my seat also,

02:00:59.140 --> 02:00:59.160
so how it works, if you go over here in my sheet, it will go

02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:01.840
in my seat, so here again, I connected my seat also, so here

02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:02.480
again, I connected my seat also, so here again, I connected

02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:07.840
my seat also, so here again, I connected my seat also, so

02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:10.800
here again, I connected my seat also, so here again, I

02:01:10.800 --> 02:01:14.880
connected my seat also, so here again, I connected my seat

02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:16.840
also, so here again, I connected my seat also, so here

02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:17.880
again, I connected my seat also, so here again, I connected

02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:18.600
my seat also, so here again, I connected my seat also, so

02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:18.600
here again, I connected my seat also, so here again, I

02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:19.940
connected my seat also, so here again, I connected my seat

02:01:19.940 --> 02:01:22.080
also, so here again, I connected my seat also, so here

02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:26.040
again, I connected my seat also, so here again, I connected

02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:28.140
my seat also, so here again, I connected my seat also, so

02:01:28.140 --> 02:01:30.820
here again, that genre and based on that it will give you a

02:01:30.820 --> 02:01:33.700
suggest suggestion plus you can try so in it and it's

02:01:33.700 --> 02:01:37.520
providing you human uh loop as well so it will come to you

02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:40.560
for approval and if you're approving it uh then basically it

02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:43.940
will like start posting based on like uh your journal so

02:01:43.940 --> 02:01:47.180
again it's not just about like that it is going to like even

02:01:47.180 --> 02:01:50.180
do a research and create the ideations that that is also you

02:01:50.180 --> 02:01:56.240
can configure right okay so this will go in this particular

02:01:56.240 --> 02:02:00.600
seat it will check the topic and here i have set status if

02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:06.040
it is to do means it has to pick it up okay and once it it

02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:09.300
will pick it up as a to do it will create these kind of

02:02:09.300 --> 02:02:13.380
things if email is there then it will uh paste the link if

02:02:13.380 --> 02:02:17.260
it even is not there in that case it will say image not

02:02:17.260 --> 02:02:20.080
created but it has posted the post that is it has copy

02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:23.680
pasted and it will automatically update post it so again and

02:02:23.680 --> 02:02:27.860
again the ai like the agent won't confuse what he has to do

02:02:27.860 --> 02:02:31.740
next just copy and paste the topic maybe it has to do so

02:02:31.740 --> 02:02:37.940
here if you go over here you can see status which value to

02:02:37.940 --> 02:02:42.000
do if it is finding todo then only it will match and it will

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:50.760
get the topic okay so if i just show you right now can you

02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:54.420
see i don't want a legacy of revenue i want a legacy of

02:02:54.420 --> 02:03:00.080
people and here the same topic here you can see i don't know

02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:03.040
on the legacy of so it is taking based on this only that you

02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:11.720
do okay so it will trigger it will go inside the google

02:03:11.720 --> 02:03:16.780
sheet get the topic and after that now here the best part

02:03:16.780 --> 02:03:21.300
again so i'll just download also this one and i'll give it

02:03:21.300 --> 02:03:24.560
to you so do not get confused here i have added so many

02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:29.080
other parts leave it leave it there is the other one so

02:03:29.080 --> 02:03:31.840
actually i was planning to post in the morning in the

02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:34.080
afternoon in the evening three times a day because that's

02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:37.240
not my manual effort right that's why i just tried to create

02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:41.200
it multiple ones but you can test and try this one also

02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:46.440
later all the other parts you can delete all right so let us

02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:50.160
jump over here it will get the data form sheet now this is

02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:53.700
what ai agent i have used and this is the prompt i have

02:03:53.700 --> 02:03:57.120
given that you can do too right it's just you can copy and

02:03:57.120 --> 02:04:00.920
paste so basically what it is doing it is designing a

02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:04.600
process particular post as per linkedin because there are

02:04:04.600 --> 02:04:06.900
some certain conditions you cannot post more than 300

02:04:06.900 --> 02:04:09.940
correct or 3000 characters so it is doing all those things

02:04:09.940 --> 02:04:13.100
it's capturing proper data getting the links and all so how

02:04:13.100 --> 02:04:18.260
it's getting so here because this is my personal uh you know

02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:23.940
the linkedin handle so right now i'm using chat gpt5 model

02:04:24.580 --> 02:04:27.440
and how you can connect the same one just click on create

02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:33.120
credentials go get your api choose the model and then the

02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:36.740
same way then you can choose the model also over here which

02:04:36.740 --> 02:04:40.020
model you want because ah so right now if someone will ask

02:04:40.020 --> 02:04:44.100
is this a great model i think that cloud is better than this

02:04:44.100 --> 02:04:48.700
one for text for the text purpose but now i'll test more and

02:04:48.700 --> 02:04:52.340
more uri also that often we have the cloud is actually

02:04:52.340 --> 02:04:55.440
better for a code generation i believe uh not for like i

02:04:55.440 --> 02:04:58.660
think uh gpt is still like better in terms of doing a

02:04:58.660 --> 02:05:02.300
general purpose task this is what i always feel uh okay so

02:05:02.300 --> 02:05:05.760
gpt four or five you can use both of this uh cloud five is

02:05:05.760 --> 02:05:08.380
basically umbrella model like there is nothing five model

02:05:08.380 --> 02:05:12.640
it's like uh calling mini and then nano and then other uh

02:05:12.640 --> 02:05:16.760
four series automatically based on your like uh input so

02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:19.020
it's kind of kind of umbrella model technically but yeah

02:05:19.020 --> 02:05:22.500
cloud is good but and somewhere even i feel that cloud is

02:05:22.500 --> 02:05:26.600
unnecessarily burning a lot of tokens because when i yeah it

02:05:26.600 --> 02:05:31.380
is also expensive basically it's becoming expensive so i

02:05:31.380 --> 02:05:35.020
have created a like a token burning model basically like the

02:05:35.020 --> 02:05:37.220
kind of output it will give you so if i'm looking for full

02:05:37.220 --> 02:05:40.000
line of output it will end up giving me like a 400 line of

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:43.700
output so obviously it's it's my cost right at my cost they

02:05:43.700 --> 02:05:45.760
are like generating for a line of output because they are

02:05:45.760 --> 02:05:50.160
charging you for the tokens yeah so this is what i feel like

02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:53.660
in a recent release of sonet 4. um before that it was good

02:05:53.660 --> 02:05:57.580
before that it was like balanced one uh so yeah i prefer to

02:05:57.580 --> 02:06:00.880
use gpt if you're giving okay proper way it will be able to

02:06:00.880 --> 02:06:04.080
give you an yeah then that's great i think because this was

02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:06.960
a jumpster in my mind because even i have never used cloud

02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:10.720
because that was costly also but i think this is good i have

02:06:10.720 --> 02:06:13.880
used gpt i have for the texting purpose because this

02:06:13.880 --> 02:06:18.200
research about this give up better kind of you know uh the

02:06:18.200 --> 02:06:22.300
text you can see in linkedin so even with the same prompt

02:06:22.300 --> 02:06:26.300
now if you are not choosing the good model this will vary

02:06:26.300 --> 02:06:29.360
the text will vary sometimes it will feel too much ai

02:06:29.360 --> 02:06:31.520
written and all this so so everything is good can also be

02:06:31.520 --> 02:06:33.300
there unfortunately and we are a good model help but yeah

02:06:33.300 --> 02:06:36.580
chat gpt 5 is i think best right now i have been using it

02:06:36.580 --> 02:06:40.520
yeah so plus i always advise people in terms of prompting

02:06:40.520 --> 02:06:42.880
always go for a few sort few sort means give some example

02:06:42.880 --> 02:06:47.500
and believe me even the worst model will perform better in

02:06:47.500 --> 02:06:50.480
terms of a few sort so just just give an example that i am

02:06:50.480 --> 02:06:52.900
looking for this kind of output this kind of a texture this

02:06:52.900 --> 02:06:55.860
kind of a flavor uh i am looking for some sort of empathy i

02:06:55.860 --> 02:06:58.120
am looking for some sort of a surprises over here i looking

02:06:58.120 --> 02:07:01.280
for some sort of a mixture of hindi english and joke right a

02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:04.500
humorous joe again when you will say joke it will produce a

02:07:04.500 --> 02:07:07.500
bad joke when you will say like a humorous joke which can

02:07:07.500 --> 02:07:10.980
give uh like people a laugh so i'm giving example more

02:07:10.980 --> 02:07:14.900
context right so then it will produce better so basically

02:07:14.900 --> 02:07:18.240
like the problem is not just with the model i would say it's

02:07:18.240 --> 02:07:21.100
it's like when i see 90 problem is with people imaginations

02:07:21.100 --> 02:07:24.100
as well that that's a major problem that imagination right

02:07:24.100 --> 02:07:26.860
of people so if you are going to give a few sort and

02:07:26.860 --> 02:07:30.200
innovative few shot if you are defining just like a good

02:07:30.200 --> 02:07:34.440
storyteller right believe me even the worst one is going to

02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:37.660
work in majority of your cases not all but yeah majority of

02:07:37.660 --> 02:07:40.040
the cases it is going to work well for you worst model i'm

02:07:40.040 --> 02:07:42.800
talking about so this is this is what i have seen i have

02:07:42.800 --> 02:07:44.960
experienced but yeah everyone is having their own

02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:48.980
experiences from their own chatting and prompts yeah no no i

02:07:48.980 --> 02:07:51.780
i think you also build the kind of platform also where the

02:07:51.780 --> 02:07:55.180
like theory so you have all idea okay which platform is

02:07:55.180 --> 02:07:58.400
better than so yeah our team can use our people can use also

02:07:58.400 --> 02:08:03.560
so yeah that is it so i have so right now if you can see i'm

02:08:03.560 --> 02:08:06.660
using tool also previous one i haven't used tool but here

02:08:06.660 --> 02:08:10.820
i'm using tool perplexity why for the wave research because

02:08:10.820 --> 02:08:12.980
every single time when the topic is coming especially

02:08:12.980 --> 02:08:15.840
related to ai or something right it made a data from real

02:08:15.840 --> 02:08:21.840
time so what it does whenever it it getting posted over here

02:08:21.840 --> 02:08:26.440
it will go in chat gpt will restructure all the posts that i

02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:30.900
needed to be posted it will go into perplexity also just

02:08:30.900 --> 02:08:39.160
check and try so let me execute you will able to see okay

02:08:41.560 --> 02:08:47.160
so here here you have been it is again and again going to

02:08:47.160 --> 02:08:51.860
perplexity also hitting perplexity api again just simply you

02:08:51.860 --> 02:08:54.720
can click over here and you can connect to your perplexity

02:08:54.720 --> 02:08:59.660
also as as we connected other as i hit our author both both

02:08:59.660 --> 02:09:01.280
options you have okay

02:09:03.480 --> 02:09:07.260
then it is going to again the image from the same process

02:09:07.260 --> 02:09:10.440
that we learned in in last one night it is creating a prompt

02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:13.780
for the image before giving to the system

02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:22.440
why because text not not might be in a better place okay and

02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:26.400
there was some error so i have i did two things if it is

02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:31.360
structured with emails go post and update if it is not then

02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:35.020
still go and post with text only so this is going this is

02:09:35.020 --> 02:09:37.940
going in this way so what is doing now it's been posted so

02:09:37.940 --> 02:09:40.340
now if you go in my linkedin this post has been created

02:09:40.340 --> 02:09:44.280
automatically okay it's it's posted it's live it is also

02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:48.240
updated in seat as well if i show you in seat here you can

02:09:48.240 --> 02:09:54.220
see yeah it's posted and this is not only here we have done

02:09:54.220 --> 02:09:58.820
i have also integrated with my gmail whatever post i am

02:09:58.820 --> 02:10:03.160
doing getting detailed gmail text format as well so just to

02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:06.440
check and verify if i'm outside or somewhere and it is

02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:11.060
labeling also so labeling yeah can you see right now at 11 8

02:10:11.060 --> 02:10:14.460
and i tell linkedin post i don't want a legacy of revenue

02:10:14.460 --> 02:10:18.960
that's how so this is also mailing me with the same detail

02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:23.160
that i have posted just to recheck and re-verify and if you

02:10:23.160 --> 02:10:26.900
go if you go in my linkedin handle so

02:10:31.510 --> 02:10:33.710
here you guys can see once

02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:39.000
we go in all posts it

02:10:46.140 --> 02:10:49.920
must be shown over here so there might be some time error

02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:53.840
which error if it is exceeded more than 300 000 words

02:10:53.840 --> 02:11:00.940
because linkedin post has its own limit okay there might be

02:11:00.940 --> 02:11:05.900
some time error that you guys can see but in most cases yeah

02:11:05.900 --> 02:11:10.500
here you can see we got it right i don't want a legacy just

02:11:10.500 --> 02:11:15.600
one minute ago this is live posting i have triggered but it

02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:19.920
can be auto triggered also like it was previously all right

02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:23.840
so this is doing all the things so here the main thing that

02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:29.800
you need so let me share in chat box also for you uh the

02:11:31.560 --> 02:11:34.340
json file for the same so you guys can test and try on your

02:11:34.340 --> 02:11:36.540
own the same agent yeah

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:44.580
it's clear yes

02:11:49.830 --> 02:11:53.770
so just i thank you so here the only thing that you need is

02:11:53.770 --> 02:11:56.970
this thing is i think we have trained a lot and you guys can

02:11:56.970 --> 02:11:59.970
connect the only thing you might face an issue to connect

02:11:59.970 --> 02:12:02.550
with your linkedin account so how you guys can connect with

02:12:02.550 --> 02:12:06.490
linkedin account okay so here again you need to put up

02:12:06.490 --> 02:12:10.630
proper credentials create a new credentials then we again

02:12:10.630 --> 02:12:15.630
need a client id to have a secret so uh so the answer here

02:12:15.630 --> 02:12:19.070
do you have any other method also just it's because this is

02:12:19.070 --> 02:12:23.410
the only way i think in linkedin so it will connect to your

02:12:23.410 --> 02:12:32.240
personal linkedin account okay so we can post just a second

02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:36.160
uh i hope so i'm audible right yeah you're audible yes yes

02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:40.280
okay fine so this is something is important uh so let me

02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:43.420
just take you directly to how you guys can do that so you

02:12:43.420 --> 02:12:46.580
can test on a real time basis and here if you have any

02:12:46.580 --> 02:12:50.880
question you can ask me also with this so simple the best

02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:52.900
part about and attend it has everything

02:12:56.480 --> 02:13:00.340
so basically when you go to post, you play this part of the

02:13:00.340 --> 02:13:02.020
code go to home and paste and save the persons here it's

02:13:02.020 --> 02:13:07.200
similar but if you can do this overnight the platform will

02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:12.720
also help you with that so go to

02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:16.360
home

02:13:16.360 --> 02:13:16.680
and paste your personal account there as you see here also

02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:18.360
the you know the profile i am holding is my own account and

02:13:18.360 --> 02:13:26.040
you and i will have

02:13:27.510 --> 02:13:31.410
over here as a new account here you can see standard one

02:13:31.410 --> 02:13:38.190
this is this is one we have we have to use and uh okay and

02:13:38.190 --> 02:13:41.790
here here all the things is being written already what we

02:13:41.790 --> 02:13:45.350
have to do step by step login into linkedin and select this

02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:48.690
link to create a new developer app this is what we needed to

02:13:48.690 --> 02:13:52.150
do this is what we will be doing in so many places this is

02:13:52.150 --> 02:13:55.850
what we will be doing in google google cloud also to create

02:13:55.850 --> 02:13:58.950
an app and then add client secret and all so many things

02:13:58.950 --> 02:14:01.910
this is we will be doing in joho crm also if you have some

02:14:01.910 --> 02:14:06.030
real use cases this we will be doing in whatsapp api

02:14:06.030 --> 02:14:09.990
facebook also right to connect to whatsapp and all and then

02:14:09.990 --> 02:14:12.750
of course these all the details we have to fill so let me

02:14:12.750 --> 02:14:16.130
take you through how we can do step by step so you guys will

02:14:16.130 --> 02:14:20.150
get an idea so first of all we must have an linkedin account

02:14:20.150 --> 02:14:22.410
which must be logged in and we can create

02:14:30.310 --> 02:14:35.350
okay app name we need to keep uh put over here we need a

02:14:35.350 --> 02:14:42.990
linkedin page okay so here either you can create your own of

02:14:42.990 --> 02:14:46.590
course you need to create your own because it will take an

02:14:46.590 --> 02:14:50.710
access to authorize so you guys can create your own linkedin

02:14:50.710 --> 02:14:55.410

create a link take them there okay then just they can create

02:15:33.350 --> 02:15:38.550
simple or okay just so

02:15:42.260 --> 02:15:44.620
if you guys have something in mind you guys can put if not

02:15:44.620 --> 02:15:51.040
then that's also fine okay logo is needed i think so that

02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:57.520
you check what you can do leave it let's create a page fill

02:15:57.520 --> 02:16:02.780
out these details is also there technology okay

02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:16.220
so this is only going to help you initially to post inside

02:16:16.220 --> 02:16:20.020
your personal linkedin account also there will be challenges

02:16:20.020 --> 02:16:22.980
right now so right now what i am showing you i am showing

02:16:22.980 --> 02:16:27.260
you how you can auto post in your personal account for the

02:16:27.260 --> 02:16:30.500
company's account we need to see in another way that i'm

02:16:30.500 --> 02:16:36.720
also uh you know just trying to do which one which one so

02:16:36.720 --> 02:16:39.980
basically there is a issue actually what happens there is

02:16:39.980 --> 02:16:40.820
two two kind of problems which one is the issue which one is

02:16:40.820 --> 02:16:42.220
the first one is the content of post the first one is

02:16:42.220 --> 02:16:46.360
personal post that we can do yeah auto post in a company's

02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:49.940
account the page that that is account yeah yeah right now

02:16:49.940 --> 02:16:55.400
the issue that i face up previously uh if i connect to

02:16:55.400 --> 02:17:00.260
company account okay then i cannot paste in my personal

02:17:00.260 --> 02:17:02.980
account if i am connecting to personal account then i cannot

02:17:02.980 --> 02:17:06.640
paste it into my no create two flow basically for one for

02:17:06.640 --> 02:17:10.220
personal one for company that i also did that i also did but

02:17:10.220 --> 02:17:13.680
then it gets filled so i think that you use a different app

02:17:13.680 --> 02:17:18.080
id basically not the same app id use a different app id so

02:17:18.080 --> 02:17:21.320
basically create one dummy like a page for your personal one

02:17:21.320 --> 02:17:24.900
and technically it requires two uh like a different app id

02:17:24.900 --> 02:17:28.780
okay so then i think that in in this case working i will

02:17:28.780 --> 02:17:32.520
create new credentials for company page with app id in that

02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:38.600
it won't okay yeah fine so now we have created this page and

02:17:38.600 --> 02:17:39.940
uh so

02:17:42.800 --> 02:17:48.280
let's go over here you can just paste over here okay and

02:17:50.330 --> 02:17:53.510
then we need to upload the logo and file if you have

02:17:53.510 --> 02:17:55.190
something anything

02:17:58.710 --> 02:18:04.390
you can upload is just to test and click on create an app

02:18:05.390 --> 02:18:11.370
okay this okay here we have to paste this is a privacy url

02:18:11.370 --> 02:18:17.710
this is not necessary here we have to paste this one click

02:18:17.710 --> 02:18:25.430
on create app i agree first agreement yes yes this one also

02:18:25.430 --> 02:18:27.470
needed this is

02:18:34.960 --> 02:18:36.560
something that it needed to be done

02:18:44.620 --> 02:18:49.110
okay just paste in uh there also in in privacy as well okay

02:18:49.110 --> 02:18:54.990
now of course we can apply

02:18:57.650 --> 02:19:04.530
this request to access here on linkedin okay this is done we

02:19:04.530 --> 02:19:07.770
have to request this one also so we can basically log in

02:19:09.810 --> 02:19:14.530
properly all the terms and conditions must be and this not

02:19:14.530 --> 02:19:19.730
needed now we have to go inside the auth so once you guys go

02:19:19.730 --> 02:19:23.250
inside now here we have client id and the client secret that

02:19:23.250 --> 02:19:30.430
we need to post over there okay so now if we go in our and

02:19:30.430 --> 02:19:39.930
it in here you can see we have to post client id and uh here

02:19:39.930 --> 02:19:46.410
we have to post client secret the paste yes yeah all right

02:19:46.410 --> 02:19:49.090
and we can click on connect my account

02:19:52.660 --> 02:19:57.360
as soon as you guys will now the okay so see now again we

02:19:57.360 --> 02:20:00.320
need to do these things the redirect uri does not match what

02:20:00.320 --> 02:20:05.300
we need to do go here copy and paste this particular uri

02:20:05.300 --> 02:20:08.580
because we need to redirect also right from where where you

02:20:08.580 --> 02:20:10.720
want to do all the things you can see authorized redirect

02:20:10.720 --> 02:20:13.680
uri for your app update

02:20:16.750 --> 02:20:24.260
it once this is done and so this is also one thing we need

02:20:24.260 --> 02:20:28.120
to do it verify that's why i told you you need to create

02:20:28.120 --> 02:20:33.540
inside your company once you click on verify it will

02:20:33.540 --> 02:20:39.660
generate a url copy url paste it so if you have it someone

02:20:39.660 --> 02:20:44.260
else's company then he need to paste it and verify so you

02:20:44.260 --> 02:20:48.640
can see now i'm directly getting an option to verify done

02:20:48.640 --> 02:20:53.560
this is also needed to be done okay i'm done it will be

02:20:53.560 --> 02:20:57.720
showing over here verify also if you come here and if this

02:20:57.720 --> 02:21:01.680
so this is only the part is needed and this is not very

02:21:01.680 --> 02:21:05.140
complex i think this is very easy part this is a standard

02:21:05.140 --> 02:21:08.040
one basically like um like anywhere you will be able to find

02:21:08.040 --> 02:21:10.400
out so whenever you will connect to a linkedin right you

02:21:10.400 --> 02:21:15.500
will do it 100 times so same right right so here once i'll

02:21:15.500 --> 02:21:16.540
connect

02:21:19.160 --> 02:21:19.680
let

02:21:27.520 --> 02:21:32.400
me add again we delete this one just

02:21:38.450 --> 02:21:44.640
go and copy and paste line secret okay

02:21:52.030 --> 02:21:56.530
here we need to switch off this one organization support

02:21:56.530 --> 02:21:57.730
finish

02:22:04.900 --> 02:22:06.460
okay

02:22:09.560 --> 02:22:14.120
now now we got okay so uh sudhanshu here the thing is also

02:22:14.120 --> 02:22:17.960
if if you can explain uh we need to you know switch off

02:22:17.960 --> 02:22:21.760
these two things organization support and legacy then only

02:22:21.760 --> 02:22:22.240
it will be working from there we need to going to slip on

02:22:22.240 --> 02:22:22.240
all this log in here i want to add thing here so let me say

02:22:22.240 --> 02:22:22.240
that something works for fund taxi and also anything you

02:22:22.240 --> 02:22:22.240
can't understand this is disabled or any other thing which

02:22:22.240 --> 02:22:22.940
means you can just leave it on there but me connects to your

02:22:22.940 --> 02:22:30.380
account personal account and this is might be because of we

02:22:30.380 --> 02:22:34.100
we haven't authorized all the other part that we can not do

02:22:34.100 --> 02:22:39.140
that need a manual kind of you know here if we see we

02:22:41.420 --> 02:22:45.620
need manual authorization for all the other parts that might

02:22:45.620 --> 02:22:48.180
be the reason i i don't know because you can see here we

02:22:48.180 --> 02:22:53.770
have other apis that we need to request but

02:22:56.460 --> 02:22:59.440
that's how things work because it was working in my case

02:22:59.440 --> 02:23:01.960
that's why i just like keep doing keep doing like like i

02:23:01.960 --> 02:23:06.680
told you uh i i just get in a huge cases if that's fine for

02:23:06.680 --> 02:23:14.420
me it's great i do not think a lot until it's giving me some

02:23:14.420 --> 02:23:15.600
error so

02:23:18.160 --> 02:23:21.720
like this okay we can allow i

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:38.080
need to change my password now yeah because we all have seen

02:23:38.080 --> 02:23:42.460
that seven thousand eight at the rate okay

02:23:44.120 --> 02:23:48.340
connection is successful so okay now all

02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:52.240
we need to do over

02:23:56.280 --> 02:24:01.140
here we can choose okay so here we have linkedin account

02:24:01.900 --> 02:24:05.720
just enable 2fa at least so that you know even passwords

02:24:05.720 --> 02:24:10.360
only to see it they can't log in i just i have enabled 2fa

02:24:10.360 --> 02:24:14.540
everywhere because generally when i share my screen right so

02:24:14.540 --> 02:24:17.760
sometimes i end up sharing my showing my passwords for many

02:24:17.760 --> 02:24:22.560
other accounts as well because i used to teach a lot so with

02:24:22.560 --> 02:24:25.580
the 2fa so no one can log in even if they are aware about my

02:24:25.580 --> 02:24:26.320
password it's fine

02:25:22.240 --> 02:25:26.740
so guys hope all of you are awake till now yes everyone okay

02:25:31.510 --> 02:25:37.190
so okay once this is done uh here we need to choose so here

02:25:37.190 --> 02:25:41.130
we it will give person name or id so id is for your

02:25:41.130 --> 02:25:43.890
organizational id okay so if you wanted to post in your

02:25:43.890 --> 02:25:48.810
company page okay then here you can see we have id this is

02:25:48.810 --> 02:25:54.230
the id once you go inside where is okay actually just now i

02:25:54.230 --> 02:25:58.990
have added the two fa you know authenticate them compliment

02:25:58.990 --> 02:26:02.770
for you yeah so it's another amazing session so yes people

02:26:02.770 --> 02:26:07.190
are liking it okay okay thank you yeah so every time i don't

02:26:07.190 --> 02:26:09.690
have to come and teach sometime even you guys can bring a

02:26:09.690 --> 02:26:12.070
project a good one and then share the experience i think

02:26:12.070 --> 02:26:14.070
this is how learning happens right learning doesn't mean

02:26:14.070 --> 02:26:16.970
that you know your mentor will come and then talk about some

02:26:16.970 --> 02:26:20.850
topic it's like we are we are trying to build something so

02:26:20.850 --> 02:26:25.810
this is how tech thing is done. happens um yes

02:26:25.810 --> 02:26:31.070
yeah and this is a real-time use case i never use in so many

02:26:31.070 --> 02:26:33.850
places to to fa authentication but this is where we need to

02:26:33.850 --> 02:26:36.710
use once we are in front of so much community anyhow we are

02:26:36.710 --> 02:26:41.210
going to make it few things these kind of sessions are way

02:26:41.210 --> 02:26:44.250
more fruitful than you know the regular sessions that i

02:26:44.250 --> 02:26:47.410
generally used to take so try to participate more and more

02:26:47.410 --> 02:26:49.970
guys i have already given you 10 exam 10 use cases in the

02:26:49.970 --> 02:26:52.730
past i don't think that anyone has completed it so take to

02:26:52.730 --> 02:26:56.110
take it seriously today also i'll give you 20 pick any one

02:26:56.110 --> 02:27:01.290
or two complete it and go for demo right so here if if we'll

02:27:01.290 --> 02:27:03.750
go in company page here you guys you can see this is a

02:27:03.750 --> 02:27:08.170
company id to post in your company right right now we do not

02:27:08.170 --> 02:27:15.510
need it we can simply choose our id over here and rest is

02:27:15.510 --> 02:27:20.790
same just the output you want media if you have now it will

02:27:20.790 --> 02:27:23.790
again post in the same okay so this is what's the main

02:27:23.790 --> 02:27:27.330
important thing over here that you needed to know if you

02:27:27.330 --> 02:27:33.590
were not if you already know that that's great okay so let

02:27:33.590 --> 02:27:37.830
me again just re-change it so it won't give me any any error

02:27:43.060 --> 02:27:46.000
so for the answer i think you might got an idea how i did

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:49.700
this thing not too much deep knowledge got it got it i have

02:27:49.700 --> 02:27:52.180
seen so many students so yeah it's fine i can understand

02:27:52.460 --> 02:27:55.900
everything and what how you think i can understand it now so

02:27:55.900 --> 02:27:59.980
but yeah it's amazing see i think practically speaking this

02:27:59.980 --> 02:28:03.800
is how we all are doing it none of us are like you know even

02:28:03.800 --> 02:28:07.060
experts are not like uh remember everything so it's it's uh

02:28:07.060 --> 02:28:10.460
okay this is how like we just like uh do our brain mapping

02:28:10.460 --> 02:28:12.800
that okay fine this is what we have to do this the thing

02:28:12.800 --> 02:28:15.380
that we have to achieve and step by st we just map it this

02:28:15.380 --> 02:28:18.820
is how we build up big things so i think your approach is

02:28:18.820 --> 02:28:22.440
correct yes and this is the third one which you probably had

02:28:22.440 --> 02:28:23.660
the similarly we just focused on the again a real life use

02:28:23.660 --> 02:28:26.900
cases and not take a lot of time because guys image image

02:28:26.900 --> 02:28:29.300
why this looks impressive it will go for my linkedin post

02:28:29.300 --> 02:28:36.040
today okay just just like you know yeah show me the full

02:28:36.040 --> 02:28:40.260
image i'll take a screenshot i'll post it on linkedin this

02:28:40.260 --> 02:28:45.560
this looks impressive yes basically here i have added so

02:28:45.560 --> 02:28:48.300
many sub agents that's the reason the email agent the

02:28:48.300 --> 02:28:50.840
calendar agent the stock agent so if i wanted to research

02:28:50.840 --> 02:28:54.040
about this talk it will directly give me uh in my linkedin

02:28:54.040 --> 02:28:57.280
the growth architect so basically it is giving me an idea

02:28:57.280 --> 02:29:01.480
about sales and the prompt agent i just give random things

02:29:01.480 --> 02:29:05.740
and it will go inside it so here here the main part the main

02:29:05.740 --> 02:29:10.620
one and here i have given the input the prompt whenever so

02:29:10.620 --> 02:29:13.960
simple just we have to put what agent you want to use based

02:29:13.960 --> 02:29:17.700
on what input right so of course if it is stock someone is

02:29:17.700 --> 02:29:20.860
asking about nifty and all all those things go into the

02:29:20.860 --> 02:29:24.480
stock if someone is asking about event go into the event

02:29:24.480 --> 02:29:30.740
right all those things and here i have used because i'm

02:29:30.740 --> 02:29:34.800
testing a lot that's why i'm using of class google that you

02:29:34.800 --> 02:29:38.180
guys can also use yuri uh you can also use google you can

02:29:38.180 --> 02:29:41.100
also use because of testing you do not need to pay anything

02:29:41.100 --> 02:29:45.540
if you are going to use openai gpt5 you need to purchase an

02:29:45.540 --> 02:29:49.860
uh you know apis the credits you need to put there and then

02:29:49.860 --> 02:29:53.240
only you will able to access or you can purchase an open

02:29:53.240 --> 02:29:56.840
router also from there you can get all the models we can use

02:29:56.840 --> 02:30:00.040
some uh we can use some other tool like think model also so

02:30:00.040 --> 02:30:04.400
it will think and then give it an output okay so just i'll

02:30:04.400 --> 02:30:12.240
so just i think uh yeah they

02:30:12.240 --> 02:30:15.800
can

02:30:15.800 --> 02:30:18.840
just directly do all the things so here i have done also one

here but if someone is asking about image so i have switched

02:30:27.580 --> 02:30:31.080
it so now this will go into the image and it will generate

02:30:31.080 --> 02:30:34.380
an image and it will send me into the into the telegram as

02:30:34.380 --> 02:30:38.300
well okay so just i'll show you so this is basically

02:30:38.300 --> 02:30:42.380
everything at one place just to test and try and show

02:30:42.380 --> 02:30:45.900
someone okay what possibilities are possible here we can add

02:30:45.900 --> 02:30:48.540

yeah actually uh the reason because i again joined you're on

02:32:46.140 --> 02:32:50.380
i also connected with sir at the time of i neuron but that

02:32:50.380 --> 02:32:53.660
time because i was working hardcore into sales morning to

02:32:53.660 --> 02:32:56.060
even so not getting that much time to do all these things

02:32:56.560 --> 02:33:02.200
but yeah so okay because it's not scheduled yeah so you can

02:33:02.200 --> 02:33:05.440
see when it is saying you do not have any schedule at 9 45 i

02:33:05.440 --> 02:33:08.240

02:33:49.120 --> 02:33:52.340
for them to get any other things and all doing so many

02:33:52.340 --> 02:33:57.680
things so just it will take one and two minutes but you guys

02:33:57.680 --> 02:34:01.200
get an idea how it is actually helping in real time not only

02:34:01.200 --> 02:34:03.860
just a fancy thing so

02:34:05.980 --> 02:34:07.300

02:34:13.380 --> 02:34:15.020
a lead yeah

02:34:17.190 --> 02:34:24.870
so here i have this one so this is a simple flow very simple

02:34:24.870 --> 02:34:29.210
flow but very effective so what it what it is doing it is

02:34:29.210 --> 02:34:34.290

here it will collect all the emails that i have done all

02:35:09.840 --> 02:35:15.680

02:35:15.680 --> 02:35:18.340
here one second third so this is the first template this is

02:35:18.340 --> 02:35:22.940
second template this is the third template so what it will

02:35:22.940 --> 02:35:26.640
do it will get all the data there is a rose if you are

02:35:26.640 --> 02:35:31.180
getting first okay so what i'll do right now if you can see

02:35:31.180 --> 02:35:37.420
here it is a to do or in my sheet let me show you here

02:35:40.970 --> 02:35:42.510
though yes

02:35:48.300 --> 02:35:53.640
so uh here just i'll show you you can see here you know

02:35:53.640 --> 02:35:57.820
status all the status to do means it is ready ready to send

02:35:57.820 --> 02:36:00.480
the message in first means send the first template second

02:36:00.480 --> 02:36:03.300
means send the second template third means send the third

02:36:03.300 --> 02:36:09.140
template okay so this anyone can do but the best part i have

02:36:09.140 --> 02:36:14.460
to just click execute workflow so let me show you some real

02:36:14.460 --> 02:36:18.960
time uh same workflow also so

02:36:21.560 --> 02:36:26.920
this is anyway on-site code which is still down here yes

02:36:26.920 --> 02:36:34.200
okay so once i execute it will go it will check if it should

02:36:34.200 --> 02:36:38.800
see you can see five it got five items now what it is doing

02:36:38.800 --> 02:36:42.800
the best use cases of this particular natm it is sending one

02:36:42.800 --> 02:36:47.340
by one email if you send in bombard 200 in one second google

02:36:47.340 --> 02:36:50.980
will spam your gmail what it is doing it is taking one email

02:36:51.500 --> 02:36:55.760
sending the mail updating in the seed waiting for 10 seconds

02:36:55.760 --> 02:36:58.740
i have added loop also waiting for 10 seconds again going

02:36:58.740 --> 02:37:02.360
back again sending mail so that's how it helps not to spam

02:37:02.360 --> 02:37:06.280
and all so someone who is reaching out as a cold outreach to

02:37:06.280 --> 02:37:08.400
different different people to selling your services and all

02:37:08.400 --> 02:37:14.100
you guys can use it this is a real part and here the one

02:37:14.100 --> 02:37:17.120
more thing that is the best that i love it i don't know how

02:37:17.120 --> 02:37:20.960
to do that but i did it so i love it that part so there is a

02:37:20.960 --> 02:37:23.440
tool that is available in the market in those tool

02:37:23.440 --> 02:37:28.720
customization is not available customization is about how

02:37:28.720 --> 02:37:33.340
you want to send the email in which ui right so what i did

02:37:33.340 --> 02:37:38.060
you can see so someone also asked you to do not know how to

02:37:38.060 --> 02:37:40.620
write but how you did it this is how i did it this is the

02:37:40.620 --> 02:37:44.320
whole html code i don't know single thing i just know few

02:37:44.320 --> 02:37:47.720
parts which i need to give in as an input right so what i

02:37:47.720 --> 02:37:51.740
did i went into the chat gpt so this is the real time things

02:37:51.740 --> 02:37:56.420
i have created that's why just i'm showing you and this is

02:37:56.420 --> 02:37:59.760
what impressed my founders also sending mail these things

02:38:00.220 --> 02:38:04.700
anyone can do right but yeah just try to like ask create a

02:38:04.700 --> 02:38:07.920
beautiful mail template for me in html css and it will give

02:38:07.920 --> 02:38:11.700
you that part and then like just like uh put your message in

02:38:11.700 --> 02:38:16.760
between the fields uh yeah so that that's what the chat is

02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:21.400
all about i believe right so the same way the same way like

02:38:21.400 --> 02:38:25.100
uh there was something so i have asked this particular chat

02:38:25.100 --> 02:38:28.680
gpt and they're given a proper this particular html and just

02:38:28.680 --> 02:38:32.460
i'll show you how this email looks like even you guys will

02:38:32.460 --> 02:38:36.300
love it because you have something in your hand it changed

02:38:36.300 --> 02:38:40.340
the whole ui of gmail you know gmail website is fine that we

02:38:40.340 --> 02:38:44.100
can do but we can change in gmail also that you must have

02:38:44.100 --> 02:38:47.340
seen your own emails as well right the mail notification

02:38:47.340 --> 02:38:50.860
that we used to send from your own side uh like uh discount

02:38:50.860 --> 02:38:54.520
and all so yeah similar kind of things basically like okay

02:38:54.520 --> 02:39:01.440
beautiful ui based like a mail not just a regular mail yes

02:39:01.440 --> 02:39:05.500
so even these things is very hard to do with you know with

02:39:05.500 --> 02:39:09.480
some platform because they have their own limitations so

02:39:09.480 --> 02:39:12.720
believe me like i i've used a lot of like a you know crm

02:39:12.720 --> 02:39:15.340
platform and almost all of them gives me like you know

02:39:15.340 --> 02:39:19.220
facility to shoot up a bulk email by creating a template and

02:39:19.220 --> 02:39:22.580
they give a drag and drop template and i've literally used a

02:39:22.580 --> 02:39:26.700
lot in my last like six seven year of my career uh as well

02:39:26.700 --> 02:39:26.700
so that's why it's hard to do that right so like you know

02:39:26.700 --> 02:39:29.440
what's that like what's that like So it's worst, it's not a

02:39:29.440 --> 02:39:32.060
polished one and you know, drag and drop, sometimes it will

02:39:32.060 --> 02:39:35.680
overlap. It just like go and ask GPT and then it will create

02:39:35.680 --> 02:39:37.180
a beautiful one as per my need.

02:39:40.740 --> 02:39:44.740
So let me just say one, just, I just wanted to see, so you

02:39:44.740 --> 02:39:47.380
wanted two templates, you guys get an idea and the best

02:39:47.380 --> 02:39:50.140
part, all three follow up template I have created in

02:39:50.140 --> 02:39:50.880
different, different UI.

02:39:56.250 --> 02:40:01.990
So now You can maybe showcase even your own, your own mails,

02:40:01.990 --> 02:40:04.570
like your own mails from my side, maybe on your registered

02:40:04.570 --> 02:40:07.930
mail ID, you must be receiving a mail, even there we have a

02:40:07.930 --> 02:40:12.390
beautiful template. I don't know. So I'll just show the both

02:40:12.390 --> 02:40:16.390
of them. Yeah. Just, just go to the mail ID that you have,

02:40:16.490 --> 02:40:17.050
where login.

02:41:08.670 --> 02:41:11.650
Yeah. Let me, let me show like your own template. So see,

02:41:11.710 --> 02:41:14.150
this is the, your own template by the way, I believe you are

02:41:14.150 --> 02:41:16.330
able to see one of the mail template, right? I'm sharing my

02:41:16.330 --> 02:41:20.110
screen. Yeah. Yeah. Likewise. I think you are talking about

02:41:20.110 --> 02:41:22.150
a similar kind of a template that you, you, you must have

02:41:22.150 --> 02:41:25.750
created for like a multiple different purposes. So yeah,

02:41:25.830 --> 02:41:28.030
this kind of a template you can create and basically a

02:41:28.030 --> 02:41:32.430
simple HTML CSS with our dataset. That's it. So you can, you

02:41:32.430 --> 02:41:35.030
can create infinite number of this kind of a template where

02:41:35.030 --> 02:41:38.130
it will not be like a regular email. It will be a templated

02:41:38.130 --> 02:41:41.570
emails and it's, it's very easy to even like configure it in

02:41:41.570 --> 02:41:44.430
a, in a tent like Dhruv has done that. Yeah. Dhruv, you can

02:41:44.430 --> 02:41:46.910
share the screen now. I have to stop sharing. Yeah. Yeah.

02:41:46.930 --> 02:41:50.970
Yeah. This is, this is great that this was also, sir has

02:41:50.970 --> 02:41:54.730
just showed the same way, but yeah, just because I'm, I'm

02:41:54.730 --> 02:41:56.710
just doing a kind of, you know, cold outreach. So I have

02:41:56.710 --> 02:41:59.830
created in that way only. Just do one thing. No copy the

02:41:59.830 --> 02:42:03.530
HTML file. Copy that HTML, paste it into like a, your text

02:42:03.530 --> 02:42:07.130
file, save it as a lot of HTML and open it on a Google. They

02:42:07.130 --> 02:42:10.590
will, they will be able to see it now itself. Okay. It's a,

02:42:10.590 --> 02:42:14.710
it's a HTML, right? Go to your node. Yeah. Yeah. I think my

02:42:14.710 --> 02:42:16.810
screen is also visible, right? Yeah. Yeah. It's visible.

02:42:16.950 --> 02:42:21.150
Yes. Yeah. So that's how I created it. So that's how you see

02:42:21.150 --> 02:42:24.870
these UI and boxes and all, because just to, I wanted to

02:42:24.870 --> 02:42:28.830
make it attractive and see, this is simple text, very simple

02:42:28.830 --> 02:42:31.430
text. They can click over here. Once they will click, this

02:42:31.430 --> 02:42:35.250
will take them into my calendar link. Okay. Once they will

02:42:35.250 --> 02:42:38.570
click over here on sitem.com, they will take them in our

02:42:38.570 --> 02:42:42.950
website also. So yeah. And for different, different

02:42:42.950 --> 02:42:44.430
template, let

02:42:47.340 --> 02:42:50.080
me give you the code also. For the different, different

02:42:50.080 --> 02:42:54.240
template, we have created the another one. So I think, yeah,

02:42:54.280 --> 02:42:57.680
this is all I, I think I have created with real life use

02:42:57.680 --> 02:43:01.460
cases. Now just, I wanted to make it more and more into the

02:43:01.460 --> 02:43:06.960
real, real world. So of course, because people are there,

02:43:07.020 --> 02:43:10.200
they just pay for the outcome. So my whole and sole focus is

02:43:10.200 --> 02:43:13.760
there only. Literally people pay for these things. Believe

02:43:13.760 --> 02:43:16.600
me, like this automations and this like a templating and

02:43:16.600 --> 02:43:19.380
other thing. Right. People have created a tool and they are

02:43:19.380 --> 02:43:21.580
charging for it. And now people are like, you know, doing a

02:43:21.580 --> 02:43:23.940
freelancing and the, because at the end of the day, see,

02:43:24.020 --> 02:43:27.940
it's not like a easy for, it looks easy for us, but yeah,

02:43:28.040 --> 02:43:31.360
not easy for like a normal people, but everyone needs it.

02:43:31.740 --> 02:43:34.880
Right. So that's the reason I told you like, go and start

02:43:34.880 --> 02:43:42.220
doing some freelancing after so basic work. Yeah. Yeah. So

02:43:42.220 --> 02:43:44.960
yes, I think this is, this is all that I have created. And

02:43:44.960 --> 02:43:47.600
at the end, if someone is having questions. So I just wanted

02:43:47.600 --> 02:43:50.300
to add one and two things. Like I told initially, if people

02:43:50.300 --> 02:43:53.260
are here now, they waited, I think so few people have gone.

02:43:53.320 --> 02:43:56.160
So many people are here still. So you can save a lot of

02:43:56.160 --> 02:43:58.820
money right now. I think yesterday, Sudhanu sir already

02:43:58.820 --> 02:44:02.160
showed how you guys can create an account. So how, how I

02:44:02.160 --> 02:44:04.480
have did it, of course, investment is needed, but not

02:44:04.480 --> 02:44:06.920
initially investment needed. Initially you can do everything

02:44:06.920 --> 02:44:12.880
free of cost. You now, you have, just to test myself, I

02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:15.340
needed to go with OpenAI and all and all, but now you have

02:44:15.340 --> 02:44:18.360
URI AI. Right. You can test anything, whatever you want,

02:44:18.440 --> 02:44:20.480
image, text and all and all, you do not need to pay

02:44:20.480 --> 02:44:24.420
anything. You do not need to pay anything also. So 14 days

02:44:24.420 --> 02:44:28.160
free trial after that. So how I did, I'd taken three and

02:44:28.160 --> 02:44:30.720
four times of free trial because I was not confident. I was

02:44:30.720 --> 02:44:33.860
sitting for 15 days just to learn about API and all, how it

02:44:33.860 --> 02:44:37.100
works. So many errors, got frustrated, then went into the

02:44:37.100 --> 02:44:40.280
work again, then again came, then again came. So once I

02:44:40.280 --> 02:44:43.220
created my first chatbot and all, that took me around 20, 20

02:44:43.220 --> 02:44:46.480
days and 25 days. Then later on, these things came again and

02:44:46.480 --> 02:44:50.660
again. And it is still taking time. So firstly, I did it

02:44:50.660 --> 02:44:53.560
with a free trial, then for a month, I purchased and

02:44:53.560 --> 02:44:57.820
attained at the cost of 3000 something. But I was in a plan,

02:44:57.920 --> 02:45:01.800
okay, I'll give because I think it can create a lot of value

02:45:01.800 --> 02:45:04.400
in terms of learning, in terms of real impact, later on I

02:45:04.400 --> 02:45:07.980
can charge from anyone. So that's why I was in a thought,

02:45:08.060 --> 02:45:10.960
but after paying a month, then I came up with the knowledge

02:45:10.960 --> 02:45:15.200
VPS. Till then, I didn't have idea about VPS. I know about

02:45:15.200 --> 02:45:16.620
server and all. Because we are also putting a lot of money

02:45:16.620 --> 02:45:19.280
into it. We are putting our software in AWS and all, but not

02:45:19.280 --> 02:45:23.920
an idea that okay, we can also host and attain in VPS, plus

02:45:23.920 --> 02:45:27.500
local server also. But local I haven't hosted, though I'm

02:45:27.500 --> 02:45:29.960
using MacBook, but even I'm not suggesting anyone because

02:45:29.960 --> 02:45:33.460
that is not live, takes a lot of time, which is unnecessary

02:45:33.460 --> 02:45:38.360
for everyone. If we can do it as a project, because one deep

02:45:38.360 --> 02:45:42.760
seek came that I hosted locally in my terminal, it was

02:45:42.760 --> 02:45:46.580
replying me. So I have an idea how to do that. So now I host

02:45:46.580 --> 02:45:49.980
it. I hosted in Hostinger. So if we go with Hostinger VPS,

02:45:50.160 --> 02:45:53.180
it is almost 1 sixth of the cost and it is working pretty

02:45:53.180 --> 02:45:56.840
fine. You guys can see right now, whatever I'm showing, I'm

02:45:56.840 --> 02:46:01.560
showing at the 1 sixth of the actual and attain cost. No

02:46:01.560 --> 02:46:04.940
changes. The only thing we need to manually update. So you

02:46:04.940 --> 02:46:07.540
guys are in enough smart to go in terminal and update the,

02:46:07.580 --> 02:46:10.280
you know, virtual and all those things. That's what I wanted

02:46:10.280 --> 02:46:14.640
to add with all the rest of people, because this cost me

02:46:14.640 --> 02:46:20.650
3000, that's why. Yeah. So that's like literally impressive.

02:46:20.770 --> 02:46:23.990
So guys, you can maybe try to use a Hostinger, just another

02:46:23.990 --> 02:46:27.010
hosting platform by the way. Yeah. But yes, cost wise, like,

02:46:27.030 --> 02:46:30.970
uh, uh, as, uh, Dhruv has already like mentioned. 400, 500,

02:46:31.250 --> 02:46:35.130
400, 516. If someone is paying 28 euros, they can pay

02:46:35.130 --> 02:46:38.710
somewhere around like four and five euros. That's all. Yeah.

02:46:38.830 --> 02:46:41.690
Yeah. So you can, you can just try to do it. You're going to

02:46:41.690 --> 02:46:43.630
be saying not easy to get freelancing. Very competitive.

02:46:43.970 --> 02:46:49.530
See, uh, I'm like, everything is competitive. So basically

02:46:49.530 --> 02:46:52.610
we try to appear for IT exams and then that is competitive.

02:46:52.790 --> 02:46:55.370
Then UPSC that is competitive. We prepare for the job that

02:46:55.370 --> 02:46:58.170
is competitive. We get out of the college that is also

02:46:58.170 --> 02:47:00.510
competitive. Life itself is all about the competition,

02:47:00.690 --> 02:47:03.850
right? So you can't come and say that like, uh, everything

02:47:03.850 --> 02:47:06.450
is competitive. Yes, there is a competitive, like there is a

02:47:06.450 --> 02:47:09.950
competition, right? But, uh, if you are in maybe top 1% or

02:47:09.950 --> 02:47:13.210
5%, there is an opportunity for you. So you can't, uh, keep

02:47:13.210 --> 02:47:16.250
on crying that, uh, there is a competition. If there is a

02:47:16.250 --> 02:47:18.650
competition, then it's fine. Like go and sleep. Take a rest.

02:47:18.790 --> 02:47:21.910
Why to, you know, study? Why to do something? Uh, just chill

02:47:21.910 --> 02:47:26.450
out and enjoy your life as long as you can. Simple, right?

02:47:26.710 --> 02:47:29.570
Uh, otherwise, anyhow, you, anything you are doing in

02:47:29.570 --> 02:47:31.770
today's world, right? Uh, even you're thinking about the

02:47:31.770 --> 02:47:34.870
startup and, and again, so we are living in a world. We are

02:47:34.870 --> 02:47:37.990
living in an era now. So we have no idea is new. Every idea

02:47:37.990 --> 02:47:41.010
is old. The only things which matters is the execution,

02:47:41.270 --> 02:47:44.750
right? If you will come and say that, okay, fine. So I have

02:47:44.750 --> 02:47:47.590
this idea. I can show you hundreds of like companies who

02:47:47.590 --> 02:47:48.770
have already invested. Who have already implemented those

02:47:48.770 --> 02:47:52.030
ideas, right? And thousand other who is already working on

02:47:52.030 --> 02:47:55.610
those ideas. So technically idea is not having any kind of a

02:47:55.610 --> 02:47:58.890
value. Your thought is not having any kind of values. Uh, if

02:47:58.890 --> 02:48:01.990
you have to like a go ahead of all the competitions, the

02:48:01.990 --> 02:48:06.190
only thing which matters is a execution. Simple, right? See,

02:48:06.290 --> 02:48:08.970
but like this, this idea that Dhruv has shown it to you. So

02:48:08.970 --> 02:48:11.610
basically if he would have just thinking about like, uh,

02:48:11.750 --> 02:48:14.070
okay, I'll do this, I'll do this, I'll do this. He was not

02:48:14.070 --> 02:48:16.430
able to do it right. He, he would have thinking that, okay,

02:48:16.430 --> 02:48:18.390
fine. I'll learn coding. I'll learn this. I'll learn that.

02:48:18.430 --> 02:48:21.570
Then I'll do this. No, this doesn't works in that way. At,

02:48:21.610 --> 02:48:24.410
uh, at least a real life doesn't works in that way. Right?

02:48:24.430 --> 02:48:26.830
Real life work doesn't works in that way. He has taken a

02:48:26.830 --> 02:48:29.090
challenges. He has kept on experimenting and now he has,

02:48:29.090 --> 02:48:32.630
he's giving a demo, right? A better demo than any other

02:48:32.630 --> 02:48:35.470
coder or someone. And again, he's using it in a real life,

02:48:35.550 --> 02:48:38.370
right? To earn his bread and butter and on some sort of like

02:48:38.370 --> 02:48:41.830
a extra money as well. And to solve the client problem. So

02:48:41.830 --> 02:48:45.650
this is how actually things happens. You get inspired by

02:48:45.650 --> 02:48:48.450
something. Uh, at some point of time, even he got inspired

02:48:48.450 --> 02:48:51.270
by this or something. Right? Then he has started exploring

02:48:51.270 --> 02:48:54.490
it. And then now he's able to like, uh, create, uh, a good

02:48:54.490 --> 02:48:56.930
one, a massive workflow, which, which works in a real time.

02:48:57.010 --> 02:49:00.650
Right? So you just, you have to like get inspired by, uh,

02:49:00.770 --> 02:49:04.190
maybe some moments. And then ultimately the things which

02:49:04.190 --> 02:49:08.550
matters is execution. Sit and do it. Doesn't matter what

02:49:08.550 --> 02:49:12.710
happens in the world. Just sit and do it. That's it. Uh,

02:49:12.710 --> 02:49:15.470
there is, there is no alternative to this one, but as simple

02:49:15.470 --> 02:49:20.730
as that. Yeah. Any session or thought lies on hosting any

02:49:20.730 --> 02:49:24.030
workflow also. See, if you are using any platform itself by

02:49:24.030 --> 02:49:26.190
default, it's hosted, just make it active and then it is

02:49:26.190 --> 02:49:29.690
hosted. So you don't have to like, you know, host it. And if

02:49:29.690 --> 02:49:31.650
you are like, uh, try to bring it on some other cloud

02:49:31.650 --> 02:49:35.550
platform, right? Either a VPS or maybe either a EC2 platform

02:49:35.550 --> 02:49:38.990
or in any system, right? VPS is also basically a machine

02:49:38.990 --> 02:49:41.970
that provides you a shared machine by the way. So VPS is not

02:49:41.970 --> 02:49:44.590
like very different. It's a cloud concept. But yeah.

02:49:44.590 --> 02:49:47.590
Technically you will be able to get a compute, right? So you

02:49:47.590 --> 02:49:50.390
can use AWS Azure, GCP or hundreds other cloud provider, and

02:49:50.390 --> 02:49:53.130
then you can try to like a host it anywhere, just like any

02:49:53.130 --> 02:49:56.190
other like application simple and like open the port and

02:49:56.190 --> 02:49:59.530
then, uh, you can, you can try to configure your URL as

02:49:59.530 --> 02:50:03.230
simple as that. I have also created a short video, uh, how

02:50:03.230 --> 02:50:06.290
to host anything in Hostinger. So if you want, I can put

02:50:06.290 --> 02:50:08.810
that video link. Please, please do that. Yeah. So I think

02:50:08.810 --> 02:50:11.510
that will solve a problem for surprise. Yeah. So surprise

02:50:11.510 --> 02:50:16.230
was having this question. Yeah. Yeah. So see, just us ask,

02:50:16.270 --> 02:50:19.430
and I think you will be able to get the solution. Okay. So

02:50:19.430 --> 02:50:22.410
if anyone is having any kind of a question, not from me

02:50:22.410 --> 02:50:25.370
today, uh, from Dhruv, so please go ahead. If Dhruv will not

02:50:25.370 --> 02:50:28.270
be able to answer, then obviously I'll try. Uh, yeah. So

02:50:28.270 --> 02:50:29.950
please raise your hand guys, if you have any kind of a

02:50:29.950 --> 02:50:35.290
question. So Dhruv, you have a question from Dhruvil. Okay.

02:50:37.470 --> 02:50:40.250
Yeah. Go ahead Dhruvil. Sorry. Sorry. I don't have a

02:50:40.250 --> 02:50:43.610
question for Dhruv. I have a question for you. And uh,

02:50:44.030 --> 02:50:46.910
thanks for a wonderful session. A lot of learning from your

02:50:46.910 --> 02:50:51.630
end. Okay. Go ahead with the question. Yeah. So like, uh,

02:50:51.670 --> 02:50:55.610
last week we had a Cesar on QA, right? Implementation using

02:50:55.610 --> 02:51:00.270
open AI. Hmm. So I was trying to use our URI things, right?

02:51:00.350 --> 02:51:05.670
Here we've been, so there were a lot of, uh, things that I

02:51:05.670 --> 02:51:08.830
need to do something from my end. So like, uh, I use the,

02:51:08.850 --> 02:51:12.770
uh, URI API SDK version for Python, right? Hmm. So there are

02:51:12.770 --> 02:51:12.890
a lot of things that I need to do something from my end. few

02:51:12.890 --> 02:51:16.310
things that i i had to i have to do some changes on the

02:51:16.310 --> 02:51:19.870
package from itself right because there are something that

02:51:19.870 --> 02:51:23.850
that is missing from there and right and also i try to

02:51:23.850 --> 02:51:28.510
modify the code from my end so now it is working as as we

02:51:28.510 --> 02:51:32.570
are like uh we it was working with the open air right so

02:51:32.570 --> 02:51:35.930
like uh it's a identity compatibility issue by the way

02:51:35.930 --> 02:51:39.250
because crew ai lanche and langra what they have done so

02:51:39.250 --> 02:51:42.350
basically they have made their library compatible directly

02:51:42.350 --> 02:51:44.970
with the open ai so whatever you have additionally written

02:51:44.970 --> 02:51:48.270
in that so they have already handled it for open ai just in

02:51:48.270 --> 02:51:50.970
the open a format because open a follows one of the pidentic

02:51:50.970 --> 02:51:53.830
formats where like this kind of a data will come as an input

02:51:53.830 --> 02:51:55.910
and this is something which i will give as an output it's

02:51:55.910 --> 02:51:59.490
already been handled by default but for a custom hosting as

02:51:59.490 --> 02:52:02.070
yuri is basically like provides you a custom hosting right

02:52:02.070 --> 02:52:04.490
it's it's our platform we have hosted it and we have defined

02:52:04.490 --> 02:52:06.930
that what will be the input what will be the output so you

02:52:06.930 --> 02:52:10.250
have to make it compatible and to do that yeah the code you

02:52:10.250 --> 02:52:12.550
have added that that's the only differences apart from that

02:52:12.550 --> 02:52:14.450
there won't be any kind of differences you will be able to

02:52:14.450 --> 02:52:20.870
find out uh yes right sir yeah so that was the question yeah

02:52:20.870 --> 02:52:24.130
that was a patient so just i tried to make it working

02:52:24.130 --> 02:52:27.630
condition with the help of uda like api so just i will try

02:52:27.630 --> 02:52:31.850
to share the repo things if anyone wants to like use ud api

02:52:31.850 --> 02:52:35.430
if anyone finds something on struggling to use so i can just

02:52:35.430 --> 02:52:37.710
share it so someone yeah i think i think that'll be better

02:52:37.710 --> 02:52:41.050
just share that share that snippet because like once we'll

02:52:41.050 --> 02:52:45.850
be able to create a llm object after that it's fine yeah so

02:52:45.850 --> 02:52:49.690
just till creating llm objects uh i think it was a pain and

02:52:49.690 --> 02:52:53.490
that is something that you have resolved right yeah so yeah

02:52:53.490 --> 02:52:57.130
so yeah i did some changes in the inside the client.py and

02:52:57.130 --> 02:53:01.990
the crew.py from the yuri sdks itself before yeah i got it

02:53:01.990 --> 02:53:04.410
got the point already like we are aware about it and

02:53:04.410 --> 02:53:07.650
whenever you will use any custom hosting right you will have

02:53:07.650 --> 02:53:12.330
to hand it any any time by default not just yuri maybe you

02:53:12.330 --> 02:53:14.910
are like doing some sort of a custom hosting from like your

02:53:14.910 --> 02:53:17.530
platform then you have to handle it and then once you will

02:53:17.530 --> 02:53:18.790
handle everything will work

02:53:23.210 --> 02:53:28.990
so actually i have uh so in uh g drive so like 12 files i

02:53:28.990 --> 02:53:32.610
have so just i want to automate directly for 12 mil i want

02:53:32.610 --> 02:53:36.750
to send through this and it and is it possible so obviously

02:53:36.750 --> 02:53:43.980
it's possible yes yeah that was the question uh that is okay

02:53:43.980 --> 02:53:47.040
yeah that is possible because even through has shown you

02:53:47.040 --> 02:53:49.440
right so he is able to access the drive if you are able to

02:53:49.440 --> 02:53:52.240
access the drive and inside the drive if you have a file

02:53:52.240 --> 02:53:55.060
maybe file any kind of format you can just pass those file

02:53:55.060 --> 02:53:58.560
or data or just pass it uh like and even if it is

02:53:58.560 --> 02:54:00.840
unstructured one pass it to the agents and then agent will

02:54:00.840 --> 02:54:04.960
be able to like fetch all kind of data that you have and

02:54:04.960 --> 02:54:12.100
then like configure your flow okay next one is like a ram uh

02:54:12.100 --> 02:54:17.120
hi so thank you uh so i have some three set of questions uh

02:54:17.120 --> 02:54:20.540
the point number one is execution flow actually you have

02:54:20.540 --> 02:54:25.200
shown the demo uh everything in one pages right and uh when

02:54:25.200 --> 02:54:28.300
you run the execution flow uh at a time and run all the

02:54:28.300 --> 02:54:30.880
things or what about that no no so he was selecting the

02:54:30.880 --> 02:54:34.140
bottom one right so in education that there was a triangle

02:54:34.140 --> 02:54:37.000
you must have seen and he was again and again clicking on

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.260
the triangle so let's suppose in one page there are three

02:54:39.260 --> 02:54:41.720
flows so he was selecting a particular flow and then he was

02:54:41.720 --> 02:54:46.480
running it at a time one every time only one flow so you can

02:54:46.480 --> 02:54:50.060
you can i think so so the screen uh screen where you had a

02:54:50.060 --> 02:54:51.980
multiple flow right so he was selecting it again and again

02:54:51.980 --> 02:54:55.300
in a triangle one yeah should we make manual step or is

02:54:55.300 --> 02:54:58.360
there any automation we directly uh automatically when we

02:54:58.360 --> 02:55:03.380
you should keep only one flow yes generally one like here

02:55:03.380 --> 02:55:06.840
you that one because multiple linkedin figures that but here

02:55:06.840 --> 02:55:10.820
you can see we have one flow right just simple and clear we

02:55:10.820 --> 02:55:13.420
can keep it one flow other you can keep it as for learning

02:55:13.420 --> 02:55:15.520
and all because sometimes you need to connect so many things

02:55:15.520 --> 02:55:19.380
but yeah the main thing maybe just just do one thing like uh

02:55:19.380 --> 02:55:24.280
import any any node just just here itself so here itself you

02:55:24.280 --> 02:55:26.260
can do it maybe just for testing but you can delete it in a

02:55:26.260 --> 02:55:30.820
later state just here plus plus click on plus yeah like yeah

02:55:30.820 --> 02:55:36.920
any anyone or create a flow fine like create dummy flow so

02:55:39.860 --> 02:55:44.600
yeah create any any node no no no need to yeah just create

02:55:44.600 --> 02:55:47.640
any node trigger manually yeah trigger manually choose it

02:55:47.640 --> 02:55:54.660
trigger manually itself choose it yeah this one is one flow

02:55:54.660 --> 02:55:57.360
and then like choose again on anyone like trigger manually

02:55:57.360 --> 02:56:02.960
itself you can choose yeah anything anything any any node

02:56:02.960 --> 02:56:07.260
yeah just now you will be so basically we have like a two

02:56:07.260 --> 02:56:09.640
separate separate flow you can create and when you will try

02:56:09.640 --> 02:56:12.780
to execute it right so just beside the execution flow you

02:56:12.780 --> 02:56:13.920
will be able to see the same thing like the flow is going to

02:56:13.920 --> 02:56:13.920
be the same thing you can execute one or another so you can

02:56:13.920 --> 02:56:15.160
see how it works with the help of triangle option and then

02:56:15.160 --> 02:56:17.440
with the help of triangle option so you can execute one or

02:56:17.440 --> 02:56:27.040
other right what at a time one in one page yes so if if you

02:56:27.040 --> 02:56:30.340
do multiple things in one single within that so you can see

02:56:30.340 --> 02:56:34.160
over here right see here yeah then schedule will work why

02:56:34.160 --> 02:56:36.760
because schedule you can create multiple times for the same

02:56:36.760 --> 02:56:40.240
thing because take an example let's take a link in uh

02:56:40.240 --> 02:56:42.480
linkedin post example if i have to post

02:56:46.360 --> 02:56:50.260
personal so i need to post multiple things so instead of

02:56:50.260 --> 02:56:53.060
either i create three different workflow that is also fine

02:56:53.060 --> 02:56:57.780
or you can create first at 10 a.m second 2 p.m third 8 p.m

02:56:57.780 --> 02:57:00.740
that is how you can also use but in magnum cases you just

02:57:00.740 --> 02:57:04.220
need simple ui instead of single page with one trigger rest

02:57:04.220 --> 02:57:07.600
you can when it will be active so it all will be active

02:57:07.600 --> 02:57:10.660
basically like see in one pages if i am doing it manually

02:57:10.660 --> 02:57:13.980
then i have to select it from the bottom one and let's

02:57:13.980 --> 02:57:16.280
suppose if i have already created a multiple flow and i have

02:57:16.280 --> 02:57:19.020
made it active active means now it's in the production so

02:57:19.020 --> 02:57:21.820
basically all flow will run if even if i created a 10 flows

02:57:21.820 --> 02:57:25.300
so all 10 flows will run but just on a safer side and just

02:57:25.300 --> 02:57:29.680
to remove or mitigate the chaos one flow one page is a good

02:57:29.680 --> 02:57:32.420
idea but yeah even you can go ahead with a multiple one but

02:57:32.420 --> 02:57:36.120
while testing so you have to select and then test it yeah

02:57:36.120 --> 02:57:39.840
hope this answers your question yeah yes yes i'm clear and

02:57:39.840 --> 02:57:43.260
then my next question uh for the connectivity part right and

02:57:43.260 --> 02:57:46.920
do you we going to connect g drive or linkedin or something

02:57:46.920 --> 02:57:50.420
so do you have any pre-domain call documentation from the

02:57:50.420 --> 02:57:53.540
portal everywhere every in every node every node you will

02:57:53.540 --> 02:57:56.400
see the documentation for example just open up any node uh

02:57:56.400 --> 02:57:59.380
for example like a linkedin yeah you can open up git as well

02:57:59.380 --> 02:58:03.560
linkedin or get anything open up yeah fine see uh just uh

02:58:03.560 --> 02:58:09.340
pick the node yes now docs click on docs click on docs yeah

02:58:09.340 --> 02:58:13.440
so for every node you click click on that so for every node

02:58:13.440 --> 02:58:16.180
you will be able to find out a proper documentation and

02:58:16.180 --> 02:58:18.400
whatever parameter that you have to set basically with

02:58:18.400 --> 02:58:21.800
respect to a login everything basically in it and has

02:58:21.800 --> 02:58:25.560
documented in a beautiful manner and you can just directly

02:58:25.560 --> 02:58:29.680
refer to it yeah yeah can you please share the link that

02:58:29.680 --> 02:58:32.880
should be useful no no so just call the node no i have not

02:58:32.880 --> 02:58:35.720
there is no link for that basically like just go for the n8n

02:58:35.720 --> 02:58:38.780
documentation and see i have just imported the node in every

02:58:38.780 --> 02:58:40.980
node you will see the doc option doc has a link okay good

02:58:40.980 --> 02:58:44.200
option okay every every node so just click on that dock and

02:58:44.200 --> 02:58:46.540
then you will be able to get into a dock of that node you

02:58:46.540 --> 02:58:49.280
don't have to even go and search for google anything see

02:58:49.280 --> 02:58:52.820
again doc option is there right yes yes right are you able

02:58:52.820 --> 02:58:56.460
to see it parameters setting and then docs yeah yeah correct

02:58:56.460 --> 02:58:59.080
yeah so simple you can go to that that particular dogs

02:58:59.080 --> 02:59:01.600
because there will be hundreds of not hundreds i would say

02:59:01.600 --> 02:59:04.260
there are like 1700 integration they have given you so

02:59:04.260 --> 02:59:10.460
technically more than 2000 pages right yeah and through

02:59:10.460 --> 02:59:16.560
shared some template right we need to uh upload into our n8n

02:59:16.560 --> 02:59:20.400
import yeah just just click on import and then you can try

02:59:20.400 --> 02:59:23.060
to you know uh set your credentials it will ask for the

02:59:23.060 --> 02:59:25.580
credentials set your own credentials and then it will work

02:59:25.580 --> 02:59:29.220
same flow for you yeah only for connectivity part right all

02:59:29.220 --> 02:59:32.560
the activity part you just have to if like sort out the

02:59:32.560 --> 02:59:37.660
connectivity part okay okay then my next question is the per

02:59:37.660 --> 02:59:40.820
coasting part right coasting part uh i think through

02:59:40.820 --> 02:59:45.320
mentioned that it's a 3000 for every month so can we create

02:59:45.320 --> 02:59:47.880
the multiple account with the difficulty my lady for every

02:59:47.880 --> 02:59:50.280
14 days something production production you can't do it

02:59:50.280 --> 02:59:53.340
right in every 14 days you won't be like you know migrating

02:59:53.340 --> 02:59:56.140
a workflow yes for a practice purposes if you don't want to

02:59:56.140 --> 02:59:58.400
pay then you can try to create like a different account 14

02:59:58.400 --> 03:00:03.020
14 days that's okay but once you will like you know create a

03:00:03.020 --> 03:00:06.720
final workflow which which should run then you need only one

03:00:06.720 --> 03:00:10.100
account so this is this is the reason those have given you a

03:00:10.100 --> 03:00:12.300
solution that instead of paying 3000 maybe you can try to

03:00:12.300 --> 03:00:15.620
like host it on your own platform anywhere you want which is

03:00:15.620 --> 03:00:19.420
going to cost you less which one currently show that is

03:00:19.860 --> 03:00:25.560
hosting the hostinger is uh one of the platform just uh let

03:00:25.560 --> 03:00:28.940
me show you also live you guys can get an idea what i was

03:00:28.940 --> 03:00:37.600
exactly talking about uh so and even inside it also and i

03:00:37.600 --> 03:00:39.720
didn't also if you guys go they have also mentioned there is

03:00:39.720 --> 03:00:42.920
complete version there is their own cloud version so there

03:00:42.920 --> 03:00:46.200
is not too much differences because initially i was in doubt

03:00:46.200 --> 03:00:50.580
who will i able to do run or not okay and the best part in

03:00:50.580 --> 03:00:54.900
both places you will get unlimited executions okay so right

03:00:54.900 --> 03:01:00.590
now you can see they have this one and they have just

03:01:00.590 --> 03:01:04.470
decreased a little bit cost also 24 euro okay so this is

03:01:04.470 --> 03:01:08.070
they are charging what i'm saying i'll just share the link

03:01:08.070 --> 03:01:11.270
also if i can can i share a referral link also to the answer

03:01:11.270 --> 03:01:14.710
in group or uh yes yes yes share the hosting hosting is

03:01:14.710 --> 03:01:16.910
again like those who are just starting this so no babadala

03:01:16.910 --> 03:01:20.050
pen everyone knows about it i believe but yeah maybe some

03:01:20.050 --> 03:01:22.170
people in this group are not aware about it so maybe you can

03:01:22.170 --> 03:01:27.530
paste the link hostinger and even i have two links i

03:01:27.530 --> 03:01:30.730
personally use my own link for a referral so i can take some

03:01:30.730 --> 03:01:33.810
money and all so then send that referral link know to

03:01:33.810 --> 03:01:36.350
everyone everyone will log in and then you will get some

03:01:36.350 --> 03:01:41.230
referral yes so here if you guys go here we have all the

03:01:41.230 --> 03:01:45.010
things we all need to do at previous okay we all need to do

03:01:45.010 --> 03:01:45.850
add videos because i have created for webpages also for

03:01:45.850 --> 03:01:48.450
webpages also I have created a site over here and here you

03:01:48.450 --> 03:01:53.310
can see all the plants okay so here if you once you click

03:01:53.310 --> 03:01:56.650
I'll just send you the direct link and this will pop up this

03:01:56.650 --> 03:01:59.550
so let me show you directly

03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:06.600
so

03:02:08.940 --> 03:02:13.140
by the way in in the video now I have shared all these

03:02:13.140 --> 03:02:16.880
things also how to fix yeah I think we should also show to

03:02:16.880 --> 03:02:19.600
some website different website we installed application but

03:02:19.600 --> 03:02:26.000
this is there any different this one on that one at the end

03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:28.100
of the day you just need a compute wherever compute is

03:02:28.100 --> 03:02:32.100
available you can host anything that's it yeah any AWS any

03:02:32.100 --> 03:02:37.440
GCP any platform any means any literally any VPS is also

03:02:37.440 --> 03:02:42.680
this is also computing platform course thing there is also

03:02:42.680 --> 03:02:47.520
computer yeah yes yes yes basically a virtual shared one so

03:02:47.520 --> 03:02:50.260
now you can see the same we were paying it's area technical

03:02:50.380 --> 03:02:53.220
it's not a dedicated one dedicated means like you control

03:02:53.220 --> 03:02:56.320
each and everything and then you go for the scale so if you

03:02:56.320 --> 03:02:59.460
are going for a massive scale let's suppose there is a

03:02:59.460 --> 03:03:03.680
company who is having like a ten thousands of a workload and

03:03:03.680 --> 03:03:07.180
they want all the execution very very quick right in a real

03:03:07.180 --> 03:03:10.720
time then even like you have to go for the maximum plan of

03:03:10.720 --> 03:03:15.120
Hostinger or because they receive they have I was talking

03:03:15.120 --> 03:03:17.560
about a compute right now check all the plans everywhere

03:03:17.560 --> 03:03:21.020
computer specification is given eight VPU and then 32 GB of

03:03:21.020 --> 03:03:26.040
RAM 400 GB of NVMe disk 32 GB of a bandwidth right so if

03:03:26.040 --> 03:03:29.800
your process needs more than this much of a bandwidth which

03:03:29.800 --> 03:03:32.440
will be required for sure if you are working for a big

03:03:32.440 --> 03:03:36.080
company and a big project then always you have to go with

03:03:36.080 --> 03:03:38.680
that dedicated one dedicated one means either go with the

03:03:38.680 --> 03:03:42.720
option of in it in automation or just go ahead with the AWS

03:03:42.720 --> 03:03:45.880
Azure or GCP or something like dedicated hosting kind of

03:03:45.880 --> 03:03:49.160
things right because it will be a shared one and even in a

03:03:49.160 --> 03:03:52.700
shared one the plan 1499 plan as you can see so just check

03:03:52.700 --> 03:03:55.580
the specification 8b core CPU and now let's suppose I have

03:03:55.580 --> 03:03:58.400
application or like I am running the process and which needs

03:03:58.400 --> 03:04:00.800
more than this much of compute because this computer is

03:04:00.800 --> 03:04:05.300
nothing 8v core CPU 32 GB of RAM is not much right if I'll

03:04:05.300 --> 03:04:07.740
talk about the big enterprise yeah it's it's good actually

03:04:07.740 --> 03:04:11.820
it's good even 549 plan even 399 plan is good one vcore CPU

03:04:11.820 --> 03:04:15.420
4 GB RAM 50 GB and NVMe disk and 4 TB of bandwidth it's good

03:04:15.420 --> 03:04:16.860
I would say for a very small

03:04:20.180 --> 03:04:22.780
amount basically right so what we do we just go for the

03:04:22.780 --> 03:04:26.360
dedicated one so that you know we can like when when we see

03:04:26.360 --> 03:04:30.040
a lot of like a task or when we see a lot of load so we see

03:04:30.040 --> 03:04:32.780
more machine basically it's called a scalability and when we

03:04:32.780 --> 03:04:35.280
see a less load we like a decrease the number of machine

03:04:35.280 --> 03:04:37.860
automatically and we try to you know manage it with the help

03:04:37.860 --> 03:04:44.020
of kubernetes so EKS AKS or GKS technically so it's done

03:04:44.020 --> 03:04:47.100
that it is I just need a compute whoever is providing it I

03:04:47.100 --> 03:04:49.600
will do it and even Hostinger is doing the same thing they

03:04:49.600 --> 03:04:51.800
are not doing something different as you can see the

03:04:51.800 --> 03:04:55.840
specification as simple as that right yeah and by the way

03:04:55.840 --> 03:05:00.020
for an example for more picture clarity the compute I'm

03:05:00.020 --> 03:05:04.380
using right now I know this one but now I will upgrade this

03:05:04.380 --> 03:05:08.700
one for the longer period yes because maybe it will like be

03:05:08.700 --> 03:05:12.480
slow or something no so that what I wanted to add the best

03:05:12.480 --> 03:05:15.400
part whatever you guys have you all have seen this is just a

03:05:15.400 --> 03:05:18.760
twenty percent of this one twenty percent everything is

03:05:18.760 --> 03:05:21.880
working pretty fine so what I believe for testing for

03:05:21.880 --> 03:05:25.640
learning for deploying smaller project and even deploying

03:05:25.640 --> 03:05:27.960
for client also because at that once you are going with

03:05:27.960 --> 03:05:31.460
client 너 then you need to give them so many things and you

03:05:31.460 --> 03:05:34.820
cannot afford that that will cost three thousand so initial

03:05:34.820 --> 03:05:39.020
part is fine and it WS and all those things I think once you

03:05:39.020 --> 03:05:41.120
have a bigger project and bigger aim and if you are working

03:05:41.120 --> 03:05:43.860
with company they will provide why you need to worry and

03:05:43.860 --> 03:05:47.120
yeah exactly and again like 3,000 rupees is not big deal for

03:05:47.120 --> 03:05:49.600
them for any companies even for the small companies they

03:05:49.600 --> 03:05:55.500
will do it And regarding the computing part, so I think

03:05:55.500 --> 03:05:58.340
Sudhanshu brought up the point, we can also use the

03:05:58.340 --> 03:06:01.900
Kubernetes. So I wanted to build some heavy application,

03:06:02.080 --> 03:06:06.520
heavy value application. Can we create the multiple system,

03:06:06.720 --> 03:06:10.840
okay? So is it really this end-to-end also do we need to

03:06:10.840 --> 03:06:13.780
install all the machine, right? Maybe the cost will be

03:06:13.780 --> 03:06:16.180
double and triple, right? No, no. You are using Kubernetes,

03:06:16.240 --> 03:06:18.420
so Kubernetes will manage it. Why you have to manage?

03:06:18.420 --> 03:06:20.700
Kubernetes is a response, this is the reason we are using

03:06:20.700 --> 03:06:23.760
Kubernetes services, right? So that entire system will

03:06:23.760 --> 03:06:26.500
behave like a master and a slave. So there will be a master,

03:06:26.620 --> 03:06:28.860
you are going to install into a master and then master will

03:06:28.860 --> 03:06:31.640
be having an access of all the slaves and it will distribute

03:06:31.640 --> 03:06:33.980
the task. This is where Kubernetes comes into a picture.

03:06:34.060 --> 03:06:37.640
This is where EKS, AKS and GKS comes into a picture. Yeah,

03:06:37.700 --> 03:06:40.580
so are you saying do we install only in the master node that

03:06:40.580 --> 03:06:43.080
is in the services? Yeah, so basically if you are using AKS,

03:06:43.120 --> 03:06:45.820
EK and GKS, right, you don't have to even install it. Just

03:06:45.820 --> 03:06:48.040
go click on the services and then everything will be

03:06:48.040 --> 03:06:51.960
configured. It's like just drag and drop and click that,

03:06:52.040 --> 03:06:54.320
okay, this is the number of masters, this is the number of a

03:06:54.320 --> 03:06:58.400
slave and this is the by default number of machine which I'm

03:06:58.400 --> 03:07:01.700
looking for and this is the number of machine on a scale and

03:07:01.700 --> 03:07:04.440
you can put the conditions and everything and it will try to

03:07:04.440 --> 03:07:07.680
spin automatically. So this is how easy configuration is. So

03:07:07.680 --> 03:07:11.300
you don't have to become an expert of Kubernetes, just go on

03:07:11.300 --> 03:07:14.420
any cloud platform, any means any, any of these three, like

03:07:14.420 --> 03:07:17.940
a popular cloud platform, right? Everything it manages

03:07:17.940 --> 03:07:22.440
automatically. Yeah, but Sudhanshu, ideally, if you run the

03:07:22.440 --> 03:07:25.380
application, right, definitely, you should be coasted all

03:07:25.380 --> 03:07:28.040
the places, across the machine, right? For example, master

03:07:28.040 --> 03:07:31.380
node should be there, when run the application, master node

03:07:31.380 --> 03:07:33.940
just for monitoring, I think controlling the whole thing.

03:07:34.260 --> 03:07:36.340
Yeah, controlling the whole thing. So basically, the entry

03:07:36.340 --> 03:07:40.820
point is master node. Yeah, right, entry point is the master

03:07:40.820 --> 03:07:44.060
node, but when we process the all the activities, all the

03:07:44.060 --> 03:07:47.240
nodes, right? Definitely, the software should be available

03:07:47.240 --> 03:07:50.820
across the machine, am I right? This is what I'm trying to

03:07:50.820 --> 03:07:53.680
say, this is where EKS, AKS, Kubernetes comes into picture,

03:07:53.780 --> 03:07:57.080
right? So basically, that cluster creation is automatically

03:07:57.080 --> 03:07:59.740
done, we as a person knows that okay, fine, there is a

03:07:59.740 --> 03:08:03.420
master architecture, but as a machine, this is where EKS

03:08:03.420 --> 03:08:06.640
service has been created. For example, even in big data,

03:08:06.740 --> 03:08:09.460
when we say Hadoop, right? So Hadoop also works on master

03:08:09.460 --> 03:08:13.460
slave architecture, right? Yes. But when we configure the

03:08:13.460 --> 03:08:15.600
machine. So we just have to say that, okay, fine, this is IP

03:08:15.600 --> 03:08:17.900
address, this is IP address of all of this machine, right?

03:08:17.980 --> 03:08:21.060
And consider this master, rest it configures automatically

03:08:21.060 --> 03:08:23.620
distributes his task. This is the reason the software layer

03:08:23.620 --> 03:08:27.460
comes into picture on hardware. So we don't do anything in a

03:08:27.460 --> 03:08:29.920
current scenario, everything has been handled by the

03:08:29.920 --> 03:08:32.180
services itself. That's the reason this service has been

03:08:32.180 --> 03:08:35.280
created. Because even see, distributed computation is not a

03:08:35.280 --> 03:08:38.800
new concept, right? But before that, in configuring it

03:08:38.800 --> 03:08:42.060
manually, that okay, fine, so when this load will come sent

03:08:42.060 --> 03:08:44.080
to this and to this and to this. So that's the balancing we

03:08:44.080 --> 03:08:46.800
were trying to do. But now things are pretty much automated,

03:08:46.920 --> 03:08:49.680
even on that side where we don't manage, we just go click

03:08:49.680 --> 03:08:52.460
two or three clicks, and then my machine will be up on the

03:08:52.460 --> 03:08:54.560
scale as simple as that. Will it be entirely configured

03:08:54.560 --> 03:08:57.140
automatically, but anyhow it is installed aggressive machine

03:08:57.140 --> 03:09:00.140
automatically. Obviously, it is going to like solve the

03:09:00.140 --> 03:09:02.600
services, then only it will be able to execute it right?

03:09:02.660 --> 03:09:07.040
Otherwise, how? Yeah, yeah, correct. You are right. And I

03:09:07.040 --> 03:09:10.080
think cost point of view, I don't think there is how much

03:09:10.080 --> 03:09:13.680
should be there. And this is the use case perspective. And I

03:09:13.680 --> 03:09:13.700
think the cost point of view, I don't think there is how

03:09:13.700 --> 03:09:16.000
much it should be there. Are you able to show some use case

03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:19.840
like when we are, we have some day to day activities, are we

03:09:19.840 --> 03:09:23.620
going to apply the jobs right applying the jobs, any Nogri

03:09:23.620 --> 03:09:26.380
platform or LinkedIn platform? No, so that that is a

03:09:26.380 --> 03:09:28.560
different task. See automation doesn't mean that you will be

03:09:28.560 --> 03:09:31.220
able to automate that. I'll tell you the reason. So whatever

03:09:31.220 --> 03:09:33.760
automation that we are talking about as of now, so

03:09:33.760 --> 03:09:36.960
basically, we are able to access our system, then only we

03:09:36.960 --> 03:09:39.240
are able to automate it. For example, if I'm talking about a

03:09:39.240 --> 03:09:42.600
LinkedIn post, so LinkedIn post is one of the automation. So

03:09:42.600 --> 03:09:45.880
where I have a. Account access and then I can try to go and

03:09:45.880 --> 03:09:48.980
I can try to basically like, you know, a login and posted.

03:09:49.040 --> 03:09:51.280
Basically, this is what I'm generating the post and then

03:09:51.280 --> 03:09:54.020
posting the post basically with the help of credential.

03:09:54.340 --> 03:09:57.160
Let's suppose there is a situation. So where I have to, you

03:09:57.160 --> 03:10:01.920
know, like I have to apply for the job. So you will go to

03:10:01.920 --> 03:10:05.700
LinkedIn, you will search for the job and then inside. So

03:10:05.700 --> 03:10:08.560
till search, it's fine. API is available. You can search it

03:10:08.560 --> 03:10:11.400
right. You will be able to list all the LinkedIn job in any

03:10:11.400 --> 03:10:13.920
like this one. And this is something that we are doing it

03:10:13.920 --> 03:10:16.800
right. If you'll go to our job portal, a job search portal

03:10:16.800 --> 03:10:18.960
that we have inside of your own, we are doing the same

03:10:18.960 --> 03:10:20.720
thing. We are calling an API. We are committing all the

03:10:20.720 --> 03:10:24.620
jobs. But after that, right after, so when applying comes

03:10:24.620 --> 03:10:30.280
into a picture, so you need a agentic browser, not agentic

03:10:30.280 --> 03:10:34.180
tool. There is a difference. Right. Because everything runs

03:10:34.180 --> 03:10:38.340
inside our browser. So basically browser should, so you need

03:10:38.340 --> 03:10:41.600
a agentic browser so that it will be able to detect a place

03:10:41.600 --> 03:10:45.000
of a site. It will be able to detect a sign in credentials

03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:48.160
so that it can fill up. Then it will go inside and it will

03:10:48.160 --> 03:10:50.760
be able to understand the forms and then it will try to fill

03:10:50.760 --> 03:10:54.000
all the details inside the form and then click on the apply

03:10:54.000 --> 03:10:58.340
because still search. It's one task after search apply is

03:10:58.340 --> 03:11:01.100
another task over there. Agentic browser comes into a

03:11:01.100 --> 03:11:04.440
picture, not this agentic AI that the, and generally people

03:11:04.440 --> 03:11:06.620
get like a confused that, okay, fine. I can solve that as

03:11:06.620 --> 03:11:09.820
well with the agentic one. No. So with agentic you can't

03:11:09.820 --> 03:11:12.240
solve it. You need an agentic browser. And you must have

03:11:12.240 --> 03:11:15.160
seen that GPT has, or OpenAI has demonstrated agentic

03:11:15.160 --> 03:11:18.480
browser a couple of days back. Even is trying to do it, but

03:11:18.480 --> 03:11:22.420
they are not able to achieve a level. So where it can

03:11:22.420 --> 03:11:25.520
automate things. So they are just trying to say that, okay,

03:11:25.560 --> 03:11:27.560
fine, limited one. And again, so they are running the

03:11:27.560 --> 03:11:30.360
agentic browser in their own instances, not in your browser.

03:11:32.280 --> 03:11:34.860
So basically they are like firing up the browser in their

03:11:34.860 --> 03:11:37.680
own instances so that they will be having a control. So

03:11:37.680 --> 03:11:39.960
that's a different use case. You need an agentic browser

03:11:39.960 --> 03:11:43.260
access, not this one. You can't do it or with any other

03:11:43.260 --> 03:11:47.020
agency won't be able to do it. Okay. So are you saying like,

03:11:47.060 --> 03:11:50.000
we don't have enough access and we can't automate it. Right.

03:11:50.040 --> 03:11:55.820
Are you saying this one, I think LinkedIn or any platform,

03:11:55.980 --> 03:12:00.480
we have the two kind of job easy apply and regular to apply

03:12:00.480 --> 03:12:03.840
into the regular. Easy apply. You can do it a little bit.

03:12:03.940 --> 03:12:06.320
You can do the automation, easy apply. Even we have done

03:12:06.320 --> 03:12:09.900
that. My team has already done that a long back. But we have

03:12:09.900 --> 03:12:12.860
not added those features. In my job portal, the reason was

03:12:12.860 --> 03:12:16.880
very simple because it was able to do a apply only for an

03:12:16.880 --> 03:12:20.400
easy apply or in-platform apply. So let's suppose there is a

03:12:20.400 --> 03:12:22.840
job in Naukri, right, Naukri platform. So even over there,

03:12:22.900 --> 03:12:25.960
so you can try to do an in-platform apply. And most of the

03:12:25.960 --> 03:12:28.480
job you will be able to find out. So where it sends you to

03:12:28.480 --> 03:12:32.100
other platforms, like it opens up on different URLs and over

03:12:32.100 --> 03:12:35.140
there you need an agentic browser capability. And that was

03:12:35.140 --> 03:12:38.600
like a tough and we were able to, we were able to crack it a

03:12:38.600 --> 03:12:41.540
little bit, but it's still like accuracy. Accuracy was not

03:12:41.540 --> 03:12:43.560
that great. So we have not published it. But yeah, easy

03:12:43.560 --> 03:12:45.960
apply, even we were able to do it. My team was able to like

03:12:45.960 --> 03:12:50.240
do those easy apply. Right. Because we spend time every one

03:12:50.240 --> 03:12:53.540
hour, two hours daily, you know, are we going to apply all

03:12:53.540 --> 03:12:56.780
the places? It will be taking time. So if we go and automate

03:12:56.780 --> 03:13:00.880
it now, maybe it should be easy for us. As of now you can't,

03:13:00.880 --> 03:13:03.120
like easy apply you can automate it or in-platform apply you

03:13:03.120 --> 03:13:05.740
can automate it. That's easy. That is something that we,

03:13:05.840 --> 03:13:10.540
even we have done that. But beyond that, no. Yeah. That is

03:13:10.540 --> 03:13:14.360
fine. But third party URL, I totally understand, at least

03:13:14.360 --> 03:13:17.580
can you show there some use cases to apply any portal, Dice

03:13:17.580 --> 03:13:21.600
portal or LinkedIn portal, any one portal, how to apply for

03:13:21.600 --> 03:13:25.800
the easy applying, how to apply the jobs. In every class,

03:13:25.880 --> 03:13:28.300
no, I take up different topics and then people say that, can

03:13:28.300 --> 03:13:30.180
you please show the example? If I start showing the example,

03:13:30.260 --> 03:13:32.640
same class will go for one and a half. No, no, this is no,

03:13:32.700 --> 03:13:35.240
no. So then, so why am I talking this one? Because this is

03:13:35.240 --> 03:13:39.060
very useful for everyone. Everything is useful for someone.

03:13:39.380 --> 03:13:41.660
See. Everything is useful for someone. Let's just stick to

03:13:41.660 --> 03:13:44.760
the lecture first and let's complete the syllabus because I

03:13:44.760 --> 03:13:49.120
have to complete the syllabus as well. Like something can be

03:13:49.120 --> 03:13:53.220
done or something can't be done wise. I always believe that

03:13:53.220 --> 03:13:56.040
everything can be done. Everything can be cracked. Right.

03:13:56.140 --> 03:13:58.580
Okay. You must have seen that in every class people say

03:13:58.580 --> 03:14:00.220
that, can you please show me this example, that example.

03:14:02.720 --> 03:14:06.220
Okay. That's fine. I can't show everything simple. I can't

03:14:06.220 --> 03:14:08.520
even give a comment. Otherwise people can come and chase me.

03:14:08.540 --> 03:14:12.140
Like you said that. You will like do it. So. Yeah. Yeah.

03:14:12.220 --> 03:14:17.120
Sure. So final one more question and how N8n support for the

03:14:17.120 --> 03:14:20.380
massive volume of data. So can we handle the data processing

03:14:20.380 --> 03:14:25.860
part with the N8n tool or would be okay or just for just

03:14:25.860 --> 03:14:29.440
connecting the different. N8n is basically orchestration

03:14:29.440 --> 03:14:33.300
tool. Just orchestration only. Not data processing. Exactly.

03:14:34.000 --> 03:14:36.860
Okay. It's kind of NiFi or something. Right. It's a pure

03:14:36.860 --> 03:14:39.420
automation tool. Yeah. NiFi is a pure automation tool. So it

03:14:39.420 --> 03:14:43.540
is again a simple like a tool and it basically takes your

03:14:43.540 --> 03:14:48.440
resources to process it. NiFi is a tool right where we try

03:14:48.440 --> 03:14:51.860
to process the data just by like it's a very small but very

03:14:51.860 --> 03:14:54.820
effective tool which has been created by I think US defense

03:14:54.820 --> 03:14:57.880
academy. I have used it a lot and I think since like last

03:14:57.880 --> 03:15:01.760
2019 2020 I have been using NiFi a lot. So yeah basically

03:15:01.760 --> 03:15:04.220
like wherever you are going to configure NiFi it is going to

03:15:04.220 --> 03:15:06.880
take the resources from that system and then it is going to

03:15:06.880 --> 03:15:12.420
process the data. If I was a processing tool but it is

03:15:12.420 --> 03:15:16.480
mostly an orchestration one. Yeah. I think it is kind of we

03:15:16.480 --> 03:15:19.840
can say kind of a land chain itself right a land chain part

03:15:19.840 --> 03:15:22.420
where we can. It's an orchestrator. Basically orchestrator I

03:15:22.420 --> 03:15:25.200
would say. So wherever you are going to host it and

03:15:25.200 --> 03:15:28.160
whichever like a file you are reading and whichever process

03:15:28.160 --> 03:15:31.040
is processing that file so that will take its own resource

03:15:31.040 --> 03:15:36.660
and it will consume it. But yeah. So yeah. So yeah. Right.

03:15:36.840 --> 03:15:39.960
If that case we cannot succeed with the massive application

03:15:39.960 --> 03:15:44.960
processing at all just for orchestration just. Yeah. I think

03:15:44.960 --> 03:15:47.400
it will happen somewhere else. Your processing will happen

03:15:47.400 --> 03:15:51.000
literally somewhere else. Right. You have the instances for

03:15:51.000 --> 03:15:54.320
processing in it and it's going to invoke that instance.

03:15:54.940 --> 03:15:58.320
Yeah. So invoke the instance and communicate it. But why do

03:15:58.320 --> 03:16:01.460
we need to have the multiple multiple platform. We can make

03:16:01.460 --> 03:16:05.040
it one platform. Right. One platform to fulfill the use

03:16:05.040 --> 03:16:07.880
cases everything. So if you are going with multiple platform

03:16:07.880 --> 03:16:11.300
or done unnecessary link. Sir sir sir sir sir sir one thing

03:16:11.300 --> 03:16:14.460
one thing one thing. Yeah. You can't keep all the files in

03:16:14.460 --> 03:16:17.680
one system. You can't bring all the SQL system in anything.

03:16:17.860 --> 03:16:20.500
You can't bring all the no SQL system in it and you can't

03:16:20.500 --> 03:16:24.640
bring a S3 or maybe a blob system in one places. Right. So

03:16:24.640 --> 03:16:27.540
how you can create your platform. So again everyone is

03:16:27.540 --> 03:16:29.480
having its own roles and responsibilities. So basically

03:16:29.480 --> 03:16:33.100
people have created anything as an orchestrator. That OK. So

03:16:33.100 --> 03:16:35.800
whatever platform that you have connect all the platform I'm

03:16:35.800 --> 03:16:37.880
giving you a services so where you can try to basically

03:16:37.880 --> 03:16:40.540
configure each and everything. And then in the later stages

03:16:40.540 --> 03:16:43.340
they have bring the agent capability that OK fine. So now

03:16:43.340 --> 03:16:46.880
you can use the power of LLMs which will make a decision and

03:16:46.880 --> 03:16:49.920
based on those decision make an orchestration only

03:16:49.920 --> 03:16:54.340
orchestration. Right. And whatever like processes each and

03:16:54.340 --> 03:16:57.640
every node or orchestrator is required that will commence

03:16:57.640 --> 03:17:02.300
the individual like basically resources. Right. Because if

03:17:02.300 --> 03:17:04.980
I'll start storing my S3 data even in here like I mean like

03:17:04.980 --> 03:17:08.280
then what will the use of all those other things. So every

03:17:08.280 --> 03:17:11.540
tool is having its own like a basically a purpose. Right.

03:17:11.560 --> 03:17:14.040
Even Lanch and LandGraph. Do they provide you to host

03:17:14.040 --> 03:17:17.340
everything like a file and your SQL and all those things.

03:17:17.400 --> 03:17:20.600
No. Right. Yeah. No. No. We can connect to something.

03:17:21.160 --> 03:17:25.300
Exactly. In this case for the orchestration perspective we

03:17:25.300 --> 03:17:27.740
have the Airflow over there and many things over there.

03:17:29.280 --> 03:17:32.240
Airflow is just a service. Right. What is Airflow? Airflow

03:17:32.240 --> 03:17:36.640
is technically a service. Yes. We can write the DAT code to

03:17:36.640 --> 03:17:38.780
launch all the things. Right. We can send an email. You can

03:17:38.780 --> 03:17:41.440
just configure. Airflow you can just try to create a

03:17:41.440 --> 03:17:44.440
schedule basically. Schedule you can try to create that okay

03:17:44.440 --> 03:17:47.980
fine after this after this run this processes. Processes

03:17:47.980 --> 03:17:51.560
doesn't runs by like processes has been called by Airflow.

03:17:52.420 --> 03:17:56.140
Correct. Process runs in its own instances even in case of

03:17:56.140 --> 03:18:01.020
Airflow or Uji. Even Uji we were using. Right. In a big

03:18:01.020 --> 03:18:03.360
data. Since a very long time. Yes. Then in a later stage we

03:18:03.360 --> 03:18:06.180
have started using Airflow. So even those tools are

03:18:06.180 --> 03:18:12.620
orchestrated tool. Yeah. Right. This is also seems like

03:18:12.620 --> 03:18:16.880
orchestrated Sudhanshu actually the NITN as well. I told you

03:18:16.880 --> 03:18:19.420
it is orchestrated. Not seems like. I told you. It is

03:18:19.420 --> 03:18:22.480
orchestrated one. No. Yeah. That's why I am asking you

03:18:22.480 --> 03:18:24.700
because we have a number of orchestrated Airflow

03:18:24.700 --> 03:18:27.680
predominantly organization use the Airflow tool. Right. We

03:18:27.680 --> 03:18:30.640
have many more operator over there. So whatever we do. We

03:18:30.640 --> 03:18:34.940
can do in the agent AI something but we have the similar.

03:18:35.080 --> 03:18:37.920
Basically see Airflow I will tell you one thing. Airflow is

03:18:37.920 --> 03:18:41.640
not that easy in terms of like because see we have to write

03:18:41.640 --> 03:18:44.260
like all those branches. We have to create the graphs and

03:18:44.260 --> 03:18:47.560
flows and everything. Correct. NITN is trying to make those

03:18:47.560 --> 03:18:50.940
things even more simpler. In Airflow you will not be able to

03:18:50.940 --> 03:18:53.020
find out the agentic features. Basically they have not

03:18:53.020 --> 03:18:56.960
created that kind of a node. Right. So basically like here

03:18:56.960 --> 03:19:00.560
so they have they are just trying to make it easy. I am not

03:19:00.560 --> 03:19:02.400
saying that you can't use Airflow. I am saying that you

03:19:02.400 --> 03:19:05.180
should always use NITN. No. It's not like that. You can go

03:19:05.180 --> 03:19:07.240
ahead with that. You can go with this. I don't have any kind

03:19:07.240 --> 03:19:10.860
of issue. The only thing is NITN is providing you more

03:19:10.860 --> 03:19:13.720
feature, more luxury, easy to implement, easy to use.

03:19:13.880 --> 03:19:17.880
Airflow is little bit tough as compared to NITN and before

03:19:17.880 --> 03:19:21.100
Airflow we have been using Uji where we used to write XML

03:19:21.100 --> 03:19:23.960
based file. In Airflow you are writing Pythonic. Right.

03:19:24.000 --> 03:19:27.780
Python based. Yes. Correct. Python based scheduler. Yes. I

03:19:27.780 --> 03:19:30.460
am coming from a background so where I have at that point of

03:19:30.460 --> 03:19:33.540
time Airflow was not even there. Just imagine 2015, 2014,

03:19:33.820 --> 03:19:37.100
2014, 2015. So I am coming from that background so where we

03:19:37.100 --> 03:19:42.020
used to write XML file. Yes. XML file and this one, auto

03:19:42.020 --> 03:19:45.320
season control M we used to write. Yes. So that was even

03:19:45.320 --> 03:19:50.200
more painful for us. Yes. So yes like then Airflow came into

03:19:50.200 --> 03:19:52.780
a picture and it looks like okay fine. Even though Uji was

03:19:52.780 --> 03:19:55.200
working for me. We have configured a hundreds and thousands

03:19:55.200 --> 03:19:58.340
of job at that point of a time by taking all those pain by

03:19:58.340 --> 03:20:00.420
Uji. But when Airflow come into picture we have adopted

03:20:00.420 --> 03:20:03.920
Airflow because it was easy to use. Right. Then now NITN

03:20:03.920 --> 03:20:07.260
come into picture I will adopt NITN because it is even more

03:20:07.260 --> 03:20:09.640
easy to use. So basically this is how adoption happens.

03:20:09.860 --> 03:20:13.780
Airflow is not having this much of rich feature. Right. NITN

03:20:13.780 --> 03:20:16.560
is having those features and Airflow does not even like go

03:20:16.560 --> 03:20:21.020
closer to agentic. Here it goes like completely end to end

03:20:21.020 --> 03:20:26.440
with agentic. Okay. All right. Okay. Just imagine the kind

03:20:26.440 --> 03:20:29.380
of a process Dhruv has shown you just in like a last two

03:20:29.380 --> 03:20:32.160
three hours. Right. If you will start doing it in Airflow

03:20:32.160 --> 03:20:37.110
how much time it will take? Airflow just is triggering and

03:20:37.110 --> 03:20:39.570
the processing will be taken by the data computing system.

03:20:40.430 --> 03:20:43.190
NITN is also same thing. Same thing orchestration itself.

03:20:43.310 --> 03:20:47.290
Yes. They have just made a very UI so that you know just by

03:20:47.290 --> 03:20:49.870
calling those UI and filling some data, filling some

03:20:49.870 --> 03:20:52.170
authorization or something it will be able to trigger

03:20:52.170 --> 03:20:54.350
automatically. In case of Airflow even you have to write the

03:20:54.350 --> 03:20:57.610
code for it. For that. Yeah. Right. Actually in the similar

03:20:57.610 --> 03:21:00.570
concept in my previous project also we used the NiFi tool,

03:21:00.670 --> 03:21:03.130
the same processor group or something. Yeah. NiFi is also

03:21:03.130 --> 03:21:06.110
same. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Same thing. I have used NiFi as well.

03:21:06.950 --> 03:21:09.910
Yeah. I am coming from by the way big data backgrounds. I

03:21:09.910 --> 03:21:13.310
have used all those tools. No. No. I don't ask much question

03:21:13.310 --> 03:21:16.490
on those because we have, they have lot of tools day by day

03:21:16.490 --> 03:21:18.950
also. How many tools are we going to adopt it I think.

03:21:19.050 --> 03:21:22.370
That's my. Whichever like your, whichever tie up your

03:21:22.370 --> 03:21:24.530
company has done. I think I told you in a previous class as

03:21:24.530 --> 03:21:27.610
well. Right. Yeah. Yeah. That's the reason I'm teaching you

03:21:27.610 --> 03:21:30.150
like five different, different kind of a way by which you

03:21:30.150 --> 03:21:32.230
can create the agents. We are creating the same agent by

03:21:32.230 --> 03:21:35.110
crew, by LangChain, by LangGraph, by anything, but yeah,

03:21:35.190 --> 03:21:37.290
let's suppose your company is using this, obviously you have

03:21:37.290 --> 03:21:41.070
to use that as simple as that. Yes. And, and, and just here,

03:21:41.130 --> 03:21:44.850
I just want to add the comment in, in, in RAM part key,

03:21:44.870 --> 03:21:46.850
which tool we need to use because every single day we are

03:21:46.850 --> 03:21:49.750
getting new updates. Okay. That's the reason you guys have

03:21:49.750 --> 03:21:51.710
seen last two or three years, right? Every single day,

03:21:51.770 --> 03:21:55.290
everything is updating. Take an example, NATN. I'll tell you

03:21:55.290 --> 03:21:57.850
that lindy.ai, you can check and test and try what we are

03:21:57.850 --> 03:22:00.370
doing here in two hours. That can do in one minute. Just

03:22:00.370 --> 03:22:04.130
type. I want LinkedIn flow. That, that will create. So I

03:22:04.130 --> 03:22:07.070
think instead of what we can do, what I have seen, take an

03:22:07.070 --> 03:22:09.990
example, nano banana before that we were using chat GPT. So

03:22:09.990 --> 03:22:12.590
these are all the methods that we kept upgrading, kept

03:22:12.590 --> 03:22:16.270
upgrading, a lot of upgrades and will happen. Like right now

03:22:16.270 --> 03:22:21.750
I can post a picture in like Instagram also. So I do not

03:22:21.750 --> 03:22:25.550
care. I just care. Which is giving. At less cost, better

03:22:25.550 --> 03:22:29.370
service at lesser time, but output is same execution is

03:22:29.370 --> 03:22:32.690
same. The impact is same. These all tools are making just

03:22:32.690 --> 03:22:34.990
easier, easier, easier. And just, you have to know which

03:22:34.990 --> 03:22:37.610
tool is making easier. That's all tomorrow. If I'll get

03:22:37.610 --> 03:22:41.430
something, I just, just write, create a workflow for

03:22:41.430 --> 03:22:45.230
LinkedIn. Why? But yeah, these are all, I think apart, which

03:22:45.230 --> 03:22:48.130
if we are going through this tomorrow, we have better

03:22:48.130 --> 03:22:50.350
knowledge as compared to the person who will just come up

03:22:50.350 --> 03:22:54.030
and from sleep and see, okay, what's happening in the world.

03:22:54.590 --> 03:22:58.830
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. See, there are many entrepreneurs who is

03:22:58.830 --> 03:23:03.210
coming up, right? So obviously now ideas are very less. So

03:23:03.210 --> 03:23:05.470
they are, they all are focusing on the execution. So they

03:23:05.470 --> 03:23:08.590
are just trying to do their best to make as simple as

03:23:08.590 --> 03:23:10.790
possible so that, you know, they will be able to capture the

03:23:10.790 --> 03:23:14.010
market. That's, that's so stupid. Yeah. Right. So because

03:23:14.010 --> 03:23:16.870
why I'm asking, because many product companies, right, they

03:23:16.870 --> 03:23:21.070
would power their tool only. They cannot go out of the tool

03:23:21.070 --> 03:23:24.070
bag. So in this case, these are the small, small companies,

03:23:24.070 --> 03:23:25.030
right? These are the small companies, small companies

03:23:25.030 --> 03:23:28.150
started the new kind of tools and who will go to purchase

03:23:28.150 --> 03:23:30.890
the tool mostly and how much you will be grading the demand.

03:23:32.450 --> 03:23:35.950
Right. That's a business that depends upon the business deal

03:23:35.950 --> 03:23:39.110
that you should not be worried about. Yeah. Microsoft goes

03:23:39.110 --> 03:23:42.190
with only Microsoft tool. They never believe in any open

03:23:42.190 --> 03:23:45.090
source, nothing. Amazon goes to the only Amazon tool like

03:23:45.090 --> 03:23:48.510
that. So they're not, they don't like to, they don't desire

03:23:48.510 --> 03:23:52.150
to move out of the tool bag. See even in this case, yeah.

03:23:52.450 --> 03:23:55.150
Even if they're building their internal. So everything will

03:23:55.150 --> 03:23:58.650
be inspired by these things itself. Right. So, and again, so

03:23:58.650 --> 03:24:02.130
you have to prove your skill with this one. So just a skill

03:24:02.130 --> 03:24:05.250
up, do something, build something and then get into those

03:24:05.250 --> 03:24:07.910
companies and even eventually you will find a different UI

03:24:07.910 --> 03:24:11.730
interface, but similar kind of a tool. Like I said, ideas

03:24:11.730 --> 03:24:16.550
are now very limited. Almost all the problems of this

03:24:16.550 --> 03:24:19.530
century we have solved. So everyone is trying to just create

03:24:19.530 --> 03:24:24.910
it in their own way. That's it. Right. Going forward, you

03:24:24.910 --> 03:24:28.250
would also expect, you know, one project to control by one

03:24:28.250 --> 03:24:41.510
human. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. No, no. Yeah. So, uh, what tool I

03:24:41.510 --> 03:24:43.830
use few years back, there's a, I've been issue, right.

03:24:43.910 --> 03:24:47.690
There's a graph kind of, so it gives me a similar kind of

03:24:47.690 --> 03:24:50.970
feeling. Right. So, but, uh, I don't know whether they

03:24:50.970 --> 03:24:53.170
implement the agent part or not. Like, I don't know. I don't

03:24:53.170 --> 03:24:56.450
know, but, uh, uh, this is a similar feeling. So my one

03:24:56.450 --> 03:25:00.490
question is, uh, if I, uh, want to decide for my company,

03:25:00.590 --> 03:25:05.150
which tool should I bring in? Right. So what are the factor

03:25:05.150 --> 03:25:09.490
criteria should I think on, uh, to implement the agent again

03:25:09.490 --> 03:25:13.650
in the last two, three weeks we did, uh, two AI, then an

03:25:13.650 --> 03:25:16.910
eight and then a line graph, all things. Right. Uh, here,

03:25:16.990 --> 03:25:19.390
here, can you give some light or, uh, help me? Yeah. So

03:25:19.390 --> 03:25:21.670
basically see, I'll, I'll tell you one thing. So if you have

03:25:21.670 --> 03:25:23.370
to, you know, automate the automation. So if you have to do

03:25:23.370 --> 03:25:26.470
the operational things, right. Then go ahead with some UI

03:25:26.470 --> 03:25:29.430
based tools so that it will be easy to implement, quick to

03:25:29.430 --> 03:25:32.310
manage a quick to implement, easy to manage and very less

03:25:32.310 --> 03:25:35.170
costly. And even one person can sit, configure each and

03:25:35.170 --> 03:25:37.070
everything, and then they can monitor it for a very, very

03:25:37.070 --> 03:25:39.590
long time. Cost to come nearly very less and quickly, you

03:25:39.590 --> 03:25:42.850
will be able to implement operational one. Right. Uh, now

03:25:42.850 --> 03:25:45.530
let's suppose if I'm working on some product agentic

03:25:45.530 --> 03:25:49.690
product, right. And which should keep on running for a very,

03:25:49.730 --> 03:25:52.250
very long time. And I have a vision that I will end up

03:25:52.250 --> 03:25:56.290
adding hundreds. Of features. Right. In that case, always go

03:25:56.290 --> 03:26:00.830
with the coding based. Okay. That's my take, because this is

03:26:00.830 --> 03:26:03.610
what I do. So whenever I have to take a decision, so for

03:26:03.610 --> 03:26:05.750
example, if I have to like, uh, you know, remove the

03:26:05.750 --> 03:26:08.310
operational headaches and all those things. So any time is

03:26:08.310 --> 03:26:10.990
going to be best for me. Maybe crew is studio is going to be

03:26:10.990 --> 03:26:14.790
best for me. Auto gen again in a UI mode is going to be best

03:26:14.790 --> 03:26:17.870
for me, right? Because crew AI is coming with the beta mode

03:26:17.870 --> 03:26:20.730
and again, UI interface chat, and then they will clear, but

03:26:20.730 --> 03:26:22.650
it's still in it. And it's going to be my favorite one. So

03:26:22.650 --> 03:26:25.790
far. Right. Because it's like a very easy to use and easy to

03:26:25.790 --> 03:26:28.730
drag and drop and configure and they're enhancing it. Uh,

03:26:28.810 --> 03:26:31.190
but yeah. So in couple of months you will be able to see

03:26:31.190 --> 03:26:33.990
that crew AI studio is also equivalent to this one or maybe

03:26:33.990 --> 03:26:36.230
better than this. No one knows they're building, they're

03:26:36.230 --> 03:26:38.110
already building it. They have already started releasing it.

03:26:38.330 --> 03:26:41.130
And uh, auto gen is also doing the same thing from Microsoft

03:26:41.130 --> 03:26:44.170
that UI and all those configuration are not that rich so

03:26:44.170 --> 03:26:46.990
far. Uh, but yeah, so they have already started working on

03:26:46.990 --> 03:26:49.770
that. Now if I have to literally build a product agent

03:26:49.770 --> 03:26:54.170
product, I'll rely on code more. Okay. So, so means the line

03:26:54.170 --> 03:26:57.330
graph, all things, right? Uh, line graph, line chain, crew,

03:26:57.450 --> 03:27:00.750
AI, auto gen, any of these, whatever, like, uh, I'm

03:27:00.750 --> 03:27:03.610
comfortable with because everyone is going to give you just

03:27:03.610 --> 03:27:06.450
a library, nothing more than that. And everyone is giving

03:27:06.450 --> 03:27:10.110
you all the features. Okay. So if I building a product, then

03:27:10.110 --> 03:27:13.690
it's better to go with the, uh, language code based approach

03:27:13.690 --> 03:27:16.670
because you will end up, see, this is the orchestration.

03:27:16.730 --> 03:27:19.150
These libraries are also orchestrator library, right? Uh,

03:27:19.270 --> 03:27:22.210
actual process. Actual function is not going to change.

03:27:22.250 --> 03:27:24.070
Okay. Like I said, so the tool calling means what

03:27:24.070 --> 03:27:28.170
technically a function, right? Uh, agentic agentic means

03:27:28.170 --> 03:27:31.390
what? So writing a prompt and then prompt, we'll try to

03:27:31.390 --> 03:27:35.670
decide something on your behalf. So core has not changed

03:27:35.670 --> 03:27:37.810
what they have done. They have just had a wrapper on top of

03:27:37.810 --> 03:27:40.230
it that we'll find like, uh, instead of, you know, writing a

03:27:40.230 --> 03:27:42.670
custom, let's, let's use this, that that's the only thing,

03:27:42.690 --> 03:27:45.250
right? So this is the reason they are the orchestrator

03:27:45.250 --> 03:27:50.370
framework by the way. Okay. So, um, if, um, as you said, um,

03:27:50.610 --> 03:27:54.510
so just that. And it is doing so much good, right? We also

03:27:54.510 --> 03:27:58.070
see this operational. So yeah. So that's the reason why so

03:27:58.070 --> 03:28:01.710
many companies are not using anything. See it, it depends

03:28:01.710 --> 03:28:04.790
upon the adoption and then sales as well. Right? See, we are

03:28:04.790 --> 03:28:07.710
providing a very affordable courses and I believe no one is

03:28:07.710 --> 03:28:09.810
affordable. Then you're on in an entire market that I can

03:28:09.810 --> 03:28:12.690
claim, uh, no one's providing a life classes with this

03:28:12.690 --> 03:28:15.390
particular price at all. That also I can claim no one is

03:28:15.390 --> 03:28:18.570
providing a URI URI API, one lakh token that also I can

03:28:18.570 --> 03:28:22.790
claim. But, uh, are we able to get the. The entire, like a

03:28:22.790 --> 03:28:30.070
crowd of the world, the answer is no, it's just, let me

03:28:30.070 --> 03:28:33.130
answer. So it requires a business expansion. It requires a

03:28:33.130 --> 03:28:36.510
marketing. It requires a sales. It requires some time

03:28:36.510 --> 03:28:39.450
bribing as well to a higher management, which is again a

03:28:39.450 --> 03:28:43.290
fact across the world, not just in India. So it works

03:28:43.290 --> 03:28:47.410
everywhere. I know people. So it's a part of business

03:28:47.410 --> 03:28:49.670
expansion. So maybe next couple of years, you will say that

03:28:49.670 --> 03:28:52.330
adoption will be high. Maybe next year you will say that our

03:28:52.330 --> 03:28:55.370
option will be even low. Some new competitor will come that

03:28:55.370 --> 03:28:58.010
depends upon the company's performance. That's a company's

03:28:58.010 --> 03:29:00.950
part, but yeah, as far as user side, if I'll have to give a

03:29:00.950 --> 03:29:04.330
feedback, it's good. It's like giving a very rich feature.

03:29:04.930 --> 03:29:09.350
Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Last two days. Also, I use this and it is a

03:29:09.350 --> 03:29:13.170
very easy to use and it will give me a visual, uh, workflow.

03:29:13.330 --> 03:29:16.010
Right. So that is easy for me to, and quickly I can do

03:29:16.010 --> 03:29:19.470
things. Right. Yeah. So that's, that's really good. Nice.

03:29:19.570 --> 03:29:22.590
Thank you. Uh, the session was really good. Uh, till now.

03:29:22.830 --> 03:29:27.570
Um, thank you. Thanks. Thanks. Hello. Hi. Uh, should I

03:29:27.570 --> 03:29:33.290
answer? Yeah. Go ahead. Yeah. And just, I wanted to ask, uh,

03:29:33.370 --> 03:29:38.430
about, uh, in it, in the product production base. I think if

03:29:38.430 --> 03:29:43.250
you want to, uh, implement in it and in any organization, so

03:29:43.250 --> 03:29:47.050
for the security level, because I have gone through the

03:29:47.050 --> 03:29:50.070
documentation about the internet. Right. And they have

03:29:50.070 --> 03:29:53.650
written that the, we are using your data and whatever you

03:29:53.650 --> 03:29:56.730
have done the activities we have gone through, and we have

03:29:56.730 --> 03:30:00.610
used that data for the analysis purpose as well. Right. So

03:30:00.610 --> 03:30:04.290
if we are talking about the organization's level, they want

03:30:04.290 --> 03:30:09.670
us security and they want, don't use any hosted on your

03:30:09.670 --> 03:30:11.950
platform. And it is also giving you a hosting on your

03:30:11.950 --> 03:30:16.750
platform option. Right. Yeah. Okay. I am. Yeah. On-prem

03:30:16.750 --> 03:30:19.370
anywhere, anywhere, any, any, the sources you can just try

03:30:19.370 --> 03:30:21.670
to host it, everything on your own system itself. That's

03:30:21.670 --> 03:30:26.070
fine for it. And it has given you all the options. Okay. And

03:30:26.070 --> 03:30:29.090
even I have also, that's the reason. Yeah. That's the reason

03:30:29.090 --> 03:30:31.390
Dhruv was talking about hosting the right. He's hosting.

03:30:31.410 --> 03:30:33.910
He's like an entertainer on hosting. Not, he's not using it

03:30:33.910 --> 03:30:37.230
in cloud by the way. Yeah. The same part, the same part,

03:30:37.290 --> 03:30:39.830
even, even this is also will come from the client also

03:30:39.830 --> 03:30:41.970
though that is going to help. Even hosting that is because

03:30:41.970 --> 03:30:44.630
they dare, if you go there, they at least tell in front

03:30:44.630 --> 03:30:47.030
keys, your data will be secured. Basically it's your

03:30:47.030 --> 03:30:49.190
instance, right? You are the owner of that instance. So

03:30:49.190 --> 03:30:52.110
obviously you control everything in your instances. Okay.

03:30:52.150 --> 03:30:55.570
And, and suppose we have web, we have hosted this one, then

03:30:55.570 --> 03:30:59.610
in that case, the competition, the competition time, how it

03:30:59.610 --> 03:31:04.270
will take and even, I think I have like, I had a very long

03:31:04.270 --> 03:31:07.930
discussion with Ram just right. Right. I have. It's a, it's

03:31:07.930 --> 03:31:10.510
a, it's a orchestrator tool. Try to understand it's

03:31:10.510 --> 03:31:14.370
orchestrator tool, not a actual processing tool. So it calls

03:31:14.370 --> 03:31:19.670
other processor. As per the node you creates. So we will

03:31:19.670 --> 03:31:23.150
always, so it requires a compute and it in itself requires a

03:31:23.150 --> 03:31:26.170
compute because even to fire the orchestrator fire, the

03:31:26.170 --> 03:31:28.950
node, obviously we need a compute, right? Without compute,

03:31:29.070 --> 03:31:31.890
we can't even drag and drop one single images, even in our

03:31:31.890 --> 03:31:35.170
screen, in our system. Right. Because every process, every

03:31:35.170 --> 03:31:38.390
click that we do in our system that requires a compute

03:31:38.390 --> 03:31:41.230
technically, right? Because like if something is running in

03:31:41.230 --> 03:31:44.710
my system, so to fire the orchestrator, to fire those node,

03:31:44.850 --> 03:31:48.390
we need a compute, but it's a very, very minimalistic one.

03:31:48.450 --> 03:31:51.030
That's the reason. So Dhruv is able to host it even on one

03:31:51.030 --> 03:31:56.850
vCore CPU, which is, which is not even sufficient to, you

03:31:56.850 --> 03:32:01.210
know, like a process, like, you know, maybe 500 MB of file

03:32:01.210 --> 03:32:07.130
technically in that much of time. Okay. So for the

03:32:07.130 --> 03:32:09.870
organization point of view, we can, we can analyze those

03:32:09.870 --> 03:32:14.070
things and we can associate that, that type of. Okay. Um,

03:32:14.070 --> 03:32:18.570
much type of sufficient core CPUs and, uh, the, the machines

03:32:18.570 --> 03:32:21.310
as well. Yeah. So because they are giving you self hosting,

03:32:21.370 --> 03:32:23.750
right? You can host it on a hundred GB of GPUs or machines,

03:32:23.950 --> 03:32:28.910
you know, and one is stopping you. Right. Okay. Okay. Thank

03:32:28.910 --> 03:32:31.750
you. Yeah. Thanks. Okay. Next. Go ahead.

03:32:36.300 --> 03:32:43.860
Yeah. Yes, ma'am. Go ahead. Yeah. How are you? Yeah. Good,

03:32:43.940 --> 03:32:46.100
ma'am. Yeah. Go ahead, please. I'd like to share my screen.

03:32:46.240 --> 03:32:48.800
No doubts. Like, you know, what Dhruv has done, like, you

03:32:48.800 --> 03:32:51.300
know, even I have done a little bit of thing. I would like

03:32:51.300 --> 03:32:54.040
to share. Sure, ma'am. We can share the screen. Uh, Sumit,

03:32:54.060 --> 03:32:56.280
you have a question. Please go ahead with your question. If

03:32:56.280 --> 03:33:00.220
you have. Yes, sir. Yeah. Go ahead, Sumit. Uh, like, I have

03:33:00.220 --> 03:33:02.680
like two, uh, like two questions. So one with the share

03:33:02.680 --> 03:33:05.800
screen, one with the group, sir. Share. You would like to

03:33:05.800 --> 03:33:08.560
share the screen? Yes, sir. I want to share the screen as

03:33:08.560 --> 03:33:11.720
well. Okay. Let me make you a manifest first. Okay. You

03:33:11.720 --> 03:33:14.000
know, like I asked the question as well. You will join.

03:33:14.060 --> 03:33:17.460
Okay. During that, you can't ask the questions. Zoom will

03:33:17.460 --> 03:33:23.180
not allow. Anuj, what is your question? Yeah. Hi, sir. Hi.

03:33:23.220 --> 03:33:27.480
Hi. Yeah. Sir, I want to share my screen. I will. I have one

03:33:27.480 --> 03:33:31.760
create one workflow. So I want to show. Okay. Fine. Uh,

03:33:31.860 --> 03:33:35.640
once. What is your question? Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon, sir.

03:33:35.880 --> 03:33:37.660
Yeah. Good afternoon. Sir, I have a question from the

03:33:37.660 --> 03:33:40.800
previous class. Uh, can you please show how to wrap up the

03:33:40.800 --> 03:33:45.200
URI API embedding that is OpenAI, uh, text 3D? I think it is

03:33:45.200 --> 03:33:49.340
more embedding model. Embedding model with the langchain.

03:33:49.420 --> 03:33:52.680
How to wrap up the embedding URI model with the langchain.

03:33:53.860 --> 03:33:57.160
Embedding with the langchain. So basically, embedding model,

03:33:57.440 --> 03:33:59.760
I think I have already shown multiple times. Code is also

03:33:59.760 --> 03:34:03.740
shared. Sir, I am not able to find. Can you please show once

03:34:03.740 --> 03:34:06.120
again? Embedding with langchain, like, what is the logic

03:34:06.120 --> 03:34:07.820
behind it? I am not able to understand. Because see,

03:34:07.840 --> 03:34:10.920
langchain requires a LLM, chat completion LLMs, by the way.

03:34:11.100 --> 03:34:14.500
Right. So embedding, you are going to use it to maybe

03:34:14.500 --> 03:34:15.900
convert the code. You are going to convert your data into a

03:34:15.900 --> 03:34:18.420
vector space and store it into a vector database, right? For

03:34:18.420 --> 03:34:21.080
that purpose. Yes. But technically, langchain is going to

03:34:21.080 --> 03:34:23.940
call LLMs, right? Chat completion. There is a difference

03:34:23.940 --> 03:34:26.540
between chat completion. So why langchain and embedding? I

03:34:26.540 --> 03:34:28.280
am not able to understand this relationship, by the way.

03:34:29.800 --> 03:34:34.540
Why? Like, uh, like the SDK code you have shown, like in the

03:34:34.540 --> 03:34:37.020
PyPy. No, no. That is, that is fine. But why? What is the

03:34:37.020 --> 03:34:41.120
purpose? Just explain me the purpose first. Where, where are

03:34:41.120 --> 03:34:43.960
you able to use embedding into langchain? Just. Just like,

03:34:44.120 --> 03:34:46.960
uh, the langchain provides functionality like the open AI

03:34:46.960 --> 03:34:49.660
embeddings. It has integrated to the open AI and we can

03:34:49.660 --> 03:34:53.540
directly call the open AI embeddings. Yeah. Technically it

03:34:53.540 --> 03:34:56.880
provides an open AI embedding. At the end of the day, you

03:34:56.880 --> 03:34:59.260
are trying to call a vector storage and you are going to

03:34:59.260 --> 03:35:03.380
store into a vector storage, right? Yes. So I can just

03:35:03.380 --> 03:35:05.780
directly go ahead and try to use like a URI embedding

03:35:05.780 --> 03:35:08.560
directly over there instead of using those a wrapper for a

03:35:08.560 --> 03:35:11.180
langchain. See I have to convert my data into a vector,

03:35:11.260 --> 03:35:16.880
right? Yes. And then call URI embedding directly. Okay. So

03:35:16.880 --> 03:35:20.100
we have to call the embedding directly. Yeah. Call the

03:35:20.100 --> 03:35:23.120
embedding and then on top of that, like, uh, call langchain,

03:35:23.240 --> 03:35:25.980
whatever like purposes that you want. Can, uh, my question

03:35:25.980 --> 03:35:29.200
is, can we make it langchain compatible? You can make it

03:35:29.200 --> 03:35:31.040
langchain compatible. So we have already made chat

03:35:31.040 --> 03:35:33.140
completion compatible with langchain, right? Yes. And we

03:35:33.140 --> 03:35:35.580
have used the SDK. Similarly, you can do it. Similarly.

03:35:36.920 --> 03:35:40.780
Okay. Yeah. So the way we have done the chat completion.

03:35:41.200 --> 03:35:44.980
Have you shown that in the previous class? I don't, I don't

03:35:44.980 --> 03:35:47.040
think so. I don't think so. I have used embedding directly,

03:35:47.240 --> 03:35:51.400
but with langchain, I haven't used, I believe. Okay. Yeah.

03:35:51.440 --> 03:35:54.300
Through API, I was able to do it, but I was figuring out

03:35:54.300 --> 03:35:54.540
that.

03:35:57.980 --> 03:36:01.420
You can, you can make it. We have made one chat completion

03:36:01.420 --> 03:36:04.720
compatible, right? Yes, sir. Yes. Yeah. Similarly, you can

03:36:04.720 --> 03:36:09.620
do it. Yeah. Second question. Like one question that came

03:36:09.620 --> 03:36:14.620
out was a security issue. Like we can host our on any

03:36:14.620 --> 03:36:17.700
platform like hosting, but the credentials we are feeding

03:36:17.700 --> 03:36:22.560
you to the right? Like those triggers, these are being like

03:36:22.560 --> 03:36:27.700
triggering from the platform. So is it, is it advisable like

03:36:27.700 --> 03:36:32.400
to give our security credentials like LinkedIn and Google

03:36:32.400 --> 03:36:35.320
drive credentials? When you are hosting, when, when you are

03:36:35.320 --> 03:36:37.720
hosting on your platform, then obviously because it's your

03:36:37.720 --> 03:36:39.780
platform, no one is going to see your credentials. Right?

03:36:40.780 --> 03:36:45.320
Yeah. But yeah, in between we are using and it, and so if

03:36:45.320 --> 03:36:48.940
you are using it and in between you are using anything, it

03:36:48.940 --> 03:36:52.160
doesn't matter. It's just a software package, right? If it

03:36:52.160 --> 03:36:55.380
is available on my instances, it's very simple. I have a

03:36:55.380 --> 03:36:58.080
control. No one can steal, come and steal my like

03:36:58.080 --> 03:37:01.080
credentials basically for me. If it is running, for example,

03:37:01.320 --> 03:37:04.500
group is running on his own hosting girl, right? Yes. So in

03:37:04.500 --> 03:37:06.860
that case, obviously whatever credential he will save, it

03:37:06.860 --> 03:37:11.000
will be inside his hosting that itself. Yes. So no one is

03:37:11.000 --> 03:37:16.660
having access of his own stinger apart from Dhruv. Okay. So

03:37:16.660 --> 03:37:20.300
it's not going out. This is the point I'm just like trying

03:37:20.300 --> 03:37:24.820
to make. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Thank you so much. Yeah. Thanks.

03:37:26.180 --> 03:37:28.780
Yeah. I think, yeah, someone is sharing a screen. Please go

03:37:28.780 --> 03:37:32.520
ahead. Yes, sir. I have shared my street. So I just want a

03:37:32.520 --> 03:37:38.380
LinkedIn use case. It's like, let's apply for newsletters or

03:37:38.380 --> 03:37:41.780
we have some like pages of the open AI research area. Hmm.

03:37:41.960 --> 03:37:45.360
So in the prompt, rather than giving a prompt, can we do

03:37:45.360 --> 03:37:49.440
something like we, it can take the text directly from this

03:37:49.440 --> 03:37:54.440
screen and it will define it and we'll post in a LinkedIn

03:37:54.440 --> 03:37:57.780
directly as for the LinkedIn posts, either from newsletter

03:37:57.780 --> 03:38:03.240
or from the, any research page of open AI or something like

03:38:03.240 --> 03:38:08.780
this. If I, if I want to, in my mind, like not this, I have

03:38:08.780 --> 03:38:13.220
like this, this, like this. They have come up something new

03:38:13.220 --> 03:38:17.040
and I want to paste it in a like post for a LinkedIn. So can

03:38:17.040 --> 03:38:21.940
we do it directly? Again, if you can come up with your

03:38:21.940 --> 03:38:23.900
question, what is your question by the way? Okay. My

03:38:23.900 --> 03:38:26.780
question is, let's say we subscribe for many of the

03:38:26.780 --> 03:38:30.060
newsletters. And if you were coming in a AI, just like I

03:38:30.060 --> 03:38:34.500
have a supply for this alpha, like alpha signal. So they,

03:38:34.600 --> 03:38:37.860
they like, they will provide me every day, but I have what

03:38:37.860 --> 03:38:44.260
the new thing happened in this. So like, so like rather than

03:38:44.260 --> 03:38:47.920
going each and every one like link and then you find it for

03:38:47.920 --> 03:38:53.540
the LinkedIn posts. Does the group as he showcased, Yeah. So

03:38:53.540 --> 03:38:56.440
just access your mail, get your mail, access your mail and

03:38:56.440 --> 03:38:58.420
you can access your inbox mail. You can access promotion

03:38:58.420 --> 03:39:00.840
mail. All the options are given in a, in a 10 by the way for

03:39:00.840 --> 03:39:03.820
a Gmail at least. Right. Even you can access your draft as

03:39:03.820 --> 03:39:05.880
well. Even if it says you're a spam, everything is

03:39:05.880 --> 03:39:08.480
accessible so you can access your mails and let's suppose

03:39:08.480 --> 03:39:11.660
this is falling under the promotional tab. So you can access

03:39:11.660 --> 03:39:14.700
it and then like send it to the agents or maybe not even an

03:39:14.700 --> 03:39:18.080
agent. I would say send it to simple a chat model and ask it

03:39:18.080 --> 03:39:20.500
to summarize and then give me the summary in a 500 words or

03:39:20.500 --> 03:39:23.280
whatever words that you want with your own flavor. Just

03:39:23.280 --> 03:39:28.580
write a simple system prompt and then post it. Simple. Okay.

03:39:29.260 --> 03:39:34.720
So next is I'm facing this issue that this is a, in that

03:39:34.720 --> 03:39:38.580
application, my generate embedding model is not working

03:39:38.580 --> 03:39:41.280
properly. Every time is giving me that data as a key

03:39:41.280 --> 03:39:43.760
element. So what I'm trying to do here is just to check your

03:39:43.760 --> 03:39:46.060
data. What is the data? What is the data variable that you

03:39:46.060 --> 03:39:49.560
have mentioned? Same. Like I have like a short all the data

03:39:49.560 --> 03:39:56.640
file itself in a file IP and a file itself. What is the data

03:39:56.640 --> 03:40:00.540
file? What is the data embedding is equal to generate

03:40:00.540 --> 03:40:02.440
embedding function. You're trying to call line number

03:40:02.440 --> 03:40:06.540
embedding line number, embedding NP array data, zero

03:40:07.080 --> 03:40:13.480
embedding. So go to the, okay. Do one thing. Go to your own,

03:40:13.500 --> 03:40:15.660
your own officer.

03:40:23.010 --> 03:40:25.950
Yeah. API API isمل

03:40:29.470 --> 03:40:34.230
embedding. Just go down, go down. Code sample, code example.

03:40:36.810 --> 03:40:42.300
Come down, copy. Now this one, copy

03:40:45.890 --> 03:40:53.870
copy. Yeah. Go back. Replace this code. Replace this code.

03:40:56.810 --> 03:40:59.450
Remove last two line. It's not required. Like just keep this

03:40:59.450 --> 03:41:02.210
function. Yeah. Do last line. Yeah.

03:41:05.620 --> 03:41:08.740
Hmm. Uh, password. Hmm.

03:41:23.040 --> 03:41:24.460
Come down. Is it cute?

03:41:27.920 --> 03:41:32.400
Hmm. Call it inside for loop with your data. Okay.

03:41:37.840 --> 03:41:39.320
This one. Hmm.

03:41:49.970 --> 03:41:53.210
So the problem is you haven't even logged in into our check

03:41:53.210 --> 03:41:56.470
the URI API page. Uh, since a very, very long time, we have

03:41:56.470 --> 03:41:59.770
published it or we already did it four months back, but you

03:41:59.770 --> 03:42:02.450
are still using a very, very old code from the old courses

03:42:02.450 --> 03:42:06.630
without even checking the URI API page. That was the only

03:42:06.630 --> 03:42:12.560
issue. Yeah. I took it from the last batch you have taken at

03:42:12.560 --> 03:42:17.440
that point we have, we are also updating, right? Sure. So we

03:42:17.440 --> 03:42:21.040
keep on updating the pages. That was the only issue. There

03:42:21.040 --> 03:42:26.360
was no, it's working now. Okay. Fine. Thank you. Thank you.

03:42:26.360 --> 03:42:29.840
You know, my, yeah. Any one. So someone was saying me too

03:42:29.840 --> 03:42:33.580
soon. Okay. So I believe I know just to make sure the

03:42:33.580 --> 03:42:37.960
screen. So I'm saying my skin. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah. Yeah.

03:42:39.970 --> 03:42:43.830
So actually this is my first time to in last four, three

03:42:43.830 --> 03:42:50.010
years when I joined, I, I knew wrong. Okay. Yeah. Sir. Okay.

03:42:51.130 --> 03:42:57.170
So one second, sir. Yeah, sure. I have create one workflow

03:42:57.170 --> 03:43:03.810
for the money. money like money alert system so when i tap

03:43:03.810 --> 03:43:05.030
on when

03:43:09.610 --> 03:43:14.650
i said just with this step reminder and and the execute flow

03:43:14.650 --> 03:43:22.030
so it will directly send to my the my gmail and then your

03:43:22.030 --> 03:43:24.210
telegram yes sir

03:43:28.460 --> 03:43:33.660
just a minute sir yeah this one sir and then uh and then

03:43:33.660 --> 03:43:38.460
same sir message i will get it in my telegram also okay okay

03:43:38.460 --> 03:43:44.840
so that i've created sir okay amazing amazing so yeah people

03:43:44.840 --> 03:43:47.700
are people are i think people will enjoy any time i think i

03:43:47.700 --> 03:43:49.960
should discuss more and more application small big

03:43:49.960 --> 03:43:54.420
everything right what do you think everyone yeah so let's

03:43:54.420 --> 03:43:56.380
discuss like more and more application on any time itself

03:43:57.180 --> 03:44:00.920
because see i'm i'm telling you honestly when i will open up

03:44:00.920 --> 03:44:04.400
your auto autogen ui parts right see autogen you can include

03:44:04.400 --> 03:44:09.540
in two way one is coding one is ui believe me you none of

03:44:09.540 --> 03:44:13.720
you are going to like it autogen ui so which is our next

03:44:13.720 --> 03:44:17.120
topic by the way so fine i'll i'll just like because yeah

03:44:17.120 --> 03:44:20.140
anything is actually very useful and the way it's it's easy

03:44:20.140 --> 03:44:23.080
to use they're providing you so i'll try to discuss more and

03:44:23.080 --> 03:44:26.740
more use cases sir i want to ask one question sir actually i

03:44:26.740 --> 03:44:29.380
have three years of experience and i am working in data

03:44:29.380 --> 03:44:35.840
centers uh like in a backup at admin so i want to just

03:44:35.840 --> 03:44:41.220
change my fields in the like in the ai or something so sir

03:44:42.300 --> 03:44:45.700
so nothing see see focus on the core part i would say

03:44:45.700 --> 03:44:47.860
machine learning deep learning is also important focus on

03:44:47.860 --> 03:44:51.800
core part apart from like a core part if you would like to

03:44:51.800 --> 03:44:54.420
if you would like to get into a just a generative ai focus

03:44:54.420 --> 03:44:57.700
on this entire generative stack build more show more see

03:44:57.700 --> 03:45:01.000
that is the only like things which is going to save you or

03:45:01.000 --> 03:45:04.500
which is going to bring an opportunity so just try to build

03:45:04.500 --> 03:45:06.820
more the way you have built this one although it's a small

03:45:06.820 --> 03:45:09.200
application but when people will see it's an effective one

03:45:09.200 --> 03:45:13.440
and then promote it over like all the places uh try to

03:45:13.440 --> 03:45:15.460
promote yourself because see at the end of the day you are

03:45:15.460 --> 03:45:18.500
the only backup that you have right so if you are not going

03:45:18.500 --> 03:45:20.780
to promote yourself if you are not going to market yourself

03:45:20.780 --> 03:45:23.620
if you are not going to sell yourself no one is going to

03:45:23.620 --> 03:45:27.860
come and give you an opportunity world is crowded right and

03:45:27.860 --> 03:45:31.680
everyone is fighting for an opportunity one single one so

03:45:31.680 --> 03:45:34.300
you have to fight for yours and this is what i keep on

03:45:34.300 --> 03:45:37.820
saying to everyone that uh fight for yourself every day

03:45:37.820 --> 03:45:40.480
within six months four months so you will be able to get a

03:45:40.480 --> 03:45:43.060
very good opportunities you will be able to encash it but

03:45:43.060 --> 03:45:47.100
yeah uh you should keep on doing it with discipline it's not

03:45:47.100 --> 03:45:50.660
a hard work i say i say it's more about it's more of like a

03:45:50.660 --> 03:45:54.060
discipline and consistent approach right which will yield a

03:45:54.060 --> 03:45:57.820
better result so keep on doing it but yeah whatever you do

03:45:57.820 --> 03:46:01.520
sell it show it to the people yes if you're not doing it so

03:46:01.520 --> 03:46:06.020
you're doing a crime against yourself yes which many of us

03:46:06.020 --> 03:46:10.280
are doing it actually yes thank you yeah thank you

03:46:14.390 --> 03:46:25.020
okay next one uh yeah anuj you have to share the screen uh

03:46:25.020 --> 03:46:27.660
then we have once we have pk we have a seat so yeah if you

03:46:27.660 --> 03:46:29.460
have any question for me so please go ahead otherwise we'll

03:46:29.460 --> 03:46:34.680
close the session yeah so uh student um in indiana natn

03:46:34.680 --> 03:46:38.480
there is options is so we put the code also right then can

03:46:38.480 --> 03:46:45.680
we combine n8n with uh the launch chain or langras i combine

03:46:45.680 --> 03:46:47.940
it so let's suppose something i have done with the language

03:46:47.940 --> 03:46:51.360
i will try to expose it as a api and then i will call https

03:46:51.360 --> 03:46:56.140
ah okay okay got it okay right see the problem with that

03:46:56.140 --> 03:46:58.860
lanchan as a sorry the problem with anything is more about

03:46:58.860 --> 03:47:00.820
the defense right so the problem with as of now is that that

03:47:00.820 --> 03:47:05.000
it allows you code but only a base library so let's suppose

03:47:05.000 --> 03:47:08.100
if i have to install some of the libraries right they're not

03:47:08.100 --> 03:47:11.360
allowing you now oh okay that's that's the biggest problem

03:47:11.360 --> 03:47:14.580
right so even in a javascript so when we were using a fetch

03:47:14.580 --> 03:47:16.860
so you must have seen that it was not allowing me to install

03:47:16.860 --> 03:47:19.080
it so basically fetch is not a part of let's suppose base

03:47:19.080 --> 03:47:22.620
library so it will not install so technically i can't use

03:47:22.620 --> 03:47:27.800
any of the code in javascript on a full scale right on a

03:47:27.800 --> 03:47:30.360
full scale because see if i have to use directly as a code

03:47:30.360 --> 03:47:32.820
as a lang chain so i have to install first a lang chain

03:47:32.820 --> 03:47:35.720
right and that to a land graph or anything which supports a

03:47:35.720 --> 03:47:38.160
javascript or maybe supports a python so i have to install

03:47:38.160 --> 03:47:40.900
it now that is something which anything is not allowing you

03:47:40.900 --> 03:47:44.720
in future maybe they will charge more because to give you or

03:47:44.720 --> 03:47:48.360
to allow you to install something again compute is required

03:47:48.360 --> 03:47:52.240
right computer is required so maybe in future they will

03:47:52.240 --> 03:47:54.680
allow you that there is a very high possibility but as of

03:47:54.680 --> 03:47:57.620
now that option is not available only base they are giving

03:47:57.620 --> 03:48:00.020
you code but code doesn't mean that you can write any kind

03:48:00.020 --> 03:48:03.360
of a code again you should understand that part okay okay

03:48:03.360 --> 03:48:05.680
but yeah in future no one knows maybe they are thinking

03:48:05.680 --> 03:48:07.600
about that feature so that you know they can charge more

03:48:07.600 --> 03:48:11.920
they can like you know uh earn more more revenue but

03:48:11.920 --> 03:48:14.760
currently i can create apis and then call it yeah so

03:48:14.760 --> 03:48:17.780
currently you can try to build your own lang chain or land

03:48:17.780 --> 03:48:20.540
graph or anything that you want expose that as an api and

03:48:20.540 --> 03:48:23.920
then call as a https ah okay thank you so that you know your

03:48:23.920 --> 03:48:25.500
lang channel lang graph or anything will run on a javascript

03:48:25.500 --> 03:48:25.920
or something like that so that's the way it will run on your

03:48:25.920 --> 03:48:29.000
instance separate instance it will just invoke that instance

03:48:29.000 --> 03:48:32.360
it will just try to access that instance that's it okay okay

03:48:32.360 --> 03:48:39.340
yeah yeah thanks okay next please okay yeah so here just i

03:48:39.340 --> 03:48:41.980
wanted to add or just i wanted to ask one thing so here if

03:48:41.980 --> 03:48:44.400
you see in community nodes now there they are giving such

03:48:44.400 --> 03:48:48.040
options to install the packages in under the limited one

03:48:48.040 --> 03:48:50.820
actually in a community node the limited one basically it's

03:48:50.820 --> 03:48:54.160
a shared package that they are allowing you to access a very

03:48:54.160 --> 03:48:56.240
very limited one everything and anything you can't like

03:48:56.240 --> 03:49:00.840
access maybe try to install maybe npm or something like this

03:49:00.840 --> 03:49:06.320
fetch i think it's a very limited one and it's a community

03:49:06.320 --> 03:49:11.140
means it will be publicly available to everyone okay got it

03:49:11.140 --> 03:49:12.720
yeah because

03:49:15.760 --> 03:49:20.940
installing anything requires instances so they can't like

03:49:20.940 --> 03:49:24.220
you know let's suppose i have installed some version uh

03:49:24.220 --> 03:49:28.540
lanchan older version and you have installed it's a

03:49:28.540 --> 03:49:32.240
community node means it's a shared node share machine right

03:49:32.240 --> 03:49:35.020
so i think here i have more flexibility with this because

03:49:35.020 --> 03:49:38.200
i'm using my own hosting version so i might have flexibility

03:49:38.200 --> 03:49:43.020
yeah you have you have a flexibility if in that ui uh it's i

03:49:43.020 --> 03:49:45.880
haven't checked but i i don't know like whether they're

03:49:45.880 --> 03:49:49.080
giving you or they're allowing you in that offline ui to

03:49:49.080 --> 03:49:52.960
install something or not okay that needed to check yeah that

03:49:52.960 --> 03:49:55.420
you have to that you have to check right because here

03:49:55.420 --> 03:50:01.730
community node means it's a shared one okay let's please go

03:50:01.730 --> 03:50:05.830
ahead okay okay through by sudan sir thank you so much for

03:50:05.830 --> 03:50:11.010
amazing session uh i was trying to integrate the yuri uh api

03:50:11.010 --> 03:50:16.250
or sir problem car when there is a data which has slashes in

03:50:16.250 --> 03:50:20.410
it like uh backward slash i i actually want to share my

03:50:20.410 --> 03:50:23.090
screen if you allow me okay sure yeah you can you can do

03:50:23.090 --> 03:50:25.550
that keep it inside triple quote i think that will work but

03:50:25.550 --> 03:50:27.830
yeah you can share the screen anyone else guys would like to

03:50:27.830 --> 03:50:28.250
share the screen

03:50:32.130 --> 03:50:39.010
yes ma'am so go ahead like you just kept me waiting yes yeah

03:50:39.010 --> 03:50:42.050
promoted as a panelist okay so question from yogi what is

03:50:42.050 --> 03:50:49.170
your question yes sir yeah yeah you have a question uh sir

03:50:49.170 --> 03:50:54.710
actually i'm a mechanical background so i have to do

03:50:54.710 --> 03:51:00.070
something in another domain personal branding order domain

03:51:00.070 --> 03:51:09.570
hmm about that but I have also I am interested as so read it

03:51:11.590 --> 03:51:15.890
it's okay you have to start from somewhere and then move

03:51:15.890 --> 03:51:18.130
forward a little from your side then obviously we are here

03:51:18.130 --> 03:51:23.590
to push you harder and harder and I am planning to do some

03:51:23.590 --> 03:51:29.110
project regarding that field hmm first do your study then do

03:51:29.110 --> 03:51:32.030
your domain project rest of the people are doing their

03:51:32.030 --> 03:51:33.290
domain okay

03:51:37.420 --> 03:51:43.160
okay Sudhanshu sir what was happening that whenever I work

03:51:43.160 --> 03:51:50.080
flow I forgot to save work flow I cannot see that it gives

03:51:50.080 --> 03:51:57.240
pop up during exit time I don't know I had built that

03:51:57.240 --> 03:52:01.280
complete work flow if it is saved then it won't give if it

03:52:01.280 --> 03:52:03.680
is not saved then once you leave then it will pop up I don't

03:52:03.680 --> 03:52:07.520
know it will give okay tell me what is the issue okay

03:52:07.520 --> 03:52:14.340
whenever I am using URI API what was happening is so the

03:52:14.340 --> 03:52:20.100
data which I am receiving that data is having slash or

03:52:20.100 --> 03:52:23.840
backward slash or slash n or curly braces all these things

03:52:23.840 --> 03:52:28.540
so when I am when I am going through the URI so I will share

03:52:28.540 --> 03:52:32.720
you my notepad I will have to make it again okay it will be

03:52:32.720 --> 03:52:35.760
made so I will share you my notepad so this is my prompt I

03:52:35.760 --> 03:52:42.080
mean this is my like messages and then content and role user

03:52:42.080 --> 03:52:45.680
content and in content is where I am giving all my prompt so

03:52:45.680 --> 03:52:50.500
if you see here this thing works json.location works but

03:52:50.500 --> 03:52:54.000
whenever I go for json.description which has a lot of

03:52:54.000 --> 03:52:59.520
backward slash it does not work and so that was one of the

03:52:59.520 --> 03:53:02.960
issue which I have been facing there is also like if you see

03:53:02.960 --> 03:53:07.200
these are like line breaks right so even those line breaks

03:53:07.200 --> 03:53:12.000
were creating issue so when I combine all of this like this

03:53:12.560 --> 03:53:16.480
it started working but whenever there is a line break and

03:53:16.480 --> 03:53:19.720
whenever I am like so wherever there is a line break you

03:53:19.720 --> 03:53:23.360
have to put slash n so that it will be able to pass it it

03:53:23.360 --> 03:53:24.960
will be able to understand that okay fine so there is a

03:53:24.960 --> 03:53:28.020
break and you have to jump it so basically that is that is

03:53:28.020 --> 03:53:31.820
the reason so we have a multiple escape character in like a

03:53:31.820 --> 03:53:33.660
computer or any programming language right in like a

03:53:33.660 --> 03:53:34.400
computer or any programming language right so whenever there

03:53:34.400 --> 03:53:37.420
is a line break you have to pass slash n instead of that so

03:53:37.420 --> 03:53:41.820
then only it will be able to understand so okay line break

03:53:41.820 --> 03:53:46.640
can still be solved but here the json.description in this

03:53:46.640 --> 03:53:53.380
the data is coming with all this backward slashes and curly

03:53:53.380 --> 03:53:57.140
braces and because of that this whole prompt is unable to

03:53:57.140 --> 03:54:02.700
work properly so in the prompt you specify the symbols like

03:54:02.700 --> 03:54:04.340
this just specify the symbol that you want me to put data in

03:54:04.340 --> 03:54:07.760
plain text and there should not be any slashes and there

03:54:07.760 --> 03:54:09.160
should not be any curly braces there should not be any

03:54:09.160 --> 03:54:12.480
emojis if you specify the symbol in the prompt then I don't

03:54:12.480 --> 03:54:16.500
think it will give you so the issue here is I am expecting

03:54:16.500 --> 03:54:19.000
the data in json format so if you are asking the json format

03:54:19.000 --> 03:54:21.920
then say that give me json clean data give it a clean

03:54:21.920 --> 03:54:24.980
structured data if you are going to give a specific like a

03:54:24.980 --> 03:54:27.520
system prompt that you have to behave like this only

03:54:27.520 --> 03:54:29.360
obviously it will behave in that way it will clean the data

03:54:30.040 --> 03:54:37.960
yes yes okay so llms are very good very good with that this

03:54:37.960 --> 03:54:41.100
is strange sir but i have created a workflow which is

03:54:41.100 --> 03:54:47.640
connecting recruiters by searching jobs from linkedin and my

03:54:47.640 --> 03:54:52.060
resume is changing according to that job description and

03:54:52.060 --> 03:54:57.800
those and if you see here uh this was uh this was the

03:54:57.800 --> 03:55:02.020
curated uh resume which is generated on the basis of the job

03:55:02.020 --> 03:55:06.100
description on the flight that's that's great it's great so

03:55:06.100 --> 03:55:15.180
just he refreshed so uh

03:55:15.180 --> 03:55:20.980
my question here is uh uh i was i was searching like how we

03:55:20.980 --> 03:55:25.440
can solve this easy apply thing easy apply and uh there is

03:55:25.440 --> 03:55:29.240
something called as browser use from from browser use you

03:55:29.240 --> 03:55:33.300
can actually fetch those uh html tags where that button and

03:55:33.300 --> 03:55:38.120
you simulate the button click event so that is one and

03:55:38.120 --> 03:55:41.760
another option is whoever is the recruiter those recruiter

03:55:41.760 --> 03:55:45.560
uh you can actually send message in your or like from your

03:55:45.560 --> 03:55:50.860
linkedin specifying the details of this give me one moment

03:55:50.860 --> 03:55:53.540
give me one yeah

03:56:31.620 --> 03:56:40.850
please go ahead okay so um i forgot what i was saying uh

03:56:40.850 --> 03:56:45.970
it's it's just that uh when when i talk about this this

03:56:45.970 --> 03:56:50.630
complete flow uh from browser use when we are simulating

03:56:50.630 --> 03:56:53.950
those tags and clicking on it you were sharing some

03:56:53.950 --> 03:56:57.030
information that uh your team were facing some issue when

03:56:57.030 --> 03:57:03.450
you tried to achieve it in terms of in terms of uh see my

03:57:03.450 --> 03:57:05.590
target is i don't want to say that i'm not a spend multiple

03:57:05.590 --> 03:57:09.270
hours in applying for jobs in linkedin i want it to create

03:57:09.270 --> 03:57:12.810
my resume on the job and just apply easy apply you can do it

03:57:12.810 --> 03:57:16.450
easy apply can be automated we have already done that and

03:57:16.450 --> 03:57:19.310
with 100 accuracy you will be able to automate the easy

03:57:19.310 --> 03:57:23.270
apply part or any in platform applying right because there

03:57:23.270 --> 03:57:26.790
will be a static tab and like we can access those tab uh

03:57:26.790 --> 03:57:30.170
easily via code and we can try to make a click on that fill

03:57:30.170 --> 03:57:33.210
the form or like fill the resume by the way and then like we

03:57:33.210 --> 03:57:37.110
can apply for that but when we talk about applying on any

03:57:37.110 --> 03:57:39.730
other platform basically like apart from the easy apply so

03:57:39.730 --> 03:57:42.950
you click you go to some other platform so every platform is

03:57:42.950 --> 03:57:45.590
different in some platform you have to do even a captcha

03:57:45.590 --> 03:57:49.070
verification right some platforms so they will like ask you

03:57:49.070 --> 03:57:53.070
to tick on like traffic signals or like some like a puzzles

03:57:53.070 --> 03:57:56.790
they will ask you to solve basically uh just to prevent any

03:57:56.790 --> 03:58:01.250
kind of attack or just to like you know uh not allow you to

03:58:01.250 --> 03:58:03.950
like you know do a robotic automation over there code based

03:58:03.950 --> 03:58:07.850
automation over there so on on that and many platform many

03:58:07.850 --> 03:58:10.330
platforms so which ask you to you know apply on their

03:58:10.330 --> 03:58:13.470
platform they have this captcha verification right or maybe

03:58:13.470 --> 03:58:15.930
they are going to ask you for a sso or maybe a google sign

03:58:15.930 --> 03:58:20.210
in or something uh in that case uh it's it's tough because

03:58:20.210 --> 03:58:24.590
for every cases it will be like a different uh flow sir but

03:58:24.590 --> 03:58:28.670
in use case they don't call you in easy apply sir you don't

03:58:28.670 --> 03:58:31.670
get any yeah so that's the thing right like uh

03:58:43.670 --> 03:58:47.730
okay so sir there is one more question sir uh uh it's been

03:58:47.730 --> 03:58:52.390
one and a half month now i'm

03:58:52.390 --> 03:58:57.850
thinking

03:58:57.850 --> 03:59:02.370
of uh building core skills related to machine learning any

03:59:02.370 --> 03:59:05.750
suggestion how i could build that probably in like one to

03:59:05.750 --> 03:59:10.710
two months of time uh�� your suggestion any courses which i

03:59:10.710 --> 03:59:14.010
should go through for the machine learning because machine

03:59:14.010 --> 03:59:16.310
learning is my new one yeah my new one i have already

03:59:16.310 --> 03:59:19.270
started right uh the one which i have started yesterday and

03:59:19.270 --> 03:59:21.650
if you would like to go in a fast-track mode go with the

03:59:21.650 --> 03:59:25.450
full stack data science batch full stack data science yeah

03:59:25.450 --> 03:59:28.110
that is also also available it's alive it was a live batch

03:59:28.110 --> 03:59:30.930
where i taught machine learning uh in a detailed manner all

03:59:30.930 --> 03:59:31.770
the algorithms were such that it منت Mercaра الد gegن and

03:59:31.770 --> 03:59:34.810
its implementation so yeah it will be like it will clarify

03:59:34.810 --> 03:59:38.710
every concept of a machine learning part sir one last

03:59:38.710 --> 03:59:43.550
question in github sir how to do backdated i want to

03:59:43.550 --> 03:59:48.650
backdate sir i have never done anything in github for 20

03:59:48.650 --> 03:59:53.650
years and just one month has started so start from today no

03:59:53.650 --> 03:59:57.210
problem start today daily but backdate can't do anything in

03:59:57.210 --> 03:59:59.970
it backdate there is no way in github

03:59:59.970 --> 04:00:04.150
okay okay this is helpful sir thank you so much yeah

04:00:10.610 --> 04:00:12.750
so next please is

04:00:20.370 --> 04:00:24.830
my screen visible uh yes ma'am yeah it's visible yes yes so

04:00:24.830 --> 04:00:28.230
uh see during lang chain like you know only two place two

04:00:28.230 --> 04:00:31.290
actually you showed us so i asked you one question like you

04:00:31.290 --> 04:00:36.770
know what much rule i do yes so coming up with that like you

04:00:36.770 --> 04:00:42.070
know i just uh i've done like uh using this in it and a very

04:00:42.070 --> 04:00:44.970
simple thing like you know you try to place like you know

04:00:44.970 --> 04:00:49.530
any question using what matter like you can have uh sign

04:00:49.530 --> 04:00:53.610
cost and anything any complex yeah yeah yeah it will try to

04:00:53.610 --> 04:00:55.030
solve it okay

04:00:57.400 --> 04:00:59.200
so

04:01:01.440 --> 04:01:03.940
yeah i think it's solving right final calculation it's all

04:01:03.940 --> 04:01:08.240
it's all 136 is the answer i can even use some geometric

04:01:08.240 --> 04:01:11.940
things like also any ratios and everything also you can even

04:01:11.940 --> 04:01:16.220
this function which is available call map but so where i try

04:01:16.220 --> 04:01:20.660
to use that and then it is trying to solve it that's it okay

04:01:20.660 --> 04:01:26.460
okay yeah yes no even you can pass even you can pass a like

04:01:26.460 --> 04:01:30.600
uh if i'll talk about a uri chat not a paper so you can pass

04:01:30.600 --> 04:01:33.080
images and you will try to understand images and then it

04:01:33.080 --> 04:01:34.740
will give you the answer if you have written something

04:01:34.740 --> 04:01:38.920
mathematical by your hand it will be we have a ocr

04:01:38.920 --> 04:01:42.240
capability in the back end okay but sometimes i'm getting

04:01:42.240 --> 04:01:45.100
this error like you know if you could see it is hitting that

04:01:45.100 --> 04:01:50.220

user fine this looks fine in terms of formatting content is

04:04:21.690 --> 04:04:26.270
this so json.chat input maybe mapping could be an issue i

04:04:26.270 --> 04:04:29.830
don't know uh model max token temperature looks fine yeah

04:04:29.830 --> 04:04:33.330
close it uh maybe test it once only

04:04:35.410 --> 04:04:39.610
this i can test individually yeah individual uh okay and i

04:04:39.610 --> 04:04:44.370
can execute this test see this one it is working fine but uh

04:04:44.370 --> 04:04:47.770
all of a sudden like you know this error so i was able to

04:04:47.770 --> 04:04:53.190
change let me give me the give me the remote control done

04:04:53.190 --> 04:04:54.230
okay so

04:04:58.420 --> 04:05:02.140
basically let me send something here now

04:05:04.350 --> 04:05:08.510
it's working fine there's no problem actually i just close

04:05:08.510 --> 04:05:11.510
this again come back and work it is working yeah basically

04:05:11.510 --> 04:05:14.930
the data was the issue it is working even everything is fine

04:05:14.930 --> 04:05:19.450
okay yeah so that's why i just build this with the help of

04:05:19.450 --> 04:05:23.230
this chat gpt i would like to show you this code also here

04:05:23.230 --> 04:05:26.130
like you know a very simple code like mac js this is just

04:05:26.130 --> 04:05:29.070
two lines a piece of code where it is trying to evaluate and

04:05:29.070 --> 04:05:33.450
then give it all the units here right all the things on my

04:05:33.450 --> 04:05:44.270
screen at the ios i mostly some always request only http

04:05:44.270 --> 04:05:46.950
request it is going and it is trying to perform an eater

04:05:46.950 --> 04:05:53.930
this one automatically n8n has given it to me okay so i

04:05:53.930 --> 04:05:56.610
don't need this might be in the future i've checked like you

04:05:56.610 --> 04:05:59.790
know what it is what it is trying to do it is just going to

04:05:59.790 --> 04:06:04.330
this okay so i think you have uploaded my uh json file right

04:06:04.330 --> 04:06:09.890
your json file no so this is my math earlier i have done

04:06:09.890 --> 04:06:13.430
that i earlier i ran yeah it's coming from that so yesterday

04:06:13.430 --> 04:06:15.630
someone has asked a question so just to answer the question

04:06:16.160 --> 04:06:19.530
i have you know drawn this part okay so why it is coming

04:06:19.530 --> 04:06:24.130
like you know i can delete this so this is not a part of my

04:06:24.130 --> 04:06:31.350
night okay okay okay okay fine fine so you were saying

04:06:31.350 --> 04:06:34.210
something like you know in your own also you have an option

04:06:34.210 --> 04:06:36.630
wherein i can just post some question and then it will give

04:06:37.650 --> 04:06:40.830
where sudhanshu post the question and then it will give you

04:06:40.830 --> 04:06:41.090
the answer

04:06:44.730 --> 04:06:47.970
so you have two systems for yuri right one is api one is a

04:06:47.970 --> 04:06:52.770
chat so here in a chat so any type of question it will be

04:06:52.770 --> 04:06:55.910
answering anything means anything it's having a chat gpt

04:06:55.910 --> 04:06:58.970
access so anything and it can do even a google search

04:06:58.970 --> 04:07:01.710
basically real-time search it can even like understand your

04:07:01.710 --> 04:07:04.670
images and can generate the images as well you can even

04:07:04.670 --> 04:07:08.230
upload file and ask for some ask for summarization so okay

04:07:08.230 --> 04:07:12.610
every task can do it for you okay okay i'm not explored on

04:07:12.610 --> 04:07:15.790
netflix i'll try to do that it's just like a chat gpt ma'am

sir i have done i've done okay sir uh uh sir my workflow of

04:07:39.340 --> 04:07:43.040
it's a case of retrieval but still

04:07:46.260 --> 04:07:47.660
okay

04:07:49.980 --> 04:07:51.380
paul

uh maybe drew uh uh is

04:08:08.580 --> 04:08:09.980
option

04:08:13.740 --> 04:08:20.440
the day right um I just click on it. You know what? Copy to

04:08:20.440 --> 04:08:26.940
paste. Control V. Control V. Right click on paste option.

04:08:28.020 --> 04:08:30.200
Control V. Control V.

04:08:33.050 --> 04:08:43.590
Copy or paste. Copy to editor. Copy to editor. Copy to

04:08:43.590 --> 04:08:47.750
editor. See, see. Can you unpin first the workflow clicking

04:08:47.750 --> 04:08:52.170
execute? That is pinned. Unpin first. When clicking, unpin

04:08:52.170 --> 04:08:57.210
it once. This one. See here. When clicking execute, the

04:08:57.210 --> 04:09:02.650
trigger node has a pin. Unpin it once. Pin, pin, pin. Yes,

04:09:02.650 --> 04:09:14.060
exactly. Unpin it first. Unpin. Now copy. Yes. Go to that, I

04:09:14.060 --> 04:09:17.180
think it will be done now. Same, same, same. Same, just. Go

04:09:17.180 --> 04:09:19.880
to execution and click on copy editor. Click there once.

04:09:23.790 --> 04:09:27.270
Go to execution. Same, same thing.

04:09:33.430 --> 04:09:37.910
Okay, and here control V. Not done. There is no paste

04:09:37.910 --> 04:09:43.550
option. This is something. It has been pinned again. Delete

04:09:43.550 --> 04:09:51.050
this old one. Delete it. Yes. Everything is empty. There was

04:09:51.050 --> 04:09:57.630
some last one left, sir. Yes. If it happens, it will not

04:09:57.630 --> 04:09:58.670
work. It will be done. It will be done.

04:10:03.090 --> 04:10:08.150
Now, control V. Not happening. Actually, this is not copying

04:10:08.150 --> 04:10:12.270
previous workflow. Might be because it has been deleted.

04:10:12.550 --> 04:10:16.390
There is an option on the right. No, no, there will be some

04:10:16.390 --> 04:10:20.010
bug. In the future, these people will solve it. In the

04:10:20.010 --> 04:10:23.050
future, this feature will release. Easy to copy. The deleted

04:10:23.050 --> 04:10:24.770
one. It is just a few days.

04:10:27.940 --> 04:10:32.280
Okay, let me try this last time. I will not waste the time

04:10:32.280 --> 04:10:36.260
of it. No, no, it is okay. It is not working. Okay, sir, I

04:10:36.260 --> 04:10:40.800
will make it. Sir, one more question. Small, I have done my

04:10:40.800 --> 04:10:46.900
child in young neuron. Raster, but the only problem is for

04:10:46.900 --> 04:10:50.440
that class at 2.30 in the night. Means from now to after two

04:10:50.440 --> 04:10:56.000
hours. Oh, so, recording. Have to go through recording. It's

04:10:56.000 --> 04:10:59.760
okay. It's not that important to study. No, it won't wake

04:10:59.760 --> 04:11:03.340
you up, sir. What happens if I wake you up? Exactly. So,

04:11:03.340 --> 04:11:05.540
tell them to watch the recording. It's okay. Okay. If there

04:11:05.540 --> 04:11:08.140
are any other questions, you can handle them easily. Like,

04:11:08.200 --> 04:11:11.940
you know everything. But, sir, will you ever do such a

04:11:11.940 --> 04:11:16.700
hybrid, such a class in BG? There is planning. They can see

04:11:16.700 --> 04:11:20.180
you and talk to you. There is a little planning for the kids

04:11:20.180 --> 04:11:22.960
as well. Like, it happens, right? Multiple things are

04:11:22.960 --> 04:11:26.220
brought. In the future, they will bring it. So, I am

04:11:26.220 --> 04:11:29.540
planning. As the bandwidth will increase, we are onboarding

04:11:29.540 --> 04:11:32.740
mentors from our side. So, it will come. There is planning.

04:11:33.600 --> 04:11:37.800
Okay, sir. If you consider some PST time, then it will be

04:11:37.800 --> 04:11:42.800
good if they see you live. Done. Done. Done. Done. Done. We

04:11:42.800 --> 04:11:45.580
will consider PST time. This is it. Okay. Thank you. Thank

04:11:45.580 --> 04:11:48.000
you so much, Dhruv and Sudhanshu. Thank you. Thank you.

04:11:48.560 --> 04:11:51.400
Okay. So, this is it, guys. Thank you so much, Dhruv. I hope

04:11:51.400 --> 04:11:57.440
you had fun today as a mentor. Thank you so much, sir. It's

04:11:57.440 --> 04:11:59.320
first time. Basically, I used to talk to friends and

04:11:59.320 --> 04:12:02.520
colleagues, but this is the first time that at least I am

04:12:02.520 --> 04:12:04.980
able to showcase something. But you are a very good auditor

04:12:04.980 --> 04:12:07.120
in terms of your storytelling, right? You are good. You are

04:12:07.120 --> 04:12:09.840
basically like a mentor material. I mean, you can do it. I

04:12:09.840 --> 04:12:14.780
mean, you can do it part-time. Literally, I am giving you

04:12:14.780 --> 04:12:17.400
honest feedback. I think you have a capability. See, very

04:12:17.400 --> 04:12:19.900
few people have a capability to express the things and then

04:12:19.900 --> 04:12:22.340
storytelling. And that is what a mentor needs. That is the

04:12:22.340 --> 04:12:23.980
first quality. That is what a mentor needs. That is what a

04:12:23.980 --> 04:12:25.520
mentor needs. And if you don't know how to do it, then what

04:12:25.520 --> 04:12:29.200
kind of mentor will you become? Okay. So, if that quality...

04:12:29.200 --> 04:12:32.360
By default, I am in the profession that I have to tell the

04:12:32.360 --> 04:12:36.680
founders of the company. So, that is anyhow needed in my

04:12:36.680 --> 04:12:41.040
profession. Mentor is not a salesman, by the way. Okay. So,

04:12:41.180 --> 04:12:44.180
okay. After that, we will talk more about your mentorship

04:12:44.180 --> 04:12:48.500
career if you are interested. But I think you should try. At

04:12:48.500 --> 04:12:51.140
least like Ikaat Bash will launch with you. Only the NITN

04:12:51.140 --> 04:12:55.340
workflow. Okay. And okay. I hope all of you have enjoyed,

04:12:55.460 --> 04:12:57.140
guys. So, with that, thank you so much, everyone. All the

04:12:57.140 --> 04:13:00.940
collateral will be shared inside the dashboard. See you

04:13:00.940 --> 04:13:03.660
again next week. Thank you, Dhruv. Thanks. Thanks. I will do

04:13:03.660 --> 04:13:06.100
a post, a lot of posts. So, basically, like I will tag you.

04:13:07.300 --> 04:13:10.980
And everyone, guys, please do at least one post for Dhruv.

04:13:11.220 --> 04:13:14.100
Right. Dhruv deserves that post. He taught you like without

04:13:14.100 --> 04:13:17.380
like even charging you anything, this entire thing. Right. A

04:13:17.380 --> 04:13:20.160
lot of things. A lot of discussions we have done. So, I

04:13:20.160 --> 04:13:23.560
think as a thank you gesture, I think you should do some

04:13:23.560 --> 04:13:27.380
posts about like, Dhruv, so that he can get some fame and.

04:13:27.580 --> 04:13:31.640
Yeah. The really huge case is how you can ask, you know,

04:13:31.640 --> 04:13:37.460
kind of appraisal. That kind of thing that I have told. Yes.

04:13:37.580 --> 04:13:40.020
Yes. Yeah. So, thank you. Thank you so much, everyone. Thank

04:13:40.020 --> 04:13:42.080
you so much, Dhruv. Take care and see you again. Yeah. Take

04:13:42.080 --> 04:13:42.440
care, everyone.
