WEBVTT

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.810
Okay, so hello everyone. Good morning. I think I'm audible

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.830
and visible to all of you. So just wait for some time and

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.290
then we're going to start with the class. Yeah, so maybe in

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.750
like a next one, three, four minutes, we are going to start

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.650
with the class. Yeah.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.220
Okay, fine, everyone. So good morning and happy Raksha

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.000
Bandhan to all of you. So it's Raksha Bandhan in India

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.040
today. So yeah, most of us are from India and yeah, good

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.860
morning. So guys, as I have already announced inside the

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.960
group that today I'm going to talk about API basically and

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.760
not just in theory. So obviously, first of all, we'll try to

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.820
discuss an API, a concept of API in theoretical term. And

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.620
then we will try to do the exact same thing in terms of

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.880
practical. Plus, we'll try to even test an API. And the

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.880
reason is very simple. So whatever system you will be able

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.540
to see in this entire world, right? Even whatever app that

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.080
you are using in your mobile devices, whatever web portal

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.920
that you are using as of now. So everything works with API.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.800
So this is something that you will be able to understand

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.720
maybe after this class. Not now. That's completely fine. But

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.120
yeah, the entire world, whatever software, whatever

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.460
application that you are going to build. So without

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.980
understanding an API, you will not be able to build it. Yes,

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.520
there are a different kind of a framework, which is

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.400
available. In this entire world, by which you will be able

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.100
to create an API. This is there is not just one single

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.660
framework. But yes, without API, you will not be able to

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.700
build any real world application. Not today, not tomorrow,

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.280
maybe not in the future. So that's the reason API concept is

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.440
very much important. Plus, we are going to consume a lot of

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.120
APIs. So we are going to use a lot of model throughout our

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.880
life classes, because whenever we are going to build an

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.420
agent, whenever we are going to build RIG application,

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.360
whenever we are going to build anything. So obviously, we

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.340
are going to call a model and model. We will be able to

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.400
access just with the help of what? Just with the help of

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.920
API. And again, this is where API again comes into a

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.820
picture. So API should not look like a black box for all of

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.520
you. And that is the reason. So we will try to understand

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.540
this concept. So now I'm going to share my screen. And yeah,

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.860
so just let me know once you are able to see my screen, I

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.820
believe my screen is visible. Well, to all of you, I did you

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:48.640
want. Yeah. OK, now let's get started. Try to focus on

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.880
class. Do not chat much in a group because that is not going

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.800
to give you any kind of advantages. If you are going to, you

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.060
know, focus inside the class, that will give you a real

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:05.180
advantage. Yeah. And again, so we'll try to do a practical

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.600
plus at the end of the class. I'm going to give you even

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.520
assignments so that you all will be able to do assignments.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:16.500
Fine. So API now, if I'll talk about a full form of API, so

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.420
it's called as application application

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.780
programming

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:26.520
interface.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.710
This is just a full form. So again, we should not go after

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.070
the full form. That's completely fine. I'll try to explain

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.630
to the API with the help of one simple example. So, for

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.310
example, let's suppose I'm trying to use a GP. I believe we

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:45.270
all are using a GP. Right. So Google pay, by the way. So we

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:49.990
all are using a Google pay. And maybe we all are like using

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:53.010
some different application. Maybe we are using a Paytm.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:55.790
Maybe we are using a phone pay. Maybe we are using a Google

00:07:55.790 --> 00:08:00.590
pay. So, but we all are using some of the payment gateway.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.150
So it's not like without a payment gateway, any one of us

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.930
can survive in a today's world in a modern world. So we are

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:12.490
using a GP, let's suppose Google pay and even outside India.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.090
So yes, most of us are using a Google pay or maybe some

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:20.250
other payment gateway. That's completely fine. Now, so GP is

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.830
one of the application, like any other application which is

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:28.490
available inside your mobile devices. So whenever you would

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:33.170
like to make some sort of a payment, so obviously GP never

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:36.530
holds any kind of money. So unless and until you are not

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:39.430
going to keep it inside a wallet, so it is not going to hold

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:43.430
any kind of money. So basically, your money will be

00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:46.030
available. Your amount will be available or your money will

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:50.090
be available inside. Some of the bank, right, maybe some X,

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:55.230
Y, G bank, I see, I see, I may be, may be inside a HD FC, so

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:59.670
your money will be available inside HD FC. Now, whenever you

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:03.550
try to, you know, search some number or maybe whenever you

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:07.610
try to do some sort of a QR code scanning or whenever you

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:12.250
will try to go ahead with some sort of a UPI ID. So with the

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:15.930
help of your UPI ID, you will be able to do a transaction.

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:20.330
So let's suppose. I'm a person and my bank is basically

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:25.550
ICICI, yeah, my bank is, let's suppose ICICI, so obviously a

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:28.710
GP will try to make a transaction from ICICI and let's

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:31.910
suppose I'm trying to make a transaction in your account and

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:37.410
your account is available in HD FC, right? So you are going

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:41.450
to request basically to a GP, so I'm a person, I'm going to

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:46.370
request to a GP that, okay, on this number X, Y, G number.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:47.650
Yeah, so basically are you're a person or UPI ID or UPI ID,

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:51.130
try to make a transaction. So basically you are XYZ person

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:56.550
right. It will try to connect with your bank. I mean a bank

00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:00.510
in which you are having the amount now it will try to check

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:04.970
with the bank that okay, so whether we have money or not, it

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:08.370
will even tried to check that, okay, so this user is

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:12.710
authorized or not. It will even try to check that. Okay. So

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:17.950
basically. Okay. So basically. Okay. in India mostly like we

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:22.350
have a limit of 1 lakh max to max in 24 hour more than that

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.850
we will not be able to do a transaction so lot of check it

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:29.850
is going to perform and then once it is going to pass all of

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:34.790
this check it is going to transfer a money from ICICI to

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:39.470
HDFC so basically ICICI is my bank where I am keeping my

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:43.830
money and HDFC is basically your bank yeah HDFC is

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.810
technically your bank so where I am trying to transfer the

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:50.690
money and then eventually inside a GPay you will be able to

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.850
see a notification that money is transferred or this

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:58.910
transaction is technically done. So here again so we all go

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:02.270
through this kind of a cycle on a daily basis right we all

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.410
are trying to do some sort of a transaction on a daily basis

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.490
may be multiple time we do this kind of a transaction right

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:16.150
multiple times regularly daily. Now so here I am not

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:18.890
bothered about the transaction in between the bank or may be

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:22.250
a GPay so I am bothered about the mechanism that it is

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.510
trying to follow and with the help of that I am trying to

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:29.490
explain you that what technically the API is. So here let's

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.970
suppose I have written a program or someone has created an

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:37.230
app for a GPay right and may be that some person someone has

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:41.090
written a program for a GPay may be a back end program by

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:44.850
using a framework called as node js a javascript right

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:50.790
someone has written may be this ICICI bank program may be in

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:55.790
a java and someone has written may be this HDFC program or

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:58.650
this entire application which is going to handle the

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:04.110
transaction in may be a language dotnet let's suppose yeah

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:09.510
dotnet. Now here because see a GPay can't ask ICICI that

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:12.350
okay. So you should use this particular language or this

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:16.310
particular framework HDFC won't be able to ask ICICI or GPay

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:19.050
that you should use this framework or that framework to

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:23.510
write a program or to write a code. So technically GPay will

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:28.250
be using one of its own framework to create this entire

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:32.030
application may be a back end may be a front end ICICI will

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:35.650
be using its own framework its own language its own

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:40.030
programming its own database of its own choice. And HDFC

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:43.910
will be doing the exact same thing right because no one can

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:48.090
ask any one of this that okay so you are supposed to use

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:52.890
just a node js or just a java or may be just a dotnet to

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:55.890
create your back end or may be go ahead with the front end

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:59.170
no one can ask because no one is having authority over each

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:05.590
and every one right but still so when through a GPay I'm

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.990
trying to send a request. Right. Right. So this is a request

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:15.210
to ICICI that for XYG this one right try to make a

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:18.550
transaction. So XYG is may be a UPI ID or may be a phone

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:22.850
number or may be a QR code I'm trying to send. So whenever

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:26.330
I'm going to request so obviously it is going to request

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:31.150
this ICICI and what will happen inside ICICI in general. So

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:34.770
it is going to check your balance check underscore let's

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:38.730
suppose a balance yeah it is going to check your balance. So

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:42.810
it is going to check even a valid underscore user right may

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:46.770
be to validate a user this ICICI is going to ask HDFC that

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.810
okay fine this is your user. So is this user a valid or not

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:52.630
or may be a UPI server it is going to ask because we have a

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.450
centralized UPI server for that one but let's not bring this

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:58.370
UPI server in between let's not complicate this entire

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:00.910
things let's try to keep the things very very simple right

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:03.270
very very simple let's forget about the UPI server over

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:06.970
here. So it is going to validate a particular user. It is

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:13.050
going to even check a daily log in. So it

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:18.430
has indicated that somebody has

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:19.650
written that he is a valid user.

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:26.950
So you can write this data is a valid user. So it is

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:35.950
SayaAl鉄塔. This is a valid user. Someone has written a check

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:39.550
limit function. Yeah. At the end of the day, when I am

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:43.010
talking about this ICICI bank, when I am talking about the

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:46.250
HDFC bank, when I am talking about the GPAY, it is nothing

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:49.210
but it is a piece of program someone has written and when I

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:51.930
say a piece of program, it simply means that method,

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.710
function and classes at the end of the day, nothing more

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:59.190
than that. That is a whole reality of this entire system,

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:01.430
that is a whole reality of the entire system at the end of

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:05.010
the day. So someone has written a function called as check

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:08.310
balance in which language, may be in a Java language, right.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:12.670
So again, so once HDFC will be able to approve this entire

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:16.130
transaction, so it is going to maybe deduct a money, right,

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:20.350
deduct a money because in your account, so basically, okay,

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:23.310
so deduct, there will be a deduct function, there will be a

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:27.050
deposit function over here, so even over here, right, there

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:33.390
will be a deduct function, there will be a deposit function,

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:37.130
right. And it is going to even send a notification. So

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:39.710
again, in every banking system, there will be a notification

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:45.930
system or acknowledgement system you can say. So even inside

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:49.770
this HDFC bank, so we have a multiple function, even inside

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:53.550
this GPAY, so we have written a multiple function and even

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:57.890
inside this ICICI, we have written technically not just one,

00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:01.050
but maybe a many, many functions, maybe a hundreds, maybe

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:04.290
200, maybe a thousands of functions we have written. But

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:07.830
here, the amazing part is that. That with the help of, with

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:10.690
Node.js, so let us suppose I have written a function in Node

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:14.430
.js, right, in a JavaScript basically, but still I am able

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:18.510
to communicate with a function which is written in some

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:22.190
other language called as Java, right. So here we have

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.310
written all set of a function in Java, but still I am able

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:28.810
to communicate with other function called, which is written

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:32.190
basically in a .NET. So technically what I am trying to

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:35.950
showcase over here. that all of the system is a

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:38.830
heterogeneous system a complete heterogeneous system so

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:42.470
where this entire tech stack for an individual system is

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:46.110
different it's completely different but still right still we

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:50.950
are able to communicate in between a system and we are able

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:53.810
to execute so whenever someone is going to ask for the

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:56.550
transaction we are executing some functions technically

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:59.670
right technically we are executing some functions so it will

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:02.130
execute a check balance function then check balance function

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:05.890
will return true or false then we will try to check a valid

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:08.470
user function so valid user function will again return may

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:11.130
be true or false then we are going to check our basically

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:14.030
limit so limit will return some numbers that okay fine so

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:16.370
this is the number this is the limit for today's for this

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:19.190
particular user and then we are going to deduct the amount

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:22.450
from this particular bank and then we are going to deposit

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:24.970
the amount from this particular bank and then we are going

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:28.590
to send a notification right so eventually whenever I am

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:31.510
going to press a button so whenever I am going to call a any

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:35.390
kind of action in my mobile devices a lot of things happens

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:39.070
in a back-end and technically it is executing a function

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:43.010
nothing much right ideally speaking so it is executing some

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:45.010
sort of function just trying to call some classes it is

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:48.490
trying to execute some function but here so everything is

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:51.170
written in a complete different different different

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.170
different framework in a complete different different

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:57.150
languages but still I am able to establish a communication

00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:01.670
right still I am able to establish the communication how

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:05.650
right the question is how we are able to establish a

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:09.770
communication so how I am able to call a node.js code from a

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:12.870
java or maybe a dotnet code from a java or javascript

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:16.790
because the entire framework is different so this is where

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:21.830
the concept of API falls into a picture this is where API

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:25.690
concept comes into a picture so what is the API by the way

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:28.910
what is the meaning of application programming interface so

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:32.470
application programming interface is not a language right

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:35.830
it's not a language so basically application programming

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:39.590
interface is a set of protocol protocol means a rule a

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:46.330
simple rule right a set of protocol that okay and so let's

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:51.230
try to create a rule let's try to create a protocol so that

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:54.990
it will not or it should not depends upon any programming

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:56.930
languages. But every programming language should have a

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:58.430
protocol. Every programming language will be able to use it

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:02.730
every framework will be able to use it and by using that by

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:07.110
using that set of rule by using that protocol we will be

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:11.010
able to hit any function which is running in any system

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:13.650
because if I'm talking about this function so obviously this

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:17.010
function must be running in some of the system right even

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:20.370
though on a server on a cloud whatever we say but again so

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:23.110
it must be running on some system so maybe today I'm going

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:26.390
to show you everything in my local and if time allows I'm

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:28.430
going to even deploy it on a render and I'm going to show

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:31.470
you that okay now my function is technically a global

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:34.490
function so anyone will be able to hit it and anyone will be

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:37.510
able to get an answer so it doesn't matter right whether

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.550
it's available in my local whether it's available on some

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:43.210
server doesn't matter at all so I need a set of rules by

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:47.950
which I will be able to call any function at any places by

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:51.410
using any framework it should be it should not depends upon

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:53.950
any of the frameworks it should not depends upon any of the

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:57.670
programming languages and this is where. API application

00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:00.470
programming interface comes into a picture which behaves

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:04.310
like a bridge right which behaves like a bridge and which

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:08.850
will be independent right independent of any or any

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:11.470
programming languages or any framework which exists in this

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:15.470
entire world so hope theoretically you are able to get some

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:21.350
idea maybe one or two percent of idea right everyone yeah

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:24.110
I'm not expecting that you are you should you should be able

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:26.410
to understand like 100% of API. That's completely fine by

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:28.910
the end of this class you will be able to understand but

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:31.970
some idea right some some thoughts you must be able to get

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:35.010
as of now right so that whenever I'm going to show you this

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:38.050
practical explanation practical example you all will be able

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:42.370
to connect yeah you all will be able to connect so API is

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:46.350
nothing like so don't don't like generally when I talk about

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:49.290
an API when I ask people that do you know or do you

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:52.390
understand API so people get scared right people get scared

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:55.730
and they say that okay so I think it's a very heavy concept

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:59.170
but it's nothing believe me it's nothing right it is

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:03.450
something which we all are using on a daily basis right and

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:06.890
whatever just open up your mobile application says to open

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:11.570
up a Euron app so let's suppose I'm going to open up any app

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:15.750
including a Euron app in my system so let's suppose this is

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:20.490
a Euron app now so here whenever you are going to do any

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:24.790
kind of a click. It's not like. It will load. All the data.

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:26.890
It will load all the data or it will there is a static data

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:30.150
which you are able to see no so whenever you are going to

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:31.910
click let's suppose you are going to click on road ramp

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:33.770
let's suppose you are going to click on URI let's suppose

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:37.470
you are going to click on this one so whenever you are going

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:41.970
to click we are trying to fetch a data we are trying to

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:45.630
fetch a data now where is my data by the way my data is

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:49.550
available into a databases yeah so my data is technically

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:53.490
available into a databases it's so whatever data that you

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:57.490
are able to see. Most of the data I would say or 90% of the

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:00.250
data is technically a dynamic data. What is the meaning of

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:03.270
dynamic data? Dynamic data means so the data that you are

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:08.430
able to see is not a part of this like technically so unless

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:11.830
and until you are not going to click, it will not load. It's

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:15.970
available into our databases. It's not like you know, binded

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:19.350
with the entire web UI that you are able to see over here.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:22.630
So again, so if you go to a profile, if you go to any of

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:26.190
these courses, so we have something called as backend and

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:28.890
then something that you are able to see or this client that

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:30.850
you are able to see, it's called as technically front end. I

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:33.530
think we all understand that part, right? So front end. So

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:37.030
whenever you are going to click on any of these button, any

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:39.330
means literally any of this button, for example, I'm

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:42.630
talking, let's talk about a resume, right? So resume. So we

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:45.270
have written a function, right? We have written a function

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:49.310
that, okay, so click, upload your resume, right? And once

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:52.390
you will be able to upload your resume, so we are submitting

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:55.310
your resume to a function. We have written a function, some

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:58.490
sort of function. So we are going to submit your resume to a

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:01.110
function. Now what that function will do, it will try to

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:04.270
scrap all of your data from your resume. It will try to

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:07.810
understand all the keywords and your email ID and your phone

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:10.790
number and your experience and your date, everything, right?

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:14.270
So we have written a function, one function which will load

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:17.650
the, or which will try to take input as a resume. Then

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:20.110
second function. So second function will try to do basically

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:23.110
a scrapping of the entire data. Now the third function. So

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:25.890
it will try to identify all of these keywords. The fourth

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:28.970
function. So it will try to summarize your entire resume.

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:32.090
The fifth function. So it will try to basically create a

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:35.550
beautiful PDF or like a whatever template that you are going

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:38.350
to select out of this one. Yeah. So a lot of function

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:40.750
calling, right? A lot of function calling is happening. Now

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:43.630
everything happens in our backend. So whenever I'm going to

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:46.230
select and click something, right? So it will try to

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:52.630
basically fire up those chain of the function. How? With the

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:55.710
help of API. My front end is written in some different

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:59.030
technology. My backend is written in my, in some different,

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:02.110
backend means the actual worker. So the actual like a

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:04.890
program, so which is going to execute something and which is

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:07.830
going to eventually give me the output, right? So it is

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:09.950
going to execute it and it is going to give you the output.

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:12.750
So how I'm trying to connect my front end and backend, both

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:15.170
frameworks are different. Both programming language is

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:17.490
different, completely different, right? So how I'm able to

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:20.870
communicate in between with the help of what? A neutral

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:25.170
strategy or a rule, technically a API. So we have exposed

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:28.290
all of those function as an API. Okay, fine. Use it, right?

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:32.110
Okay, fine. Let's use it. I'll try to give you a simple

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:35.250
theoretical example and then I'll come to the next part. So

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:41.330
here, uh, let's suppose I'm going to come on this end

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:44.410
points, right? End points. Now we have given you this end

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:47.990
point. What is technically a meaning of this end point by

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:50.910
the way? So we have basically given you this end point. Now

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:54.850
what is a meaning of this end point? And by the end of this

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:57.550
class you will be able to understand practically, even

00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:59.090
practically. So as of now I'm trying to explain it

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:01.150
theoretically, but yeah, you will be able to understand even

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:03.530
in a practical manner. What is the meaning of this end

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:07.190
point? Meaning of this end point is very simple that I'm

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:10.550
hosting a model in some server, right? In some server.

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:13.850
Server means piece of computer, nothing much, right? This is

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:17.630
the meaning of the server, nothing fancy. So I'm trying to

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:21.110
host my model. Let's suppose I'm hosting a GPT model in some

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:24.850
of the server, fine. Now you have to reach out to that

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:27.310
server. So you have to reach out to this particular system.

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:31.890
Now we have given you this URL so that with the help of this

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:36.990
URL you will reach out to this particular server, right? Now

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:40.910
we have even applied a password that, okay, you will be able

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:45.150
to reach out to the server, but it's a protected one. So you

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:48.270
have to give a password. And this is where this API is. API

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:51.910
key comes into a picture, right? Without API key, you will

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:55.010
not be able to use any of the model that we have given to

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:57.450
you, right? So API key is what? It's nothing but

00:25:57.450 --> 00:26:00.650
authentication. Just the way you try to log in through a

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:03.490
Gmail. So obviously you are going to give your email ID, you

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:07.730
are going to give your password. So technically this is a

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:12.190
API end point. This is called as API. So at this location

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:17.770
and in again a layman way, technically it's a IP address.

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:20.430
Nothing fancy. Nothing much, right? It's IP address and the

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:24.430
port number. So we have just given a English name to it, or

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:27.550
you can say a domain name to it. And that's the reason. So

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:30.490
you are able to see in this way, but technically it's a IP

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:33.970
address, right? Technically it's a IP address and we are

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:36.670
just like a, so that it will be human readable. You will not

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:39.430
be able to maybe remember IP address frequently, but yeah,

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:43.210
so this looks like you will be able to remember simple. So

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:46.890
all of these end points is nothing, but it is helping you

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:51.210
out to reach out to some. Some of the system where we have

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.950
written a function. Now what that function is doing, for

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:57.330
example, this chat completion, right? So if you are going to

00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:01.290
click, let me erase everything. So let's suppose if I'm

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:06.070
going to click, right, I will be able to get a response. I

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:08.890
will be able to get a response. Let me, let me hit this one.

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:12.910
Yeah. So there is a call which is given to me. So if I have

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:17.950
to hit this call, maybe I can copy it and uh, don't worry.

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:22.270
Those who will not be able to understand. So uh, once we are

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:27.480
going to build the API, you will be able to understand. So

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:32.560
here call is given to me. So let me just copy this part now.

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:53.480
So I just have to replace with my API token. So here I'm

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.260
going to put my API token. So how I will be able to get my

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:59.820
API key. So click over here, create API key, give any kind

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:03.460
of a name and create. Now if I'm going to copy this API key

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:10.380
and uh. I just have to replace this one, this API token with

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:15.860
this one now. So if I'm going to curl it, if I'm going to

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:20.200
send this request over here, it will be able to give me some

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.200
sort of a output. So based on whatever, like a function

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.000
which has been designed. So it is going to give me

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.900
technically other output. What uh, friends call

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:10.270
is good API key in

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:33.180
just a minute guys. Let me. Check the curl part.

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:41.820
Yeah just hit the terminal. So think

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:56.150
because of this comma.

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:01.930
Yeah you can do it through postman as well. I'm going to

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:04.730
show you today that how we can do it even through a postman.

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:11.270
There is some unnecessary text.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.560
Let me load it.

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:31.510
Hmm. Now it will work. So see I have just like a basically

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:36.110
given a curl. And uh I'm able to get the response. See uh so

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:40.410
basically my uh content was I didn't get it a role user

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:45.090
right and the content message was what is AGI. So yes it is

00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:48.390
able to give me some sort of a outcome right. Some sort of

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:51.650
outcome I'm able to receive out of this one. So technically

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:55.950
I'm trying to hit this particular URL, the URL that you are

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:59.090
able to see a chat completion URL along with this. I'm

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:01.290
trying to send my authorization. Authorization means I'm

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:05.070
trying to send my password. You can say and then someone has

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:08.530
written a function right. Someone has written basically a

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:13.730
function and uh basically I'm trying to access that function

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:16.530
and what technically that function is trying to do. So that

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:19.470
function is trying to hit a model right. That function is

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:22.410
trying to hit the model and then it will be able to give me

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:27.250
some sort of a output at the end of the day. So I think this

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:33.830
is a new model which team has changed recently. Yeah. Uh it

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:40.170
should be let me change a model as well. This is a model

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:45.430
that team has changed I think just day before yesterday when

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:50.390
GPT-5 was launched. So open AI maybe I can go ahead with uh

00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:55.150
fine let's go ahead with GPT-4.1-nano, 4

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.680
.1-nano.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.960
Again let's try to hit and

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.980
I will be able to get it. Let's try to get the output here.

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:27.460
So now I'm able to see the output a complete output I'm able

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:30.280
to see as you can see in terms of a text. So what is AGI?

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.400
That was my question. This was the question which I have

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:35.940
sent and this is the answer which I'm able to get that what

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:38.660
is technically the AGI is. So AGI stands for artificial

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:41.560
general intelligence. It refers to the type of the

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.380
artificial intelligence that can understand, learn, apply

00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:47.800
knowledge across the wide range of the task at level of uh

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:51.060
completion. So yeah I'm able to get some sort of a output.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.800
So technically. What I'm trying to prove over here that this

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:58.440
is the URL right. This is the URL. Now with the help of this

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:03.060
URL you are reaching out to our system. Now in our system so

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:05.640
let's suppose I'm trying to influence this particular model

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:09.360
right this particular model. So technically someone has

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:12.180
written a function. My team has written maybe a function and

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:16.940
that function is trying to take a input input as this one

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:21.320
right input as this one and this one a message plus which

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:23.640
model you are. You are supposed to call what should be the

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:26.020
maximum number of token. What should be the temperature. So

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:29.600
all of this basically will go as a input into a function. So

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:33.360
with the help of and this function is available at this URL

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:36.120
right. This function is available at this URL and this is

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:38.300
the password to access that particular function. This is the

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:41.360
token to access that particular function. It is executing

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:44.360
that function and this is the output of the function I'm

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:49.900
able to see as simple as that right. So this is API. I'll

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:53.200
come to this point. Uh. I'll try to like a show you all of

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:58.700
these Euron API or URI API and again so curl is one of the

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:03.020
way by which you will be able to hit the API from your

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:07.580
command prompt. There are other ways as well. So I can try

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:10.840
to call it inside a python. I can try to call it inside a

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:14.560
java. I can try to call it inside a dotnet. I can try to

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.260
test it with the help of some other tools called as postman

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:21.400
something like that right. So this API. This URL is

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:25.400
independent. This is basically a HTTPS URL and it's

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:29.300
independent of any programming language and this is

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:33.060
technically called as API. Are you able to understand

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:39.150
something is like what is the API now? Yeah. Yes. Are we

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:42.790
able to understand that what is technically the API? So this

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:47.670
URL which I'm talking about, it's technically a API which is

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:50.530
independent of any programming languages. If someone is

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:53.990
going to give me this URL and if someone is going to give me

00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:57.090
this authorization and if someone is going to tell me that,

00:34:57.190 --> 00:35:00.650
okay, so your function is going to take this, this, this as

00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:04.570
an input. So that is the only thing which I need apart from

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:08.130
that nothing means literally nothing is required. That is

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:12.410
the exactly exact things which is required. That's it right.

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:16.350
Just this URL and authorization if someone is going to give

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:19.470
me a token and then I need like a input. I need the

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:22.330
information with respect to the function input that what

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:25.790
this function actually takes. So function takes a message,

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:29.090
function takes a model input, function takes a maximum

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:32.410
token, function takes a temperature. If someone is going to

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:36.470
give me only this much of input, I can write a Java code, I

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:39.710
can write a .NET code, I can write a Python code, I can

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:43.250
write a code in any languages which will be able to call

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:46.530
this API, right, which will be able to call this API. For

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:53.030
example, let's copy it. Let's copy it and then after copying

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:54.550
this, let's

00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:05.140
go to a URI, maybe 4.1 is better and I am going to ask that

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:09.260
convert this code or give me a code, whatever it is, convert

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:21.460
this code into Python, Java and .NET. Yeah, .NET. Now, the

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:23.040
only thing. Like I said. The only thing I said will be

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.700
required will be the API. So see it is now giving me a

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:28.300
Python code. Now what Python code is trying to do, again

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:32.640
same thing, hit the URL with this particular API and this is

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.880
the data. So basically it is trying to call request.post URL

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:40.160
header, header means your authorization basically and then

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:43.180
it is trying to give this input. So this is my Python code.

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:46.040
This is my Java code. Again, Java code will do the exact

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:48.600
same thing. It is going to take all of these inputs, it is

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.960
going to take the API endpoint which is the URL. The URL and

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:57.220
the authorization, again in .NET, same thing, right. So I

00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:00.280
just need only this much of information and if that

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.940
information is available with me, doesn't matter which

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:06.260
language I am going to use, I will be able to consume your

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:10.140
API. I will be able to access your system and this is how

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:14.900
all of you are able to access technically a Euron system and

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:17.340
again it is language independent, right. So maybe we have

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:20.520
given you a curl and we have given you a sample in a Python.

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:24.840
Again, we have given you a sample in a JS, a JavaScript, but

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:27.120
let's suppose if you are trying to use some other languages

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:30.020
of your own choice, that's completely fine. Go ahead, use

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:32.780
it, right. You don't have to hustle because you just need

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:36.260
what? You need a URL so that you will be able to reach out

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:39.620
to our system. You need an API token so that you will be

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:43.680
able to unlock our system and then inside our system, there

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.900
is a function that we have written which will give you an

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:46.820
access of like

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:54.520
models. That we are hosting and that needs some input, maybe

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:57.160
a message, maybe a model name because we have a multiple

00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:00.500
model. So you have to pass a model name over there, a

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:03.440
maximum number of token you have to pass and then you have

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.900
to technically give a temperature and then everything will

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:09.940
be done, right. And you don't have to worry about like in

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:12.720
which language I have written my function. It's completely

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:15.480
fine. It's up to you in which language you are calling. You

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:18.220
should not bother about like in which language we have

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:23.740
written. So this URL. Which is a HTTPS URL or HTTP, so what

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:27.620
is HTTPS, hypertext transfer protocol, right. And HTTPS is

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:30.540
nothing but hypertext transfer protocol secure. Now what is

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:35.680
this HTTP by the way, it's a rule, right. Since our

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:38.400
childhood, we keep on listening that this HTTP is what? A

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:43.860
protocol, a rule, right, a rule which is helping me out to

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.800
reach out to some system and this is how the entire internet

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:50.280
works. We try to type google.com. We try to type linkedin

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:53.980
.com. We try to type facebook.com, right. So someone is

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:57.820
hosting that Facebook application in some server and with

00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:01.400
the help of that URL and technically it's an IP address,

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:04.200
right, so whenever you are going to like from a command

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:07.020
prompt, you are going to do ping google.com. It will start

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:09.400
showing the IP address, right. It will start showing the IP

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:12.680
address. So someone is running that google program. Someone

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:15.240
is running that facebook.com. Someone is running that

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.620
linkedin.com. Someone is running basically this huron.one.

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:20.480
And with the help of that Facebook.com, right, they are

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:23.300
going to ping it. this HTTPS you are able to reach out to

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:26.380
that server where this is running. So we are running this

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:30.800
url01 at some server, with the help of this url you are able

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.880
to reach out to our server and in our server we have this

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.080
entire application. So you are able to access it. So

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:41.000
technically you are using this HTTPS protocol to access our

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.680
server. Similarly API, so you are trying to access some of

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.480
the function which we have written in our server. So we are

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:51.920
trying to expose it with the help of API and entire world.

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.620
So maybe you are trying to order something from a swiggy

00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:57.180
gemato, you are going to click, it is going to check from

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:59.580
the back end that okay fine, so this particular items are

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:02.540
available or not. You will try to add something to the cart

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:05.820
and then you will be able to place the order. Same goes with

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:08.240
a Netflix, same goes with the YouTube, same goes with the

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:12.100
entire world. Now just open up any application and click on

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:14.940
any application. Every time you are going to click, you are

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:20.320
hitting some APIs. And it is trying to bring the data, how?

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:25.060
After executing some of the function in a back end, yes.

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:30.680
So after executing some sort of a function in a back end,

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:36.980
fine. So HTTPS need SSL certificate, yeah that the reason so

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:39.120
it is called a secure, HTTPS means hypertext transfer

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:41.320
protocol secure. Once you are going to attach the

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:44.820
certificate, otherwise it will be HTTP, okay. So hope

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:48.800
theoretically this concept of API is clear, right. But it

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:52.560
will be more clear, so when we are going to write some API,

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:55.580
right, when we are going to write some API. Now if I will

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:59.200
talk about a Python, so Python is a programming language,

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:02.400
right. But inside a Python programming language, we have a

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:05.520
multiple frameworks, right. We have a multiple frameworks to

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:09.400
achieve a different task. For example, for performing maybe

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:13.080
operation with respect to a structured data, we have a

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:16.820
Pandas, right, to deal with maybe a numerical data arrays

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:20.400
and vector. We have NumPy, right, to deal with all those

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:24.100
scientific functions. We have a SciPy basically to plot a

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:27.160
graph. We have a Matplotlib, we have Seaborn, we have a

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.980
Pandas plot, we have a Plotly, we have a Cufflinks, right.

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:35.720
Now to create an API, to create an API. So which framework

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:40.840
do we have, yeah, which framework do we have in Python? So

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.580
we have a multiple framework, right, we have a multiple

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:46.740
libraries technically, yes. So now people are giving me an

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:49.400
answer. People are saying that we have a fast API, we have a

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:52.580
Flask, in a Django we can try to create it and technically

00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:57.180
all of you are correct, yes. So we have a framework, I can

00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:00.760
try to use any of this framework and I will be able to

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:03.620
create an API. It's just a matter of fact that every

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:06.920
framework try to follows its own functionalities and it is

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:09.360
having its own set of the rule because every framework has

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:12.820
been created by someone else, right. But eventually I will

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:15.960
be able to get an API which is going to be language

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:19.080
independent. And anyone and everyone will be able to call

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:22.560
it, anyone and everyone will be able to use it. So fine,

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:25.980
let's go ahead and let's try to create some of the APIs on

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:29.120
our own. Then only we will be able to understand this entire

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:34.920
things in a true manner. So closing everything, just try to

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:38.060
open up your VS code guys. I believe in my previous class we

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:41.640
have already done an installation of a VS code, right. So

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:44.460
just try to open up your VS code. Nothing much is required.

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:49.180
Click on file, create one folder. So let's suppose I am

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:55.240
going to create a folder called as API, API, API, EXAM, VLE,

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:59.880
API example. So just create one folder inside a VS code and

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:05.120
close everything. Just create one like a file, sorry, one

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.800
folder called as API example and then close everything.

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:11.070
Done, everyone.

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:16.440
Library basically. Framework means library.

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:22.520
In an interview. Someone asked fast API is not enough. You

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:25.920
should know Django. I mean like just go after the JD. If

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:28.220
someone has mentioned something inside the JD, then it's

00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:30.300
fine. Otherwise like there are hundreds of other framework

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:33.280
and someone will tell you that this is not enough. So what

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.640
you will do? You will go and learn. So technically like you

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:39.040
should know the core part that what is the API. Now if

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.160
someone is going to ask me that how to create an API in a

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:44.700
flask, I will be able to do it in two minutes. Django again

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:48.780
two minutes, right, fast API again two minutes because there

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:51.400
are like so many technology and so many things out there in

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:52.220
a market.

00:43:54.760 --> 00:44:00.120
So fine guys, just open up a VS code and let's try to build

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:02.720
a API. So I'll, I'll try to do one thing. So I'll try to

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:06.460
create one simple file over here. So test.py file. So this

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:08.940
is the python file I have created. Yeah, a very simple file

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:13.500
inside this one. .py file I have created not a .ipunv file

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:19.060
and here, so what I will do, so I'll try to basically like

00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:23.980
create a API. And then I'll try to even test a API again. So

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:26.000
when I'm going to create an API, there is something called

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.300
as get method. There is something called as post method.

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:30.640
There is something called as put method. There is something

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:34.040
called as delete method. So all of these methods will come

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:36.900
into a picture and one by one, I'll try to explain you that.

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.140
Okay. So what is the meaning of a get? What is the meaning

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:42.340
of a post? What is the difference between get and post? What

00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:46.220
is technically a delete? What is technically a put? All of

00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:48.820
these things will try to understand one by one, one by one.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.360
So far. So far, our objective was to understand a API

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:55.360
theoretically. I believe most of us are able to understand

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:58.140
it theoretically, only theoretically, right? Only in a

00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:01.040
theoretical way and by doing a practical. So we'll try to

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:05.800
see that whatever we have like a learnt during this theory

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:09.600
is correct or not, right? So we'll try to validate, we'll

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:14.520
try to verify that one. Okay, let's do it. So here to

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:19.160
execute this API or to create this API. So I'm going to use

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:20.500
a framework. I'm going to use a framework called as, or you

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:23.380
can say a library called as fast API library. You can use

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:25.520
flask. That's completely fine. Use Django. That's completely

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:30.560
fine. Right? So fast API. Now here, uh, first of all, you

00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:33.400
will have to install. So just open up your terminal. So to

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:36.300
open up your terminal, you can try to, you know, uh, like,

00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:39.840
uh, click on view and then you can click on terminal or the

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:44.200
shorthand is basically control tilt, right? Control tilt by

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.900
which you will be able to open up your terminal control

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:48.960
tilt. So that is a shorthand. So generally I use a

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:50.780
shorthand. But yeah, so if you're not able to remember

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:53.120
shorthand, then go to view and then go to a terminal. You

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:55.340
will be able to open up. And there are many, many other ways

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:57.880
as well. You can even go and search over here and then open

00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:01.180
up the terminal. So multiple ways now. So first of all, we

00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:05.320
have to install a framework. So Python core Python is

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:07.320
already installed. We have already done that in my previous

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:10.740
class and we have already done this like entire things. So

00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:15.400
here to install a fast API, so pip install pip install and

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:18.420
fast API. So this is something that you have to install. All

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:21.720
so that it will be available inside your system and you will

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:25.840
be able to do whatever you want. Yeah. So pip install fast

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:30.860
API, hit enter and uh, in no time it will be able to install

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:33.440
it in my system. It is telling me requirement all the

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:35.780
satisfied because in this environment it's already

00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:38.480
available. Yeah. Fast API is already available, but for you

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:41.840
it will not be, it may be not the same case. Yeah. It will

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:44.640
start downloading. It will start installing it. So done

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:50.020
guys. Just everyone pip install. So pip install pip install

00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:54.240
fast API. Simple. Everyone.

00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:01.850
Yeah. So pip install fast API. Now along with this pip

00:47:01.850 --> 00:47:05.590
install fast API. So you have to execute a fast API and it

00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:10.110
needs basically CLEAR clear. Yeah. So you have to install

00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:14.330
one more thing. So pip install UVCORN, E-N-I-N-S-T-A-L-L

00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:19.670
install UVCORN, UVCORN basically so that you will be able to

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:23.070
execute a fast API. So just do these things in my system.

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:25.230
It's already available. I have already pinged you inside

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:29.930
your chat box. Yeah. So pip install UVCORN guys and pip

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:32.250
install fast API. Done. Everyone.

00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:40.970
Yeah. Done. Yes. Okay. People are saying yes. Done. Fine.

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:45.610
Why is UVCORN? Because it needs a support of the UVCORN

00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:49.610
library to execute or make any API like available to the

00:47:49.610 --> 00:47:50.270
entire world.

00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:58.830
It's not UVI. I have already pinged you. Just look at it.

00:47:58.850 --> 00:48:03.990
Look into that. It's a UVI. UVCORN. Just see by spelling.

00:48:04.170 --> 00:48:05.230
You are doing a spelling mistake.

00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:14.170
Okay. Now people are asking what is fast API guys. Just a

00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:17.290
simple advice. Try to focus inside the class. You will be

00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:20.210
able to understand and if you are sleeping in between and if

00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:23.850
you are like, you know, uh, uh, like, uh, not sitting in

00:48:23.850 --> 00:48:25.770
front of your system, maybe if you're roaming here and

00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:28.490
there, and maybe if you are trying to do some of your, uh,

00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:33.270
work, I know it's a morning. You all are at home. But yeah,

00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:36.030
so when you are trying to learn, focus is the most important

00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:38.530
part. I believe this is something which I told you in my

00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:42.430
class number one, class number two, both. Otherwise no one

00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:44.210
will be able to teach you. Believe me, no one will be.

00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:47.890
Things are not difficult, but yeah, all, everything requires

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:52.490
attention. So stop roaming around and then sit in front of

00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:59.110
your like a system. Okay, good. Now we are able to do this

00:48:59.110 --> 00:49:01.350
installation. So this two installation was required going

00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:03.810
forward. I'm going to teach you that. How you will be able

00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:06.210
to create an environment, a different, different environment

00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:08.930
on a project basis and then how you will be able to keep

00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:11.790
your requirement or TXT. All these things will come into a

00:49:11.790 --> 00:49:14.230
picture. But as of now we are just like trying to start

00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:19.010
ahead with. So let's go in a basic mode now here. So what

00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:23.470
you have to do, so you have to, uh, import a fast API. So

00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:33.050
from, from fast API, just try to import fast API. So. So

00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:36.710
fast API capital. So just try to import this fast API. Just

00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:39.190
the first line. Second line is coming from the auto

00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:44.110
completion. So just import this one guys. So from fast API,

00:49:44.310 --> 00:49:48.050
import fast API. Now once you are able to import this one,

00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:52.830
then you have to create an object of fast API. Forget about

00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:55.930
it. We are not going to create as of now. Let's suppose I'm

00:49:55.930 --> 00:49:58.590
going to create a function yet. I'm going to create a

00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:01.550
function called as addition function. Now this addition

00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:03.610
function. This addition function is going to do what? So it

00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:06.550
is going to take two input, a comma B. I'm going to create a

00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:10.090
very simple function, add a function, right? And it is going

00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:14.410
to take two input technically. And these two input is A and

00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:17.430
B. It is going to take, and then it is going to return A

00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:21.070
plus B. Yes. So a very simple function, right? A very, very

00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:24.590
simple function. I believe we all will be able to understand

00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:27.310
this function. So this function is taking two input A and B,

00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:31.430
and it is going to give me A plus B as simple as that. Okay.

00:50:31.830 --> 00:50:34.990
That's well and good. Now, if I have to call this function

00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:39.570
in this program itself, so what I do, so I'm going to write

00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:44.070
add, and then I'm going to pass this value of A and B and

00:50:44.070 --> 00:50:48.490
then done, right? And then done. So maybe I can try to

00:50:48.490 --> 00:50:52.490
execute this entire thing. So here I can try to execute it

00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:57.150
and I will be able to maybe get the no module name fast FST

00:50:57.150 --> 00:51:01.310
API. Why no module name fast API? I have

00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:20.000
already done the installation. So maybe it is considering a

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.740
different environment. I'll check and I'll try to change it

00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:22.940
then.

00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:31.590
Okay. So that is taking a different environment. Let me

00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:33.550
execute in this way so that I can consider the same

00:51:33.550 --> 00:51:37.230
environment. So python test.py file. Now it will consider

00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:39.930
the same environment. So basically it is trying to execute

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:42.890
my function. And as we can see that there is no output

00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:45.210
because I have not written the print over here. So let's try

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:49.410
to write a print and then it will try to print whatever. I'm

00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:53.330
trying to execute. So here python test.py and three plus

00:51:53.330 --> 00:51:57.250
four is equal to seven simple function, right? A simple

00:51:57.250 --> 00:52:00.510
function. So this is the add function that we have written.

00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:04.090
And yes, I'm able to call this function in the same program.

00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:07.750
Yes, I'm able to call this function in the same program and

00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:10.830
I'm able to see the output. Now there is no issue with this.

00:52:11.810 --> 00:52:15.750
Now someone has asked me that expose this function, right?

00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:19.150
Expose this function to the outer world. So that not just

00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:21.610
from python, because we all know that, yes, this is the

00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:24.950
python program and from python program itself, I'm trying to

00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:27.830
access it and it's, it's working well, right? I'm able to

00:52:27.830 --> 00:52:31.390
access it. I'm able to execute it. Uh, that's cool. That's

00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:35.090
completely fine. But someone has asked me that no expose

00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:39.250
this function to the outer world so that anyone will be able

00:52:39.250 --> 00:52:42.870
to access this function. Anyone means literally anyone will

00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:46.270
be able to access this function from any framework or maybe

00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:51.030
from any program. Or maybe from a URL, right? Maybe from a

00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:56.150
URL, maybe from a Google, uh, like a Chrome, someone will be

00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:58.530
able to access it, right? And they should be able to get the

00:52:58.530 --> 00:53:02.550
output, how I will be able to do it. And this is where this

00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:04.770
API concept comes into a picture. And that was the whole

00:53:04.770 --> 00:53:07.250
idea. That was the whole discussion that we have been doing

00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:11.350
in theory, right? That we have one function just like a

00:53:11.350 --> 00:53:14.530
function will be available inside a bank for check balance,

00:53:14.610 --> 00:53:18.010
valid user, whatever it is. Right? So I'm going to request

00:53:18.010 --> 00:53:21.370
and it should be able to execute that function. So maybe I

00:53:21.370 --> 00:53:24.850
have to do that. I have to expose this function first of all

00:53:24.850 --> 00:53:29.550
to the outer world. How I will be able to expose. Yeah. How

00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:33.810
I will be basically able to expose this particular function.

00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:37.510
Let's try to understand and then you will end up creating

00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:41.190
your very first API and technically it's very easy. Believe

00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:45.770
me, it's very, very, very, very easy. How? Okay. So fast API

00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:48.950
is a framework. I'm going to use and let's suppose I'm going

00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:52.910
to create one object. Object means variable, right? Variable

00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:56.270
of what variable of fast API. So I'm just trying to call,

00:53:56.410 --> 00:53:59.590
right? I'm just trying to call this fast API and this is the

00:53:59.590 --> 00:54:02.890
variable so that I will be able to access this entire

00:54:02.890 --> 00:54:07.470
library. Yeah. So this is a variable I have created. Okay,

00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:10.830
fine. Now what I will do with this variable and how I'm

00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:13.490
going to expose this function to the outer world. It's very

00:54:13.490 --> 00:54:17.310
simple at the rate. So call the decorator. Decorator will

00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:20.530
try to give an access or decorator will try to give a power,

00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:25.770
additional power and then app dot get and then slash. So

00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:30.290
this is something that we have to write. So app dot get

00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:34.670
slash. Now only this much is required. Now what is our

00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:37.390
meaning of this? And now I'm saying I'm claiming basically,

00:54:37.570 --> 00:54:40.490
right? I'm trying to claim over here that now this function

00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:43.870
will be exposed. This function will be exposed to the entire

00:54:43.870 --> 00:54:46.530
world. Not entire world. world, at least it's running in my

00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:50.390
local as of now, right. I will show you how to how I will be

00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:53.110
able to make this function available to the entire world.

00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:56.690
I'll show you that as well right now. Right now itself, I'll

00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:58.730
try to show it to you. And there are multiple ways to do it.

00:54:58.970 --> 00:55:03.670
But here, technically, by writing this, just by writing this

00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:07.250
line number six that you are able to see over here. So I'm

00:55:07.250 --> 00:55:10.910
trying to claim that, OK, now this function is exposed and

00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:16.630
API has been created. Yes, API has been created. This is

00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:19.490
what I'm trying to claim. We'll see. So whether my claim is

00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:23.810
valid or it's invalid claim, we'll try to verify that part.

00:55:24.030 --> 00:55:27.010
But yeah, so as of now, that's a claim I'm trying to make.

00:55:27.330 --> 00:55:31.270
OK, so if that is a claim, then how I'm going to test it?

00:55:31.390 --> 00:55:36.030
Yes, how I'm going to basically test it. So yes, guys, every

00:55:36.030 --> 00:55:38.970
one of us are able to write it. Say yes or no in a chat.

00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:02.360
Yes. OK. Simple code. Right. And again, nothing fancy. I

00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:03.920
have written because at the end of the day, everything will

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:06.840
be just a function. Yes, everything will be just a function.

00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:12.860
OK, fine. So if I have to execute this fast API control is

00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:15.240
save it and then see

00:56:18.370 --> 00:56:22.130
a list. OK. And now if I have to execute this one, so you

00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:25.290
have to call what you we call you we call that you have

00:56:25.290 --> 00:56:28.550
installed. Right. So it is required for the execution. You

00:56:28.550 --> 00:56:33.250
call and then you have to basically write a file name. So

00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:36.510
what is my file name? By the way, it's a test. Right. So you

00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:40.490
we call and then file name is what test colon. You have to

00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:44.710
write app by default. Yes. So test app basically. And then

00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:47.690
you have to call hyphen hyphen reload so that it will be

00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:50.630
able to reload automatically whenever I'm going to make any

00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:52.950
kind of changes so that I don't have to come and execute

00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:55.470
this function or execute this file again and again and

00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:58.670
again. So you we call test and it's available in the

00:56:58.670 --> 00:57:00.970
directory. Same directory. If it is not available, then give

00:57:00.970 --> 00:57:05.270
up. So I'm

00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:09.590
trying to call you we call test test is what test is my file

00:57:09.590 --> 00:57:12.150
name. So whatever file name that you have given, maybe you

00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:14.850
have given some different file name. So give that file name.

00:57:15.050 --> 00:57:17.890
Otherwise it will not work. I have given, as you can see, a

00:57:17.890 --> 00:57:21.410
test file name. So I'm giving a test over here and then app

00:57:21.410 --> 00:57:25.050
reload as simple as that. Now, if I'm going to hit enter,

00:57:25.170 --> 00:57:30.250
right now, if I'm going to hit enter, so if all works well.

00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:33.970
Now it is telling me what you will watch a changes of this

00:57:33.970 --> 00:57:36.010
directory. So whatever changes which I'm going to do

00:57:36.010 --> 00:57:39.250
automatically will be loaded. UV corn running on this

00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:44.210
particular URL, right? This particular URL. So where we have

00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:48.590
an IP address and where we have a port number. Yeah. So what

00:57:48.590 --> 00:57:51.850
is this IP address by the way? So this IP address is

00:57:51.850 --> 00:57:56.630
technically an IP address of my local system. If I'm going

00:57:56.630 --> 00:58:00.430
to host it on some server, then there will be a public IP

00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:03.010
address of that server. So IP address is nothing but an

00:58:03.010 --> 00:58:05.510
address address for any system. This is what we understand,

00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:08.330
right? And port number is nothing but we are running one

00:58:08.330 --> 00:58:11.070
program, right? We are running, for example, this test.py

00:58:11.070 --> 00:58:15.930
file. So now in our system, so we have a series of the port,

00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:18.650
right? Port is starting from a zero, maybe till million. We

00:58:18.650 --> 00:58:22.290
have a port inside our system. So this program is basically

00:58:22.290 --> 00:58:25.870
exposed to that particular tunnel, that particular port. So

00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:30.490
here, with the help of this URL, let's suppose if I'm going

00:58:30.490 --> 00:58:33.970
to hit this URL, right? If I'm going to hit this URL and a

00:58:33.970 --> 00:58:37.170
port number, what will happen? And see it's running, right?

00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:39.670
It's running. It's not like it has given you the output and

00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:42.630
then it will be like gone. No, it will keep on running. If

00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:44.990
it is not running, then you will not be able to hit this URL

00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:47.930
as simple as that, right? So it should be keep on running.

00:58:48.030 --> 00:58:51.050
It should be up and running all the time. Now if I'm going

00:58:51.050 --> 00:58:55.390
to hit this URL, what is a meaning? A meaning is a code. A

00:58:55.390 --> 00:58:58.330
meaning is very simple. If I'm going to hit this URL with

00:58:58.330 --> 00:59:01.350
the help of this IP address, with the help of this IP

00:59:01.350 --> 00:59:06.790
address 127.0.0.1, right? I'm reaching out to my local

00:59:06.790 --> 00:59:09.370
system, this system, right? Where I have executed this

00:59:09.370 --> 00:59:13.850
program and inside the system at this port number, this

00:59:13.850 --> 00:59:16.990
program is up and running and this method, right? This

00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:20.630
method is actually live. This method is actually live. Now I

00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:25.790
have written app.git, yeah? I have written app.git. And then

00:59:25.790 --> 00:59:28.410
I have written basically slash. What is a meaning of the

00:59:28.410 --> 00:59:31.070
slash by the way? Yes, what is the meaning of the slash?

00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:33.470
I'll explain you. Don't worry. I'll even change the route

00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:35.770
and then what is the meaning of a route? I'll try to explain

00:59:35.770 --> 00:59:38.710
you step by step. Let's try to move a step by step so that

00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:42.270
every one of us will be able to understand technical meaning

00:59:42.270 --> 00:59:46.990
of API, yeah? So now my program is live. I'll copy this one.

00:59:47.130 --> 00:59:52.150
Yes, I'll copy this one and I'll go to a browser. I'll go to

00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:56.370
a browser. Simple, right? Hit enter. Hit enter. Are you able

00:59:56.370 --> 00:59:58.950
to see something? Let's go ahead with a pretty print, yeah?

00:59:59.070 --> 01:00:02.350
So are you able to see something? Maybe yes. We are able to

01:00:02.350 --> 01:00:05.650
see something over here, right? We are able to see something

01:00:05.650 --> 01:00:11.230
over here. Now just do one thing, slash, right? Slash and

01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:17.010
then call docs, basically. Slash what? Slash docs. D-O-C-S

01:00:17.010 --> 01:00:19.870
docs. I'll tell you what is the meaning of this one, yeah?

01:00:20.170 --> 01:00:23.730
Now you will be able to see a beautiful UI. This UI is

01:00:23.730 --> 01:00:27.410
called as Swagger. Swagger UI. S-W-A-G-G-E-R. Swagger UI,

01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:32.930
basically. So fast API provides you UI as well, right? Fast

01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:36.110
API provides you UI as well. Now once you will come to this,

01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:38.790
so basically this UI will help you out in terms of doing a

01:00:38.790 --> 01:00:41.310
testing. I'll show you a multiple way of doing a testing,

01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:45.010
don't worry. So if you will click on this UI, are you able

01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:48.170
to see a get over here and are you able to see your own

01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:50.210
function name? This is the function which I have written,

01:00:50.310 --> 01:00:52.970
right? This is technically a function which I have written,

01:00:53.090 --> 01:00:57.250
right? This is the function. And at this root, this function

01:00:57.250 --> 01:01:02.110
is available where it is taking two input, A and B, right?

01:01:02.130 --> 01:01:05.770
It is taking two input, A and B. And if I'm going to click

01:01:05.770 --> 01:01:10.090
on try this out, if I'm going to click on this try this out,

01:01:10.290 --> 01:01:14.530
right? So here I'm going to give a value of A, 4, value of B

01:01:14.530 --> 01:01:19.010
is equal to 5, execute. Now once I'm going to click on this

01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:22.270
execute, execute, execute, execute, maybe multiple times,

01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:25.770
maybe one time. That's completely fine. So once I'm going to

01:01:25.770 --> 01:01:29.970
click on this execute, execute, execute over here. So you

01:01:29.970 --> 01:01:36.190
will be able to see what? You will be able to see some sort

01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:39.670
of a output. You will be able to see some sort of a output

01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:42.470
over here, right? You will be able to see some sort of

01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:45.790
output. So it is giving me 45 by the way, why? What is the

01:01:45.790 --> 01:01:48.730
reason? It is giving me output as a 45 because if I'm trying

01:01:48.730 --> 01:01:52.310
to enter something over here, it is trying to consider it as

01:01:52.310 --> 01:01:55.790
a store. I have used string, I have used plus. So it is

01:01:55.790 --> 01:01:58.350
trying to perform concatenation operation. That's again the

01:01:58.350 --> 01:02:01.110
problem. Yes. So it is trying to perform the append

01:02:01.110 --> 01:02:05.050
operation by the way. Yes, it is trying to. So how I'm going

01:02:05.050 --> 01:02:09.890
to mitigate this kind of a situation? See so when I have

01:02:09.890 --> 01:02:13.970
executed my method in the console, it was giving me a 3 plus

01:02:13.970 --> 01:02:16.310
5 or whatever I have written. So it was trying to do an

01:02:16.310 --> 01:02:20.230
addition operation. But when I'm trying to send a data right

01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:22.910
through this URL, through this URL, when I'm trying to send

01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:26.570
this data, so now it is trying to consider because here any,

01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:29.890
right? So it is trying to understand type of A and B is

01:02:29.890 --> 01:02:32.930
equal to any and by default it is going to consider that as

01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:36.190
a string. So I'm able to get 45 as an output. I'm getting an

01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:38.450
output, right? It's not like I'm not getting output. I'm

01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:43.790
able to get the output. But how I'm going to make sure that

01:02:43.790 --> 01:02:47.850
it should consider integer. It should not consider, right?

01:02:47.890 --> 01:02:53.670
It should not consider basically this A and B. It should not

01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:56.870
consider A and B as any.

01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:04.300
So simple. I can try to write colon int, right? Colon int so

01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:07.300
that it will be able to understand that, okay, fine. Even

01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:11.600
from outside if I'm going to call. So colon int, control S,

01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:15.200
right? Control S and this is the meaning of, so when I have

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:17.920
written reload, so this is the meaning of it. So you don't

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:19.980
have to re-execute it. It will be able to refresh

01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:22.340
automatically, right? This is the meaning of hyphen hyphen

01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:25.840
reload, which we have written. Now let's go over here once

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:29.320
again, right? So here it is trying to understand that, okay,

01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:32.180
so any is not required. It's an integer. So if I'm going to

01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:36.140
pass four, if I'm going to pass, try this out, right? If I'm

01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:38.360
going to pass four, if I'm going to pass six over here, if

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:41.740
I'm going to call execute, now six plus four is equals to

01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:46.320
10. Are we able to get the answer? Same? Yeah. Are we able

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:50.180
to get the answer? So here with the help of this UI, what is

01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:53.000
technically happening? Let's try to understand that part. So

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.120
see. We, our program, our function is live at this

01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:00.180
particular location, right? This particular location. And we

01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:03.740
have written, technically we have written what? So we have

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:06.480
written, okay, fine. So this function will be available at

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:10.260
slash. This is the route that we are trying to give. Let's

01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:12.840
suppose if I'm trying to say that, okay, this function will

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:16.300
be available at route Sudhanshu. This function will be

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:19.400
available where? At route Sudhanshu. I have given just any

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:23.040
name, my own name I have given. Now control S, save it.

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:28.960
Yeah. Save it. Fine. Now again, go back again, go back and

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:31.860
then try to hit enter. It will not, it will say that I'm not

01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:37.160
able to find anything now slash Sudhanshu. Now it is able to

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:40.580
get something. Now if I'm going to do slash DOCS, so it will

01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:45.040
be able to reach out. Yeah. It will be, or maybe like, uh,

01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:50.100
what has happened? Yeah. Message required. This, this, this.

01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:56.900
Okay. Fine. Now, so it is showing me route is equal to what

01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:59.780
it is showing me route is equal to slash Sudhanshu. Fine.

01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:05.220
Now I'm going to write even a slash, uh, maybe K U M A R

01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:11.700
slash Sudhanshu slash Kumar slash X Y G and control S. So

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:15.060
again it will re execute itself, right? Uh, so this is

01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:18.020
basically a route. Now what is technically a meaning of this

01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:21.280
one? Let me execute. So now here a meaning of this one is

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:25.040
very simple. This add a function is available. This add a

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:28.460
function is available where this add a function is available

01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:33.240
at which location. So this add a function is available at

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:37.560
this URL. This is the IP address which will be able to

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:39.640
reach, which will help me out to reach out to the system,

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:46.040
right? Then inside that at this port now inside of that at

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:49.640
this route, right at this location. So means directory

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:51.760
inside, directory inside directory. Consider in that way,

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:55.940
right? So at this route, so this is technically called as a

01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:59.480
route. Yes, this is technically called as basically a route

01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:02.220
that, okay, so what is the total route? What is the whole

01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:05.500
route? The whole route to hit this function, this add

01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:13.480
function is technically 127.0.0.1, colon 8000 slash

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:15.340
Sudhanshu

01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:23.600
slash Kumar slash X Y G. This is technically a route. This

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:27.100
is technically a API. This is a API, right? This is

01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:30.940
technically a API by which you are reaching out to this

01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:34.020
function called as add. You will be able to access this

01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:39.460
function called as add. Yes. So why docs? So basically a

01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:43.140
fast API provides you a UI so that you will be able to test

01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:46.780
it with the help of UI itself. That's a leverage you will be

01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:50.360
able to get with respect to the fast API. Simple. Just for

01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:52.640
the testing purpose, it is giving you the UI so that, you

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:55.120
know, you will be able to see like what is the input, what

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:57.880
is the output and you will be able to basically test it. As

01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:00.440
simple as that. That is something that you will be able to

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:04.320
access it at docs. So wherever your API is running, just do

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:07.800
slash docs and you will be able to access the entire UI and

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:10.700
through a UI itself, you will be able to do a testing. But

01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:14.020
again, let's suppose I don't have this UI, possible, right?

01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:17.140
I don't have this UI. My function is running at which

01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:20.420
location? So slash Sudhanshu slash Kumar slash X Y G. So

01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:23.880
this is the location where my function is running. Okay.

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:27.520
That's cool. So this is the location where my function is

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:33.500
running. Okay. Fine. So I'll not use a docs. I'll try to use

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:36.380
the answers. So this, because this is the total route,

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:38.900
right? This is the total route. The highlighted one is a

01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:42.380
total route. Now if I'm going to hit enter, yes, it is like

01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:44.940
a giving me some sort of a details, right? It is giving me

01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:47.480
some sort of a details and it is telling me that you have to

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:51.100
pass a value of a. Okay. It is basically a value of B

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:54.980
because that is something that you will pass. Then only I

01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:57.620
will be able to execute. So now if I'm going to hit again,

01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:02.780
if you will come over here, so it will give you this 422

01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:08.180
unprocessable entity means I am trying to hit this URL. So

01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:11.460
whenever I see, so whenever I'm trying to hit, as you can

01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:14.580
see the URL, right? This path. So whenever I'm trying to hit

01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:18.620
this path, it is trying to execute this function. Simple.

01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:21.420
Whenever I'm going to hit this path, it is trying to execute

01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:25.140
this add function as simple as that. It is trying to execute

01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:28.240
this add function. But to execute this add function, I need

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:32.300
the input A and B, which I have not passed, right?

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:37.000
Technically I, I am trying to hit this one. So hit this one,

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:40.020
execute this one. It simply means that, that I'm trying to

01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:42.900
execute this function because this route has been binded by

01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:44.660
this, but this function has been binded by this particular

01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:48.060
route, right? But this, to execute this function, I need to

01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:50.640
pass a value. I need to pass a value of A and B. So how I

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:55.060
will be able to pass a value of A and B so that I can try to

01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:59.020
execute it. Yeah. So that I will be able to execute it. So

01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:02.060
we have seen that with the help of Swagger UI, right?

01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:04.980
Swagger UI. So which I was able to access with the help of

01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:08.340
slash docs. So Swagger UI UI interface where I can test my

01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:11.880
APIs. Now if I have to execute it through the URL itself,

01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:16.060
how I will be able to execute it. Let's try to understand.

01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:20.200
So here at this path. My function is available. I know that

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:24.420
someone has told me maybe, right? So I will try to do what?

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:28.480
So I will try to write maybe a question. So if I have to

01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:32.720
pass a data through a URL, I'll, I'll talk about that. A is

01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:38.460
equal to four, right? A is equal to four and B is equals to

01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:42.960
five. Hit enter. Are we able to get the output? I have given

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:47.520
A is equal to four and B is equal to five. I'm pinging you

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:50.320
this. Yeah. So just change your route if your route is not

01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:54.080
same. So I'm trying to pass A is equal to four and B is

01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:57.080
equal to five. Are we able to hit our function? Can I say

01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:59.640
that, that this is the browser, right? This is the Google

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:02.140
browser. This is the Google Chrome I'm using. Just use any

01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:05.300
browser. I don't care. Right. Just go and use any browser.

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:08.080
Can I say that through a browser, right, through a browser,

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:12.680
I'm able to execute a Python code. 200 status is okay. That

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:16.300
200 means a good status. I'm able to execute it. So can I

01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:18.500
say that? Through a browser? Through a browser, I'm able to

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:22.240
even execute a Python code and I believe this is what we

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:24.360
were trying to understand, right? From a very first minute

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:28.960
of this class, yes, from the very first minute of this

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:30.760
class, this is something that we were trying to understand,

01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:34.060
right? That it should be framework independent, it should be

01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:38.640
language independent. And yes, we are able to use a browser.

01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:41.920
First of all, we have used a Swagger UI. We are able to hit,

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:44.980
we were able to hit that, right? Then I have, I'm trying to

01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:47.400
show you with respect to our browser. I'm able to hit again.

01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:53.500
Yes, I'm able to hit again and it's a good status. And when

01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:56.000
I say that I'm able to hit, I believe we all are able to

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.780
understand. So guys, just tell me one thing. Are we able to

01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:02.760
understand that how we are able to reach out to this

01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:08.120
function? Are we able to understand that how we are able to

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:11.800
reach out to this function, right? And what is a meaning of

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:16.240
this route or the whole URL? One person is saying like a no.

01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:22.140
Two person no. So what is, what is your question then? If

01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:24.100
you are saying no, then what is your question? What is your

01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:28.620
doubt? Yeah. Yeah. Some of you will face an error. Maybe

01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:31.100
like we'll try to solve it, but it should not give you that.

01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:32.920
It's a very simple function. Basic function. I have written

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:38.520
like nothing, nothing fancy over here. Right? Yeah. So here

01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:41.900
with the help of this, I'm able to, so I'm able to reach out

01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:44.080
to this function. I'm able to execute this function. So

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:49.080
technically, technically this is my API only till this point

01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:53.040
and I'm trying to pass the data. Right? So this is my API

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:58.360
and if I'm going to expose this API now to the entire world,

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:01.680
so I do it guys, so I expose this to entire world so that

01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:07.020
even you will be able to access my API. So I do it now that

01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:11.460
like you will be able to access my ad function. Yeah. You

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:15.220
will be able to access my ad function now itself. Okay. Let

01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:19.260
me do it that. So basically see this is running in my local

01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:21.320
system, right? In my local system. In my local system

01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:25.160
basically. So there is of like a, there is basically a

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:29.020
software, a small tool called as ng rock. Right? There is a

01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:32.020
tool called as ng rock, ng

01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:40.380
rock, right? So ng rock and with the help of ng rock, I will

01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:44.120
be able to do that. Yeah. I will be able to basically do

01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:47.460
that to do that. So just go to Google and first of all you

01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:49.580
have to download so you can click on download. It doesn't

01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:51.540
matter which system you are using. It's completely fine. It

01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:54.840
works for Windows, Mac and like a Linux, all of these. So

01:12:54.840 --> 01:13:00.440
privacy policy, okay, fine except all save choices. Okay. So

01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:02.600
here you can come and then you can try to download for

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:05.760
Windows. We have for Linux, we have for Mac as well. So it's

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:08.980
just a simple plain file. So download it a very small file.

01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:13.360
So like a nine MB of file and with the help of this you will

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:16.560
be able to expose it to the ng rock. So this URL that you

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:19.060
are able to see, right, you will be able to expose it with

01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:21.800
the help of ng rock. I'll show it to you. Now you will be

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:22.740
able to hit my function.

01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:47.560
Yeah. So ng rock download is done. Now once you are able to

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:52.380
download it, right click and then extract it basically after

01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:55.540
downloading just like any other software. And where is my

01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:59.040
extraction where I

01:14:01.730 --> 01:14:05.490
have extracted, it's not showing me here. Okay. Here. Okay.

01:14:05.570 --> 01:14:10.550
Sorry. My bad. So here is a small file. It's one small file.

01:14:10.630 --> 01:14:14.710
So basically I can try to open up like a CMD. This location

01:14:14.710 --> 01:14:18.330
I can try to open up into a CMD. So here if I'm going to do

01:14:18.330 --> 01:14:21.670
DIR. So this file is available ng rock.exe is available over

01:14:21.670 --> 01:14:28.690
here. Now I should do what? So basically my entire things is

01:14:28.690 --> 01:14:33.150
running at port number 8,000 and I have to make this port

01:14:33.150 --> 01:14:38.390
and my system exposed towards a outer world. Outer world

01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:41.550
means over the internet so that you will be able to test it

01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:45.010
right now. Right? You all will be able to test it now itself

01:14:45.010 --> 01:14:48.750
while program is running in my system. So I have to make my

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:53.150
local machine global, right? I have to make my local machine

01:14:53.150 --> 01:14:56.930
global. So here you should expose this particular port

01:14:56.930 --> 01:15:00.110
number and this is where ng rock comes into picture. So

01:15:00.110 --> 01:15:02.890
whatever is running at this port number, you all will be

01:15:02.890 --> 01:15:07.010
able to access it by a URL given by ng rock. So just try to

01:15:07.010 --> 01:15:09.810
like open up your ng rock wherever you have a ng rock. Now

01:15:09.810 --> 01:15:16.630
just type ng, ng rock and then HTTP. So because it's running

01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:21.470
on HTTP, not on S, HTTP and then it's running on port number

01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:24.930
8,000. Right? Port number 8,000. So by doing this, I'm

01:15:24.930 --> 01:15:27.870
trying to say that, okay, fine. So let's try to make it

01:15:27.870 --> 01:15:31.650
global. That whatever is running on my 8,000 port. So ng

01:15:31.650 --> 01:15:34.670
rock will try to expose it over the internet. So now hit

01:15:34.670 --> 01:15:37.930
enter and once you are going to hit enter, this is your

01:15:37.930 --> 01:15:42.470
local host. Right? dot 0, dot 0, dot 1. And this is the,

01:15:42.510 --> 01:15:46.730
HTTPs as you can see it's S right? Yes. So whatever is

01:15:46.730 --> 01:15:50.410
running on like a HTTPs S you will be able to access. Now

01:15:50.410 --> 01:15:54.030
this is a global URL guys, if I'm going to give it to you.

01:15:54.230 --> 01:15:58.070
Right, you all will be able to access it. You have to give a

01:15:58.070 --> 01:16:01.290
proper route. Meaning is what? So you have to give a proper

01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:04.770
route means only till this point, this URL is going to work

01:16:04.770 --> 01:16:07.290
after that to access my function. Sudhanshu, slash Kumar

01:16:07.290 --> 01:16:12.850
XYZ.. so this is the total with input this is the route and

01:16:12.850 --> 01:16:15.930
if you are going to hit it you will end up hitting my system

01:16:15.930 --> 01:16:19.350
so click on visit site first for the first time and then you

01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:22.330
can keep on hitting my system and you will be able to get it

01:16:22.330 --> 01:16:25.750
get the final result and i'll show you live see people are

01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:28.370
hitting my system i'm not doing anything see i'm not writing

01:16:28.370 --> 01:16:31.090
anything i'm not doing anything right people are hitting my

01:16:31.090 --> 01:16:34.250
system some people are saying it's 404 so after slash you

01:16:34.250 --> 01:16:38.090
have to give a route right to the enchu slash so to reach

01:16:38.090 --> 01:16:41.630
out because that url is only till port number i have exposed

01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:46.320
it till port number so basically i'm doing a port forwarding

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:51.060
yes got it see many people are trying to hit my system you

01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:55.520
can see it live yeah so technically i have written a python

01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:59.000
function and i have exposed this python function now any one

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.180
of you will be able to access it across the globe right

01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:05.820
across the globe and you will be able to execute a python

01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:07.840
Python function and the fun part is you don't have to write

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:11.280
a code in Python. Maybe if you have to like consume it

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:14.980
through a Java, do it. You have the URL, right, you have the

01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:17.100
URL. If someone would like to access my function maybe

01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:20.080
through C++ or maybe some other programming languages, you

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:23.200
will be able to do it. Now the URL which I have given to you

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:26.780
till route, till xyg, right, because after that it is an

01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:32.040
input. That is API. 404, someone is trying to hit the system

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:35.040
without giving a proper input. Give a proper input, you will

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:37.820
be able to see 200, otherwise no.

01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:48.190
Give me ng log command. So it is nothing, ng logs space HTTP

01:17:48.190 --> 01:17:51.830
space port number. So on whatever port you are running like

01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:59.160
a program, fine. So are we able to relate now the theory and

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:01.540
a practical, are we able to relate now?

01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:09.190
What is port forwarding? So basically I have exposed my 8000

01:18:09.190 --> 01:18:12.990
port to the entire world. That is a port forwarding. So

01:18:12.990 --> 01:18:16.570
technically this one is called port forwarding. See. So

01:18:16.570 --> 01:18:20.590
basically if anyone is going to hit this URL, so when you

01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:23.450
are hitting this URL, right, so you are reaching out to this

01:18:23.450 --> 01:18:25.930
location. So it is called as forwarding.

01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:41.560
Virus detected while downloading ng log. I do not know.

01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:43.540
Maybe you should like look into your system setting.

01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:51.780
Please share the expose command. I think I have already

01:18:51.780 --> 01:18:57.280
shared. So this one, it is not a command, it is just a URL,

01:18:57.420 --> 01:19:00.400
right. There is no command. Okay, expose command you are

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:03.720
saying ng log HTTP and then like a port number 8000.

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:10.840
Thoda yeh bataayi ng log config at authentication token. We

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:12.920
will talk about it in the future. As of now without even

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:14.840
authentication token, you will be able to push it.

01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:17.320
Authentication token will be required. So when you are

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:20.180
hosting something on a like a cloud, so when you are trying

01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:23.280
to expose something from a cloud server, for local

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:24.320
authentication is not required.

01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:33.500
Fine guys, yes, yeah,

01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:43.600
make sure you are downloading from the official website.

01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:46.440
Exactly. ng log has given you official website. So just go

01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:49.160
over there, download it. And if it is giving you some option

01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:52.140
like a virus or something, so switch it off your system.

01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:53.600
Right. So fine.

01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:05.960
Everyone. So most of you I can see like you are able to do

01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:09.440
it. Some of you are stuck. Maybe you got deviated here and

01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:17.120
there because of that, that may be the reason. Yeah. So here

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:20.940
I'm able to like see a lot, a lot of like a good hit. I'm

01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:24.580
able to get like 200, 200. I'm able to see which is great.

01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:30.740
Fine. 200, 200, 200. So many people are able to hit my

01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:37.940
server. Now let me off it. So control Z and now you will not

01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:42.960
be able to access it. Yeah. So now everything is gone. Now

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:47.180
you will not be able to hit my server. So technically

01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:52.120
speaking, we are able to create our very first API. Yeah. We

01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:55.920
are able to create our very first API. Now again, inside

01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:58.440
this one while creating an API, there are multiple concept

01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:02.740
which exist. Now let's talk about that. So here we have

01:21:02.740 --> 01:21:06.280
written app dot get, yeah, we have written basically app dot

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:10.480
get. Now there is something called as post. There is

01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:13.900
something called as like a get and there is something called

01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:17.260
as post. Now what is the difference between get and post? I

01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:20.220
want more thing, right? One more thing. So we are able to

01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:23.140
test it with the help of this. This URL, we are able to test

01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:26.040
it with the help of docs or maybe redocs. There is another

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:31.220
testing tool, right, which is called as postman. So you

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:34.220
should download generally, ideally I suggest people to

01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:37.360
download this postman. Even if postman is not available,

01:21:37.580 --> 01:21:39.980
that's completely fine. I have a multiple ways of doing a

01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:43.820
testing, but yeah, postman is one of the standard tool that

01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:47.680
all the developer generally uses for API testing because

01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:50.180
developer create a thousands of APIs. They have to maintain

01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:53.360
those logs and API. So postman is basically a tool which

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:56.200
will keep everything in one place. I'm not saying that

01:21:56.200 --> 01:22:01.120
postman is the must tool. No, not at all. Like I said, so I

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:03.720
have a multiple ways of doing that testing or hitting my

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:06.840
APIs. But yeah, postman is one of the beautiful tool that

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:08.940
people have created. So maybe you should go ahead and you

01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:12.180
should download it. It's very easy. It's available for all

01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:14.140
the system. It's available for Mac machine. It's available

01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:19.180
for Linux. It's available for Windows, right? So just go

01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:21.700
there. Go there and download a postman search for the

01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:24.660
postman. It's a popular, very, very popular one and those

01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:27.280
who do a development, so they must be aware about it. This

01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:31.200
is what I'm assuming, right? It will just keep your things

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:34.140
in one places. It gives you like a multiple functionalities

01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:38.500
of doing a testing. So download a postman. I believe in my

01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:42.460
system, postman is already available. I think so. Yeah. So

01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:46.360
postman is already available. So what postman does? So okay,

01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:52.370
I have already like done a lot of API testing. Okay. So what

01:22:52.370 --> 01:22:55.350
postman does by the way, so let's suppose I'm on a home

01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:58.710
screen, right? So with the help of this postman, you will be

01:22:58.710 --> 01:23:03.970
able to do a API testing, right? Do a API testing. So how?

01:23:04.130 --> 01:23:06.590
Let me show it to you that part as well. So let's suppose

01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:09.930
I'm going into any of my workspace and then here there is a

01:23:09.930 --> 01:23:14.170
plus symbol, right? There is a plus symbol. Now here you

01:23:14.170 --> 01:23:19.050
will be able to get post, put, patch, delete, head, all of

01:23:19.050 --> 01:23:22.310
these options. So as of now the API which I have created, so

01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:25.870
basically it's a get API, right? It's technically a get API.

01:23:26.190 --> 01:23:30.990
So get API I have created. Now what is the meaning of get?

01:23:31.050 --> 01:23:35.070
I'll tell you, right? Now here, so I can try to like do the

01:23:35.070 --> 01:23:38.430
same. Maybe I can try to remove A and B from here. I can try

01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:41.190
to give a key value pair as an input. So let's suppose if

01:23:41.190 --> 01:23:43.830
I'm, otherwise it is all already able to detect it, right?

01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:47.290
So maybe I can try to remove it from here and key wise A is

01:23:47.290 --> 01:23:51.370
equal to. Okay. So in both the way it's completely fine. B

01:23:51.370 --> 01:23:54.510
is a key and what is the value I have to pass? Value I have

01:23:54.510 --> 01:23:57.790
to pass, it is equal to seven and then I can try to click on

01:23:57.790 --> 01:24:02.950
a send, but I have to change this URL, right? It's a ng-roc

01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:05.010
URL. I have switched off my URL.

01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:15.250
So http://localhost, local host, local host, colon, 8000

01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:20.210
port number. Yeah. Slash slash. So technically it's running

01:24:20.210 --> 01:24:22.770
in my local host. I have switched off my ng-roc. So now it's

01:24:22.770 --> 01:24:26.490
not global. Now it's not live. And then I can try to pass

01:24:26.490 --> 01:24:30.110
these values. So slanchu slash kumar slash this one. And

01:24:30.110 --> 01:24:34.030
okay. So A is equal to, let's suppose seven I'm giving and B

01:24:34.030 --> 01:24:37.630
is equals to, uh, like a nine I'm trying to give. So

01:24:37.630 --> 01:24:39.710
automatically, as you can see, it is trying to append inside

01:24:39.710 --> 01:24:43.470
the URL, right? Automatically it is trying to append inside

01:24:43.470 --> 01:24:47.430
the URL send. So if all works well, you will be able to get

01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:49.370
the output. So nine plus seven is equal to what nine plus

01:24:49.370 --> 01:24:52.670
seven is equal to 16. So even with the help of postman, I'm

01:24:52.670 --> 01:24:56.830
able to test it, right? My get request. So this is called as

01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:59.630
like, I'm sending a request and this is something called as

01:24:59.630 --> 01:25:02.050
a response. Request means I'm sending something and then

01:25:02.050 --> 01:25:05.050
like response means I'm able to get some response. So even

01:25:05.050 --> 01:25:08.390
with the help of this, uh, uh, postman, which is technically

01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:12.770
a tool, right? I'm able to access my Python function,

01:25:12.850 --> 01:25:15.770
Pythonic function, and I'm able to execute it. So this is

01:25:15.770 --> 01:25:20.050
another way of doing a testing. Developers generally use it,

01:25:20.130 --> 01:25:23.190
use this particular postman one. It helps you out in terms

01:25:23.190 --> 01:25:26.050
of managing a multiple environments and then like a multiple

01:25:26.050 --> 01:25:29.850
flows and then teams. So it's basically make your life easy

01:25:29.850 --> 01:25:32.910
because when it comes to a creation and creating an API,

01:25:33.050 --> 01:25:35.370
right? We actually create a thousand of API, not just one,

01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:37.490
there'll be thousands of functions, thousands of different,

01:25:37.530 --> 01:25:40.030
different requirements, right? And we have to expose each

01:25:40.030 --> 01:25:43.010
and everything. So we end up creating a thousand and when

01:25:43.010 --> 01:25:45.430
your number of API will keep on increasing. So it's very

01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:48.170
difficult to manage. Now, let's see. Now you will be having

01:25:48.170 --> 01:25:52.270
a tool postman, which is ideally free if you are not going

01:25:52.270 --> 01:25:56.730
with a team plan, right? So you will be able to use a

01:25:56.730 --> 01:26:01.520
postman. Is it necessary to pass the same key? Obviously,

01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:04.500
because how it will be able to understand that what is the

01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:08.300
value of A and B and what is basically A. So you have to do

01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:11.800
a mapping A and B. Then only it will be able to understand

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:16.160
ng-roc URL is not working in postman. It works everywhere.

01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:20.760
But I have deactivated. I have activated my ng-roc, right?

01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:25.740
So it will not work actually. If you have your own ng-roc

01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:27.400
URL, obviously it is going to work.

01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:33.290
So this is Anshu slash Kumar slash XYG. So yes, this

01:26:33.290 --> 01:26:36.350
technically this entire URL, the highlighted part, right?

01:26:36.410 --> 01:26:40.750
This entire URL, which I'm talking about, let me open up

01:26:40.750 --> 01:26:46.510
here. So this entire URL, right? This entire URL is an API.

01:26:46.770 --> 01:26:50.670
Now at this URL, at this API, right? My function is this. My

01:26:50.670 --> 01:26:53.270
function is available. As you can see here, right? Just see

01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:58.350
the URI API. So it is available where? At our website, HTTP,

01:26:58.490 --> 01:27:02.490
this one, API slash V1 slash URI slash chat slash

01:27:02.490 --> 01:27:06.610
completion. Why we have given this much of route? Because we

01:27:06.610 --> 01:27:10.490
are not just having only one, right? We have multiple. So we

01:27:10.490 --> 01:27:13.610
keep on giving a route so that, you know, anyone will be

01:27:13.610 --> 01:27:16.190
able to understand it that, okay, fine. So at this location.

01:27:16.370 --> 01:27:20.150
So this is technically the whole route. This is technically

01:27:20.150 --> 01:27:23.730
the whole route, right? So it's running on this system. So

01:27:23.730 --> 01:27:26.250
this is basically the highlighted one is a system. And then

01:27:26.250 --> 01:27:30.470
this one is technically a route. Inside that system at this

01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:33.850
route, at this location, means at this folder location, it

01:27:33.850 --> 01:27:37.490
is running. Similarly, this is basically a system, right? It

01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:39.670
will help you out to reach out to the system. And then

01:27:39.670 --> 01:27:43.110
inside a system at this location, at this route, it is

01:27:43.110 --> 01:27:45.150
running. That is, this is what it means.

01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:55.720
Can this API access through a curl? You can access it

01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:58.880
through anything. Even through a curl, you all will be able

01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:04.680
to access the same like API. So it doesn't matter whether

01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:07.620
you are hitting it through a curl or maybe you are trying to

01:28:07.620 --> 01:28:11.560
hit it through anything else, for example. So postman,

01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:17.120
right? So let's copy this one. Now open up a CMD and do curl

01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:19.600
over here. So CURL curl.

01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:23.920
Curl this one.

01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:32.700
What is the issue? Detail type missing. Message failed.

01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:39.700
Input null. B is operable. A is equal to 7. B is equal to

01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:43.660
this. Yeah, this is a good hit. It seems. My API is running,

01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:50.520
right? Unprocessed entity. So local LOCALHOST colon 8000

01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:55.160
slash nanshu slash kumar slash xyg question mark a is equal

01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:58.760
to 7. Yeah, it was working well in a postman. So this is the

01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:05.190
API. Oh, sorry. So my bad. So I should keep it inside the

01:29:05.190 --> 01:29:06.230
string.

01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:15.040
This is how curl works. Now see 16. Yeah. So even with the

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:18.700
help of curl. Right. I have given curl and then I have given

01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:24.310
same thing and I'm able to access it. So it doesn't matter

01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:26.590
like how you are going to hit it. You will be able to hit

01:29:26.590 --> 01:29:31.350
it. Right. So because it's an API and it simply means I will

01:29:31.350 --> 01:29:34.550
be able to access from everywhere. Right. From any program.

01:29:34.610 --> 01:29:37.210
From anywhere. From any interfaces without any kind of a

01:29:37.210 --> 01:29:40.290
restriction. So whether it's a curl, whether it's a postman,

01:29:40.390 --> 01:29:43.250
whether it's a doc, whether it's a URL everywhere.

01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:51.010
Okay. Now so moving ahead here.

01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:56.840
So we have a method called as get. Now let's try to

01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:59.480
understand what is the meaning of a get. So generally the

01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:03.860
common sense that we used to like receive from this word

01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:06.740
keyword called as get is something we are trying to get.

01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:09.440
Right. Something we are trying to get. But there is a

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:13.280
technical meaning to it. So get simply means that in other

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:16.860
ways. So get simply means that that we are trying to send a

01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:21.120
data. Right. Which will be exposed, which will be

01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:24.600
technically exposed to the world. So what the world will be

01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:28.320
able to see your data. This is the another meaning of a get.

01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:31.500
How and what I'm trying to say. Let me prove it. Right. Let

01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:35.060
me prove it. So here let's suppose there is a Google. Right.

01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:37.860
There is a Google. And if I'm trying to search over here.

01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:43.140
Maybe a data science. Yeah. I'm going to search. So I went

01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:46.180
to Google and then I'm trying to search data science. Now

01:30:46.180 --> 01:30:51.640
you just observe this URL. So here query is equal to data

01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:56.440
plus science. So are you like can I can I say over here that

01:30:56.440 --> 01:31:00.280
whatever data which I'm trying to send. Right. It's visible

01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:03.480
to the entire world. Whatever data which I'm trying to send.

01:31:03.660 --> 01:31:08.080
Technically it's visible to the entire world. Yes. Everyone

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:13.880
technically it's visible to the entire world. Yep. Okay. Now

01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:19.820
at the same point of time, let's go and do a Gmail gmail.com

01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:24.540
gmail.com now even over here. So while signing up. So you

01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:27.500
try to pass your data. Right. You try to pass your email ID.

01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:31.240
You try to pass your password. Will you be able to see that

01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:36.500
here inside this URL? No. Never. Right. So you are sending a

01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:40.360
data basically even in case of doing a sign up when you're

01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:42.340
trying to do a sign up. So you are sending your data.

01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:45.160
Sending your data means you are sending your like a email ID

01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:47.600
and you're sending your password. All of these things. Even

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:50.760
while you log in into a you're on, you send a data, maybe

01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:54.140
your phone number, then you receive a OTP or maybe you're

01:31:54.140 --> 01:31:56.680
like a Google login. Right. So that with the help of Google,

01:31:56.740 --> 01:32:00.500
we will be able to authorize you. So you are sending a data

01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:04.580
in both the cases. But in one of the case. In one of the

01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:07.720
case, your data is visible, right? In one of the case, your

01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:11.140
data set is visible and in other case, data is not visible.

01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:15.160
So I can say it's a secured one, right? It's a secured one.

01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:20.480
So here, wherever my data set is visible, it's called as get

01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:24.700
request. We are sending. It's not secure. Anyone can see it.

01:32:24.780 --> 01:32:28.060
And here. So we are also sending a data. It's called as

01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:33.860
post. Means we are attaching our data as a body. In a body,

01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:36.240
we are trying to attach a data and then we are sending a

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:39.080
data. So it will not be visible to the outer world, to any

01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:42.700
any user that what we are sending like email, ID and

01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:45.600
password, because this is a secure data. So there is a two

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.760
differences you will be able to find out. One is a get one

01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:51.140
is a post. Get is a non secure post is basically sending a

01:32:51.140 --> 01:32:54.500
data via body, which is technically a secure one. Now, how I

01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:57.940
will be able to create a post API. Let me show you that part

01:32:57.940 --> 01:33:00.660
as well. Are you able to understand the layman difference

01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:03.100
guys? Just a layman difference. Yeah.

01:33:10.140 --> 01:33:11.560
Yep. Everyone.

01:33:17.820 --> 01:33:20.920
50 percent. That's okay. So even 5 percent will be like a

01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:23.440
fine because now you will be able to understand 100 percent.

01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:24.480
Yeah.

01:33:41.810 --> 01:33:45.990
Okay. So let's let's try to like understand that how I will

01:33:45.990 --> 01:33:51.030
be able to, you know, basically send a post and how that is

01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:54.170
going to be secure. And then eventually we'll try to

01:33:54.170 --> 01:33:58.110
understand that how we are going to even test those part via

01:33:58.110 --> 01:34:03.250
curl, maybe via postman. And maybe like via X, Y, G things.

01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:07.530
Right. How I will be able to like do it. Let's let's try to

01:34:07.530 --> 01:34:10.510
understand that particular part. So get is nothing but get

01:34:10.510 --> 01:34:13.470
is a unsecured way of sending a data as we can see. So

01:34:13.470 --> 01:34:16.010
basically when you do a Google search, it's actually a get

01:34:16.010 --> 01:34:19.190
you are sending a data. You are hitting a Google server and

01:34:19.190 --> 01:34:21.650
then Google. So basically that is a request and then in a

01:34:21.650 --> 01:34:24.310
response it will give you the list of the pages. Simple.

01:34:24.450 --> 01:34:27.690
Right. So it is executing some function. It is trying to do

01:34:27.690 --> 01:34:30.150
some sort of a search function. Right. That search function

01:34:30.150 --> 01:34:33.210
is trying to search all those pages, the relevant pages

01:34:33.210 --> 01:34:35.570
based on your query and then you will be able to get that

01:34:35.570 --> 01:34:38.830
data. This is what happens even in terms of a Google, even

01:34:38.830 --> 01:34:43.070
in terms of any kind of a things now. So this is get. I'll

01:34:43.070 --> 01:34:46.710
leave it as it is. I'll try to create another function. So

01:34:46.710 --> 01:34:50.270
def let's suppose a subtract function I'm going to create.

01:34:50.410 --> 01:34:53.450
Yeah. Subtract function I'm going to create and then here.

01:34:53.770 --> 01:34:57.330
So function is very simple. Subtract is going to take again

01:34:57.330 --> 01:35:00.970
two data. A and B and it is going to return a minus B as

01:35:00.970 --> 01:35:03.230
simple as that. Yeah. So this is a very simple plane

01:35:03.230 --> 01:35:07.110
function. I have created a very small one. Now I have to

01:35:07.110 --> 01:35:12.090
convert this function right as a API. I have to convert this

01:35:12.090 --> 01:35:15.250
function as an API so that you know it will be able to like

01:35:15.250 --> 01:35:16.590
do something.

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:22.200
Masking user a miss. Okay.

01:35:30.370 --> 01:35:36.860
Fine guys. Everyone. Yeah. So just do it with me. Okay. So

01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:39.340
here. So here we have written a very simple function

01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:42.180
subtract. Right. We have written a very simple function

01:35:42.180 --> 01:35:44.560
called a subtract and then it is going to do nothing. Take

01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:47.540
two inputs and then subtracted given the output as simple as

01:35:47.540 --> 01:35:51.060
that. Give me that return. Now I have to convert that as a

01:35:51.060 --> 01:35:54.100
API. So I know this particular manner, right? I know this

01:35:54.100 --> 01:35:56.300
particular way that, okay, fine. So I can convert that as a

01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:59.740
API in this manner. But yeah, this is a get get means. So

01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:02.640
whenever I'm sending a data, it will be exposed and we are

01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:05.320
able to see it. We are attaching our data in a URL itself.

01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:08.260
Right. So everywhere we are trying to attach our data into a

01:36:08.260 --> 01:36:13.280
URL and then we are like trying to do this a request, right?

01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:15.900
Then we are trying to do this kind of a request. Otherwise

01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:20.040
we are not able to do the request. So the secure way will be

01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:23.880
post. So I have to convert this entire things as a post. So

01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:30.420
maybe I can call app dot post, right post. And then I can

01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:32.960
give my path, whatever path I want. So maybe I'm giving

01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:37.960
slash S U B T R S C T subtract. Okay. Fine. Cool. So I have

01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:42.300
given this path called a subtract and uh, now I'm assuming

01:36:42.300 --> 01:36:45.420
that, that it will be exposed. Let's go and let's try to

01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:48.240
check. So I have just saved it and it will start

01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:51.480
automatically. Otherwise I have to write like a UV corn

01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:55.220
test, call an app and then reload. But yeah, so it is, it

01:36:55.220 --> 01:36:57.240
has a reloaded automatically. So this is the function which

01:36:57.240 --> 01:37:00.600
I have created guys, a very, very simple function, right? A

01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:03.060
subtract. And the only changes which I have done over here

01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:07.440
is that app dot post. Last time. It was good. Now let's go

01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:13.020
to the URL, right? Let's go to the URL, local host 8,000 or

01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:20.140
maybe one 27.1 27.0.0.1. So 8,000 and let's try to access

01:37:20.140 --> 01:37:27.600
swagger UI. So DOCS docs. Let's try to access docs. So I

01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:29.940
have created two functions, right? So one function is hosted

01:37:29.940 --> 01:37:33.540
at this URL as Kumar slash X, Y, Z. That was a gate get one.

01:37:33.540 --> 01:37:36.840
And then I have a second function called as post. I can

01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:41.120
click over here. I can try to expand it now. So this

01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:45.380
subtract function is available at slash subtract because

01:37:45.380 --> 01:37:47.720
this is what I have written at this route. This is

01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:53.380
available. Same as before now here. So here I can click on,

01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:56.820
try this out and maybe I can try to pass a value of a is

01:37:56.820 --> 01:38:00.100
equals to five value of B is equals to two. And then if I'm

01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:03.560
going to click execute now, this is that. This is the curl

01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:06.820
it is trying to do. This is the curl it is trying to do. And

01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:11.440
eventually I'm able to get this particular output. Yeah.

01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:16.360
Eventually I'm able to get this particular output. Now last

01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:19.040
time, let's suppose this is the get function. And if I'm

01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:21.620
going to click on, try this out, if I'm going to pass some

01:38:21.620 --> 01:38:25.240
sort of a data and call execute, the only difference was

01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:28.140
this get, it was calling get last time, right? It was

01:38:28.140 --> 01:38:31.960
calling it. I was able to get the response over here. And

01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:35.660
uh, even. So when I'm trying to pass the data, so the only

01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:38.540
difference I'm able to see, or I'm able to observe over here

01:38:38.540 --> 01:38:45.020
that it's a calling post, right? In both the cases I am able

01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:48.500
to get the data, right? In both the cases I'm able to get

01:38:48.500 --> 01:38:54.280
the data. Now how these two things are different. So

01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:59.000
obviously one is get one is post. Now let's do one thing. So

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:02.480
I'll copy the same URL, right? I'll copy the same URL. And

01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:06.860
I'll try to hit it here. Simple, right? Call subtract and

01:39:06.860 --> 01:39:10.280
hit it here. Now when you are trying to hit it through this

01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:17.880
URL, it is giving you what method not allowed. This is the

01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:20.840
difference. This is the difference between get and post. So

01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:24.960
here I'm trying to expose my data because I have to send the

01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:28.000
data, right? So to execute this function, if I'm not sending

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.120
a data function will not be executed. That's a problem,

01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:35.000
right? Now when I'm sending a data. It is telling me that

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.880
no, it's not allowed. So you are not supposed to expose your

01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:43.460
data into a URL. This is what it is trying to say because

01:39:43.460 --> 01:39:47.680
you have created the subtract function and you have exposed

01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:51.040
it via what post, not via get. That's the difference between

01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:54.080
get and post. Are you able to get it guys? A difference

01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:56.880
between get and post. So see in both the way I'm trying to

01:39:56.880 --> 01:40:00.520
expose my function. Simple, right? The only difference is

01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:04.740
that, that one is allowed in a URL. Another one is not

01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:07.180
allowed. Yes, I will be able to test it in a postman. I will

01:40:07.180 --> 01:40:11.000
be able to test it into a curl. I will be able to call it

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:14.860
through maybe like a, any, any like a programming language.

01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:17.280
That's completely fine in a URL. It will not be allowed.

01:40:18.380 --> 01:40:22.580
Yes. In a URL because I have created this function which is

01:40:22.580 --> 01:40:25.360
hosted as a sub, which is hosted at this particular URL

01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:28.880
slash subtract URL, but it nature, it is basically a post

01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:33.040
that's in nature. Technically. Technically it's a post which

01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:36.380
I have created. So post means you should not pass any data

01:40:36.380 --> 01:40:39.320
as exposed one. You should pass a data in a, as a body,

01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:43.080
basically as a body. So how I will be able to test it,

01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:48.400
right? How I will be able to test it through a postman.

01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:50.760
Let's try to understand. So first of all, if you'll come to

01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:54.180
postman, you can't do get, you should select first of all

01:40:54.180 --> 01:40:57.380
post. Fine. You should select what you should select first

01:40:57.380 --> 01:40:59.880
of all post, are you able to get it guys? What would I'm

01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:03.260
trying to explain it to you? Yeah. So you should select

01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:07.060
first of all post and then here the URL. So URL till what?

01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:09.620
URL till subtract so that you will be able to reach out to

01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:14.940
the system, right? System and then a function, simple

01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:18.920
localhost 8000 means system and then function. And then what

01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:22.960
you have to do, so as it's a post one, as it's a post one,

01:41:23.060 --> 01:41:25.940
so you should not pass a parameter. It is not going to work

01:41:25.940 --> 01:41:29.120
because this parameter is basically for a get method. You

01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:33.040
should click on body, right? You should. You should click on

01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:38.000
raw. So body raw, and then you can try to pass as a JSON

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:41.620
means key value pair. So how? So maybe this is how you can

01:41:41.620 --> 01:41:47.280
try to write. So a, right? So a is equal to maybe six. This

01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:50.220
is called as body, right? This is called as body by the way.

01:41:50.340 --> 01:41:55.640
And B is equals to what? Maybe B is equals to two, right? So

01:41:55.640 --> 01:42:01.660
this is called as body. So body raw JSON, right? JSON. So in

01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:04.640
this one format, you should pass this data as of now, let me

01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:08.460
ping you this, uh, like data pass. Yeah. So this is the data

01:42:08.460 --> 01:42:12.000
that you will pass. Now, if you are going to send, what

01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:27.170
is missing six and two, I'm able to pass. So why it is

01:42:27.170 --> 01:42:31.730
telling me that it's missing unprocessed entity. I missed

01:42:31.730 --> 01:42:37.330
something HTTP localhost 8,000 slash subtract. Yeah. It

01:42:37.330 --> 01:42:42.230
looks good. Why does give me four to two like this? Okay.

01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:52.920
25, 10. Hmm.

01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:21.680
It is not able to understand why data

01:43:25.580 --> 01:43:31.420
type. Yeah. So query a field, this one, it's

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.240
a good pass. It seems body

01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:48.480
raw JSON is correct.

01:43:56.140 --> 01:44:02.310
Value of a value of B. Yeah. Everything seems to be right. I

01:44:02.310 --> 01:44:06.790
don't know why it is giving me an error. So post is fine.

01:44:06.930 --> 01:44:13.870
This is fine. Like it's a good hit. Raw JSON. Fine. Why

01:44:21.580 --> 01:44:23.240
it is giving me this response.

01:45:03.010 --> 01:45:07.630
Let me pass a is equals to B.

01:45:08.850 --> 01:45:13.650
It should work. It should not give me this issue by the way.

01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:26.150
Location query B is missing. No, it's not missing. And,

01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:41.780
uh, get was okay.

01:45:56.020 --> 01:46:00.440
So I have a fix for this one. And I think I can, I can try

01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:03.900
to fix it. So it is not able to understand this data. Let me

01:46:03.900 --> 01:46:06.180
show you the curl part and then I'll try to fix this

01:46:06.180 --> 01:46:09.200
problem. Let me fix it with respect to this one. So all

01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:12.020
these things are, uh, hits are good. Uh, there is no changes

01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:16.220
because, uh, this is cool. And like, this is good. Uh, even

01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:18.420
I'm trying to do a post method that everything is okay.

01:46:18.940 --> 01:46:21.480
I'll, I'll tell you why it is not working. So there is

01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:23.400
something called as pidentic issue because of that. It is

01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:26.460
not working. Uh, so I'll, I'll come to that point. But yeah.

01:46:26.780 --> 01:46:27.160
So with the help of this swagger UI, I'm able to access it.

01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:30.420
So, uh, with the help of this swagger UI, I'm able to access

01:46:30.420 --> 01:46:34.060
it. I'm able to hit it. So that is good. Now let's try to do

01:46:34.060 --> 01:46:36.800
a curl and let's see that whether with the help of curl, I

01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:40.080
will be able to hit it or not. So just try to open up a CMD

01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:44.820
and then just try to do a cancel and a curl.

01:46:48.030 --> 01:46:50.730
So maybe I have to curl

01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:56.440
this only

01:47:00.340 --> 01:47:08.070
till this point we can, all of this are anyhow not required.

01:47:09.470 --> 01:47:09.870
Yeah.

01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:17.380
So we are basically trying to do this. Do a curl over here

01:47:17.380 --> 01:47:20.480
and in the old fashion, right in the old fashion, so curl X

01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:25.400
post. And as you can see, like, uh, it is not working. So

01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:28.740
even in case of a curl, in case of a get, everything was

01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:31.460
working, but yeah. So when I have started doing something

01:47:31.460 --> 01:47:35.260
called as a post, so it has started giving me a problem

01:47:35.260 --> 01:47:38.700
technically. Right. So it is, it has started giving me the

01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:44.960
problem. So here, how I will be able to fix it, right. How I

01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:47.300
will be able to fix this particular problem. Because I have

01:47:47.300 --> 01:47:50.040
seen that, that in a postman, it is not working even when

01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:55.260
I'm trying to do a curl. So it is not working, right. It is

01:47:55.260 --> 01:48:00.840
not working. So to make it up and running and to make it

01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:05.380
work, there is something called as pidentic so that I have

01:48:05.380 --> 01:48:08.480
to handle. And with the help of that, I can make it working.

01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:11.640
So what is the meaning of pidentic by the way? So pidentic

01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:15.780
is again, a set of the rule, a library, which try to like,

01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:19.620
uh, you know, give you a set of the rule by which you will

01:48:19.620 --> 01:48:24.460
be able to set a data type, right? You will be able to set a

01:48:24.460 --> 01:48:27.600
data type in a pidentic way. How we can do an implementation

01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:32.280
to do a implementation. So you have to like a call from

01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:38.640
pidentic P Y D N T I C pidentic. And then you have to import

01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:43.000
a base class and uh, how I will be able to use this

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:46.220
pidentic. So just try to create your own class. So let's

01:48:46.220 --> 01:48:50.980
suppose I'm creating class like, uh, subtract, uh, subtract,

01:48:50.980 --> 01:48:55.220
uh, model, let's suppose. Yeah. So subtract model, I'm

01:48:55.220 --> 01:48:58.440
trying to, uh, create, and I'm trying to inherit basically

01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:02.000
this base model so that this class, the, my own custom class

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.460
will be having a idea about this, uh, entire rule rules and

01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:10.080
regulations. And here, as I know that I'm going to pass

01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:14.520
basically A and B and A as an integer, I'm going to pass.

01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:19.040
And B as an integer, I'm going to pass. So what I have done,

01:49:19.100 --> 01:49:21.940
so I have just defined A is equals to integer and B is equal

01:49:21.940 --> 01:49:27.040
to integer. And whenever you are going to send a data, it

01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:30.040
will be looking for a validation that, okay, A should always

01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:32.460
be integer and B should always be integer. So basically this

01:49:32.460 --> 01:49:35.540
pidentic class, which I'm trying to create, and I'm trying

01:49:35.540 --> 01:49:38.860
to align with the pidentic rule, it is just going to help me

01:49:38.860 --> 01:49:41.920
out in terms of validation. Nothing else, right? Nothing

01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:44.040
else. And which is required for the post. For get, it's, it

01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:47.160
was not required, right? Get is not required, but as post is

01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:50.680
a most secure one. So you have to attach basically a

01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:54.000
pidentic over here. And with the help of this pidentic,

01:49:54.020 --> 01:49:58.320
right? With the help of this pidentic, you will be able to

01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:01.680
achieve whatever you want. How? Let me show you that part.

01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:04.820
So here, let's suppose I have created a simple plane

01:50:04.820 --> 01:50:07.460
subtract function, right? It's a simple plane subtract

01:50:07.460 --> 01:50:12.020
function. Now how it will be able to understand that. Okay.

01:50:12.020 --> 01:50:15.420
So use a pidentic. So here, just try to create another

01:50:15.420 --> 01:50:20.960
function def subtract number, let's suppose, right? And then

01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:26.500
here, so just try to write model subtract, subtract function

01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:30.000
you are trying to call, which needs A and B. So you are

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:34.580
trying to call model dot A and model dot B. Just try to

01:50:34.580 --> 01:50:38.480
understand in this way guys. Yeah. So this is my function,

01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:41.440
original function. Okay. I'm trying to call that original

01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:44.100
function over here. Now this original function takes two

01:50:44.100 --> 01:50:47.420
input, A and B. So okay, I'm trying to pass A and B, but

01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:51.800
how? Right? How? So first of all, data will come here. Data

01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:54.920
will come here. It will validate. It will validate. So this

01:50:54.920 --> 01:50:57.720
is a pidentic. This is a pidentic implementation. So

01:50:57.720 --> 01:51:00.040
pidentic is again another library, which is going to help me

01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:02.640
out in terms of a data validation and going forward, even in

01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:05.540
Langchain, Langraph, Lama indexes, we will end up using

01:51:05.540 --> 01:51:08.360
multiple times this pidentic, right? Multiple times.

01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:10.180
Multiple times. Not just one or two pidentics. So you will

01:51:10.180 --> 01:51:13.400
be able to see many examples. So data will come first of all

01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:16.500
here and it is going to validate that, okay, A is equal to

01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:18.500
integer and B is equal to integer. So whether it's an

01:51:18.500 --> 01:51:21.060
integer or not, only that validation it will do. If data,

01:51:21.180 --> 01:51:23.380
someone has passed and data is available in some different

01:51:23.380 --> 01:51:26.840
format, it will not be able to accept. And once it will be

01:51:26.840 --> 01:51:30.220
passed over here, so I'm trying to create a function and I'm

01:51:30.220 --> 01:51:33.300
trying to give access to the model, subtract model, this

01:51:33.300 --> 01:51:37.000
one, and now this model variable, model dot A means whatever

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:40.980
data which came here. Just try to access A out of it and

01:51:40.980 --> 01:51:43.180
then B out of it. So this is called as pidentic

01:51:43.180 --> 01:51:47.300
implementation, which I'm using for a data validation in a

01:51:47.300 --> 01:51:51.380
first place. Okay. Now, so once this is created, now expose

01:51:51.380 --> 01:51:58.460
it as a, like a expose it as a, like a API. So app dot POST

01:51:58.460 --> 01:52:02.320
and then slash subtract.

01:52:03.920 --> 01:52:07.860
Yeah. So this is the function available at this API, at this

01:52:07.860 --> 01:52:09.680
location. And technically this is calling. Okay. So I'm

01:52:09.680 --> 01:52:12.080
using my function, original function, and technically it's

01:52:12.080 --> 01:52:15.920
using a pidentic one. Now control S, right? Control S.

01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:24.500
Now you will call test app reload. So just try to execute

01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:27.640
it. And let me give you this piece of the code so that in

01:52:27.640 --> 01:52:32.200
parallel you all will be able to do this experiment. So I've

01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:34.680
given you the code guys. So I have a get as well as I have a

01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:39.280
post over here. Now what I will do, so local host 8,000

01:52:39.280 --> 01:52:42.680
subtract. Now let's try to send and see my issue has fixed.

01:52:43.420 --> 01:52:47.900
That was the issue. So basically when I'm trying to do a

01:52:47.900 --> 01:52:53.600
post, it requires a check, check on the data that you are

01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:56.840
trying to pass. It requires a validation. That's a secure

01:52:56.840 --> 01:52:59.720
one, right? And nowadays almost all the framework is like

01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:02.180
using a pidentic one. Nowadays everyone has implemented the

01:53:02.180 --> 01:53:05.260
pidentic in a Python. So they say that, that, okay, fine. So

01:53:05.260 --> 01:53:08.540
first validate and then pass. So this is what my pidentic is

01:53:08.540 --> 01:53:11.120
trying to do. And now my same issue, same code, everything

01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:13.500
is the same. I'm not changing anything, right? It was post.

01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:16.900
It was the same URL, right? And like, uh, I was able to

01:53:16.900 --> 01:53:20.020
like, uh, send this data, same data. And now my issue is

01:53:20.020 --> 01:53:22.800
gone. I'm able to get my output. So I'm able to technically

01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:31.020
test my API. The only issue was what a pidentic one. So

01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:33.440
whenever you are trying to create a post method, so you have

01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:36.960
to pass a data inside it with the help of pidentic means you

01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:39.960
have to do a data validation with the pidentic one. And then

01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:43.280
only you will be able to pass a data. And you will be able

01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:45.760
to test it in case of post, in case of gate, it's not

01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:49.380
required. It's completely fine. You can leave it. So this

01:53:49.380 --> 01:53:52.420
is, this is the body, right? This is the body parameter,

01:53:52.540 --> 01:53:54.540
which I'm trying to pass. So I'm trying to pass a parameter

01:53:54.540 --> 01:54:01.820
via body. So body raw JSON. Is it making sense to all of us

01:54:01.820 --> 01:54:02.140
guys?

01:54:06.490 --> 01:54:06.810
Yeah.

01:54:10.810 --> 01:54:13.690
Now, if I'm going to do a curl, see even curl is working

01:54:13.690 --> 01:54:18.290
now. Sorry. Curl was working even for like a before. Okay.

01:54:18.310 --> 01:54:23.390
So here, if I'm going to do, let me show it to you.

01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:29.660
Okay. So in this way, curl is telling me that methods are

01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:32.580
not allowed. Obviously method will not be allowed because I

01:54:32.580 --> 01:54:36.720
have to send our data via body. Yeah. So I have to send the

01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:40.560
data via body. Let me show it to you. So is it, is it

01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:42.860
working? Are we able to test it through a postman? Everyone?

01:54:47.900 --> 01:54:48.260
Yeah.

01:55:03.140 --> 01:55:08.120
Yes. So here, if I have to like a test this same thing via

01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:10.840
curl. So how do I test it? How I can write it or how I can

01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:14.300
do it? Let me write it down. Let me show it to you. CLS

01:55:14.300 --> 01:55:17.700
clear. Yeah. So first of all, I'll write curl and then

01:55:17.700 --> 01:55:20.700
inside the string, I can try to write my URL. So this is my

01:55:20.700 --> 01:55:24.700
URL localhost colon 8000 subtract, right? So this was

01:55:24.700 --> 01:55:29.740
technically my URL now here. So I can try to give a data. So

01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:34.080
to give a data slash D slash D is a high, basically this is

01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:37.540
a notation for giving a data. So to pass a data. Now let's

01:55:37.540 --> 01:55:40.860
try to pass a data over here. Okay. So I will try to pass a

01:55:40.860 --> 01:55:44.900
data as a JSON, as a key value pair. So a and a is equal to

01:55:44.900 --> 01:55:47.840
what? So a is equal to, let's suppose like a three and then

01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:53.100
B I'm going to pass. So B and B is equal to what? So B is

01:55:53.100 --> 01:55:56.340
equal to, let's suppose two I'm going to give, right? This

01:55:56.340 --> 01:55:59.700
one. So in this way I can try to pass a data. Hyphen D means

01:55:59.700 --> 01:56:04.600
passing a data over here. Hit enter. Sorry. I have to even

01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:11.100
write post, right? So method type is what? So hyphen. X. P.

01:56:11.220 --> 01:56:19.560
O. O. S. T. Post. Input should be a validated one. What is a

01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:26.360
issue? What should not give me issue by the way, I think I

01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:27.520
have written the correct curl.

01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:39.540
I have to attach header as well. Let me attach it. So data

01:56:39.540 --> 01:56:44.060
header. Let me pass again a issue. Let

01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:48.520
me test it.

01:56:56.550 --> 01:57:00.090
It is not able to bypass my pidentic.

01:57:02.670 --> 01:57:04.610
That's a whole issue.

01:57:09.050 --> 01:57:12.390
This one. This one.

01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:17.790
Slash.

01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:29.180
Now it's working. So basically, there was an issue with the

01:57:29.180 --> 01:57:32.460
pidentic. I have to pass a data so that it will be able to

01:57:32.460 --> 01:57:37.360
parse my entire like a dataset as an integer. So basically a

01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:40.280
new line. So I have written like new line, new line, new

01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:42.540
line, new line, something like this I have written. So this

01:57:42.540 --> 01:57:47.300
is a curl command guys to test this one, test this entire

01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:52.100
things. Yeah, this is the curl command. But again not very

01:57:52.100 --> 01:57:56.620
different. So I am able to like test as a curl, I am able to

01:57:56.620 --> 01:57:59.920
even test from the postman. So postman is one of the neat

01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:02.520
and clean and the simple one by the way. So whenever you are

01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:07.560
testing it something some APIs with the postman, if your API

01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:11.400
is good, then postman is the easiest possible way by which

01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:14.600
you can test it. But now I believe we are able to understand

01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:17.040
that what is the difference between post and get and

01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:21.260
whenever we are trying to create a post API. So what we are

01:58:21.260 --> 01:58:23.620
supposed to do and whenever we are trying to create a get

01:58:23.620 --> 01:58:28.720
API, what we are supposed to do. So both is done. Now the

01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:31.940
another one is called as put and delete. So maybe it's a

01:58:31.940 --> 01:58:35.600
time now, we will try to talk about this put and delete

01:58:35.600 --> 01:58:39.500
tomorrow. The whole idea and intention was to explain you

01:58:39.500 --> 01:58:45.020
and to teach you that what is the API and hope after today's

01:58:45.020 --> 01:58:48.020
class all of you are able to understand and where we are

01:58:48.020 --> 01:58:50.660
going to use it. So technically everywhere, right,

01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:55.100
technically everywhere we are going to use an API. Now if

01:58:55.100 --> 01:58:59.780
you will go to, right, now if you will go to your own. If

01:58:59.780 --> 01:59:03.400
you will go to your own and if you'll go to URI API and then

01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:07.620
if you will look into this one like endpoints, right, you

01:59:07.620 --> 01:59:10.620
all will be able to understand that what is the meaning of

01:59:10.620 --> 01:59:12.780
this one, right? What is the meaning of this URL? What

01:59:12.780 --> 01:59:16.500
technically this URL is trying to do, where we are trying to

01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:19.220
do a curl over here, right? I can just copy the same code

01:59:19.220 --> 01:59:22.120
base. I can ask that that convert that into a Python. We

01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:26.440
know that that we just need a URL, right? And if it is a

01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:31.100
secured one, then token. And then a body where we can try to

01:59:31.100 --> 01:59:33.880
pass our input. That's it. And we all understand now that

01:59:33.880 --> 01:59:37.000
ideally what is the meaning of it, right? Again for

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:40.160
embedding, right? So what is the meaning of it? We know. So

01:59:40.160 --> 01:59:44.280
we are trying to hit our function with this URL, right? We

01:59:44.280 --> 01:59:47.360
are trying to hit a function with this URL. We are trying to

01:59:47.360 --> 01:59:50.920
pass our password over here, right, inside a header and then

01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:54.040
as a data slash hyphen demons data, right? It's a post

01:59:54.040 --> 01:59:57.180
method. It's a post method, right? So as a data. We are

01:59:57.180 --> 02:00:01.440
trying to pass these two data. Very simple. Right? Very

02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:04.580
simple. This is what it means. Yeah. Now if I look into this

02:00:04.580 --> 02:00:07.660
speech API, right, we have given you a like a text to speech

02:00:07.660 --> 02:00:11.920
as well. So a speech function is available at this location.

02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:15.220
Yes. A speech function is available at this location. We are

02:00:15.220 --> 02:00:17.320
trying to pass our header. Header means we are trying to

02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:20.320
pass our basically token password basically. And then we are

02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:23.560
trying to pass our input data, hyphen D hyphen demons input

02:00:23.560 --> 02:00:26.800
data we are trying to pass. So. These are the key and value

02:00:26.800 --> 02:00:28.980
we are trying to pass. So we will be able to understand even

02:00:28.980 --> 02:00:32.520
this one, if I have to call this one as a Python code, as a

02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:36.600
Java code, not an issue at all. Yes, I will be able to call

02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:39.860
it. Now, if I'll come to this image API, which is going to

02:00:39.860 --> 02:00:43.320
generate an image for me, technically this image API is

02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:46.280
going to generate an image for me, right? So my image

02:00:46.280 --> 02:00:49.160
generation function is available at this location. This is

02:00:49.160 --> 02:00:52.360
the API, which I'm trying to pass. This is API key and this

02:00:52.360 --> 02:00:56.580
is the data. Right? So. of images, size, quality responses

02:00:56.580 --> 02:00:59.560
and then eventually this is going to generate an image for

02:00:59.560 --> 02:01:02.760
me. Now if I have to call it as a Python function, not an

02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:05.040
issue at all, I will be able to call it as a Python

02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:08.480
function. Now if you will come even inside the code example,

02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:12.380
so here we have given you like a Python, JavaScript and

02:01:12.380 --> 02:01:16.680
curl. So I have given you three let's suppose but yeah

02:01:16.680 --> 02:01:19.000
doesn't matter which programming language you are going to

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:23.260
use, you all will be able to use it. Yes and even without

02:01:23.260 --> 02:01:25.360
using a programming language, let's suppose I have to hit it

02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:27.660
through a postman. I can hit it through a postman. I can try

02:01:27.660 --> 02:01:28.680
to test it through a postman.

02:01:33.240 --> 02:01:36.680
Are we able to understand it guys overall like what is the

02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:40.680
concept behind an API and how does API actually work in a

02:01:40.680 --> 02:01:42.720
backend? Are we able to understand? Are we able to get that

02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:48.180
point? Yes so any no, any no inside the class I can say all

02:01:48.180 --> 02:01:52.300
yes yes yes yes yes yeah. So we are able to create our own

02:01:52.300 --> 02:01:55.400
API. We are able to test our own API. So two kind of API,

02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:59.100
one is a get, one is a post we have created. Yeah. Tomorrow

02:01:59.100 --> 02:02:02.180
I will be discussing about put and sorry I will try to put

02:02:02.180 --> 02:02:05.560
and delete. So put is nothing but update and delete means

02:02:05.560 --> 02:02:08.000
delete. But I will show you like how to do it.

02:02:12.210 --> 02:02:16.960
Yes yes but need some simple docs or note too. Why do you

02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:20.440
need, are you sitting in a school or college class where do

02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:24.620
you need like where you need like you know notes of each and

02:02:24.620 --> 02:02:27.560
every like things that I am going to teach. Wherever notes

02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:30.520
will be required. I will upload the notes but again do not

02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:33.080
keep this kind of expectation at least in my class. I do not

02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:37.580
teach in that way. Then I will teach you, I will give you a

02:02:37.580 --> 02:02:39.800
lecture for two hours then I will prepare the notes for you.

02:02:39.860 --> 02:02:42.300
I will give you even a notes which you will dump inside some

02:02:42.300 --> 02:02:47.340
of XYZ directories which you will never look into. Right it

02:02:47.340 --> 02:02:50.160
is a practical thing which I am trying to teach you. And if

02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:53.160
you have this kind of a mindset that okay you will try to

02:02:53.160 --> 02:02:55.820
take a note of each and everything and that too even for

02:02:55.820 --> 02:02:58.140
like a practical thing which I am going to teach you believe

02:02:58.140 --> 02:03:02.520
me. You will learn. You are not going to give some UPS exam

02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:05.420
or maybe your 10th and 12th exam. You are going to build a

02:03:05.420 --> 02:03:07.940
product right. Now to build a product you need a practical.

02:03:11.350 --> 02:03:13.970
So leave that mindset. If you have that kind of a mindset,

02:03:14.110 --> 02:03:18.110
the old mindset, the rote learning kind of a mindset with

02:03:18.110 --> 02:03:20.430
this you will never be able to survive in a tech industry at

02:03:20.430 --> 02:03:21.270
least. Never.

02:03:25.580 --> 02:03:27.720
Okay so okay

02:04:02.020 --> 02:04:04.580
so now it is assignment time guys so I am giving you

02:04:04.580 --> 02:04:08.180
assignment so that you know you will be able to create an

02:04:08.180 --> 02:04:11.620
API. And then you will be able to like test each and

02:04:11.620 --> 02:04:14.400
everything on your own and that assignment that you have to

02:04:14.400 --> 02:04:17.180
do. So let just wait for some time and

02:04:30.270 --> 02:04:32.650
just do this assignment after this you will be able to

02:04:32.650 --> 02:04:34.730
understand. So if you are not able to understand maybe 1 or

02:04:34.730 --> 02:04:38.110
2% you will be able to understand it in a easiest possible

02:04:38.110 --> 02:04:39.030
way. So

02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:18.380
let me give you an assignment.

02:05:21.670 --> 02:05:26.090
So this is a question number one that you have to do.

02:05:31.660 --> 02:05:38.050
This is a question number two that you have to do. Okay.

02:05:40.720 --> 02:05:43.400
And this is basically a question number three.

02:05:46.190 --> 02:05:49.450
Yeah. This is a question number three. So it is very simple.

02:05:49.570 --> 02:05:52.510
The very first one that the very first assignment question

02:05:52.510 --> 02:05:55.270
that we have given to you is create a fast API application

02:05:55.270 --> 02:05:58.370
that exposes a post endpoint to multiply two numbers. So

02:05:58.370 --> 02:06:00.690
already we have done for subtraction and addition get and

02:06:00.690 --> 02:06:04.190
post. So just have to do a multiplication and then the route

02:06:04.190 --> 02:06:07.090
is going to be slash multiply and you have to test it via

02:06:07.090 --> 02:06:11.170
the post curl and python. So just like do this part. Then

02:06:11.170 --> 02:06:13.870
second one is basically a calculated API. So in a calculator

02:06:13.870 --> 02:06:16.030
you have to create an addition subtraction multiplication

02:06:16.030 --> 02:06:20.070
division or any n number of other functions and then all of

02:06:20.070 --> 02:06:22.390
those functions you should be able to access it through an

02:06:22.390 --> 02:06:25.650
API fine. So all this detail is given over here. Then third

02:06:25.650 --> 02:06:28.490
one is basically a user registration. So whenever you go to

02:06:28.490 --> 02:06:31.010
any website and register yourself for the very first time.

02:06:31.110 --> 02:06:34.290
So basically you will try to enter your detail maybe a user

02:06:34.290 --> 02:06:36.850
name and mobile number or maybe a location each and

02:06:36.850 --> 02:06:40.570
everything we try to enter and that goes into our databases.

02:06:40.750 --> 02:06:45.470
Right. And then we send our data into our databases so that

02:06:45.470 --> 02:06:48.350
it will be able to store it into our databases. Now here. So

02:06:48.350 --> 02:06:51.370
you just have to create like a post function because you are

02:06:51.370 --> 02:06:54.050
sending a user email id and password. So that should be a

02:06:54.050 --> 02:06:56.810
post that should not be get by the way because now we

02:06:56.810 --> 02:06:58.790
understand what is the difference between get and post. So

02:06:58.790 --> 02:07:00.810
you have to create basically a post where you are sending a

02:07:00.810 --> 02:07:04.650
data email id password and a user name and technically like

02:07:04.650 --> 02:07:07.790
from other end. So you are able to get some sort of a

02:07:07.790 --> 02:07:09.850
message saying that okay fine so it's a correct user id

02:07:09.850 --> 02:07:14.170
phone number and whatever it is. Just try to like a create

02:07:14.170 --> 02:07:19.710
an API and then API

02:07:19.710 --> 02:07:21.350
assignment

02:07:24.580 --> 02:07:26.040
question.

02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:35.840
So after that I don't think that any one of you will face

02:07:35.840 --> 02:07:43.980
any kind of a issue. So where is the file control

02:07:45.990 --> 02:07:47.890
s d

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:58.630
type downloads. Okay. See the download API.

02:08:01.760 --> 02:08:02.240
Okay.

02:08:09.410 --> 02:08:10.350
Yeah. Yeah.

02:08:24.230 --> 02:08:26.670
Okay. So I have just given you the assignment question

02:08:26.670 --> 02:08:30.270
inside your group. That's the first part. Now it will be

02:08:30.270 --> 02:08:34.610
your assignment will be uploaded even inside your dashboard.

02:08:34.830 --> 02:08:39.010
So once we are going to upload a recorded so I think we all

02:08:39.010 --> 02:08:41.970
know that recording will take some time maybe two to three

02:08:41.970 --> 02:08:44.930
hour of time and I don't want you to wait for that long.

02:08:45.150 --> 02:08:47.810
Maybe you can start completing your assignment now itself.

02:08:48.050 --> 02:08:50.430
So that's the reason. So I am pinging you the entire

02:08:50.430 --> 02:08:55.230
assignment question. Even here so that you all will be able

02:08:55.230 --> 02:08:59.310
to download it. So let me ping you inside a zoom. I have

02:08:59.310 --> 02:09:02.050
already pinged you even inside your group.

02:09:38.980 --> 02:09:42.940
So it's available inside a zoom. So now you can download. I

02:09:42.940 --> 02:09:46.720
think it's showing me network disconnected. Click to retry.

02:09:50.420 --> 02:09:53.920
There is some issue with the zoom upload. I can just copy it

02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:54.540
and paste it.

02:10:05.900 --> 02:10:08.320
Zoom unable to find assignment. Yeah I'm just trying to copy

02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:12.840
and paste it and it's very long. So it's not allowing me it

02:10:12.840 --> 02:10:18.280
seems. So here is a question number one. I can't paste all

02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:21.600
of this message together. So here is a question number two

02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:24.900
and here is a question number three. Now whenever I'm going

02:10:24.900 --> 02:10:27.240
to upload the recording which will take eventually like a

02:10:27.240 --> 02:10:30.760
two three four hours. The last time Saturday it was quick

02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:35.220
but yeah on Sunday so it was giving us some issue with

02:10:35.220 --> 02:10:38.900
respect to DRM system. But yeah it will be available by

02:10:38.900 --> 02:10:42.060
evening. So along with that. I will be uploading this one

02:10:42.060 --> 02:10:46.820
plus I will be uploading this one as well. This material. So

02:10:46.820 --> 02:10:49.360
whatever I am going to do whatever I have discussed. So I'll

02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:52.260
be uploading even a code base code base will be uploaded

02:10:52.260 --> 02:10:59.840
inside your recording. So here API theory.

02:11:06.070 --> 02:11:10.910
So API theory your assignment and this particular code will

02:11:10.910 --> 02:11:13.310
be available inside your dashboard along with the recording.

02:11:13.430 --> 02:11:16.530
But yeah. It's going to take some time. So not quick as we

02:11:16.530 --> 02:11:21.340
all know. Can you please attach in the resources. I think I

02:11:21.340 --> 02:11:23.760
am speaking English right and we all understand English

02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:28.800
language. Yeah so why people keep on asking the same thing

02:11:28.800 --> 02:11:31.220
again and again. I don't understand even in group I can see

02:11:31.220 --> 02:11:35.420
that there was some misadventure which was going on and I

02:11:35.420 --> 02:11:38.140
think guys we all are mature enough right. So please

02:11:38.140 --> 02:11:42.420
maintain a distance from such activities. I think that will

02:11:42.420 --> 02:11:45.100
be and I'm telling you in the beginning of the class and

02:11:45.100 --> 02:11:46.880
I'll keep on telling you these things again and again and

02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:51.840
again in every classes. So that we all can learn in a

02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:52.700
smoothest possible way.

02:11:55.490 --> 02:11:58.250
You are technically a roaster. Yeah I do a lot. I love it.

02:11:58.270 --> 02:12:05.350
Basically I do a lot. I love roasting people. Okay fine. So

02:12:05.350 --> 02:12:08.690
those who is having any kind of a question please be here.

02:12:09.030 --> 02:12:12.170
Those who don't have any kind of a question you can drop

02:12:12.170 --> 02:12:15.470
from this class. Your class is over. I'm not going to

02:12:15.470 --> 02:12:20.230
discuss anything new now. So yeah thank you so much and hope

02:12:20.230 --> 02:12:22.870
all of you have liked the class. If you have any kind of

02:12:22.870 --> 02:12:26.410
feedback so you have a group which is open for all kind of a

02:12:26.410 --> 02:12:29.910
conversation. The productive one obviously right. So you can

02:12:29.910 --> 02:12:32.210
give me a feedback over there. You can give me a feedback

02:12:32.210 --> 02:12:35.630
even over here. So are you able to understand your API guys?

02:12:36.450 --> 02:12:39.770
Most of you maybe like 60-70 percent not 100 percent maybe

02:12:39.770 --> 02:12:43.890
60-70 percent yes okay then I'm happy. We all are happy.

02:12:43.990 --> 02:12:48.870
Yeah. 90 percent. Yeah. 80 percent 70 percent is also fine

02:12:48.870 --> 02:12:51.650
because again and again we will keep on using these things.

02:12:55.950 --> 02:12:58.770
Yeah. So Prashant Rai is saying I don't understand how to

02:12:58.770 --> 02:13:04.590
use ng-rog. Okay ng-rog is nothing but ng-rog and then like

02:13:04.590 --> 02:13:08.390
your HTTP and then port number simple and will expose. So

02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:10.350
whatever is running on that particular port number it will

02:13:10.350 --> 02:13:13.630
expose that to the outer world. By when should we finish the

02:13:13.630 --> 02:13:18.250
assignment? So see guys I'm not a school teacher right. I'm

02:13:18.250 --> 02:13:20.350
not a school teacher at all. So I'm not going to check your

02:13:20.350 --> 02:13:23.950
assignment and you are neither a like a school student right

02:13:23.950 --> 02:13:27.190
or a college student and even if I'm going to give you a

02:13:27.190 --> 02:13:29.530
marks for the assignment that is not going to help me or

02:13:29.530 --> 02:13:32.710
help you out right. Again it will try to create a friction.

02:13:33.150 --> 02:13:36.450
So I'm giving you assignment as of now and very soon within

02:13:36.450 --> 02:13:39.490
two to three week you will be able to see that I will start

02:13:39.490 --> 02:13:42.130
giving you challenges a lot of challenges right lot of

02:13:42.130 --> 02:13:45.830
challenges. And I will be expecting that that with honesty

02:13:45.830 --> 02:13:49.230
all of you are going to work on those assignments.

02:13:49.230 --> 02:13:54.170
Assignment and on challenges. You have a AI validated with

02:13:54.170 --> 02:13:57.510
it. I have already given you a group. Maybe you can try to

02:13:57.510 --> 02:14:01.790
like a pick your learning partner if you want right. Let's

02:14:01.790 --> 02:14:04.290
suppose you would like to learn with maybe two people three

02:14:04.290 --> 02:14:07.010
people and then maybe create your own separate group and do

02:14:07.010 --> 02:14:09.610
all kind of a discussion in your own group on private group

02:14:09.610 --> 02:14:12.550
right. My responsibility was to create a community. Yes we

02:14:12.550 --> 02:14:15.070
have a community and that community will keep on growing so

02:14:15.070 --> 02:14:17.090
that that community will be able to help you out. Not in

02:14:17.090 --> 02:14:20.150
just terms of learning. Okay. That's number one right. The

02:14:20.150 --> 02:14:23.110
major part is like a transition so that community will be

02:14:23.110 --> 02:14:26.150
able to help you out. And yeah so whatever assignment I'm

02:14:26.150 --> 02:14:29.510
giving you try to solve it. Try to solve it. Try to validate

02:14:29.510 --> 02:14:31.770
it. Try to discuss with your groups. Your mini group

02:14:31.770 --> 02:14:35.010
basically three to four people or try to validate it with

02:14:35.010 --> 02:14:39.010
the AI. So we are not going to behave like a school child

02:14:39.010 --> 02:14:41.670
because that is not going to help any one of us. And that is

02:14:41.670 --> 02:14:44.690
not my style of taking the classes right. So don't think

02:14:44.690 --> 02:14:47.170
that I'll give you assignment then I'll ask you to submit

02:14:47.170 --> 02:14:50.250
the assignment then I'll check it. I'll check it for you and

02:14:50.250 --> 02:14:53.110
then I'll give you a marks out of ten out of hundred right.

02:14:53.330 --> 02:14:56.010
What you will do with that marks at the end of the day we

02:14:56.010 --> 02:14:59.150
all have to write the code. We have to build a system right.

02:14:59.730 --> 02:15:02.990
So whenever I'm giving you challenges build it do it and

02:15:02.990 --> 02:15:05.690
show it to everyone that I have built this particular system

02:15:05.690 --> 02:15:09.030
as of now it's just assignment. But in two three week we'll

02:15:09.030 --> 02:15:11.430
start building a system as well in two three week only.

02:15:14.550 --> 02:15:17.670
Yes I believe this approach is good and all of you are okay

02:15:17.670 --> 02:15:22.670
with it. Yes everyone. Yeah. So we'll we'll not be here like

02:15:22.670 --> 02:15:24.610
a school and college. We are not in a school and college.

02:15:24.710 --> 02:15:27.750
It's a professional things that we are trying to learn and

02:15:27.750 --> 02:15:31.250
here we'll try to learn less. We'll try to build more

02:15:31.250 --> 02:15:36.810
because that is the only way because see I'm into this

02:15:36.810 --> 02:15:42.550
teaching profession since last eight nine year. So and many

02:15:42.550 --> 02:15:45.490
people not just one to maybe more than 10,000 people have

02:15:45.490 --> 02:15:49.490
done the transition and because of this philosophy.

02:15:52.230 --> 02:15:53.850
So it's a proven one by the way.

02:15:58.650 --> 02:16:00.710
Would you teach? Did you teach flask also? No, not at all.

02:16:00.830 --> 02:16:03.590
So if you have to like a learn flask, come to my python

02:16:03.590 --> 02:16:07.730
classes over there. I used to teach flask. So I have like a

02:16:07.730 --> 02:16:10.830
separate class for separate separate things because I can't

02:16:10.830 --> 02:16:12.890
like a teach everything in one single classes practically

02:16:12.890 --> 02:16:17.690
that is not possible and again people will like a get bored

02:16:17.690 --> 02:16:25.190
by those things. Okay, fine guys. So now let's start a doubt

02:16:25.190 --> 02:16:29.090
clearing. So I think we all know that drill. So to do a

02:16:29.090 --> 02:16:31.630
doubt clearing, you can even share your screen, right? So

02:16:31.630 --> 02:16:33.430
without getting wise, you can share your screen, you can

02:16:33.430 --> 02:16:36.910
chat and all those things can be done. So just raise your

02:16:36.910 --> 02:16:39.570
hand. You will must be able to see a raise hand option, uh,

02:16:39.750 --> 02:16:42.850
the icon, right? So raise your hand one by one. I'm going to

02:16:42.850 --> 02:16:45.950
call out your name and uh, yeah, if you would like to share

02:16:45.950 --> 02:16:47.850
the screen, share the screen. If you would like to like, uh,

02:16:47.950 --> 02:16:51.090
ask some doubt, do it. I don't have any issue. I'm open for

02:16:51.090 --> 02:16:56.150
all discussion. Yeah. So, uh, go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead.

02:16:56.430 --> 02:16:59.910
Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. So first Karthick, then guess,

02:17:00.070 --> 02:17:04.370
then Javir, and then like, uh, Avarice. Yeah. Thank you for

02:17:04.370 --> 02:17:08.870
the class Mr Fur . Um, so I am just trying, I'm just trying

02:17:08.870 --> 02:17:13.430
to run, uh, the API with перcon, uh, from outside the

02:17:13.430 --> 02:17:16.230
directory, so when I'm just trying to give it a full path,

02:17:16.390 --> 02:17:18.510
it is not taking, it is giving

02:17:27.470 --> 02:17:31.330
not able to uh do it uh can i share my screen quickly yeah

02:17:31.330 --> 02:17:34.230
you can share your screen but going to directory then try to

02:17:34.230 --> 02:17:37.530
i mean like anything is fine yeah actually i tried three

02:17:37.530 --> 02:17:40.570
four combinations nothing nothing was working out so i was

02:17:40.570 --> 02:17:44.750
like um if i'm doing something or should i escape it or not

02:17:44.750 --> 02:17:50.250
like share your screen next question please in between i'm

02:17:50.250 --> 02:17:54.190
not getting an option to share it uh no i have added you as

02:17:54.190 --> 02:17:58.470
a panelist so you will join again as a panelist okay got it

02:17:58.470 --> 02:18:02.750
yeah in between so uh next one mucus what is your question

02:18:02.750 --> 02:18:08.150
yeah sir it's a recorded session so uh if possible uh can

02:18:08.150 --> 02:18:12.270
you minimize uh like live videos so that i will get the food

02:18:12.270 --> 02:18:17.050
skin because in the corner uh right top corner uh there's

02:18:17.050 --> 02:18:20.190
some like no a block is coming and few of the options

02:18:20.190 --> 02:18:24.650
whenever we are going to i was not able to follow up so that

02:18:24.650 --> 02:18:27.650
is that is a default like a recording and in a corner so

02:18:27.650 --> 02:18:31.570
obviously there will be a my photo right yeah i mean it

02:18:31.570 --> 02:18:34.970
should be minimized i'm not much uh because yeah there is

02:18:34.970 --> 02:18:37.570
there is no option in zoom by default zoom records a session

02:18:37.570 --> 02:18:41.690
in that way in live so i can i can remove that part but uh

02:18:41.690 --> 02:18:44.810
in a recording so it's a default recording with jones repair

02:18:44.810 --> 02:18:48.450
we are not doing a like a anything extra from like our side

02:18:48.450 --> 02:18:53.510
basically about it yeah because and uh a few pace like

02:18:53.510 --> 02:18:57.210
whenever i was trying to like ns rock and all i was not able

02:18:57.210 --> 02:19:00.890
to follow up and by like no uh by that time i was trying to

02:19:00.890 --> 02:19:05.350
figure it out my issues uh like no some something was missed

02:19:05.350 --> 02:19:09.770
like no the capturing so just give like uh one or two

02:19:09.770 --> 02:19:13.410
minutes pause so that uh like everyone uh maybe if someone

02:19:13.410 --> 02:19:15.730
is also facing the same issue don't worry anyhow i used to

02:19:15.730 --> 02:19:18.790
repeat same thing multiple times see whatever content i have

02:19:18.790 --> 02:19:21.690
discussed so what i have done today if you will observe uh

02:19:21.690 --> 02:19:26.110
carefully right uh the content that i have discussed only uh

02:19:26.790 --> 02:19:32.970
like a 15 or 12 line of a code in two hours yeah that's true

02:19:32.970 --> 02:19:40.310
so in two hours just imagine right in two hours so i keep on

02:19:40.310 --> 02:19:43.610
repeating uh things multiple times and if you have any

02:19:43.610 --> 02:19:46.290
question after that so we have a doubt clearing as we are

02:19:46.290 --> 02:19:50.850
doing it now that's all i'm having yeah thank you yeah yeah

02:19:50.850 --> 02:19:55.830
thanks okay so jb javier uh yeah so in between uh karthik

02:19:55.830 --> 02:19:57.450
you can share your screen i think you have permission to

02:19:57.450 --> 02:20:03.980
share the screen can you hear me yeah i can hear you oh yeah

02:20:03.980 --> 02:20:08.380
thank you um my question is that too one is the we need to

02:20:08.380 --> 02:20:14.280
learn of the api testing and like postman and uh oh you see

02:20:14.280 --> 02:20:17.560
in the fast api and of the curve we need to all three of

02:20:17.560 --> 02:20:21.580
them need to learn or only one right you don't see i don't

02:20:21.580 --> 02:20:24.280
think that it's called as learning by the way it's a simple

02:20:24.280 --> 02:20:28.440
utility that you are going to use it all the time like what

02:20:28.440 --> 02:20:30.440
is learning in this one there is nothing called as learning

02:20:30.440 --> 02:20:34.960
in this one right no it's a utility right so you have to

02:20:34.960 --> 02:20:37.460
basically create an api you have to test it so maybe test it

02:20:37.460 --> 02:20:39.640
through a postman pressure through a curl to call it inside

02:20:39.640 --> 02:20:43.400
uh like a code that's completely fine yeah but it's just a

02:20:43.400 --> 02:20:47.060
utility i don't call this these things as a learning oh okay

02:20:47.060 --> 02:20:51.080
okay that's fantastic and also i have faced the problem i

02:20:51.080 --> 02:20:55.180
cannot run the like you can share if you want yeah you can

02:20:55.180 --> 02:20:56.860
share the screen i'm promoting you as a panelist you will be

02:20:56.860 --> 02:21:00.100
rejoining yeah karthik so what is i can see your screen so

02:21:00.100 --> 02:21:04.100
show me like what you're writing so yeah this is uh this is

02:21:04.100 --> 02:21:08.820
the one like this is the one and then what is your file name

02:21:08.820 --> 02:21:13.180
so your file name is basically so inside a gen ai there is a

02:21:13.180 --> 02:21:16.320
api just do one thing right click on a test.pi right click

02:21:16.320 --> 02:21:22.600
okay yeah yeah copy the path copy path okay fine now come

02:21:22.600 --> 02:21:26.660
over here uh uv con paste it paste that path okay

02:21:30.500 --> 02:21:39.690
so test.py colon yeah app reload you can write it you can

02:21:39.690 --> 02:21:43.730
skip it that's completely fine yeah you'll hit now now it's

02:21:43.730 --> 02:21:49.850
working could not import the module called as c okay so it's

02:21:49.850 --> 02:21:55.810
basically a windows issue i can say fine like uh terminate

02:21:55.810 --> 02:22:03.770
it ctrl x terminate now um like uh arrow up okay and do

02:22:04.050 --> 02:22:07.590
double slash c drive double slash personal double slash gen

02:22:07.590 --> 02:22:12.570
ai uh yeah no no yeah double slash here double slash

02:22:12.570 --> 02:22:16.490
everywhere double slash then double slash once again then

02:22:16.490 --> 02:22:23.430
double slash once again fine hit now i could not import

02:22:23.430 --> 02:22:29.170
module c drive it is not able to speaking this as like

02:22:29.870 --> 02:22:34.630
anything trying to take it as a module rather than uh the

02:22:34.630 --> 02:22:38.350
directory structure uh it should it should work stop

02:22:38.350 --> 02:22:48.190
reloading the process uh okay so uh c it just it's a string

02:22:48.190 --> 02:22:50.650
right it never understand the string part it never

02:22:50.650 --> 02:22:56.050
understand that so here api gen ai fine and the absolute

02:22:56.050 --> 02:23:00.030
path is fine now just do one thing do a backward slash

02:23:00.030 --> 02:23:03.210
remove double slash do a backwards less it's a windows issue

02:23:03.210 --> 02:23:05.850
if you are running the same thing in a linux and in a mac

02:23:05.850 --> 02:23:07.950
machine it will never give you issue it will take the

02:23:07.950 --> 02:23:10.170
absolute path but with windows this is the issue

02:23:16.590 --> 02:23:22.650
just just hit it error loading asgi app could not import two

02:23:22.650 --> 02:23:26.010
picon running no no just run it and then test it as a this

02:23:26.010 --> 02:23:31.190
one url copy the url test it

02:23:36.060 --> 02:23:39.020
going inside a folder is one of the way that's why you can't

02:23:39.020 --> 02:23:43.540
reach no it's not running is gi fine go inside the folder

02:23:43.540 --> 02:23:47.040
and then do it because uh it's it's not able to identify

02:23:47.040 --> 02:23:50.340
it's a windows issue in other system it will not give you

02:23:50.340 --> 02:23:54.360
the issue but like we can give different parts right and see

02:23:54.360 --> 02:23:56.900
it's just a file it will try to detect it is not detecting

02:23:56.900 --> 02:23:59.220
anything else just a file right so wherever file is

02:23:59.220 --> 02:24:02.360
available we always give that path but with windows there

02:24:02.360 --> 02:24:05.220
will be this issue uh where it will not be able to identify

02:24:05.220 --> 02:24:08.920
or uh c drive you are trying to give so maybe it is not

02:24:08.920 --> 02:24:11.620
having admin permission or something like that in other

02:24:11.620 --> 02:24:16.340
system it never gives an issue can i say something sir yeah

02:24:16.340 --> 02:24:21.740
manisha i'm also trying the same and i am using d drive but

02:24:21.740 --> 02:24:26.100
uh that is happening the same so this thing windows machine

02:24:26.100 --> 02:24:30.220
right yeah windows machine could not import module d so yeah

02:24:30.220 --> 02:24:35.700
go with the absolute path simple means go inside the

02:24:35.700 --> 02:24:38.380
directory and then execute that that must be working right

02:24:38.920 --> 02:24:42.600
yes that is what that will that will always work see path it

02:24:42.600 --> 02:24:45.140
works with the path but uh there is an issue with the

02:24:45.140 --> 02:24:51.360
windows so got it gets gets confused got it and uh i have

02:24:51.360 --> 02:24:56.300
one another very basic question um can we touch base a bit

02:24:56.300 --> 02:24:59.520
on like what is the difference between an llm and a gpt

02:25:00.840 --> 02:25:06.700
technically gpt is llm so gpt is one kind of llms so llms

02:25:06.700 --> 02:25:09.760
will form his large language model so which is is going to

02:25:09.760 --> 02:25:14.200
give you a output based on your input and if that

02:25:14.200 --> 02:25:16.440
architecture is a transformer architecture it's called as

02:25:16.440 --> 02:25:19.280
llms technically large language model so which can generate

02:25:19.280 --> 02:25:24.280
like a 128k token or maybe 4k token or 10k token at a time

02:25:24.280 --> 02:25:28.160
based on your input that is taking so in a generic way it's

02:25:28.160 --> 02:25:32.660
a llms gpt is one of the llms like we have other lms for

02:25:32.660 --> 02:25:36.680
example we have a cloud s soon it we have gemini we have a

02:25:36.680 --> 02:25:40.000
llama we have a maverick maybe we have a quen basically we

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.920
have our deep seek so all of these things are technically

02:25:42.920 --> 02:25:46.860
llms okay so like they can be these terms can be used

02:25:46.860 --> 02:25:50.900
interchangeably like we can say that gpt is an llm or llm

02:25:50.900 --> 02:25:54.140
can be anything can be a transformer yeah so anything which

02:25:54.140 --> 02:25:56.320
is going to like a take an input and which is going to

02:25:56.320 --> 02:25:59.160
generate a huge amount of the data a text for you or any

02:25:59.160 --> 02:26:01.820
kind of a data a huge amount obviously that is called as llm

02:26:01.820 --> 02:26:06.640
got it got it yep and again so it will be having a

02:26:06.640 --> 02:26:09.320
transformer architecture and again so transform architecture

02:26:09.320 --> 02:26:12.640
wise it will be having many layers so 96 layers or maybe a

02:26:12.640 --> 02:26:17.220
hundred and like a 20 something layer or maybe 500 layer of

02:26:17.220 --> 02:26:19.700
the transformer is stacked upon each and every one so it's

02:26:19.700 --> 02:26:23.280
called as technically a large language model got it got it

02:26:23.280 --> 02:26:27.520
thank you yeah thanks for that yeah yeah try with the

02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:29.960
command prompt so even kartik right so try this out with the

02:26:29.960 --> 02:26:32.980
command prompt uh you you were must be trying i think with

02:26:32.980 --> 02:26:38.460
the power cell serial screen once again yeah okay so now

02:26:38.460 --> 02:26:44.400
just try to change it to the uh this one uh yeah go with the

02:26:44.400 --> 02:26:45.760
power cell you

02:26:52.420 --> 02:26:55.300
want me to go to the partial yes so

02:26:57.500 --> 02:27:06.340
from here you can switch from your uh from your terminal

02:27:06.340 --> 02:27:09.320
itself so on your right hand side uh you will be able to see

02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:12.420
a button plus right so just click over there click yeah now

02:27:12.420 --> 02:27:17.480
you can select from here so you want it yeah

02:27:19.660 --> 02:27:22.720
i'm trying using the power cell but whenever i do it it will

02:27:22.720 --> 02:27:22.720
give me power cells so it takes a little bit of time to get

02:27:22.720 --> 02:27:23.640
it to say now one minute is left i'm trying I got the result

02:27:23.640 --> 02:27:26.620
with the five five, but whenever I'm trying with the UV con,

02:27:26.740 --> 02:27:31.600
it is showing the same error, same error, right? So better

02:27:31.600 --> 02:27:36.600
to go inside the directory and then like a do it as okay. So

02:27:36.600 --> 02:27:38.540
from here, if you're trying to execute, then you should

02:27:38.540 --> 02:27:39.960
write dot slash API.

02:27:44.870 --> 02:27:49.210
No. So I think you have a stop sharing your screen. If

02:27:49.210 --> 02:27:53.570
you're trying this out from this folder, right? So where you

02:27:53.570 --> 02:27:55.730
are as of now, which is a gen AI folder, which I was able to

02:27:55.730 --> 02:27:59.690
see. So from there dot slash API, so that it will go to the

02:27:59.690 --> 02:28:03.550
home directory means this local one, and then it will be

02:28:03.550 --> 02:28:05.650
able to grind the API directory and then it will go inside

02:28:05.650 --> 02:28:12.650
the file. So this one has dot slash API

02:28:12.650 --> 02:28:20.010
underscore example, then slash a test MPP,

02:28:22.200 --> 02:28:25.440
the, the, the backslash basically not a forward one.

02:28:30.460 --> 02:28:33.180
Yeah. So dot slash API. So dot slash API, example, test app

02:28:33.180 --> 02:28:40.070
and then hit the package argument was required before what

02:28:40.070 --> 02:28:44.270
happened? You, we call you every time, right? Yes. Type

02:28:44.270 --> 02:28:49.030
error. It is not able to identify. Yep. Leave it goes

02:28:49.030 --> 02:28:52.670
directly and then execute. God. It's facing an issue with a,

02:28:52.810 --> 02:28:58.730
uh, like a location. Yeah. Yeah. So what is your issue? Uh,

02:28:58.830 --> 02:29:04.230
my issue is that I cannot run this one. See you. It's a

02:29:04.230 --> 02:29:07.010
user. You have written UV.

02:29:10.200 --> 02:29:11.360
Yeah. It's a, I.

02:29:15.060 --> 02:29:20.160
Yes. Right. Yes. And then like, I do it like a test column.

02:29:20.220 --> 02:29:23.460
Pi reload is fine. If you are going to leave it, it's, it's

02:29:23.460 --> 02:29:29.520
not an issue at all. Okay. When I like, uh, a cup of coffee,

02:29:29.540 --> 02:29:37.480
this one, after that, I think some issue, like it's

02:29:44.840 --> 02:29:49.560
going to show up. This message checking. Yeah. Yeah. Just

02:29:49.560 --> 02:29:51.720
show me, show me the command once again. What do you have

02:29:51.720 --> 02:29:51.900
written?

02:29:54.780 --> 02:29:59.040
No. Just go to a terminal, terminal, terminal, terminal, VS

02:29:59.040 --> 02:30:03.740
code, go back to VS code, uh, base code. Yeah. What do you

02:30:03.740 --> 02:30:07.760
have written? Uh, where is the command? Uh, you'll be called

02:30:07.760 --> 02:30:12.460
T S T. Okay. So call an app. It's not a pie. Basically it's

02:30:12.460 --> 02:30:16.960
an app. Oh, that's the column app. That's a command, right?

02:30:17.040 --> 02:30:20.320
So test is your file name. App is a syntax by which it will

02:30:20.320 --> 02:30:22.900
be able to understand terminate, terminate, control C or

02:30:22.900 --> 02:30:33.310
control X. Control X. Yeah. Control C, control C. Yeah. Now,

02:30:33.490 --> 02:30:37.930
uh, yeah. Write it again. Up arrow. Let's just do up arrow.

02:30:38.050 --> 02:30:41.370
It will be able to throw you the same command. Uh, like

02:30:41.370 --> 02:30:44.310
test. You will call. Yes. You will be ice. You are in test,

02:30:44.510 --> 02:30:47.910
call an app. It'll be app. Okay. Test is your file name. App

02:30:47.910 --> 02:30:51.630
is a command. Call an app. Okay. Yeah. Hit enter. Enter.

02:30:51.730 --> 02:30:56.090
Enter. Enter. Hmm. Now go and test. It will work.

02:31:00.730 --> 02:31:03.810
You can even write like a local host. No, no, no. It's been

02:31:03.810 --> 02:31:08.270
terminated. Run again. Run again. Oh, run again. Yeah.

02:31:11.260 --> 02:31:16.040
Now leave it. Go to the browser. Leave it as it is. It's

02:31:16.040 --> 02:31:20.800
running. So now hit it. Hmm. It's running. Now call slash

02:31:20.800 --> 02:31:26.300
docs. It will show you the Swagger UI. Slash. Okay. No, no,

02:31:26.360 --> 02:31:30.240
no. With that. With the same thing. 127.0.0.0.1. 8,000.

02:31:30.320 --> 02:31:37.800
Slash. Okay. Slash. Yeah. Slash. Docs. Yes. Slash. Enter.

02:31:38.400 --> 02:31:47.560
No, no, no. Slash. Docs. Docs. Docs. Docs. Yeah. Enter. Now

02:31:47.560 --> 02:31:50.180
here is the Swagger UI. You can see your API, right? Slash

02:31:50.180 --> 02:31:54.100
add. Oh, yeah. Okay. Can I share my screen? Yeah. Just a

02:31:54.100 --> 02:31:59.440

have a. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so. Thank

02:33:46.240 --> 02:33:49.560
you. So. All session. It is. Wonderful session. Basically.

02:33:50.580 --> 02:33:54.080
Some questions. So in my project. We are. Extracting the

02:33:54.080 --> 02:33:57.800
data. From the web. Publication. Twitter. Or something.

02:33:58.260 --> 02:34:02.580
Twitter. And Facebook. Instagram. So basically. What

02:34:02.580 --> 02:34:06.940
happened? Over there. So we are. We are. invoking the api

02:34:06.940 --> 02:34:11.300
call with the sequential patient so iterating one by one so

02:34:11.300 --> 02:34:14.720
is there any easiest way to get the api and the asynchronous

02:34:14.720 --> 02:34:19.580
way is there an asynchronous patient that can do because

02:34:19.580 --> 02:34:23.460
yeah no no please please go ahead complete your question

02:34:23.460 --> 02:34:26.960
please yes yeah right so we have the one intermediate

02:34:26.960 --> 02:34:31.320
platform over there so sprinkler platform so we can get the

02:34:31.320 --> 02:34:35.160
platform and it can extract the data so what is the problem

02:34:35.160 --> 02:34:38.860
i am facing sometime we are facing some connection out time

02:34:38.860 --> 02:34:42.920
out issue api connection time out issue but in our python

02:34:42.920 --> 02:34:47.120
code just we are using we are using iteration approach to

02:34:47.120 --> 02:34:52.140
hit the api call for every hundred every thousand rows but

02:34:52.140 --> 02:34:55.500
we are extracting the data from website to generate some

02:34:55.500 --> 02:35:02.020
page performance data something we have the 10k 20k rows so

02:35:02.020 --> 02:35:04.720
for every iteration we are extracting the hundred thousand

02:35:04.720 --> 02:35:09.680
rows okay so how can we uh is there any easiest approach to

02:35:09.680 --> 02:35:14.740
follow the asynchronous uh synchronous you can try to run

02:35:14.740 --> 02:35:19.600
but as you are trying so just go ahead with one thing no so

02:35:19.600 --> 02:35:22.060
just go ahead with the pagination don't try to like you know

02:35:22.060 --> 02:35:25.800
scrap all the data uh at a time because you are facing a

02:35:25.800 --> 02:35:27.840
timeout issue right so by the time it will try to give a

02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:31.060
request and it will get a response so uh basically that

02:35:31.060 --> 02:35:34.140
connection will be like a timed out so i will say simply go

02:35:34.140 --> 02:35:36.640
ahead with the pagination over here there's a concept of

02:35:36.640 --> 02:35:39.320
pagination even with the what is the page yeah what is the

02:35:39.320 --> 02:35:42.600
page generation sir it means like a layer by layer page by

02:35:42.600 --> 02:35:44.980
page page by page it will be able to access the things it

02:35:44.980 --> 02:35:48.860
will not try to access everything at a time so that you will

02:35:48.860 --> 02:35:54.400
not face a timeline time out issue basically and also i am

02:35:54.400 --> 02:35:57.420
curious to know that so right now we are hitting the

02:35:57.420 --> 02:36:00.560
thousand rows right for every iteration it is extracting the

02:36:00.560 --> 02:36:03.860
thousand rows from api but how does it understand sequence

02:36:03.860 --> 02:36:07.460
the first time when we hit the api it is extracting the

02:36:07.460 --> 02:36:10.380
thousand rows from topic basically whoever has written a

02:36:10.380 --> 02:36:12.660
function yeah so whoever has written a function right

02:36:12.660 --> 02:36:15.420
someone has written a function and with the help of api you

02:36:15.420 --> 02:36:18.420
are hitting that function so over there person has already

02:36:18.420 --> 02:36:20.820
mentioned that okay fine so maximum number of record or

02:36:20.820 --> 02:36:23.140
maybe a minimum record or minimum number of record should be

02:36:23.140 --> 02:36:26.300
thousand in that function someone has written that okay

02:36:27.840 --> 02:36:31.260
those values we are passing right from our client side so if

02:36:31.260 --> 02:36:35.660
one thousand rows yeah if person has exposed it right see

02:36:35.660 --> 02:36:39.380
let's suppose i have written a function right so parameter

02:36:39.380 --> 02:36:42.400
will be under my control so maybe i will expose some of the

02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:44.840
parameter and some of the parameter i will not expose so if

02:36:44.840 --> 02:36:47.600
person has already exposed that parameter that you can pass

02:36:47.600 --> 02:36:51.100
number of records like then you can pass through an api and

02:36:51.100 --> 02:36:53.520
it will be able to act accordingly if a person has not

02:36:53.520 --> 02:36:57.540
exposed that parameter so in that case you won't be able to

02:36:57.540 --> 02:37:02.600
do anything okay and one more question i got into your point

02:37:02.600 --> 02:37:06.080
sir actually we have the ten this is record or 20k records

02:37:06.080 --> 02:37:09.760
right okay maybe how many pagination over there over the

02:37:09.760 --> 02:37:13.560
website overall so basically you should you should you

02:37:13.560 --> 02:37:16.620
should basically check that uh at uh like how many second

02:37:16.620 --> 02:37:19.740
basically you are getting this timeout issue and in that

02:37:19.740 --> 02:37:22.780
time frame so how much record you are able to access so

02:37:22.780 --> 02:37:24.720
basically when you are doing a pagination you should put

02:37:24.720 --> 02:37:29.640
that particular values over there because everyone will give

02:37:29.640 --> 02:37:32.280
a different different timeouts right so timeout is again

02:37:32.280 --> 02:37:34.240
under my control so let's suppose if i have designed my

02:37:34.240 --> 02:37:36.600
system so i can mention that okay fine so on five

02:37:36.600 --> 02:37:39.300
millisecond just do a timeout or maybe on a 5000 millisecond

02:37:39.300 --> 02:37:42.840
or microsecond just go with the timeout yes so if there is

02:37:42.840 --> 02:37:44.860
no data or if someone is trying to extract something or

02:37:44.860 --> 02:37:48.180
someone is trying to hit my system so again it's your so

02:37:48.180 --> 02:37:50.860
let's suppose you are trying to hit some apis so just try to

02:37:50.860 --> 02:37:53.720
observe that okay so in this particular part of the second

02:37:53.720 --> 02:37:56.840
how much record i am able to get and after how many seconds

02:37:56.840 --> 02:37:59.060
it's going for the timeout you can do the calculation right

02:37:59.060 --> 02:38:01.620
so basically you can just try to call the time function

02:38:01.620 --> 02:38:03.800
before calling the api and after calling the api okay and

02:38:03.800 --> 02:38:06.520
then find out the subtraction of it so it will give you the

02:38:06.520 --> 02:38:09.440
total second basically so okay fine so in this many seconds

02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:11.820
this is the total number of record which it was able to

02:38:11.820 --> 02:38:14.740
fetch and this is like going for the timeout after this this

02:38:14.740 --> 02:38:19.180
particular values try to do a pagination accordingly so that

02:38:19.180 --> 02:38:22.920
will become a parameter for okay but but yeah yeah i agree

02:38:22.920 --> 02:38:26.540
with your point but the response depends on that locality

02:38:26.540 --> 02:38:30.660
and server location we have various parameters right

02:38:30.660 --> 02:38:34.000
obviously response depends upon the server location i am

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.640
telling you that observe that what alternative you are not

02:38:36.640 --> 02:38:38.260
going to observe right you will not be able to set these

02:38:38.260 --> 02:38:44.520
parameters okay and is there anything set the api uh called

02:38:44.520 --> 02:38:48.080
try limit from the tool level maybe in the server side uh

02:38:48.080 --> 02:38:51.800
would they set up any code the api try limit and for example

02:38:51.800 --> 02:38:54.980
obviously even obviously even even we have done that so

02:38:54.980 --> 02:38:57.460
whenever you are going to hit yuri api right we are giving

02:38:57.460 --> 02:39:01.480
you only one lakh token per day 365 lakh in a year so if you

02:39:01.480 --> 02:39:03.900
will check the yuri so you will be able to even see the

02:39:03.900 --> 02:39:07.200
track of those api that okay fine so in this hit this is the

02:39:07.200 --> 02:39:09.240
total number of api consumption in this hit this is the

02:39:09.240 --> 02:39:11.960
total number of api consumption and even we have given you

02:39:11.960 --> 02:39:14.940
the limit so every system will give you a limit similar kind

02:39:14.940 --> 02:39:19.200
of a limit okay have you tried the have you updated the

02:39:19.200 --> 02:39:23.780
logic in the server side right based on that only so let me

02:39:23.780 --> 02:39:25.640
let me share my screen i'll show it to you so if you have

02:39:25.640 --> 02:39:33.640
not sir my number is please oh one short

02:39:33.640 --> 02:39:38.040
question uh uh can i use the yuri for voice chat uh you can

02:39:38.040 --> 02:39:42.820
use basically yuri for text to speech but uh inside yuri

02:39:42.820 --> 02:39:45.600
right voice chat yeah you can use it i was wondering that

02:39:45.600 --> 02:39:47.900
yuri api yeah so ramesh basically i was trying to explain

02:39:47.900 --> 02:39:51.920
you this part so here we have users right yeah yeah sure uh

02:39:51.920 --> 02:39:54.420
today i have shown you one example right so where i was

02:39:54.420 --> 02:39:57.100
using api so see my today's consumption so we are tracking

02:39:57.100 --> 02:40:00.000
each and everything so the limit is basically one lakh and

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:03.380
for 365 days you have basically like uh access of this

02:40:03.380 --> 02:40:06.940
entire portal entire api in one single payment so even we

02:40:06.940 --> 02:40:11.180
are tracking it and then if you come to logs right so you

02:40:11.180 --> 02:40:14.020
will be able to check that okay fine so in one api hit so

02:40:14.020 --> 02:40:16.860
what was the total number of token which was consumed what

02:40:16.860 --> 02:40:19.240
was the head everything everything we are observing and we

02:40:19.240 --> 02:40:22.540
are going so whoever designed the api system right this is a

02:40:22.540 --> 02:40:25.440
system that we have designed now let's suppose you are using

02:40:25.440 --> 02:40:29.280
an api from someone else so for sure even those organization

02:40:29.280 --> 02:40:32.780
or that person will do the same thing and again so here we

02:40:32.780 --> 02:40:36.020
can see like what is the total second or what is the total

02:40:36.020 --> 02:40:41.360
amount of time which it took yeah duration to like this

02:40:41.360 --> 02:40:41.800
result

02:40:45.680 --> 02:40:48.920
sorry where you can see where i can see that one hit how

02:40:48.920 --> 02:40:52.700
many token they consume like they maximum token you have set

02:40:52.700 --> 02:40:55.360
right over here so this is the total number of uh so

02:40:55.360 --> 02:40:57.920
technically this is the input token and this is the output

02:40:57.920 --> 02:41:01.080
token so thousand token consume for this request right

02:41:01.080 --> 02:41:03.400
that's what this one this one this one yeah so here is a

02:41:03.400 --> 02:41:07.400
total like actually it is the sir it is the usage section

02:41:07.400 --> 02:41:10.080
right but where the code is controlled maybe the they have

02:41:10.080 --> 02:41:12.540
updated the logic in the code level as well right yes

02:41:12.540 --> 02:41:17.880
exactly we have updated the logic in a code where you are

02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:23.020
hitting the api yeah and and one more question right suppose

02:41:23.020 --> 02:41:26.240
we are passing we passed in curl command the maximum token

02:41:26.240 --> 02:41:30.220
is thousand right so uh would actually will it go to

02:41:30.220 --> 02:41:33.760
transfer the data at a time or otherwise it can transfer the

02:41:33.760 --> 02:41:38.960
packet by packet in between the server technically what

02:41:38.960 --> 02:41:43.060
happens is that we are you are trying to hit our api and you

02:41:43.060 --> 02:41:46.620
are trying to call our model right by the way you are trying

02:41:46.620 --> 02:41:49.540
to call a model now how model gives a response a model gives

02:41:49.540 --> 02:41:53.040
a response in a chunks right so maybe like a hundred tokens

02:41:53.040 --> 02:41:55.500
then hundred token then hundred token then hundred token so

02:41:55.500 --> 02:41:58.340
in a chunks model will give a response now the response that

02:41:58.340 --> 02:42:01.240
you are able to see so we are trying to accumulate or you

02:42:01.240 --> 02:42:03.640
can say we are trying to concatenate the entire chunk and

02:42:03.640 --> 02:42:06.920
then we are giving you the response but behind the scene

02:42:06.920 --> 02:42:09.760
when you try to hit the api so technically you are hitting

02:42:09.760 --> 02:42:12.820
my function and that function is calling the model right it

02:42:12.820 --> 02:42:14.840
is trying to pass the input and then model is going to give

02:42:14.840 --> 02:42:17.100
the response so model always gives a response in a chunks

02:42:17.100 --> 02:42:21.260
based on the model like a chunks only yeah on a chunks only

02:42:21.260 --> 02:42:24.180
yeah where is the chunking limit actually in the software

02:42:24.180 --> 02:42:28.480
level or i think in the server that depends upon my model as

02:42:28.480 --> 02:42:30.960
well right that depends upon my model plus i can try to

02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:35.760
control it even with the function that i have okay okay and

02:42:35.760 --> 02:42:39.140
is there any idea what is the limit uh of the value of data

02:42:39.140 --> 02:42:43.620
to send from source to server is there any which is the best

02:42:43.620 --> 02:42:46.540
mechanism no no there is no limit is there any best

02:42:46.540 --> 02:42:49.940
mechanism no no no no there is nothing called western

02:42:49.940 --> 02:42:52.860
version there is no limit at all technically it depends upon

02:42:52.860 --> 02:42:58.260
right how i'm writing my system okay yeah but anyhow the

02:42:58.260 --> 02:43:01.140
data has been transferred chunk by chunk right okay yes yes

02:43:01.140 --> 02:43:06.600
okay yeah yeah okay but again that is that is a variable

02:43:06.600 --> 02:43:09.700
what is the chunk size that depends upon me that okay yes

02:43:09.700 --> 02:43:09.700
yeah but again that is that is a variable what is the chunk

02:43:09.700 --> 02:43:14.940
size that depends upon me that can control right and and

02:43:14.940 --> 02:43:17.380
actually we we have heard some different mechanism right

02:43:17.380 --> 02:43:21.460
other than http mechanism is there any other mechanism a

02:43:21.460 --> 02:43:26.280
whip circuit or something the chat solution that you are

02:43:26.280 --> 02:43:29.700
able to see while even on zoom right so we have a chat so

02:43:29.700 --> 02:43:33.520
technically these are the example of a like a bib socket all

02:43:33.520 --> 02:43:39.680
of these are the mulchون may be a GPRC call, so basically

02:43:39.680 --> 02:43:48.250
it's a socket that we are using in a webinar chat. So again,

02:43:48.310 --> 02:43:50.530
this is one of the ways by which we can transfer the data.

02:43:52.250 --> 02:43:56.070
And also MCP as well is kind of the similar one, right? No

02:43:56.070 --> 02:44:01.070
MCP is not the similar one. MCP is basically, it's a kind of

02:44:01.070 --> 02:44:03.590
an agent, so which will be able to take an access of some of

02:44:03.590 --> 02:44:05.990
your system and then it will try to like take a decision

02:44:05.990 --> 02:44:08.850
automatically. That is technically MCP. MCP is not the same.

02:44:10.230 --> 02:44:14.350
Okay, it's not the protocol. Thank you sir. MCP is a

02:44:14.350 --> 02:44:17.950
protocol, but used not just for data transfer, it has been

02:44:17.950 --> 02:44:20.270
used to take the full control of the particular system

02:44:20.270 --> 02:44:25.590
itself. It's also a protocol. It can take that any number of

02:44:25.590 --> 02:44:27.710
multiple machines, right? It can take the control of

02:44:27.710 --> 02:44:31.730
multiple machines or you can say multiple processes or maybe

02:44:32.250 --> 02:44:34.010
you can try to give. You can try to give multiple tool

02:44:34.010 --> 02:44:38.810
access to that MCP, depends what you are creating. Okay,

02:44:38.870 --> 02:44:42.490
yeah, yeah, got it. Okay, thanks. Okay, fine. Manish, please

02:44:42.490 --> 02:44:42.950
share your screen.

02:44:47.680 --> 02:44:53.040
Sharing. Yeah, sharing immediately. Yeah. So Manish, please

02:44:53.040 --> 02:44:57.380
share here. Yeah. So this is the one which I'm facing. So if

02:44:57.380 --> 02:45:01.760
I'm running this. Okay. Yeah, I'm facing this issue and what

02:45:01.760 --> 02:45:04.900
to do here, I don't know exactly. Don't worry. We'll fix it.

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:08.940
Yeah. So what do you want to do? If you are running, oh, we

02:45:08.940 --> 02:45:13.000
probably test. Okay, fine. Remove like terminated. I made

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.180
this one. It's a location issue. So just go into the

02:45:15.180 --> 02:45:20.040
terminate. Yeah. Basically your test.py file is available

02:45:20.040 --> 02:45:22.760
inside the API example. Right. Just do DIR.

02:45:25.880 --> 02:45:31.660
Okay. Yeah. So hit enter. Yes. So basically you have a

02:45:31.660 --> 02:45:34.420
folder called as API underscore example. Now do CD. CD API

02:45:34.420 --> 02:45:40.050
underscore example. You have test file. Yeah. Okay. Okay.

02:45:40.570 --> 02:45:45.970
Just do auto tap. Press tab. Oh, that's what. Obviously.

02:45:46.370 --> 02:45:49.110
Yeah. That was the issue. Now do a DIR. Once again, you will

02:45:49.110 --> 02:45:52.750
see the file. Test file. Yeah. Now we have a test file here.

02:45:52.830 --> 02:45:55.050
Right. In this location. Now run the same thing. It will

02:45:55.050 --> 02:45:55.330
work.

02:45:58.790 --> 02:46:02.750
Yeah. It'll work. See. It's working. . . .

02:46:12.190 --> 02:46:14.250
. .

02:46:19.790 --> 02:46:21.270
. .

02:46:24.950 --> 02:46:28.750
. . . .

02:46:36.150 --> 02:46:42.170
. . . . . .

02:47:04.150 --> 02:47:07.110
That's fine. Now it's working. Thank you so much. Now I'll

02:47:07.110 --> 02:47:11.890
handle everything. Great. Next, Prashant, you can share the

02:47:11.890 --> 02:47:12.110
screen.

02:47:37.650 --> 02:47:41.950
Okay, open AP. So then we can also access from office. Can

02:47:41.950 --> 02:47:46.370
we do that from anywhere? Yes, exactly, you can do it from

02:47:46.370 --> 02:47:48.990
anywhere. So there are no restrictions like firewall? It's

02:47:48.990 --> 02:47:51.030
running in your local, actually. So where does the firewall

02:47:51.030 --> 02:47:53.630
come from? The firewall comes when you hit something

02:47:53.630 --> 02:47:57.330
external. No, if you hit something external, I was asking in

02:47:57.330 --> 02:48:02.170
that case. No, no, no, no, nothing will happen. Okay, okay.

02:48:02.430 --> 02:48:05.630
Thank you. Sir, if you want to hit for the public, it will

02:48:05.630 --> 02:48:08.810
be through that, right? What you just told me. NG Rocks, NG

02:48:08.810 --> 02:48:14.850
Rocks. Not rocks, not rocks on the rocks, NG Rocks. NG

02:48:14.850 --> 02:48:20.350
Rocks, NG Rocks. Sir, I wanted to ask you how to do that.

02:48:20.830 --> 02:48:24.110
You can do the screen share, we'll solve the problem. Okay,

02:48:24.250 --> 02:48:28.610
sir, share the screen. You have permission. We'll do it

02:48:28.610 --> 02:48:32.710
practically. I appreciate it. Jabir, you have a question,

02:48:32.830 --> 02:48:36.130
please go ahead. Yeah, I want to know how to like voice chat

02:48:36.130 --> 02:48:40.790
of the Euro. So voice chat with Yuri, right? Yuri, yeah.

02:48:40.970 --> 02:48:46.950
Okay, so voice chat wise, if you will go inside a Yuri. So

02:48:46.950 --> 02:48:50.910
let me share my screen. Prashant, we are sharing our screen.

02:48:51.290 --> 02:48:57.530
Go ahead. So basically, if you will go here, so you can try

02:48:57.530 --> 02:49:05.190
to click and then you can speak. And then. So, sorry. No, it

02:49:05.190 --> 02:49:08.210
is only for sure. The text. And then send it for. Yeah,

02:49:08.210 --> 02:49:11.390
yeah, yeah. So it's not for a real-time conversation. For

02:49:11.390 --> 02:49:14.510
real-time conversation, we have Avni. See, we have Avni. So

02:49:14.510 --> 02:49:17.150
where you can upload your resume and then you can do a real

02:49:17.150 --> 02:49:20.330
-time conversation. Oh, yeah, yeah. I saw your video.

02:49:20.950 --> 02:49:24.630
Exactly. So Avni is for a real-time conversation and it will

02:49:24.630 --> 02:49:27.530
try to take the interview multiple rounds. Even it will ask

02:49:27.530 --> 02:49:30.130
you to like open up the prompt and then open up the window

02:49:30.130 --> 02:49:32.590
and it will ask you to write a code. So this is where Avni

02:49:32.590 --> 02:49:35.710
comes into picture. And Avni is a pure conversational AI

02:49:35.710 --> 02:49:38.850
speech to speech. And you can speak in any languages. Even

02:49:38.850 --> 02:49:43.110
in English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and then Arabic. Multiple

02:49:43.110 --> 02:49:45.810
languages Avni can understand. So Avni will give you always

02:49:45.810 --> 02:49:49.550
an output in English, but you can give an input in any

02:49:49.550 --> 02:49:53.550
languages. Simple. Just like HR, right? So generally HR

02:49:53.550 --> 02:49:55.770
speaks in English, but the candidate can speak in any

02:49:55.770 --> 02:49:59.130
languages. Just like that. Yeah. So we have. Is this your

02:49:59.130 --> 02:50:04.010
own created or is that someone API? No, no, no. It's our.

02:50:04.010 --> 02:50:07.490
Like we are using our models. We are using API. We have. I'm

02:50:07.490 --> 02:50:10.190
just curious. Yeah. So we have done a lot of engineering

02:50:10.190 --> 02:50:13.070
behind this one. Right. Yeah. And then we have created the

02:50:13.070 --> 02:50:16.430
Avni. The real-time conversation one. This is the great. I

02:50:16.430 --> 02:50:19.450
saw. Yeah. So you can experience it. It will be amazing.

02:50:19.510 --> 02:50:23.350
Like it'll be amazing. Yeah. I did. I a little bit tested

02:50:23.350 --> 02:50:26.690
today. Okay. Sure. Sure. Okay. Thanks. Thank you, sir. Yeah.

02:50:26.750 --> 02:50:30.690
Thanks. Okay. So, uh, Prasad. How I saw. Yeah. Yeah.

02:50:38.330 --> 02:50:41.170
Anyone. Anyone else guys who share the screen? I can make

02:50:41.170 --> 02:50:45.470
you as a panelist first. So Arman. Yes. I have a question

02:50:45.470 --> 02:50:49.610
without sharing my screen. Okay. Fine. Those who just, just

02:50:49.610 --> 02:50:52.150
a minute. Just a minute. Those who would like to share.

02:50:52.490 --> 02:50:56.370
Please like a chat. I'll allow you to share the screen. So,

02:50:56.470 --> 02:51:00.990
uh, please go ahead. So. And you're off. And you're off. My

02:51:00.990 --> 02:51:03.570
log in. I have to log in and then download it. No, no. You

02:51:03.570 --> 02:51:06.290
don't have to log in. Just click on downloads. Click on

02:51:06.290 --> 02:51:14.160
downloads. Click on get ng rock. The last option. Last

02:51:14.160 --> 02:51:19.180
option. Last tab. Last tab. Get ng rock. Okay. Yeah. Get ng

02:51:19.180 --> 02:51:21.220
rock. You'll get it down. Get for free.

02:51:26.030 --> 02:51:31.990
Set download. Okay. Nothing. Simple. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up.

02:51:31.990 --> 02:51:35.090
Click on download. Last option. Last tab. If you don't pay

02:51:35.090 --> 02:51:37.030
attention to the class, that's what happens. We've shown in

02:51:37.030 --> 02:51:38.770
the class. Download. That was the option. Yes. Download.

02:51:38.990 --> 02:51:43.350
Exactly. Done? Yes, sir. Yeah. We've shown this in the class

02:51:43.350 --> 02:51:47.130
too. Sir, that error came. It got skipped. Sir. No problem.

02:51:47.370 --> 02:51:51.510
No problem. It's okay. Okay. So, download is done. Okay.

02:51:51.670 --> 02:51:55.470
Open it up. Yeah. Uh, Anjit.

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:09.900
Uh. Right click. Right click. Right click and then extract.

02:52:11.940 --> 02:52:17.100
So. Uh. Okay. Extract. Extract here.

02:52:21.880 --> 02:52:26.220
Yeah. Hmm. It's done. It's showing below. Extracted. In the

02:52:26.220 --> 02:52:30.220
bottom line. Okay. Now just go to that and download. Go to

02:52:30.220 --> 02:52:34.720
the browser. Go to the file browser and hit cmd. Just. File

02:52:34.720 --> 02:52:37.640
browser. Up. Up. Up. Up. PC, Windows, User, Prashant.

02:52:37.680 --> 02:52:41.780
Download is visible. Go there. Yes. CMD. Type cmd. Type cmd.

02:52:42.900 --> 02:52:45.020
CMD. Yes. So, it will open the command prompt at this

02:52:45.020 --> 02:52:48.040
location. CMD. It will open the command prompt at this

02:52:48.040 --> 02:52:48.440
location. Hit. Hit.

02:52:52.670 --> 02:52:54.690
Just hit it there and the CMD will open the command prompt.

02:52:59.640 --> 02:53:02.200
It's just entering but it's not opening the command prompt.

02:53:02.400 --> 02:53:05.160
So, it's okay. Open it separately. It will open the terminal

02:53:05.160 --> 02:53:09.020
itself but open it separately. What else? From here. By the

02:53:09.020 --> 02:53:11.500
way, it always opens from there. CMD. Yes.

02:53:16.620 --> 02:53:21.560
Hmm. It opened. Prashant downloads. Yes. Okay. Multiple. The

02:53:21.560 --> 02:53:24.600
system is a bit slow. Just close it. Yes. Come back. Now

02:53:24.600 --> 02:53:27.520
from here. Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. you click it OK, here is

02:53:27.520 --> 02:53:40.040
ngROCK, ngROK, rok, space, http, and then space, port number

02:53:40.040 --> 02:53:44.480
Is your app running? Is the app running? Yes sir, it is

02:53:44.480 --> 02:53:47.920
running right now, now it is showing start running ok, it is

02:53:47.920 --> 02:53:53.080
running, ok, it is running OK, leave it, no, no, it's off,

02:53:53.280 --> 02:53:55.180
then run it and leave it again

02:53:58.930 --> 02:54:06.070
simple up arrow and then hit enter up arrow hit enter

02:54:07.630 --> 02:54:16.530
command means uv core and test app up arrow hit enter close

02:54:16.530 --> 02:54:27.930
it and go to command prompt go to cmd port number 8000

02:54:30.870 --> 02:54:41.000
hit your app is global error authentication failed using

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:45.120
required verified account and odd token generally this

02:54:45.120 --> 02:54:51.600
should not be given in local then sign up and put

02:54:51.600 --> 02:54:53.740
authentication token what else your system is having some

02:54:53.740 --> 02:55:00.460
issue in your network sign up means you have to do it there

02:55:00.460 --> 02:55:03.580
in ng rock ng rock you have to sign up in ng rock it gives

02:55:03.580 --> 02:55:07.320
you auth token in line number 1 you have to set auth token

02:55:07.320 --> 02:55:11.510
here first go and sign up quickly

02:55:14.610 --> 02:55:17.330
generally it does not happen but i think your network has

02:55:17.330 --> 02:55:21.450
some issue that is why it is asking maybe you have put vpn

02:55:21.450 --> 02:55:27.530
no google sign up google sign up google sign up yes

02:55:47.080 --> 02:55:50.380
accept create ok yes the

02:56:05.220 --> 02:56:06.940
system is working it is

02:56:21.340 --> 02:56:21.940
working it is working so

02:56:25.130 --> 02:56:29.690
so now what to do here that yes fine just fill anything fill

02:56:29.690 --> 02:56:30.010
anything

02:56:34.160 --> 02:56:34.760
continue

02:56:38.040 --> 02:56:42.220
ok yes it has come up auth token ok so after that this

02:56:42.220 --> 02:56:45.420
second second option left hand side second option your auth

02:56:45.420 --> 02:56:50.440
token yes copy here personal option ok and you don't have to

02:56:50.440 --> 02:56:52.820
do anything just go there is a command here in the upper

02:56:54.200 --> 02:56:58.120
this is the command you have to copy it you have to copy

02:56:58.120 --> 02:57:05.000
this command and here you have to paste but you have to

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.640
remove and put the last auth token yes this remove last part

02:57:08.620 --> 02:57:12.020
your auth token you have to remove this whole yes yes you

02:57:12.020 --> 02:57:14.920
have to remove this whole until dollar and then the auth

02:57:14.920 --> 02:57:16.720
token that has been generated you have to paste it here

02:57:19.910 --> 02:57:25.890
hmm enter ok auth token is saved up up like ng rock again so

02:57:27.240 --> 02:57:29.760
just up arrow up arrow

02:57:38.220 --> 02:57:46.420
now now that will be done so now using this we have to copy

02:57:46.420 --> 02:57:50.460
the whole meaning no no no it is just forwarding to the app

02:57:50.460 --> 02:57:55.000
up to that app and dot ap no local host is your local system

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:59.080
that app up to there this portion this portion yes only that

02:57:59.080 --> 02:57:59.380
portion

02:58:17.700 --> 02:58:22.160
so next Rajeev can share Rajeev and after that Abhishek can

02:58:22.160 --> 02:58:24.540
share the screen yeah so Rajeev please share the screen

02:58:27.900 --> 02:58:30.740
yeah Armaan in between please go ahead with the question you

02:58:30.740 --> 02:58:39.100
can hit anything

02:58:39.100 --> 02:58:43.340
anything means literally anything see whatever you can do in

02:58:43.340 --> 02:58:45.920
terms of programming right so technically you are just

02:58:45.920 --> 02:58:49.300
trying to expose it via an API that's it means you can do

02:58:49.300 --> 02:58:52.380
literally anything API is not having any set of a rule that

02:58:52.380 --> 02:58:52.660
you can't do anything you can't do anything you can't do

02:58:52.660 --> 02:58:53.300
anything you can't do anything you can't do this you can't

02:58:53.300 --> 02:58:56.720
do that whatever you can do in programming simple with the

02:58:56.720 --> 02:58:59.680
help of API you are exposing it to the outer world whether

02:58:59.680 --> 02:59:01.900
it's a data that you are trying to fetch whether it's a

02:59:01.900 --> 02:59:04.540
store that data storage you are trying to do whether it's a

02:59:04.540 --> 02:59:07.100
streaming that you are trying to do whether it's a execution

02:59:07.100 --> 02:59:09.360
of the model or execution of the simple function that you

02:59:09.360 --> 02:59:12.620
are trying to do everything means everything my question

02:59:12.620 --> 02:59:15.940
related to this is right for example I have a database on my

02:59:15.940 --> 02:59:20.140
local system and I want to expose some of my data to other

02:59:20.140 --> 02:59:26.080
users so by using this you can do it obviously you should

02:59:26.080 --> 02:59:28.880
write one function right just write one function the way we

02:59:28.880 --> 02:59:30.960
have written add function right so let's suppose you are

02:59:30.960 --> 02:59:33.580
writing one function now what that function will do so that

02:59:33.580 --> 02:59:38.300
function will try to extract a data from your database so a

02:59:38.300 --> 02:59:41.620
kind of a data or amount of the data that you would like to

02:59:41.620 --> 02:59:45.600
expose simple so there is a function so let's suppose I have

02:59:45.600 --> 02:59:47.780
a employee table now inside the employee table I have a

02:59:47.780 --> 02:59:50.740
multiple column I don't want to showcase like all the

02:59:50.740 --> 02:59:53.920
columns or all the data to maybe like other person so what I

02:59:53.920 --> 02:59:56.680
will do I will just try to write select column name and then

02:59:56.680 --> 02:59:58.940
maybe I can try to put the limit over there that only this

02:59:58.940 --> 03:00:02.220
many records and only two columns not 10 columns so that

03:00:02.220 --> 03:00:05.980
function will try to like a fetch that that main number of

03:00:05.980 --> 03:00:08.580
column only two columns and you are exposing that function

03:00:08.580 --> 03:00:11.840
with the API simple so that whoever will hit the API they

03:00:11.840 --> 03:00:14.500
will be able to see only those two columns so in that

03:00:14.500 --> 03:00:18.880
function we have to define the column under value yes yeah

03:00:18.880 --> 03:00:22.920
yeah so function will return that when sir Next question is,

03:00:22.960 --> 03:00:26.100
for example, I have an API code written in .NET systems,

03:00:26.260 --> 03:00:29.860
right? So, what I have worked is that there we host the API

03:00:29.860 --> 03:00:34.880
by using the IIS. So, for example, if I want to expose that

03:00:34.880 --> 03:00:38.300
data to other users, not locally the client side. So, that

03:00:38.300 --> 03:00:42.220
code I have to convert into fast API and then using ng-rog I

03:00:42.220 --> 03:00:44.220
have to expose it or is there any other way? If it is

03:00:44.220 --> 03:00:46.740
running in your local machine, if something is running in

03:00:46.740 --> 03:00:51.020
your local machine, then we try to use a ng-rog so that I

03:00:51.020 --> 03:00:54.640
can expose it to anyone out there, right? Let's suppose same

03:00:54.640 --> 03:00:57.480
database, same code base that you are talking about, it's

03:00:57.480 --> 03:01:00.580
running on cloud. So, if something is running on cloud, so

03:01:00.580 --> 03:01:03.020
can I say that it's already available over the internet?

03:01:03.620 --> 03:01:06.620
Yes. Your system is not available over the internet, right?

03:01:06.720 --> 03:01:08.880
But if something is running on cloud, cloud is already

03:01:08.880 --> 03:01:12.780
available over the internet. So, in that way, you don't have

03:01:12.780 --> 03:01:15.680
to even use ng-rog. You can just share the public IP address

03:01:15.680 --> 03:01:17.540
or whatever endpoint that you are going to create. And

03:01:17.540 --> 03:01:20.220
people will be able to access it the way we are doing it for

03:01:20.220 --> 03:01:25.020
URI. So, first I have to convert that .NET code into the

03:01:25.020 --> 03:01:29.080
fast API Python, right? No, no, no. So, for .NET, see, no,

03:01:29.100 --> 03:01:33.060
no, no, no, no. .NET is another programming language, right?

03:01:33.160 --> 03:01:36.180
A different programming language. Fast API is a framework,

03:01:36.240 --> 03:01:38.600
not a programming language. Fast API is written in which

03:01:38.600 --> 03:01:44.100
language? Python. Python, right? So, for .NET, let me tell

03:01:44.100 --> 03:01:46.740
you the framework. Even I don't know like what is a

03:01:46.740 --> 03:01:50.680
framework. I never coded in a .NET. I know Java and... So,

03:01:50.680 --> 03:01:51.920
for

03:01:55.050 --> 03:02:01.070
API creation, yeah? So, in .NET, let me see how to create

03:02:01.070 --> 03:02:04.470
the API. Yeah, so I think ASP.NET core is by default giving

03:02:04.470 --> 03:02:07.730
you API creation. Yeah, by default, it is giving you the API

03:02:07.730 --> 03:02:10.610
creation. So, you will be able to create the API without any

03:02:10.610 --> 03:02:13.910
kind of framework. You don't have to use... So, Flask is...

03:02:13.910 --> 03:02:17.510
Sorry, this fast API or Flask that I am trying to say. So,

03:02:17.570 --> 03:02:21.750
basically, this is a framework. Where you can convert your

03:02:21.750 --> 03:02:25.310
Python code as an API. Only for Python code. Let's suppose

03:02:25.310 --> 03:02:27.570
if you are writing into a .NET, right? So, obviously, you

03:02:27.570 --> 03:02:30.890
have to write your function into a .NET. And then you have

03:02:30.890 --> 03:02:33.690
to use a .NET framework or .NET library to convert something

03:02:33.690 --> 03:02:36.550
into an API. If you are writing something into a Java. So,

03:02:36.570 --> 03:02:40.150
Java. So, that... See, API is a neutral entity, right? So,

03:02:40.210 --> 03:02:42.650
whatever native language that you are trying to use, you

03:02:42.650 --> 03:02:46.530
have to use a framework for that native language. What was

03:02:46.530 --> 03:02:49.750
my point? I am still confused. No, sir. I thought I had...

03:02:49.750 --> 03:02:52.070
Basically, different frameworks for different languages. I

03:02:52.070 --> 03:02:56.330
was wondering that when we are using a .NET framework to

03:02:56.330 --> 03:03:00.210
host that API, I want to expose that using Python. So, that

03:03:00.210 --> 03:03:03.170
was my... No, in .NET. So, I can see over here. So, as per

03:03:03.170 --> 03:03:05.690
my search. So, there is something called stum.biv.http,

03:03:05.790 --> 03:03:08.230
which will help you out to get the API. So, it's by default

03:03:08.230 --> 03:03:12.370
inbuilt inside the .NET core. Okay. And, sir, if my database

03:03:12.370 --> 03:03:16.510
is whatever language. For example, MS SQL or SQL Server. So,

03:03:16.650 --> 03:03:19.430
if I want to expose that data using fast API, then I can

03:03:19.430 --> 03:03:21.110
directly... I can directly call that column name for

03:03:21.110 --> 03:03:23.650
whatever data I want, right? You have to write a function in

03:03:23.650 --> 03:03:27.190
Python, technically, right? That function is calling your

03:03:27.190 --> 03:03:30.650
database. So, I believe you know that how we can establish a

03:03:30.650 --> 03:03:32.730
connectivity with the databases, right? Let's suppose if you

03:03:32.730 --> 03:03:35.670
have MySQL. So, obviously, I have to install a SQL driver

03:03:35.670 --> 03:03:39.430
and maybe pip install MySQL driver I have to install. And

03:03:39.430 --> 03:03:41.850
then I have to establish the connection by giving a user ID

03:03:41.850 --> 03:03:44.710
and password. So, that will be the core function which will

03:03:44.710 --> 03:03:48.330
be calling your databases. Okay. Now, you are exposing that

03:03:48.330 --> 03:03:51.350
function as an API, right? So, simple add function example I

03:03:51.350 --> 03:03:54.230
have given to you. Now, here you are trying to pass to input

03:03:54.230 --> 03:03:57.510
A and B. It is trying to give you some return. Yeah. And you

03:03:57.510 --> 03:04:00.430
are trying to expose that add function as an API so that

03:04:00.430 --> 03:04:03.330
anyone can use my add function. Similarly, you will write a

03:04:03.330 --> 03:04:06.350
function. Function is calling your databases and that whole

03:04:06.350 --> 03:04:08.890
function you are exposing to the outer world with the API.

03:04:09.650 --> 03:04:12.930
Okay. So, one last thing. Can I explain the difference

03:04:12.930 --> 03:04:17.010
between the endpoint and that API key? So, endpoint is

03:04:17.010 --> 03:04:19.490
basically the URL. For example, I was running something.

03:04:19.490 --> 03:04:23.270
Localhost and port number and then slash dhanshu slash xyg,

03:04:23.430 --> 03:04:28.190
right? Now, that URL is called as endpoint. Okay. Now, so,

03:04:28.250 --> 03:04:31.630
today the API that we have created. So, it was an exposed

03:04:31.630 --> 03:04:34.890
one. Exposed one means there was no authentication. Means

03:04:34.890 --> 03:04:38.850
anyone can access it. Yeah. But what I will do tomorrow when

03:04:38.850 --> 03:04:41.070
I will show you the example. So, what I will do. So, I will

03:04:41.070 --> 03:04:43.930
try to apply the authentication. Means without a password

03:04:43.930 --> 03:04:46.150
you will not be able to access it. And that is called as API

03:04:46.150 --> 03:04:51.310
key. Okay. Okay. Got it. Today I have created the URL,

03:04:51.410 --> 03:04:54.390
right? So, I have exposed it with the help of ng-rock and

03:04:54.390 --> 03:04:57.950
all of you were able to use it directly, right? But same in

03:04:57.950 --> 03:05:00.670
case of URI API, you will not be able to. Even though you

03:05:00.670 --> 03:05:03.230
have an endpoint, but without API key you will not be able

03:05:03.230 --> 03:05:05.970
to use it. So, basically those APIs are the secured one.

03:05:06.890 --> 03:05:10.150
Okay. So, basically a password. Simple. API key is nothing

03:05:10.150 --> 03:05:12.850
but password. As simple as that. That you are trying to

03:05:12.850 --> 03:05:16.150
access my function with the help of API like that endpoint.

03:05:16.390 --> 03:05:19.410
You are trying to access my function, right? But to access.

03:05:19.410 --> 03:05:21.130
To access my function, you have to give me a password.

03:05:21.250 --> 03:05:23.450
Otherwise, I will not allow you. That is called as

03:05:23.450 --> 03:05:27.750
authentication or key. Okay. All right, sir. Got it? Okay.

03:05:28.110 --> 03:05:35.570
Okay. So, just wait. Yeah. So, Rajiv, share your screen,

03:05:35.670 --> 03:05:39.530
please. And then Mukesh is also saying he would like to

03:05:39.530 --> 03:05:42.690
share his screen. Fine, Mukesh. You can share. Yeah, Rajiv.

03:05:42.710 --> 03:05:44.490
Go ahead. Share your screen. Hello.

03:05:48.010 --> 03:05:51.270
In the between. Just a minute. Okay. Mukesh. Please join as

03:05:51.270 --> 03:05:54.270
a panelist so that you can share your screen. Are you able

03:05:54.270 --> 03:05:58.250
to see my screen, sir? Yes, I can see your screen. Sir, I

03:05:58.250 --> 03:06:05.540
don't know how to output. You will never get the output. I

03:06:05.540 --> 03:06:11.840
mean, I know how to output. I don't know how to output. What

03:06:11.840 --> 03:06:16.040
do you want to do? Sir, I think my Python is not working

03:06:16.040 --> 03:06:19.460
properly. Can you suggest me how to get it back? What do you

03:06:19.460 --> 03:06:22.660
say about this? What do you say about this? Sir. In this

03:06:22.660 --> 03:06:25.860
batch, which you are joining in, we had already uploaded the

03:06:25.860 --> 03:06:30.220
lecture. So I want to say that spend a couple of hours over

03:06:30.220 --> 03:06:32.980
that. We asked you about in the last week also to spend a

03:06:32.980 --> 03:06:36.920
couple of hours on it. You will spend 45-45 minutes with it

03:06:36.920 --> 03:06:39.700
daily. This will get smooth in a week itself. And the

03:06:39.700 --> 03:06:41.780
functions we are talking about and all these are already

03:06:41.780 --> 03:06:45.580
discussed in it. A lot of that means a lot. You will feel so

03:06:45.580 --> 03:06:47.960
comfortable that you will not face any problem from

03:06:47.960 --> 03:06:53.110
anywhere. This is what you should do. You should do it once,

03:06:53.650 --> 03:06:58.030
spend a week and then tell him that the issue will end, if

03:06:58.030 --> 03:07:00.550
there is no issue, then tell him that you are not honestly

03:07:00.550 --> 03:07:03.690
speaking that I had installed Python, but I am not sure that

03:07:03.690 --> 03:07:09.750
what you had told me about Python to add, it has been added

03:07:09.750 --> 03:07:15.290
or not, it has been issued, I see your videos once, once,

03:07:15.330 --> 03:07:18.930
and on top of that, do a little Python lecture, don't

03:07:18.930 --> 03:07:21.270
complete it, I am not suggesting that you should complete it

03:07:21.270 --> 03:07:23.790
completely, but do a little Python lecture from the

03:07:23.790 --> 03:07:27.130
beginning, which is preloaded from the beginning, which we

03:07:27.130 --> 03:07:29.850
have kept preloaded, do that, believe me, you will be

03:07:29.850 --> 03:07:32.270
comfortable, otherwise, that struggle will keep coming again

03:07:32.270 --> 03:07:34.990
and again, you will get stuck again and again, so it is

03:07:34.990 --> 03:07:38.050
better that you complete it in a week, okay, okay, okay,

03:07:38.150 --> 03:07:42.930
thank you, okay, so may I, sir, sir, I have one doubt, sir,

right i have got the meeting id from from the previous class

03:09:03.310 --> 03:09:07.550
i was able to join the previous class because i was able to

03:09:07.550 --> 03:09:10.090
access the link from the dashboard itself but today it is

03:09:10.090 --> 03:09:13.430

03:09:21.290 --> 03:09:25.070
maybe just do one thing so uh connect with a divyanshu or

maybe drop a mail uh by uh maybe you on your mail right so

03:09:29.650 --> 03:09:33.990
we have sent you the uh invoices right so the invoice will

03:09:33.990 --> 03:09:36.470
check from the back end but that is not an issue that is a

03:09:36.470 --> 03:09:39.070
very rare case i mean like no one is facing such kind of

03:09:39.070 --> 03:09:41.890
problem or maybe some issues no uh he is trying to log in

03:09:41.890 --> 03:09:47.510
with different uh exactly yeah because even in my case i had

03:09:47.510 --> 03:09:51.410
issues uh i already involved like uh four five uh like

03:09:51.410 --> 03:09:54.570
months back when you have launched that and then i was

03:09:54.570 --> 03:09:57.990
trying and then it says uh no no you you uh you need to

03:09:57.990 --> 03:10:02.050

mail id that i have registered to and this is with whatever

03:10:05.950 --> 03:10:08.770
with whatever mail id or maybe phone number right maybe you

03:10:08.770 --> 03:10:11.530
have used a phone number at that point of a time uh while

03:10:11.530 --> 03:10:15.630
purchasing the batches just use the exact same id then uh

03:10:15.630 --> 03:10:18.610
like it will work otherwise if you have like logging through

03:10:18.610 --> 03:10:22.290
a mail id and then accessing it through a phone number then

03:10:22.290 --> 03:10:27.110

03:11:20.170 --> 03:11:23.050
should be the issue. I mean, like, uh, otherwise I don't see

03:11:23.050 --> 03:11:26.170

protection, account protection, firewall network protection,

03:13:39.730 --> 03:13:47.090
uh, uh, virus and threat click over there. Okay. Then, uh,

03:13:47.750 --> 03:13:52.870
just a minute in my system. Also, I can check so privacy and

03:13:52.870 --> 03:13:58.590
security, window security, virus and threat protection and,

03:13:58.690 --> 03:14:02.190

and security. Fine.

03:15:07.670 --> 03:15:11.810
Yeah. Just, just do one thing. So directly try to, uh, call,

03:15:12.130 --> 03:15:15.390
but it will go to the same location. Even my system going to

03:15:15.390 --> 03:15:21.030
the same location and virus and threat protection manage

03:15:21.030 --> 03:15:25.250
setting. Okay. Okay. Fine. Got it. Hmm. So go to virus and

03:15:25.250 --> 03:15:28.190
threat protection. Same first one, first option, first

option. Yeah. Now go to manage setting, manage setting,

03:15:32.270 --> 03:15:35.550
manage setting the below one. Yeah. Manage setting now from

03:15:35.550 --> 03:15:38.550
here, turn off. Yeah. Real-time protection off. Dev drive

03:15:38.550 --> 03:15:39.070
protection off.

03:15:45.290 --> 03:15:49.450
Yeah. So switch off. Hmm. So it's off now. Try to download.

03:15:56.800 --> 03:15:59.480
Now it's downloading. Right. That was the only issue. Your

03:15:59.480 --> 03:16:02.840
windows. It was downloaded also, uh, the last time. I mean,

03:16:02.880 --> 03:16:04.720
last minute. Okay. So after download, it's off. It is giving

03:16:04.720 --> 03:16:08.960
you the issue. Okay. Just wait, just wait. We'll see. Well,

03:16:09.040 --> 03:16:13.600
now it's downloaded. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And, uh, from here we

03:16:13.600 --> 03:16:17.660
need to, uh, directly. Yeah. Go inside the same directory.

03:16:19.500 --> 03:16:23.720
It's inside gypsum. You have to unzip it by the way. So

03:16:23.720 --> 03:16:24.040
yeah.

03:16:29.040 --> 03:16:33.220
Extract all down, down, down, down, down. Yeah. Extract all.

03:16:33.280 --> 03:16:33.440
Yes.

03:16:38.070 --> 03:16:41.330
Yeah. Now from here, you have to go to CMD now

03:16:48.980 --> 03:16:54.820
from here. So ng log space, HTTP steps, what number, if your

03:16:54.820 --> 03:16:59.780
program is running, yeah, program is running, it's

03:17:04.160 --> 03:17:06.800
up and running. Yeah. So

03:17:18.360 --> 03:17:21.080
go again inside the directory, not an issue wherever you

03:17:21.080 --> 03:17:22.460
have unzipped it, ng

03:17:28.470 --> 03:17:36.250
log, ROK, space, HTTP, HTTP space, 8,000 port number, not

03:17:36.250 --> 03:17:41.450
calling, not calling the space, space, space. Yeah. Yeah.

03:17:41.450 --> 03:17:44.770
Yeah. It is 8,000 port number, wherever your application is

03:17:44.770 --> 03:17:50.150
running. Yeah. Enter. So you have to add authentication

03:17:50.150 --> 03:17:53.230
token. So again, there is a network issue. So go to ng ROK,

03:17:53.290 --> 03:17:55.310
log in and then add it's

03:18:08.880 --> 03:18:09.800
below. Yeah. Yeah.

03:18:13.340 --> 03:18:20.140
Add it. Enter. I did now execute the same thing.

03:18:26.100 --> 03:18:28.240
It's working now. You, you are able to see that you are

03:18:28.240 --> 03:18:33.100
right. HTTPS. You are the other one. This one. So now this

03:18:33.100 --> 03:18:37.440
URL is. This is equivalent to your localhost 8,000. It will.

03:18:38.280 --> 03:18:38.740
Yeah.

03:18:43.330 --> 03:18:52.520
Visit site. Now it's working. Slash docs so that you can see

03:18:52.520 --> 03:18:57.040
the swagger UI, DOCS. Yeah. Yeah. It's available. Right.

03:18:57.280 --> 03:19:01.760
Yeah. Thank you. Okay. Yeah. Now Abhishek, your screen.

03:19:01.820 --> 03:19:05.360
Yeah. Good afternoon, sir. Abhishek Desai, so I'm from non

03:19:05.360 --> 03:19:08.140
-tech background. Unfortunately, I'm unable to run this

03:19:08.140 --> 03:19:12.860
code. I have installed past API and, uh, you'll be gone, but

03:19:12.860 --> 03:19:18.040
still, uh, the error is occurring. Okay. So terminal, I

03:19:18.040 --> 03:19:20.940
think you opened up the Python terminal directly. Just do

03:19:20.940 --> 03:19:27.640
control C control C. Control C control C. Yeah. Yeah. No, it

03:19:27.640 --> 03:19:31.560
is not working. No, no, it will. Hey, just a minute.

03:19:35.300 --> 03:19:38.380
Give me control. I can take control from here. Give me

03:19:38.380 --> 03:19:39.600
control. Okay.

03:19:42.270 --> 03:19:47.610
Yeah. So I did. I have a control of your screen. So just

03:19:47.610 --> 03:19:52.250
delete this one, delete this one, delete this one, delete

03:19:52.250 --> 03:20:00.610
this one. Let me make it bigger for me. Yeah. And, uh, here,

03:20:00.750 --> 03:20:05.470
so basically you have form fast API, fast API, add dot run.

03:20:05.670 --> 03:20:12.930
Okay, fine. So it's available. AI, DIR inside that you have

03:20:12.930 --> 03:20:16.330
a folder. It's called as API. So basically here you have,

03:20:16.410 --> 03:20:24.040
uh, so let me do, let me do DIR. So see here, you have API

03:20:24.040 --> 03:20:27.760
dot PI file, right? So inside of this, if I have to execute

03:20:27.760 --> 03:20:31.500
this Python file, just as a Python file. So Python API dot

03:20:31.500 --> 03:20:34.560
PI, and it will be executed as a Python file. So basically,

03:20:34.640 --> 03:20:38.100
uh, you have not saved it. So control S all the time you

03:20:38.100 --> 03:20:41.720
have to do, and now you will see the output seven, right? So

03:20:41.720 --> 03:20:44.520
three plus four is equal to seven. Now, if you have. I have

03:20:44.520 --> 03:20:50.120
to convert this as a API. So at the rate app dot get, and

03:20:50.120 --> 03:20:53.960
then you can try to pass the route over here. So maybe your

03:20:53.960 --> 03:20:56.840
name is Abhishek, right? So I'm giving a name. It's a S H E

03:20:56.840 --> 03:20:59.560
K. I will shake as a route. I will say it's less. Let's

03:20:59.560 --> 03:21:02.200
suppose I will say it's add a method as a route. I'm going

03:21:02.200 --> 03:21:05.320
to give now, if I have to execute this one, so how I can

03:21:05.320 --> 03:21:08.740
execute it. So for that UV corn, you have already installed

03:21:08.740 --> 03:21:11.460
the UV corn, right? Yes. Yes. Okay, fine then. So you will

03:21:11.460 --> 03:21:14.840
call and then what is the file name? So file name is API. So

03:21:14.840 --> 03:21:21.200
API, so, and hyphen, sorry, hyphen app. Yeah. Uh, yes. And I

03:21:21.200 --> 03:21:24.100
can try to hit enter. So now it will become the API and it

03:21:24.100 --> 03:21:29.780
will open running. See my API is up 1 27.0.0.1. Now you can

03:21:29.780 --> 03:21:32.000
open up your Google Chrome and then like the way we were

03:21:32.000 --> 03:21:34.100
trying to do a testing. We can do a testing in the same way,

03:21:34.160 --> 03:21:37.660
but yeah, now it's exposed. Okay. Thank you so much. I'll do

03:21:37.660 --> 03:21:40.240
the remaining thing. Yeah. And if you get a stuck, let me

03:21:40.240 --> 03:21:43.900
know. I can like, thank you so much again. Thanks. Yeah.

03:21:44.440 --> 03:21:47.380
Pravath, you can share the screen in between. So in between,

03:21:47.620 --> 03:21:51.320
I can ask, I'm Naresh. Hi, yeah, please go ahead. Uh, yeah,

03:21:51.420 --> 03:21:55.160
so basically I have a question on Euro platform. Okay. So,

03:21:55.160 --> 03:22:00.220
uh, the one, uh, Euro API you are giving and as well as Euro

03:22:00.220 --> 03:22:03.160
chart, uh, chart interface, you are giving. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

03:22:03.160 --> 03:22:07.340
Yeah. So chart interface, if I do anything, it won't, uh,

03:22:07.460 --> 03:22:11.180
deduct my, uh, API token count. Not at all. Not at all. So

03:22:11.180 --> 03:22:13.700
it is completely independent. Yeah. Completely independent.

03:22:13.800 --> 03:22:14.900
That's the reason. So we have to do it. We have kept both

03:22:14.900 --> 03:22:18.940
the system like, uh, separate, right? So your API token, we

03:22:18.940 --> 03:22:21.220
used to showcase and for chat, you have a different quota.

03:22:21.480 --> 03:22:23.980
So that one lack token limit that we are saying, right? So

03:22:23.980 --> 03:22:28.840
that you will not consume in a chat. Okay. And my second

03:22:28.840 --> 03:22:34.040
question, uh, see, I, I have, uh, I am from actually a

03:22:34.040 --> 03:22:38.880
different node JS programming background. Okay. Uh, so I'm

03:22:38.880 --> 03:22:44.100
trying to build a voice system. So basically I have done. I

03:22:44.100 --> 03:22:46.460
have done a voice system, uh, using the, you know, browser,

03:22:46.580 --> 03:22:50.600
uh, speech recognition and the browser, uh, text to speech.

03:22:50.640 --> 03:22:54.040
So which is working fine only problem I am facing. It is not

03:22:54.040 --> 03:22:56.940
real time because, uh, when you are speaking your text to

03:22:56.940 --> 03:22:59.760
speech, you have to, uh, you know, stop all this, uh, uh,

03:22:59.760 --> 03:23:03.220
configurations I'm not able to do, uh, because basically it

03:23:03.220 --> 03:23:06.900
is not a full duplex voice integration. Right. So I am

03:23:06.900 --> 03:23:10.420
wondering now, Avani, what is the tech stack you have been

03:23:10.420 --> 03:23:13.280
used to achieve this and, uh, you know, stream the audio

03:23:13.280 --> 03:23:17.160
chunks. Yeah. So basically see what we are doing. So chunk

03:23:17.160 --> 03:23:20.500
by chunk, it looks like that it's streaming, right. But what

03:23:20.500 --> 03:23:23.440
we have done from a backend, so we have basically broken

03:23:23.440 --> 03:23:26.260
down each and every chunk, and then we are trying to

03:23:26.260 --> 03:23:29.320
concatenate it in a real time. Then we are sending it to the

03:23:29.320 --> 03:23:31.660
model. Then model is giving us back. Then again, we are

03:23:31.660 --> 03:23:35.440
trying to convert it and we are doing it. So like a fast and

03:23:35.440 --> 03:23:38.240
a smooth way that looks like a real time and it is able to

03:23:38.240 --> 03:23:42.380
even understand one hour of chat. So it's like a core

03:23:42.380 --> 03:23:44.460
engineering that we have done. Tech stack wise. It's just a

03:23:44.460 --> 03:23:47.440
simple node. Just that we are using a text to speech, like,

03:23:47.500 --> 03:23:51.360
uh, models we are trying to use and a couple of APIs. We are

03:23:51.360 --> 03:23:54.680
trying to use it, but it's a core engineering that we have

03:23:54.680 --> 03:23:58.560
done from our side. So, uh, let me correct if I'm not wrong,

03:23:58.640 --> 03:24:03.100
you are not using, uh, any, uh, frameworks like a live kit

03:24:03.100 --> 03:24:07.220
or pipe cat. No, no, no. We are trying to like take your

03:24:07.220 --> 03:24:09.120
input. We are trying to break it down into a small, small

03:24:09.120 --> 03:24:11.580
pieces with technically a small, small chunks. We are

03:24:11.580 --> 03:24:14.560
sending those input to the model. So that model will be able

03:24:14.560 --> 03:24:17.280
to understand the syntax sentiment, uh, that you are trying

03:24:17.280 --> 03:24:20.960
to showcase inside that one. And again, accordingly, like it

03:24:20.960 --> 03:24:22.920
is giving us a response. So again, it is giving us a

03:24:22.920 --> 03:24:25.800
response to a text we are converting into a speech. Okay.

03:24:26.060 --> 03:24:30.500
And my last question, uh, so, uh, this is like coming to a

03:24:30.500 --> 03:24:33.620
pricing, uh, pattern of, uh, you know, real time, why says,

03:24:33.720 --> 03:24:37.520
so I haven't tried a live kit with, uh, you know, deep

03:24:37.520 --> 03:24:41.800
Chrome, uh, deep Chrome API or Google text to speech. You

03:24:41.800 --> 03:24:45.700
know, everything is like a burning money. If you calculate.

03:24:46.320 --> 03:24:48.720
Exactly. That's the reason. So, and again, we are like

03:24:48.720 --> 03:24:50.920
giving it something for a very, very affordable price,

03:24:51.020 --> 03:24:54.440
right? So people like us can't integrate those direct APIs,

03:24:54.620 --> 03:24:58.400
uh, it will create an overhead because again, API is fine,

03:24:58.600 --> 03:25:01.360
but you have to host a system on your platform, on your

03:25:01.360 --> 03:25:04.920
server, right? So again, server cost, API cost, DB cost, a

03:25:04.920 --> 03:25:07.500
lot of things, uh, falls into a picture. That's the reason.

03:25:07.620 --> 03:25:10.920
So we have designed our own optimized solution. Yeah. Uh,

03:25:11.000 --> 03:25:13.880
the. That's it. So that's it. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks. Okay.

03:25:13.920 --> 03:25:17.840
So, uh, Prabhat, you are setting your screen. No, I don't

03:25:17.840 --> 03:25:21.260
think so. Ramesh, you have a question. Please go ahead. Hi,

03:25:21.260 --> 03:25:24.260
Susan. So I have a question. Yeah. Please go ahead. Uh, sir,

03:25:24.340 --> 03:25:26.940
I have the cup. I have the couple of questions, sir. In my

03:25:26.940 --> 03:25:30.400
process, uh, we have the 10 K records from the multiple

03:25:30.400 --> 03:25:35.380
page. Right. Uh, so we used the Python code to get the, to

03:25:35.380 --> 03:25:39.420
get the AP one by one. So in this case, uh, when the

03:25:39.420 --> 03:25:41.760
message, right. Uh, when we extract the power of thousand

03:25:41.760 --> 03:25:45.700
rows, every time we start the thousand rows, but, uh, it is,

03:25:45.820 --> 03:25:49.520
uh, coming, you know, uh, by the memory, I think when we run

03:25:49.520 --> 03:25:55.680
the, when we process the Python code, it is on the Python

03:25:55.680 --> 03:26:00.280
memory, but after 10 call, right after 10 call, it can, uh,

03:26:00.760 --> 03:26:04.860
uh, concatenate all the response. Then finally we can store

03:26:04.860 --> 03:26:09.240
the data into storage location. Yes. So, yeah. So my

03:26:09.240 --> 03:26:12.200
question is that. Is there any efficient way to avoid this

03:26:12.200 --> 03:26:15.860
sequence process according to your experience? So basically

03:26:15.860 --> 03:26:17.900
you are trying to say that you don't want to like hold

03:26:17.900 --> 03:26:21.120
something into our memory, uh, basically Ram, right? So you,

03:26:21.160 --> 03:26:24.040
you were trying to reduce the consumption of your Ram. This

03:26:24.040 --> 03:26:28.360
is what you're saying. No, no. What is, what is my

03:26:28.360 --> 03:26:32.260
expectation right now? Uh, we have the 10 K rows, right?

03:26:32.320 --> 03:26:36.920
From the API. It is extracting, uh, for every API call, it

03:26:36.920 --> 03:26:40.740
is extracting the thousand rows, one K rows. So overall it

03:26:40.740 --> 03:26:45.580
is, uh, taking the 10 calls. So, but right now it runs in

03:26:45.580 --> 03:26:49.360
the sequential patient, but is there any way, will there be

03:26:49.360 --> 03:26:53.760
any way to run in parallel and we can consume as soon as

03:26:53.760 --> 03:26:57.880
possible? That's Run it in parallel and you can consume it

03:26:57.880 --> 03:27:00.520
as soon as possible. So in that case, Within the one table,

03:27:00.640 --> 03:27:04.720
within the one table. Yeah. So basically if you have to like

03:27:04.720 --> 03:27:08.260
run it in a real time, so just use some messaging system,

03:27:08.260 --> 03:27:12.000
for example, Kafka or Kinesis. So Kafka is one of the best,

03:27:12.020 --> 03:27:14.600
I would say if you would like to consume it in a real time.

03:27:16.120 --> 03:27:19.920
So just try to use Kafka. Yes. Kafka. Kafka is one of the

03:27:19.920 --> 03:27:23.040
best ones. Yeah. Actually. Yeah. They're using Kafka only.

03:27:23.100 --> 03:27:27.740
Topic only. They extract the data. Inside the topics. Yes.

03:27:30.360 --> 03:27:34.000
So the topic, yeah, we are hitting the topics to extract the

03:27:34.000 --> 03:27:37.960
API only. So my, my question is that why don't, why don't,

03:27:37.960 --> 03:27:39.600
why don't, why don't, why don't you run in sequential? Is

03:27:39.600 --> 03:27:42.280
there any easiest way to extract the data in parallel

03:27:42.280 --> 03:27:46.240
patient? Because everything is in the one web page, for

03:27:46.240 --> 03:27:50.320
example, so let us say one Facebook, right? Facebook, the

03:27:50.320 --> 03:27:53.600
people will post the comment or something. It might be in

03:27:53.600 --> 03:27:56.980
behind, there is some problem related with the API. There

03:27:56.980 --> 03:27:59.160
are a thousand rows or two thousand rows, two thousand

03:27:59.160 --> 03:28:03.100
people can respond to something. So when we extract the data

03:28:03.100 --> 03:28:07.860
from there, right? Maybe is there any way to hit the API in

03:28:07.860 --> 03:28:10.720
parallel? In a parallel manner and we can extract the API

03:28:10.720 --> 03:28:15.660
message. Is it possible? Yeah. So call like a thread over

03:28:15.660 --> 03:28:23.560
there then, in parallel. Yes. Yeah. But yeah, what is the

03:28:23.560 --> 03:28:26.480
current system means if we run this one by one as well, we

03:28:26.480 --> 03:28:29.940
sometime we'll get the connection timeout issue. So are we

03:28:29.940 --> 03:28:33.220
going to proceed with the parallel process and is that

03:28:33.220 --> 03:28:37.260
efficient? Yeah. Go with the parallel processing then. In a,

03:28:37.280 --> 03:28:39.320
in a Python or something. Maybe, you know, some other

03:28:39.320 --> 03:28:41.920
different languages, but it's still, I'm not able to

03:28:41.920 --> 03:28:43.940
understand the whole holistic picture that you're trying to

03:28:43.940 --> 03:28:47.860
explain because see the timeout issue, you can handle it in

03:28:47.860 --> 03:28:50.220
multiple ways. So that is one question. Then you are saying

03:28:50.220 --> 03:28:54.720
that like, I don't want to save into a main memory. So maybe

03:28:54.720 --> 03:28:57.140
how I can avoid that. That is a separate question. No, no,

03:28:57.140 --> 03:29:00.020
no, no. I am. That is not my question. Exactly. Main memory

03:29:00.020 --> 03:29:05.080
or that is a different story. My exact question is that we

03:29:05.080 --> 03:29:08.460
have one database per one topic. We have the 10k row. So

03:29:08.460 --> 03:29:12.160
over there right now in our existing process, we are

03:29:12.160 --> 03:29:16.480
extracting per every one k rows. So we are getting the 10k,

03:29:16.560 --> 03:29:20.680
10 APA call, it will be run in sequential. So what, what

03:29:20.680 --> 03:29:24.680
would I expectation? Is there any best approach to extract

03:29:24.680 --> 03:29:27.720
the message in parallel and concatenate quickly? Yeah. You

03:29:27.720 --> 03:29:29.460
can, you can do that. So anyhow, you are storing everything

03:29:29.460 --> 03:29:32.300
into our topics, right? So you can try to connect with the

03:29:32.300 --> 03:29:34.220
multiple connectors. So basically there will be 10

03:29:34.220 --> 03:29:37.500
connectors or maybe in a 10 parallel connectors and 10 panel

03:29:37.500 --> 03:29:39.140
connector will try to read from the different different

03:29:39.140 --> 03:29:42.980
offset because inside the topic topic name, right inside the

03:29:42.980 --> 03:29:45.700
topic, technically there will be a partitions, right? So

03:29:45.700 --> 03:29:48.200
from a partitions, you are trying to read something or like

03:29:48.200 --> 03:29:50.140
you are trying to give a offset that, okay, fine. So from

03:29:50.140 --> 03:29:53.080
this like a place to this place, read the data, try to

03:29:53.080 --> 03:29:55.200
create the 10 connectors parallelly because Kafka supports

03:29:55.200 --> 03:29:57.440
multiple connector at a time, even for the single topics.

03:29:59.320 --> 03:30:02.260
Right. Yeah. For the connector setup, is there anything do

03:30:02.260 --> 03:30:05.480
we need to configure from their side or no, nothing.

03:30:05.600 --> 03:30:10.760
Connector means it's a topic, right? Yeah. So we have to

03:30:10.760 --> 03:30:12.740
give a topics and then you have to give basically an offset

03:30:12.740 --> 03:30:15.260
that, okay, fine. So from this to this, only try to give me

03:30:15.260 --> 03:30:18.160
the data. So one connector will read maybe from like a zero

03:30:18.160 --> 03:30:20.420
to a hundred record. Then second connector, a hundred, one

03:30:20.420 --> 03:30:23.460
to like 200, third connector, 200, one to 300. So in this

03:30:23.460 --> 03:30:26.060
way you can configure over there so that it will do the

03:30:26.060 --> 03:30:28.960
panel and it will not like read the same data. It will read

03:30:28.960 --> 03:30:33.000
the different, different data. Yeah. Yeah. I agree with this

03:30:33.000 --> 03:30:35.940
approach, but where is the connector set up? Maybe there any

03:30:35.940 --> 03:30:39.220
code level. So basically a piece of Python connector is not

03:30:39.220 --> 03:30:41.660
a setup by the way, it's a piece of Python code, right? So

03:30:41.660 --> 03:30:44.740
where you install the Kafka driver and then inside a Kafka

03:30:44.740 --> 03:30:47.200
driver, you will be able to get a function called as Kafka

03:30:47.200 --> 03:30:49.700
connector. So you just like call that function. That's it.

03:30:49.840 --> 03:30:54.540
This is basically like a one line of a code. Okay. But is

03:30:54.540 --> 03:30:58.880
there any limitations for this connection? No, not at all.

03:30:58.980 --> 03:31:01.660
So Kafka never like give that kind of limitation. Yeah. If

03:31:01.660 --> 03:31:03.780
you have, your admin has given some sort of a restriction,

03:31:04.060 --> 03:31:06.640
that's a different issue. Okay. So whoever is managing the

03:31:06.640 --> 03:31:08.860
Kafka, because someone will be, someone must be managing

03:31:08.860 --> 03:31:11.600
your Kafka cluster, right? Someone has already done the

03:31:11.600 --> 03:31:14.400
setup of Kafka cluster and someone must be managing that

03:31:14.400 --> 03:31:17.620
Kafka cluster, right? There must be some admin. So if they

03:31:17.620 --> 03:31:20.340
have not given any kind of a restriction, then it will not

03:31:20.340 --> 03:31:22.940
like give you a restriction. We can do the n number of

03:31:22.940 --> 03:31:25.580
calls. You are just consuming it, right? You are just a

03:31:25.580 --> 03:31:28.740
consumer side of it. So you are not like controlling the

03:31:28.740 --> 03:31:31.080
Kafka, basically you are just consuming it. So it will not

03:31:31.080 --> 03:31:34.960
give you an issue. Yeah. Yeah. My same question is there,

03:31:35.040 --> 03:31:37.580
for example, in the live application, right, Uber or

03:31:37.580 --> 03:31:41.840
something, we are getting the multiple API call from the

03:31:41.840 --> 03:31:45.260
different region, right? So as per my understanding, are

03:31:45.260 --> 03:31:48.060
they using some load balancer or something, they're coasting

03:31:48.060 --> 03:31:51.480
the website at the multiple server, that should be okay. But

03:31:51.480 --> 03:31:54.780
in my current use case, it is depending on the particular

03:31:54.780 --> 03:31:59.140
topic, right? The topic has the multiple data. I wanted to

03:31:59.140 --> 03:32:01.900
make it parallel, that is a challenge. So what is the

03:32:01.900 --> 03:32:06.420
challenges I'm facing? When we hit that one by one as well,

03:32:06.480 --> 03:32:10.160
even though sometimes we may get the connection time out

03:32:10.160 --> 03:32:14.240
issue. So if we go with parallel also, it is also most

03:32:14.240 --> 03:32:17.000
possible, right, to get the connection time out issue.

03:32:17.240 --> 03:32:21.020
Otherwise, just do one thing. So whenever you are trying to

03:32:21.020 --> 03:32:24.200
consume it, write it inside the Spark, basically don't use a

03:32:24.200 --> 03:32:28.380
plain Python, write it inside the Spark and then host it on

03:32:28.380 --> 03:32:30.760
a distributed system. So basically not a standalone system,

03:32:30.900 --> 03:32:33.460
not one single system. Host it on a distributed system. So

03:32:33.460 --> 03:32:37.970
even in that way, it will be very, very fast. So distributed

03:32:37.970 --> 03:32:41.650
system, meaning from source or JSON? No, no, distributed

03:32:41.650 --> 03:32:44.210
system is like your cluster, your server, your server,

03:32:44.290 --> 03:32:45.970
basically like the hardware that you're trying to use,

03:32:46.030 --> 03:32:48.570
right? Because the rest of the things will be managed by

03:32:48.570 --> 03:32:53.350
Spark itself. The parallelism that we're talking about,

03:32:53.410 --> 03:32:55.290
right? So that will be managed by framework itself. So you

03:32:55.290 --> 03:32:57.170
don't have to even manage anything in that way and your

03:32:57.170 --> 03:33:02.180
process will be way more faster. Correct, sir. But anyhow,

03:33:02.280 --> 03:33:05.980
the Spark as well. It can consume the data from API. Right.

03:33:05.980 --> 03:33:08.920
From different servers and putting memory and process in it.

03:33:09.160 --> 03:33:14.900
From anywhere it can consume. Okay. So I think, so, okay, if

03:33:14.900 --> 03:33:17.580
you go with the, if you go with this Spark and can we

03:33:17.580 --> 03:33:19.460
eliminate it? That is another option that you have.

03:33:19.600 --> 03:33:22.260
Distributed. Yeah. Distributed system. So that is another

03:33:22.260 --> 03:33:25.620
option to make your process faster. That is like a best,

03:33:25.660 --> 03:33:30.380
another best option you can say. Okay. But, but that's why I

03:33:30.380 --> 03:33:32.620
know, why do we use the Python, it is running single

03:33:32.620 --> 03:33:35.580
machine. So there are some connection out. That might be the

03:33:35.580 --> 03:33:38.140
reason. Yeah. Because Python runs on a single thread right

03:33:38.140 --> 03:33:42.300
at a time. So it will take its own sweet time to call the

03:33:42.300 --> 03:33:45.380
data. Okay, sir. Okay, sir. And one more final question.

03:33:45.560 --> 03:33:49.780
Right. We, you teach, you know, you, you talked about the

03:33:49.780 --> 03:33:54.560
fast API. So what is the real, no real time environment,

03:33:54.800 --> 03:33:57.660
right? Which tool we are prepared for the API related

03:33:57.660 --> 03:34:00.820
project. We have many tools, right? In case of Python, so it

03:34:00.820 --> 03:34:03.440
will be fast API. Fast API is one of the best, one of the

03:34:03.440 --> 03:34:06.800
best table. Python is one of the best. Yeah. There are such

03:34:06.800 --> 03:34:12.460
a tool, right? Django, Plask. Django is basically a web

03:34:12.460 --> 03:34:14.420
framework. So if you have to create a front end, back end,

03:34:14.460 --> 03:34:16.020
all those things, you can go ahead with the Django. But

03:34:16.020 --> 03:34:20.360
again, it's too old. Flask, flask is not a production ready

03:34:20.360 --> 03:34:23.160
framework. Flask is just experimental framework. The

03:34:23.160 --> 03:34:25.760
production ready framework is technically a fast API that we

03:34:25.760 --> 03:34:30.680
are discussing now. Okay. Fast API only. And streamlet also

03:34:30.680 --> 03:34:33.160
is not a, can I use the streamlet? Streamlet is not for API.

03:34:33.320 --> 03:34:34.640
Streamlet is for a user. Streamlet is for UI basically.

03:34:34.860 --> 03:34:39.640
Streamlet is not used for API. API. Okay. Fast API. Can we

03:34:39.640 --> 03:34:42.260
go with the fast API? You can go with the fast API.

03:34:42.380 --> 03:34:45.760
Streamlet I will be using, but for UI interface, not for API

03:34:45.760 --> 03:34:50.000
creation. You can't use a streamlet for API creation. Okay.

03:34:50.100 --> 03:34:54.720
So Node.js also. Node.js is basically a JavaScript based

03:34:54.720 --> 03:34:56.760
framework, not a Python. It's a different framework itself.

03:34:57.140 --> 03:35:01.980
Different language based. JavaScript based framework. Okay.

03:35:02.000 --> 03:35:05.380
Okay. Thank you, sir. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks. Yeah. Hi Sudha.

03:35:05.440 --> 03:35:08.080
Okay. Yeah. So just a minute. So Prabhat, I think you are

03:35:08.080 --> 03:35:09.680
not sharing your screen. Please share your screen so that I

03:35:09.680 --> 03:35:13.060
can see. I don't have a like screen-sharing related issues.

03:35:13.160 --> 03:35:17.100
I just have some career related career. It's my first class.

03:35:17.300 --> 03:35:21.860
Okay. Okay. So actually my question is mostly like I have

03:35:21.860 --> 03:35:24.260
eight years of experience right now. I already gone through

03:35:24.260 --> 03:35:26.480
the recording and you already told that deep learning

03:35:26.480 --> 03:35:31.620
concepts and NLP concepts you are already teaching. Like.

03:35:31.620 --> 03:35:35.840
But like in the interview perspective, I want to ask if they

03:35:35.840 --> 03:35:39.620
like are going to ask like specifically dedicated NLP like

03:35:39.620 --> 03:35:44.680
more than it is taught in this particular bootcamp or how it

03:35:44.680 --> 03:35:46.780
will be. In this bootcamp, first of all, I'm not teaching

03:35:46.780 --> 03:35:51.800
NLP by the way. I have taught NLP in my previous bootcamp.

03:35:51.940 --> 03:35:54.540
In this bootcamp, please look through those syllabus. There

03:35:54.540 --> 03:35:58.560
is no NLP. Yes. If someone would like to learn NLP. So for

03:35:58.560 --> 03:36:01.040
that recorded lectures are available from the previous

03:36:01.040 --> 03:36:05.120
classes. So you can go through it in this entire bootcamp.

03:36:05.220 --> 03:36:09.440
So I'm dedicating just towards a core generative AI. Core.

03:36:09.700 --> 03:36:12.680
Right. Obviously, like in some of the interview, I do agree

03:36:12.680 --> 03:36:15.220
that people will ask you even a statistics. People will even

03:36:15.220 --> 03:36:17.120
ask for the machine learning question. Couple of questions.

03:36:17.300 --> 03:36:20.720
Right. People will ask like a lot from the generative AI.

03:36:20.860 --> 03:36:23.360
Now, if you are going to prepare for such kind of an

03:36:23.360 --> 03:36:26.680
interview, then you have to watch my other lectures and then

03:36:26.680 --> 03:36:29.340
come to the class. Come to the class and watch other

03:36:29.340 --> 03:36:34.100
lectures parallel. Yes. I got you. But like the, like I'm

03:36:34.100 --> 03:36:37.200
completely planning to transition to generative AI. So I saw

03:36:37.200 --> 03:36:42.180
your roadmap. So it has a Python statistic NLP. Yeah. So

03:36:42.180 --> 03:36:44.580
that, that roadmap, which I have given that roadmap that I

03:36:44.580 --> 03:36:47.720
have created. So basically that is a year long roadmap that,

03:36:47.740 --> 03:36:50.300
okay. So if someone is trying to start from the scratch,

03:36:50.540 --> 03:36:53.320
right. Let's suppose I'm completely new to the data industry

03:36:53.320 --> 03:36:56.320
and I don't even know like programming or anything. So in

03:36:56.320 --> 03:36:58.660
that case, okay. So follow the sequence. So first I have

03:36:58.660 --> 03:37:00.560
given Python. Then I have given a statistics. Then I have

03:37:00.560 --> 03:37:03.200
given basically a NLP. Then I have given basically a

03:37:03.200 --> 03:37:05.840
generative AI. Then I have given a MCP. Then I have given a

03:37:05.840 --> 03:37:08.500
RAG. All those things I have given in a sequence over there.

03:37:08.720 --> 03:37:12.500
That, okay. So in this way you will be pro. But let's

03:37:12.500 --> 03:37:17.340
suppose I know some of the Python. I know a basic of NLP. I

03:37:17.340 --> 03:37:19.140
know a little bit of machine learning as well. One or two

03:37:19.140 --> 03:37:22.360
algorithm maybe. Right. Some, I know stats. Now I have to

03:37:22.360 --> 03:37:25.180
get into a core generative AI industry. Now for that, this

03:37:25.180 --> 03:37:28.440
is the bootcamp. So for interview, it will be sufficient or

03:37:28.440 --> 03:37:29.120
like, I, you know, I have to get into a core generative AI

03:37:29.120 --> 03:37:31.480
industry. If I have time, so I can go to NLP. If you have

03:37:31.480 --> 03:37:35.720
time, if you have time, then go through this. NLP. Yeah. But

03:37:35.720 --> 03:37:39.280
without this also, I can attend the interviews. Without that

03:37:39.280 --> 03:37:41.580
also you can attend the interview, but in some of the

03:37:41.580 --> 03:37:43.980
interview, maybe you will get stuck because they will ask

03:37:43.980 --> 03:37:46.320
some transformer related question. They will ask, maybe

03:37:46.320 --> 03:37:50.880
explain the architecture of a GPT, which I am not going to

03:37:50.880 --> 03:37:53.180
discuss in this lecture, which I have already discussed in

03:37:53.180 --> 03:37:56.460
those lectures. So okay. And deep learning is not required.

03:37:56.760 --> 03:37:59.600
As it is not in the rules. NLP. If you are going through. So

03:37:59.600 --> 03:38:01.560
by default, deep learning is all about neural network. So

03:38:01.560 --> 03:38:04.700
anyhow, you will be learning a neural network, but actually

03:38:04.700 --> 03:38:07.440
story starts from deep learning. You can say the, like

03:38:07.440 --> 03:38:09.600
whatever we do, even inside the NLP, right. Whatever

03:38:09.600 --> 03:38:11.720
algorithm that we are going to learn, whether it's RNN,

03:38:11.720 --> 03:38:16.240
LSTM, GRU, transformer or anything, right. It's a

03:38:16.240 --> 03:38:18.860
technically neural network. And that story starts from your

03:38:18.860 --> 03:38:23.320
deep learning. So after doing Python, I can directly do NLP

03:38:23.320 --> 03:38:27.700
in that case, like ask for your roadmap. Just follow the

03:38:27.700 --> 03:38:30.560
roadmap. Because that would allow I given for anyone who

03:38:30.560 --> 03:38:33.860
would like to become a pro and they have a time. Yes. I am

03:38:33.860 --> 03:38:37.040
taking a year to a year time for transition. So mostly, so I

03:38:37.040 --> 03:38:40.800
think I'm wanting to follow all your roadmap. So back

03:38:40.800 --> 03:38:43.360
propagate, mostly I will do the JNA, then I will pray back

03:38:43.360 --> 03:38:47.860
to the concepts. And another thing I already have some JNA

03:38:47.860 --> 03:38:50.040
experience. I'm already doing currently projects on my

03:38:50.040 --> 03:38:53.740
current company. So the thing is I am wanting to learn LLM

03:38:53.740 --> 03:38:57.960
ops mostly. So do it require Docker and Kubernetes. Okay.

03:38:57.980 --> 03:39:00.380
And this is the first knowledge to Ops, wherever Ops comes

03:39:00.380 --> 03:39:02.840
into a picture, Docker, Kubernetes comes into a picture and

03:39:02.840 --> 03:39:06.280
we have an LLM ops course as well. So if you go and search,

03:39:06.380 --> 03:39:08.740
so that course has been delivered by Bappy, one of the

03:39:08.740 --> 03:39:11.540
finest mentor, right. Even MLOps has been delivered by him

03:39:11.540 --> 03:39:15.320
one person and one person I'm trying to like, I'm still

03:39:15.320 --> 03:39:17.280
planning. I have already launched it, but I was not able to

03:39:17.280 --> 03:39:20.360
do a recording. So MLOps, LLM ops, both the courses are

03:39:20.360 --> 03:39:23.460
already available and whatever is required, it's already

03:39:23.460 --> 03:39:26.460
discussed inside that. Okay. So if I do LLM ops, it also

03:39:26.460 --> 03:39:29.860
includes Docker and Kubernetes. required for llm exactly i

03:39:29.860 --> 03:39:33.120
can show you i can show you that so see uh if you will go

03:39:33.120 --> 03:39:37.560
and uh i think my screen is visible right ah yes okay so if

03:39:37.560 --> 03:39:45.920
i'll go and i'll try to search uh your own so lm yeah so see

03:39:45.920 --> 03:39:50.180
llm ops master this one yeah so everything if you will go

03:39:50.180 --> 03:39:53.300
through a syllabus so starting from what is llm os

03:39:53.300 --> 03:39:56.780
foundation then lms loading lama index hyperstack whatever

03:39:56.780 --> 03:40:00.860
it is aws cicd pipeline with respect to llm ops so

03:40:00.860 --> 03:40:04.260
everything is already whatever is required for lmops and

03:40:04.260 --> 03:40:06.420
whatever component that we are using inside the lmops

03:40:06.420 --> 03:40:11.080
including edelweiss bedrock right vortex ai uh then like uh

03:40:11.080 --> 03:40:14.600
yeah so everything everything is discussed here i think i

03:40:14.600 --> 03:40:17.440
checked the syllabus but i did not find docker and stuff so

03:40:17.440 --> 03:40:20.680
i am i believe he must be using even i'm not able to find

03:40:20.680 --> 03:40:26.180
out this is where i'm a little bit surprised uh but uh he

03:40:26.180 --> 03:40:30.920
must be using inside a project he is not covering a docker

03:40:30.920 --> 03:40:33.660
separately because in mlops so

03:40:37.080 --> 03:40:45.260
mlops master dvc and then this is selfless right here he is

03:40:45.260 --> 03:40:50.780
covering inside a mlop so he is covering github dvc and the

03:40:50.780 --> 03:40:54.820
core yeah here is he is covering docker so basically llm ops

03:40:54.820 --> 03:40:59.060
and mlops both he will have to do technically this is

03:40:59.060 --> 03:41:02.120
something that we are doing even inside the ml lm ops just

03:41:02.120 --> 03:41:06.880
with the flavor of llm so he has discussed already a docker

03:41:06.880 --> 03:41:11.580
so he has not discussed over there so for mlops we have any

03:41:11.580 --> 03:41:14.960
prerequisite because at least i don't have a background of

03:41:14.960 --> 03:41:18.680
machine learning no he's he's not so i have already gone

03:41:18.680 --> 03:41:20.540
through his lecture so basically he is not discussing

03:41:20.540 --> 03:41:23.640
anything with respect to a core machine learning part yes he

03:41:23.640 --> 03:41:26.440
has taken an example of a model that okay fine this is the

03:41:26.440 --> 03:41:30.000
model which we have built and across that he's showing the

03:41:30.000 --> 03:41:35.400
ops part okay so we are like good to go if you don't have

03:41:35.400 --> 03:41:37.540
the knowledge of machine learning all of these courses are

03:41:37.540 --> 03:41:39.760
technically independent of each other if you know python

03:41:39.760 --> 03:41:42.840
then you can pick any of these courses okay so the roadmap

03:41:42.840 --> 03:41:47.100
will be mlops then llm ops then after that exactly yeah yeah

03:41:47.100 --> 03:41:52.200
you got it and last question is uh for uh like for nlp do we

03:41:52.200 --> 03:41:55.060
have any prerequisite like if i go to the course of that

03:41:55.060 --> 03:41:59.220
provided any you don't see if i'll tell you very simple so

03:41:59.220 --> 03:42:04.080
if you will look into the nlp now let's suppose if you're

03:42:04.080 --> 03:42:06.600
going through this hybrid one there is a nlp even inside

03:42:06.600 --> 03:42:09.300
this one genetivi with nlp and fine tuning this was a live

03:42:09.300 --> 03:42:12.180
batch which i have concluded two months back so which i have

03:42:12.180 --> 03:42:14.300
completed so even here so i have discussed all these things

03:42:14.300 --> 03:42:18.580
in detail now here so till this point i think last three or

03:42:18.580 --> 03:42:22.460
four modules is not been uploaded so this module i think it

03:42:22.460 --> 03:42:24.760
will be uploaded soon within two weeks you can say this

03:42:24.760 --> 03:42:27.500
model and this model now till this module everything is

03:42:27.500 --> 03:42:30.540
uploaded and i'm i have recorded it so i can tell you like

03:42:30.540 --> 03:42:35.780
what is required so here technically i'm not trying to like

03:42:35.780 --> 03:42:39.300
you know uh talk about a deep learning not even here so

03:42:39.300 --> 03:42:42.460
using a simple python and then i'm trying to use uh

03:42:42.460 --> 03:42:46.500
libraries over here so nlt can like a spacey and based out

03:42:46.500 --> 03:42:49.660
of that i'm trying to showcase the example similarly so over

03:42:49.660 --> 03:42:53.440
here so theory practical again in a plain python now even

03:42:53.440 --> 03:42:56.400
over here so theory practical with the plain python and then

03:42:56.400 --> 03:42:59.760
model building i'm trying to do and again in this particular

03:42:59.760 --> 03:43:02.420
section which will be uploaded very soon so it will be

03:43:02.420 --> 03:43:06.080
theory practical but here you will be able to see little bit

03:43:06.080 --> 03:43:10.340
of a concept of a deep learning so because i'm going to

03:43:10.340 --> 03:43:13.960
teach rnn lstm now inside rnn lstm whenever i'm teaching so

03:43:13.960 --> 03:43:17.100
obviously i have to show you the practical example and

03:43:17.100 --> 03:43:19.860
practical example will be based out of neural network but

03:43:19.860 --> 03:43:22.100
yeah in that example whatever component which i'm going to

03:43:22.100 --> 03:43:26.360
use i'll be explaining to you as simple as that so as such

03:43:26.360 --> 03:43:29.980
there is only a python which is a prerequisite for this this

03:43:29.980 --> 03:43:33.300
particular one so if you are a simple person generally tvi

03:43:33.300 --> 03:43:36.980
with nlp agent tk and fine tuning now over here so this is

03:43:36.980 --> 03:43:41.100
already a very very long batch it was a live one so here i

03:43:41.100 --> 03:43:43.680
have discussed everything in sequence whatever like sequence

03:43:43.680 --> 03:43:45.760
that i have given but yeah if you are going through this

03:43:45.760 --> 03:43:50.140
part of nlp then i don't think that much will be required so

03:43:50.140 --> 03:43:53.080
thank you for clarifying the only reason i asked because i

03:43:53.080 --> 03:43:56.880
want to master end to end so i i think in case then then the

03:43:56.880 --> 03:43:58.760
simple approach is follow the roadmap

03:44:02.120 --> 03:44:04.660
if you have time because many people come and say that no

03:44:04.660 --> 03:44:06.980
they just wanted to spend four to five months of time i say

03:44:06.980 --> 03:44:09.540
okay fine go with the core but if people are saying that

03:44:09.540 --> 03:44:11.640
okay fine i would like to like follow the roadmap i would

03:44:11.640 --> 03:44:15.160
like to like spend maybe a eight month of time over here i

03:44:15.160 --> 03:44:18.440
say okay fine so in that case uh don't give a second thought

03:44:18.440 --> 03:44:21.480
just follow the roadmap and here i'm creating a fresh

03:44:21.480 --> 03:44:24.500
recording of each and everything uh it's taking a lot of

03:44:24.500 --> 03:44:27.980
time for me but yeah so almost all the model will be

03:44:27.980 --> 03:44:32.300
completed within a month of time uh seriously for your

03:44:32.300 --> 03:44:38.600
guidance thanks take care yeah okay so now uh anyone guys

03:44:38.600 --> 03:44:41.280
please go ahead with the question i think we have like uh

03:44:41.280 --> 03:44:44.760
four people only who have raised the hand yeah so sarik

03:44:47.700 --> 03:44:53.810
anyone sir i have a doubt regarding yuri api yeah i

03:44:53.810 --> 03:44:55.650
understand first step and enforcement

03:44:58.730 --> 03:45:02.450
but i just wonder about the how to use and how to implement

03:45:04.270 --> 03:45:10.550
okay sorry how to how to use and implement yuri api how to

03:45:10.550 --> 03:45:12.830
use an implement yuri api that i will be teaching you don't

03:45:12.830 --> 03:45:15.510
worry like we have to use a lot so let's come to the

03:45:15.510 --> 03:45:23.230
tomorrow's class because some of the students are regarding

03:45:23.230 --> 03:45:28.670
tokens and i am still confused about this there not not an

03:45:28.670 --> 03:45:31.670
issue so come to the tomorrow's class i'll be like today i

03:45:31.670 --> 03:45:34.690
have already shown you right so the curl command tomorrow

03:45:34.690 --> 03:45:41.510
i'll give you the more demos okay sir yeah okay okay next

03:45:41.510 --> 03:45:45.930
question please yeah so my question is like in today's

03:45:45.930 --> 03:45:50.270
lecture we have exposed a function to api right so what if

03:45:50.270 --> 03:45:54.450
we have our classes and objects in that case we can host an

03:45:54.450 --> 03:45:58.150
entire class to an api you never call a class right so

03:45:58.150 --> 03:46:00.930
basically classes means what inside the class will be having

03:46:00.930 --> 03:46:03.230
a function at the end of the day you will be executing a

03:46:03.230 --> 03:46:06.830
function function will be doing the task classes are nothing

03:46:06.830 --> 03:46:12.590
but just a skeleton technically that is the class right you

03:46:12.590 --> 03:46:17.290
create a object basically means a variable of the class and

03:46:17.290 --> 03:46:20.050
then variable of the class with the help of that you will be

03:46:20.050 --> 03:46:22.830
able to access multiple things now that variable of the

03:46:22.830 --> 03:46:26.130
class you are going to use in some function so in an ideal

03:46:26.130 --> 03:46:29.110
way it's a function that we try to expose because it's a

03:46:29.110 --> 03:46:31.150
function which will be doing the real task

03:46:33.910 --> 03:46:35.970
how can you explain the difference between the curl fast api

03:46:35.970 --> 03:46:39.150
and whatever you use primary intent whatever whatever

03:46:39.150 --> 03:46:44.490
whatever sorry curl and the past api call you can get that

03:46:44.490 --> 03:46:50.210
last line so included let's say you use the fast api then

03:46:50.210 --> 03:46:54.390
curl uh curlра yeah didn't explain the difference between

03:46:54.390 --> 03:46:58.150
these two no no curl is the generic command for a linux

03:46:58.150 --> 03:47:01.490
system or maybe you can say a command prompt so wherever you

03:47:01.490 --> 03:47:04.870
have to hit some api or some external system so the command

03:47:04.870 --> 03:47:10.650
is basically curl so it's a generic universal system yeah

03:47:10.650 --> 03:47:12.790
fast api is basically a framework by which you are creating

03:47:12.790 --> 03:47:17.350
a api curl is like just hit the api or maybe if you have to

03:47:17.350 --> 03:47:20.290
hit a github even right so we can curl the github

03:47:24.110 --> 03:47:27.290
yeah fine okay next one please yeah

03:47:29.210 --> 03:47:33.390
next one anyone guys so after that we'll close the class so

03:47:33.390 --> 03:47:37.130
i think uh i can see ramesh i can see abhinash i can see

03:47:37.130 --> 03:47:38.210
sarik so any question

03:47:41.070 --> 03:47:46.970
yeah sir i

03:47:46.970 --> 03:47:50.110
have the basic question something right we uh what is the

03:47:50.110 --> 03:47:56.070
difference between uh web cook and api means it is actually

03:47:56.070 --> 03:48:02.890
yeah yeah yeah yeah so basically the meaning of babook in a

03:48:02.890 --> 03:48:05.410
language way if i have to explain it to you so let's suppose

03:48:05.410 --> 03:48:08.510
you are trying to hit my api right you are trying to hit my

03:48:08.510 --> 03:48:11.870
system now you understand the api part right so basically

03:48:11.870 --> 03:48:14.190
it's nothing but you are executing some function or maybe

03:48:14.190 --> 03:48:16.970
let's suppose you are not executing any function you have

03:48:16.970 --> 03:48:21.030
logged in into my system now on your login when you are

03:48:21.030 --> 03:48:24.570
logged in into like a euron let's suppose i have to trigger

03:48:24.570 --> 03:48:27.990
one alarm basically that's okay ramesh has logged into your

03:48:27.990 --> 03:48:31.690
own system right so basically that trigger can be done with

03:48:31.690 --> 03:48:36.010
the help of webhook that is called as babook uh okay web

03:48:36.010 --> 03:48:38.750
cook is also beginning with ap process and back end

03:48:38.750 --> 03:48:42.030
something oh it's a bit i would say a bit different

03:48:42.030 --> 03:48:44.270
ultimately under the hood like we have written the function

03:48:44.270 --> 03:48:47.330
right but the concept of bevoo says that that okay on any

03:48:47.330 --> 03:48:50.370
kind of event if you have to trigger something right then

03:48:50.370 --> 03:48:53.010
you can try to use for example you do a payment right so

03:48:53.010 --> 03:48:55.950
basically we are using a payment gateway we don't have a

03:48:55.950 --> 03:48:59.970
payment gateway so we are using technically a payment now so

03:48:59.970 --> 03:49:03.690
once you do the payment let's suppose not on our program on

03:49:03.690 --> 03:49:06.150
any platform in the entire world right maybe amazon maybe

03:49:06.150 --> 03:49:08.850
netflix wherever whatever like wherever you are doing a

03:49:08.850 --> 03:49:12.190
payment so payment will not be from amazon payment will not

03:49:12.190 --> 03:49:15.130
from netflix or payment is not something that euron holds

03:49:15.130 --> 03:49:18.250
right we are using rosarpay someone will use stripe someone

03:49:18.250 --> 03:49:21.850
will use paypal basically so whenever you do a payment we

03:49:21.850 --> 03:49:24.570
have to give you the access but payment is happening in

03:49:24.570 --> 03:49:28.170
different system right and access you have to like get into

03:49:28.170 --> 03:49:31.650
your own system course access right so whenever you will do

03:49:31.650 --> 03:49:35.030
a payment so that it's on that action so let's suppose you

03:49:35.030 --> 03:49:37.530
have done the payment so that is going to be one of the

03:49:37.530 --> 03:49:41.630
action so we call a bev hook right so that will return a

03:49:41.630 --> 03:49:44.450
data success message or failure message that will return the

03:49:44.450 --> 03:49:47.750
success message with your detail your login id detail saying

03:49:47.750 --> 03:49:50.490
that that okay fine so this person who has logged into your

03:49:50.490 --> 03:49:54.350
system with this id so basically he has done the action now

03:49:54.350 --> 03:49:58.410
on that to the reaction means give that course access so

03:49:58.410 --> 03:50:01.410
technically the action right the call that we are trying to

03:50:01.410 --> 03:50:03.390
get that is that we are getting from the data right

03:50:03.390 --> 03:50:06.450
automated action exactly automated action so basically

03:50:06.450 --> 03:50:08.990
whenever you're someone's going to access your system you

03:50:08.990 --> 03:50:11.330
have to like generate a reaction that is called as bev hook

03:50:13.030 --> 03:50:16.690
okay sir so as per your experience what are the challenges

03:50:16.690 --> 03:50:21.390
uh uh did you pay us in api related things sir any couple of

03:50:21.390 --> 03:50:24.790
points hell a lot of challenges i mean like see challenges

03:50:24.790 --> 03:50:29.630
no i think see unless you are not working in one full scale

03:50:29.630 --> 03:50:33.670
project which has been used by 10 000 people right believe

03:50:33.670 --> 03:50:36.370
me you will never be able to experience a real challenge

03:50:38.950 --> 03:50:43.350
challenge scalability security right someone is going to

03:50:43.350 --> 03:50:47.110
override your api maybe some endpoint is exposed one uh

03:50:47.110 --> 03:50:49.830
maybe you are not able to for example we are giving you

03:50:49.830 --> 03:50:52.510
token right so initially we have launched and there was a

03:50:52.510 --> 03:50:55.310
glitch for example right that we were not able to like you

03:50:55.310 --> 03:50:58.310
know calculate a proper token or you you will keep on

03:50:58.310 --> 03:51:01.110
hitting but our system was like uh running uh the

03:51:01.110 --> 03:51:03.090
calculation system right which was trying to calculate the

03:51:03.210 --> 03:51:07.150
so it was like a delayed so let's suppose you are hitting

03:51:07.150 --> 03:51:10.650
back to back back to my api and i'm not able to calculate it

03:51:10.650 --> 03:51:13.810
so in that i will end up giving you more tokens which is a

03:51:13.810 --> 03:51:18.590
business loss for me yeah yeah yes correct yeah that is

03:51:18.590 --> 03:51:21.190
might be the reason sir sir and one more challenge is i am

03:51:21.190 --> 03:51:24.590
facing no really uh so basically when we extract the payload

03:51:24.590 --> 03:51:28.390
right and it is a big big of the json big kind of the json

03:51:28.390 --> 03:51:33.130
so i think how do we need to uh parse it and you know at

03:51:33.130 --> 03:51:37.370
least uh how do we either any uh is there any easiest way to

03:51:37.370 --> 03:51:40.570
pass the entire json and understand the structure general

03:51:40.570 --> 03:51:43.470
any thumb rules for this i understood we have the code over

03:51:43.470 --> 03:51:47.450
there we can parse it but is there any easiest way to uh

03:51:47.450 --> 03:51:51.050
extract the payload no and it's not to extract the payload

03:51:51.050 --> 03:51:55.230
to understand the json structure okay json structure just

03:51:55.230 --> 03:51:59.570
use json viewer then copy paste json data in a json yeah but

03:51:59.570 --> 03:52:04.370
it is coming the line by line we have almost no i think no

03:52:04.370 --> 03:52:08.230
hundred thousand k or two thousand k something json is more

03:52:08.230 --> 03:52:11.530
like a schema right so if someone is sending you like one

03:52:11.530 --> 03:52:14.130
json packet you are saying it's having ten thousand lines

03:52:14.130 --> 03:52:17.650
one only one json packet you know yeah one packet one packet

03:52:17.650 --> 03:52:20.470
is almost that is one data right one data

03:52:25.390 --> 03:52:29.330
then you want if one data length is like thousand line what

03:52:29.330 --> 03:52:31.610
you can do nothing you have to understand it right because

03:52:31.610 --> 03:52:35.570
someone has created it yeah it is the challenges to

03:52:35.570 --> 03:52:38.690
understand the structure right because when we extract the

03:52:38.690 --> 03:52:44.070
data from the web right especially twitter or facebook it is

03:52:44.070 --> 03:52:47.450
it's not that challenging i mean like json gives you very

03:52:47.450 --> 03:52:50.530
formatted response like uh layer by layer layer by layer

03:52:50.530 --> 03:52:56.330
like uh just try to yeah so just try to put it inside uh uh

03:52:56.330 --> 03:53:01.510
like this one i'll say uh put it inside uh json viewer and i

03:53:01.510 --> 03:53:06.090
think you will be able to understand json okay json okay yes

03:53:06.090 --> 03:53:09.090
then if you want to make it a table or format that should be

03:53:09.090 --> 03:53:11.250
better right and to understand the whole thing then call

03:53:11.250 --> 03:53:16.290
pandas yeah panda you can call pandas for a table format

03:53:16.290 --> 03:53:21.770
okay and the pandas data frame is sufficient yeah that's why

03:53:21.770 --> 03:53:25.230
we don't have any mapping documents over there because when

03:53:25.230 --> 03:53:28.690
we extract the message from the uh twitter or something it

03:53:28.690 --> 03:53:34.710
it ha it is having the lot of attributes blah blah like this

03:53:34.710 --> 03:53:38.610
but we cannot understand the schema whole thing because when

03:53:38.610 --> 03:53:42.070
you look at the payload file it contains a lot number a lot

03:53:42.070 --> 03:53:45.450
of number of lines so that is a difficult to it will taking

03:53:45.450 --> 03:53:48.210
time it is a manual process it is taking time to understand

03:53:48.210 --> 03:53:51.790
the whole schema even though just do one thing upload one

03:53:51.790 --> 03:53:54.790
json into a yuri and then ask yuri to explain it will

03:53:54.790 --> 03:54:00.870
explain you okay yeah yeah i totally agree no no actually we

03:54:00.870 --> 03:54:04.690
how did we use mean actually yeah we used to the spark and

03:54:04.690 --> 03:54:08.490
exploding operation and try to read the data we did it but

03:54:08.490 --> 03:54:12.750
also anyhow uh the schema is a lengthy and we had a lot of

03:54:12.750 --> 03:54:16.770
nested schema uh so it is the parsing is something difficult

03:54:16.770 --> 03:54:22.390
to get it exactly that so a lot of uh no it is a it is

03:54:22.390 --> 03:54:26.330
contained a lot of nested schema so maybe we may we may face

03:54:26.330 --> 03:54:30.590
the lot of errors to pass it that's when i was facing the

03:54:30.590 --> 03:54:35.030
challenges like this okay okay yeah next one arman you have

03:54:35.030 --> 03:54:40.850
question yes sir so on that on your first part in which you

03:54:40.850 --> 03:54:44.070
showed the theory where we are using google application and

03:54:44.070 --> 03:54:46.670
we are transferring the money so it's related to that

03:54:46.670 --> 03:54:51.450
whenever we are using api so indirectly hitting is it it is

03:54:51.450 --> 03:54:53.990
hitting the database right to extract the money and then

03:54:53.990 --> 03:54:56.470
depositing basically it is it is hitting the function

03:54:56.470 --> 03:55:01.030
function is hitting the ap uh databases okay okay and sir

03:55:01.030 --> 03:55:04.590
one last question like for example if someone wants to get

03:55:04.590 --> 03:55:09.050
higher than your own after this gen ai code so what will be

03:55:09.050 --> 03:55:12.110
your criteria evaluating that based on the challenges and

03:55:12.110 --> 03:55:15.850
assignments you are given in the course uh our team takes a

03:55:15.850 --> 03:55:18.670
rigorous interview and they take an interview not a regular

03:55:18.670 --> 03:55:21.370
way they will give you the project a project where you can

03:55:21.370 --> 03:55:24.410
use ai and whatever you want you can use it but yeah at the

03:55:24.410 --> 03:55:28.630
end of the day we will be looking for the final result okay

03:55:28.630 --> 03:55:31.630
yeah okay next question is what is the best way to get

03:55:31.630 --> 03:55:32.730
higher than your own api yes sir you have a question please

03:55:32.730 --> 03:55:36.150
go ahead yeah yeah hi sudhanshu yeah so i've been following

03:55:36.150 --> 03:55:39.390
you from since your iron neuron days so currently i'm

03:55:39.390 --> 03:55:44.790
working as a data engineer so my company is indulging into

03:55:44.790 --> 03:55:48.670
this dan ai project so i've worked on something called radio

03:55:48.670 --> 03:55:52.810
for the ui part and a little bit of 2ai so the project is

03:55:52.810 --> 03:55:58.490
getting bigger so like i uh i just want to know your opinion

03:55:58.490 --> 03:56:01.630
so in the day-to-day life since companies forcing me to use

03:56:01.630 --> 03:56:05.890
ai majorly so what i do is i ask for the system architecture

03:56:05.890 --> 03:56:10.270
i ask for the modules and i get the code but i try to review

03:56:10.270 --> 03:56:13.990
each and every line before sending it to the production so i

03:56:13.990 --> 03:56:18.410
know my architecture i know my code the problem which i am

03:56:18.410 --> 03:56:22.250
facing and i want to know your opinion is that the lms are

03:56:22.250 --> 03:56:25.930
generally having a context limit so they sometimes

03:56:25.930 --> 03:56:29.490
hallucinate whenever the context gets larger or the project

03:56:29.490 --> 03:56:31.970
gets larger so this is something that i'm trying to see just

03:56:31.970 --> 03:56:34.550
like how can we like get a way out of it like how we can

03:56:34.550 --> 03:56:37.150
break down break down into our chunks it's a normal issue

03:56:37.150 --> 03:56:40.810
with which we all are facing by the way so just try to like

03:56:40.810 --> 03:56:43.850
a chunk it out and try to call a multiple agent instead of

03:56:43.850 --> 03:56:47.050
like doing a or generating a response in a single sort even

03:56:47.050 --> 03:56:49.890
we are doing the same thing like in multiple cases right so

03:56:49.890 --> 03:56:52.450
whenever we are trying to build for example the awni that we

03:56:52.450 --> 03:56:56.030
have released so awni you can try to even chat with awni for

03:56:56.030 --> 03:56:58.930
hours and that too real-time conversation is happening right

03:56:58.930 --> 03:57:01.610
just imagine how long context we are able to maintain in

03:57:01.610 --> 03:57:01.610
time right so just imagine how long context we are able to

03:57:01.610 --> 03:57:05.190
maintain is So again, we are trying to like do a checking

03:57:05.190 --> 03:57:08.190
over there and we are trying to break down the data and then

03:57:08.190 --> 03:57:10.590
we are sending to the LLM so that it will be able to create,

03:57:10.690 --> 03:57:13.110
understand your context, as well as it will be able to like

03:57:13.110 --> 03:57:15.890
generate the next question for you. It will be able to ask

03:57:15.890 --> 03:57:18.130
even a follow-up question. So if you'll chat with Avni,

03:57:18.210 --> 03:57:20.610
right, it will be able to ask even a follow-up questions,

03:57:20.730 --> 03:57:24.490
right? Just like a real, real interviewer, which asked like

03:57:24.490 --> 03:57:27.790
a real follow-up question. So checking is the only way, call

03:57:27.790 --> 03:57:31.130
a multiple agents basically, right? Call a multiple agent

03:57:31.130 --> 03:57:34.890
and do the checking. So if my project has multiple Python

03:57:34.890 --> 03:57:39.630
packages as well as modules, so in that case, how can I

03:57:39.630 --> 03:57:43.910
basically ask for the next follow-up codes like without

03:57:43.910 --> 03:57:47.270
losing the context? So yeah. So basically you have to create

03:57:47.270 --> 03:57:49.810
the context, right? Whenever you're trying to send the next

03:57:49.810 --> 03:57:52.510
one, whenever you're trying to send a query. So for example,

03:57:52.770 --> 03:57:54.850
okay, so let's, let me give you the very simple example,

03:57:54.930 --> 03:57:58.230
right? So in an agent, we try to give a memory, right?

03:57:58.770 --> 03:58:01.170
Whenever we try to get. Or maybe if you're not not created

03:58:01.170 --> 03:58:03.190
the agent. So let's try to go ahead with that second

03:58:03.190 --> 03:58:06.650
approach, approach number two, where RIG. So I think you

03:58:06.650 --> 03:58:10.370
would know the meaning of RIG. So basically whenever we are

03:58:10.370 --> 03:58:13.390
trying to send a query, what do we do? So we try to send a

03:58:13.390 --> 03:58:15.950
query, first of all, to our vector databases, right now,

03:58:15.990 --> 03:58:18.270
based on that query, it will try to generate the top K

03:58:18.270 --> 03:58:22.610
context. And then we try to append the query plus topic

03:58:22.610 --> 03:58:25.610
context, and then we send it to LLMs. This is what we do in

03:58:25.610 --> 03:58:28.930
RIG, right? Correct. Yeah. Now do the same thing over here.

03:58:29.790 --> 03:58:32.090
See, whenever you're trying to generate the new code, let's

03:58:32.090 --> 03:58:34.730
suppose I have already written like a 10,000 line of a code

03:58:34.730 --> 03:58:38.870
and maybe hundreds of module. Agree? Yeah. But again, so to

03:58:38.870 --> 03:58:41.290
generate the next one, those hundreds of models are not

03:58:41.290 --> 03:58:44.530
required, right? Dependency will not be on hundreds of

03:58:44.530 --> 03:58:46.670
module. Maybe there will be a dependency on five modules, 10

03:58:46.670 --> 03:58:50.470
modules, max to max. Now so when you're trying to append

03:58:50.470 --> 03:58:53.550
this context, top K, which I'm trying to say in a RIG

03:58:53.550 --> 03:58:56.090
approach, top K when you're trying to send, obviously it

03:58:56.090 --> 03:58:59.690
will be able to retrieve those like a relevant module. And

03:58:59.690 --> 03:59:03.030
your entire like a context length will be smaller in that

03:59:03.030 --> 03:59:06.590
way. Okay. Okay. I understood now. We all are following the

03:59:06.590 --> 03:59:09.290
same approach. Like, and this is a very normal problem

03:59:09.290 --> 03:59:13.010
nowadays for us. Yeah. My second question is I'm working

03:59:13.010 --> 03:59:16.250
here since past three years, so I'm trying to switch in the

03:59:16.250 --> 03:59:19.450
data engineering domain. So is it a good combination, data

03:59:19.450 --> 03:59:22.530
engineering plus LLMs? Lethal. Lethal. Lethal. I have

03:59:22.530 --> 03:59:24.870
started my career as a CP consultant, then data engineering

03:59:24.870 --> 03:59:28.630
and then data science. Because see, data science maybe give

03:59:28.630 --> 03:59:29.990
you a knowledge. Yeah. I have a lot of knowledge, expertise,

03:59:30.190 --> 03:59:33.610
and experience with respect to algorithms and all those

03:59:33.610 --> 03:59:35.590
things, application building, model building, everything.

03:59:36.190 --> 03:59:39.630
Data engineering always try to brings you a flavor where you

03:59:39.630 --> 03:59:43.750
can build a real system with a scale, with a security and

03:59:43.750 --> 03:59:47.010
with a huge volume of traction plus optimization. That is

03:59:47.010 --> 03:59:49.930
the capability that we get from the data engineering and

03:59:49.930 --> 03:59:53.650
somewhere in my life. So I have like started as a CP

03:59:53.650 --> 03:59:55.550
consultant, then moved into data engineering, then moved

03:59:55.550 --> 03:59:59.570
into a data science. So that was my progression into like a

03:59:59.570 --> 03:59:59.810
tech.

03:59:59.810 --> 04:00:02.890
me and because of that somewhere i think that like i am able

04:00:02.890 --> 04:00:05.070
to design the system or i understand the system actual

04:00:05.070 --> 04:00:09.210
system right even on a very very low level so if someone is

04:00:09.210 --> 04:00:11.870
trying to learn data big data right or data engineering i

04:00:11.870 --> 04:00:15.750
always suggest go for it all right so i like whatever you

04:00:15.750 --> 04:00:19.690
have taught you you know i i use it on a daily basis so uh

04:00:19.690 --> 04:00:23.150
like the rest api part so i understood totally although i

04:00:23.150 --> 04:00:26.430
have used flask majorly but it's good to learn fast api

04:00:26.430 --> 04:00:29.170
because it is now majorly no differences between flask and

04:00:29.170 --> 04:00:31.490
fast api i mean like i don't think that you have found out

04:00:31.490 --> 04:00:34.350
any differences major difference no no not material

04:00:34.350 --> 04:00:36.830
difference but since there's something called pidentic there

04:00:36.830 --> 04:00:41.550
you have there is no pidentic in like a fast api there is a

04:00:41.550 --> 04:00:44.310
concept of pidentic just for data validation yeah sure that

04:00:44.310 --> 04:00:48.730
that's the only so that's from my side thank you yeah but

04:00:48.730 --> 04:00:51.030
flask is not a production rating uh basically so in a

04:00:51.030 --> 04:00:54.250
production send up flask api but fast api is a production

04:00:54.250 --> 04:00:59.030
rating yeah right right thank you okay thanks uh next one we

04:00:59.030 --> 04:01:02.490
have two people only avini uh avinas and sarik anyone go

04:01:02.490 --> 04:01:04.990
ahead after that we'll close the class i have to like

04:01:04.990 --> 04:01:06.450
celebrate raksha mandan as well

04:01:13.850 --> 04:01:18.670
okay fine no doubt sir no doubt okay no no fine thank you so

04:01:18.670 --> 04:01:21.390
much everyone take care and uh tomorrow we have again a

04:01:21.390 --> 04:01:23.690
class which will be the continuation of today's class itself

04:01:23.690 --> 04:01:26.690
i have already given the assignment do it and recording will

04:01:26.690 --> 04:01:30.430
be available uh in next four to five hours so whenever it

04:01:30.430 --> 04:01:32.390
will be ready we'll upload the recording with that thank you

04:01:32.390 --> 04:01:34.670
so much everyone happy raksha mandan take care and see you

04:01:34.670 --> 04:01:38.310
again same time tomorrow best wishes thank you thanks

04:01:38.310 --> 04:01:43.090
everyone take care same time 9 am ist i have i think we all

04:01:43.090 --> 04:01:45.250
know like where to find the link and hope all of you have

04:01:45.250 --> 04:01:47.650
enjoyed the class all of you have learned a lot and we had

04:01:47.650 --> 04:01:51.570
an amazing discussion let's continue the same enthusiasm for

04:01:51.570 --> 04:01:56.410
a very very long time at least for three months okay take

04:01:56.410 --> 04:01:58.390
care i'm ending ending the discussion.
