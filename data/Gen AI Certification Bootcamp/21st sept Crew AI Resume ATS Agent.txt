WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
By the way, today I'm going to talk about basically a very

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.420
amazing and interesting application and that application is

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.500
going to be a ATS resume application. So where we are going

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.420
to build our resume with respect to ATS like a compliances.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.200
So basically, we all know that that whenever we are going to

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.140
submit a resume, so obviously it will go through a ATS

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.020
system, applicant tracking system. And what it does? So

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.340
basically, it will try to match your resume with respect to

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.100
a job description. And based on that, based on that

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.620
matching, basically, so it is going to, you know, either

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.920
pick your resume or maybe it is going to like discard your

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.860
resume. And that is something that we are going to like see

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.540
with respect to our agents that how we can try to build a

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.600
ATS compliant resume. How we can try to improvise. How we

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.460
can improvise a score of our resume, our own resume, so

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.660
where it will be eventually become a ATS compliant. So all

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.200
of these things in an accent we are going to see we are

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.460
going to observe. So let me share my screen. I have already

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.080
prepared a beautiful demo for all of you. So let me give you

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.420
a demo first and then maybe we can try to start ahead with

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.380
the code base by the way. Yeah. So let me share my screen

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.980
and here it goes. So as you can see, right, uh, we have a

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.940
application up and running and I have built this application

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.040
with the help of crew AI agent again. So yesterday I have

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.560
shown you that, uh, how you can try to use a crew a studio

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.200
or a crew at cloud and where you can dress, try to do some

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.800
sort of a prompting. And with the help of prompting, you

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.340
will be able to build a resume, uh, but here, so I'm not

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.660
going to do just a prompting. So I have done this things

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.980
with respect to a pure route from the scratch where what you

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.220
can do, so you can try to upload some of the resume. So I

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.100
have maybe a resume over here, right? Maybe a good, maybe a

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.480
bad one. That's completely fine. So I just have to upload a

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.840
resume over here. Now once I'm going to upload the resume, I

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.200
can try to, you know, align my resume with respect to a JD.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.860
So here job discussion wise. So let's suppose I'm giving

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.440
machine learning engineer, and then if I'm going to pass a

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.600
complete JD, right? So if I'm going to pass a complete job

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.280
description. So this is one of the job description for a

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.540
machine learning engineer I have passed. And if I'm going to

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.060
run this ATS agent, now let's see what is going to happen.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.740
So it will take some time. So maybe it is going to take like

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.760
a two or three minute of time for me for one single resume

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.960
and it is going to parse my resume, which is available into

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.680
a PDF format, which is available maybe into a document

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.640
format or maybe into a TXT format. So I have uploaded my

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.420
resume in a PDF format by the way. Yeah. It is going to read

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.400
my entire resume. It is going to read each and every points,

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.520
which is available with respect to a project with respect to

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.220
a skillset, which I have mentioned with respect to a

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.420
description inside the resume, each and everything it is

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.860
going to read out and it is going to rewrite my entire

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.140
resume. And then it is going to refine each and every

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.700
points, which is available inside my resume, all the bullet

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.260
points, and it is going to give me even a ATS score that

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.280
what is a current ATS score. So that is the overall goal of

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.260
this content if I'm going to use it. So this is how this

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.340
entire things is going to work. And we will see that how we

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.740
can try to build this kind of a system with the help of

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.420
agents. So framework wise, you can try to use any of this

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.000
framework. You can use a Langchain, you can use a Lang

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
graph. You can try to use maybe a Lama indexes. You can try

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.860
to use a crew AI. So today I'm going to show you this

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.720
application with respect to a crew AI that how we can try to

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.060
build a agent inside a crew AI. Now. Now how I can try to

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.360
give access of a tool, technically a function, right?

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.920
Technically a function to agents and then how I'm going to

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.320
schedule a task basically and tasks are going to call

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.580
agents. Agents will be going, agents are going to invoke

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.180
basically a tool. And finally I will be able to get my task

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.300
completed. So which is nothing but like a ATS compliant

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.760
resume I will be able to get along with that. I will be able

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.340
to get an ATS score. So just sit tight. Watch for like a

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.760
couple of minutes. My ATS resume will be ready. So whatever

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.320
resume which I have uploaded, it will be ready in some time.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.040
So this application is going to be the amazing one. By the

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.300
way, Sir,

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.380
how much autogen is being used? It is a little difficult to

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.640
say how much autogen is being used because it's a new

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.480
framework and again adoption always takes time. It's not

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.740
like whenever someone has released a new framework. It's not

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:29.220
like whenever someone has released a new framework. People

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.820
will start using it because obviously it takes a blacker, a

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.080
very huge amount of approval. It goes through a chain and

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.700
then people will adopt it and accept it.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.120
Is it performing a modification or completely building it

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.680
from a scratch? So technically it's trying to modify your

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.160
existing content. So whatever content which is available

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.220
inside your resume, so basically it is trying to modify that

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.260
part. It's not building from the scratch. That's the reason.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.020
So I have given a sample resume over here. Okay. And apart

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.340
from that, so I have given a title of a job and I have given

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.720
a job description JD over here with respect to a machine

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.220
learning engineer, right? So you can try to pass any resume

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.840
over here in this system. You can try to pass any job title

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.780
over here. You can try to pass any kind of a job description

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.940
and eventually it will try to align your resume with respect

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.260
to a job description that that's a whole concept behind

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.300
building this application by the way.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.620
So Lang chain, Lang graph crew. I entertained. You know the

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.180
job description. You know the job description. You know the

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.480
program and you can help them prepare. Exactly. Yes. See,

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:51.260
uh, agent creation, like, uh, up, basically up, land chain,

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.680
low your llama index, lay low, lay low. Uh, okay. I

00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:01.160
ultimately use, use, use, use, use, use, use, use.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.540
But here obviously in a class, so we are going to explore

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:14.600
all of this framework so that I'm and then you will try to

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.800
write all of these like a project things with respect to one

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.560
single framework.

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:29.310
So just wait, it takes time, it is running in my local

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:32.550
system and it takes time and eventually it's not about a

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.690
local system. So it's about an agent. I have given some sort

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.650
of a timeout to things to agents as well, but still it takes

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:45.980
a little bit of time. And, uh, you will be able to find out

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.300
that the resume system that we have over here, right? The

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.600
resume AI that we have created over here. So again, it

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.680
follows a similar kind of a nature, right? So you can try to

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.640
click on this resume. You can try to select the template of

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.820
the resume, and then you can try to upload a resume over

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.000
here, right? You can try to upload the resume over here. Now

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.540
after uploading the resume, you can try to give your GitHub

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.020
profile or profile, or maybe you can try to skip this

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:13.720
particular part and then you can give your JD, right? So

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.760
company name and job description we used to give, and then

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.140
we can click on continue and it will start building our

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:23.700
resume. So this resume AI system that we have created, which

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:27.460
is live and which we all are able to use it on a Euron

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.800
platform, right? So the resume system that we all are able

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:37.760
to use it. So this application is, okay, time out issue. Let

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.840
me try this out once again, I have, I've just given a

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.400
timeout because it was, uh, like, a. Uh, you know, very, uh,

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:48.540
slow, uh, so I have just given a timeout so that, uh, it

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:54.900
will not cross a certain time limit, machine learning

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.300
engineer. Let me give a demo for this one.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.960
How do we make sure that this whole process is faster if we

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.080
have to process a hundred to 200 resumes, see, uh, here,

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.300
what we have done. So here, if you are going to upload your

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:29.480
resume, so this system is taking hardly a 1.5 minute to 2

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.980
minute of time means 90 second to max to max. You can say a

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:36.740
200 second of time it is trying to take, and it is going to

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.640
prepare your resume. So we have done a complete scalable

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.880
deployment of this entire application. And the plus we have

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.180
also given, uh, agents, uh, instruction that, okay, so do

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.240
not take this much of time or trim out this part of the

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.660
resume or that part of the resume and then recreate it. And

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:57.520
obviously in a parallel, even if 200, not just 200, even

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.080
2000, people are going to upload. That is human. It is going

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.340
to take same amount of time, approximately 90 seconds to 1

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:08.020
22nd of time, uh, as I have done some sort of a timeout

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.600
things to this agent as well, which I'm going to show you in

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.780
a code part. Uh, but yeah, so I have not made it a scalable.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.480
So it is, it is like a taking time, but this application

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.160
that you are able to see. So technically, uh, the

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.820
application, which I'm trying to show you, it's mimicking

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.640
the same thing. So if you have to create this kind of a

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.900
product, uh, or this kind of a system. Uh, you will, you

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:35.450
can, we can follow the same approach. Yeah. It's not a URI

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:38.230
resume. It's a resume AI. So URI is different. URI is

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.750
basically like our conversational system and API system, by

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:41.970
the way, uh,

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:50.770
on the same way we can do a JD quality enhancer, a recruiter

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:53.470
pays the rough job description tool, writes it with the

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:57.410
clarity, miserable skill and, uh, inclusivity check, uh,

00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:00.550
yes, you can do that. I don't think that you need an agent

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:03.390
for that one. Maybe you can just try to call, uh, some sort

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.550
of, uh, you know, a real time, uh, you know, some, uh,

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:09.150
Google search API, plus you can try to call LLM. So LLM plus

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:12.230
a search API. And I think that is going to do a job, uh,

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:14.650
because what it will do search API. So whenever you are

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.950
going to give any kind of a job description, it will go to

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.710
the market means it will go to the internet and we'll try to

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:24.310
search a latest trend so that whatever keyword it is going

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.430
to mention inside your job description, it should not be the

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:29.590
outdated one. It should not be the old one. Uh, it can align

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:32.910
itself towards a trend and then LLM is going to do what it

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:34.370
is going to do. It is going to do the summarization. It is

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:37.230
going to align it, format it, and then give it to you. So I

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:40.090
don't think that, uh, agent, you can, you can do it with the

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:43.790
agents. That's that's completely fine, but, uh, agents is

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:47.270
not that required. Uh, it's a very small one, right? It's a

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:52.650
very small application. You're just enhancing a JD resume

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.280
is pretty fast and mostly perform a modification on the

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.660
hooks. Yeah. So basically, uh, to create this, uh, resume

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.940
AI, right. It took a lot of time for us. Uh, we were doing a

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:10.220
lot of like, uh, Back-to-back experimentation, mostly on

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.340
optimization side, because, uh, see, we can, we can build

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.980
any kind of application. That's completely fine. But, uh,

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.620
most of the problem we try to face on a scalability side and

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:22.440
optimization side that, okay, this system should work in

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:26.080
this particular timestamp. It should not cross, uh, uh, this

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.880
particular time limit. And again, so it should not even give

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.900
me a timeout error. So if some of the agents are going to

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:35.480
fail and we have, we have handled all of these things here.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:52.450
Yeah. Anywhere code base is available for ATS resume

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:56.090
builder. No, we have not made it public. It's a private code

00:12:56.090 --> 00:13:01.170
base. So code base is available, but, uh, with us, with your

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:02.370
own, can

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:12.890
we also create an agent here along with the ATS where agent

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:15.410
visits a candidate mentioned GitHub profile and validate

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:19.270
their work. I mean like a validation of the work, uh, I

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.230
think you can create a separate, uh, pipeline for that one,

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:26.450
uh, to check a GitHub or to access a GitHub and then maybe

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:28.650
like a explore the project, which is available inside your

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:31.570
GitHub and then give a score out of it, uh, for a particular

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:35.330
JD. But I don't think that, uh, attaching, uh, a GitHub and

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:39.170
a scrapping GitHub for a resume is going to be effective

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:42.630
unnecessarily, uh, you will end up, you know, introducing a

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:46.250
very heavy process over here. And again, so if you're

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:50.010
introducing that in that case, uh, time is going to

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:54.710
increase. So I will not advise if, if I'm building that, uh,

00:13:54.750 --> 00:14:00.330
kind of a product. Okay. It's taking more than expected

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:01.370
time.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.500
Okay. So it's thinking, I can see that it's, it's in a

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:15.340
thinking mode, by the way, my agents are thinking, can

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:27.670
we add user mail here to give a feedback on the resume, like

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:30.490
missing his skills and mail it? Yes, it will be able to do

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:32.790
it automatically. So I believe I have already shown you that

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:35.850
how you can do the integration of mail. Uh, right. So there

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:38.910
are two way one, you can try to follow SMTP or other, you

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:43.190
can try to follow basically, uh, APIs, uh, request. Uh, and,

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:46.110
uh, yeah, so you can send the complete feedback, uh, to a

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:49.710
candidate automatically. So based on the like, uh, parsing

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:51.570
that you are trying to do, uh,

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.480
it's still, I can see it's in a thinking phase. So I did

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.880
think still

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.020
thinking, okay.

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:47.470
How agents are different from your RPA or IPA. Okay. So

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:50.410
basically see agents will be having a LLM access, whereas

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:54.410
your RPA will not be having a LLM access. It's kind of a, a

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:57.650
rule based, uh, system. That we try to like configure. So

00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:00.790
basically it's a one step or you can say it's a RPA plus

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:03.790
plus automation, plus, plus agents are always a automation

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:06.710
plus, plus it's not like without agent, we can't do

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:09.690
automation. We can do it. We have been doing it since a

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:13.030
very, very long time, but yeah, with agents. So basically,

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:18.170
uh, things get smarter if, if I'm able to use it in a proper

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:18.550
manner.

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:31.700
Basically my application is stuck with respect to ATS

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:37.280
optimizer. Let me do one thing. Machine learning engineer.

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:42.360
Fine. Fine. Now it will complete its job quickly.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:13.170
Uh, again, timeout issue, uh, why I think I have given

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:17.490
enough time for this one. It should not take even this much

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:20.730
of time. Yesterday night when I was like, uh, building this,

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:24.610
uh, so it was not

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:29.730
taking this much of time, but now it's taking this much of

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:31.950
time. So okay. We'll fix it.

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.780
I have already tested with multiple resumes, uh, the system.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.300
It was not taking more than, uh, one and a half minute to

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:08.860
two minute of time. So now it's a failing. So basically my

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:12.520
agents are getting into a multiple iterations. I have even

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.300
controlled the iteration part. I'll even show you that part

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.920
in a code. So how to control the iteration part and how to

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:22.900
give a timestamp and how to give a tool access to a

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.980
particular agents. Uh, I have already like, uh, done those

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:31.420
implementation, but still it's getting into, uh, can

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:52.450
you check the log? I'm already looking at it. I

00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:00.400
hope not consume the token. No, actually the, uh, the, the,

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.420
the thing which I can see in a log. So basically it's, uh,

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:07.120
like, uh, getting, giving me a timeout issue at a last

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:10.800
stage. So where I'm looking for a ATS evaluation. So ATS

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:14.020
score because it's, uh, in a last tab, right? So I am

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:17.640
printing even a ATS evaluation. That what is the current ATS

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:21.100
score of your resume system, the way we are doing it in a

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:25.020
resume AI. So even resume AI gives you a, like a final score

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:28.340
that, okay, this was, uh, like a score that we had before.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.420
And this is the score that we have now, a similar thing we

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:32.300
are doing here as well.

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:47.230
Just wait. Uh, it will be up and running. Don't worry. So it

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:51.890
was up and running till, uh, yesterday night, uh, 3 AM I

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:54.720
have already tested it.

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:10.530
Just a piece of code, right? It always works.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:37.900
Maybe need to start to give some break to him. It's not

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:38.180
required.

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:43.710
Just wait.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:30.760
Hmm. Again, timeout issue, the user ATS analyzer tool to

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:37.280
analyze a keyword gap. Okay. That's fine. Hmm. Let me fix it

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:40.840
now. So I think it's time to fix it. Uh,

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:49.840
let me increase a time or a maximum execution.

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.340
Token limit exhausted. No, it's not a token limit basically.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:46.140
It's a timeout issue. Timeout time is something which I have

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.400
given, I have configured it into the application basically

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.940
that you should not take this much of time for this

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:51.440
particular step.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:03.160
Just wait for some time. I'm just like, uh, changing it.

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:23.700
I'll even tell you the reason that why it was like a thing

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:26.920
so much of time and what is the fixes for that? Because I

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:30.140
have like a, uh, two different, different version of the

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:35.220
same application. So one where it can work quickly and one

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.640
where it can take some time.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:29.460
Hmm. Now, so see it has, it has walked in, uh, like, uh, uh,

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:33.900
85 overall score is 85 and it has worked quickly. And, uh, I

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.580
basically, I have detached the tool with the agent. So I

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:39.500
have kept two separately. And now you can see that, that,

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:42.840
uh, it is able to give me the final refined version. So

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.080
whether it's a skillset, whether it's a technical skill,

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.960
whether it's a professional somebody, everything,

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:50.660
everything, it is able to give it to me and, uh, here. So it

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:53.840
is giving me even a ATS score for this particular resume,

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:56.900
that whatever content that I've given to you with respect to

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.420
a job description that you have mentioned. So basically, uh,

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:02.400
the overall score, which I am able to make for this

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.380
particular resume is 85, right? So which is a quite good,

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:08.860
the score, uh, anything above 80 is like a quite good, uh,

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:12.060
basically. So here it is able to like, uh, give me the score

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:15.240
and then it is giving me some sort of a suggestions as well,

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.940
a quick bins, which I have mentioned over here, right? Uh,

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.740
so this is how this resume system is going to work. So just

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:23.700
upload the resume up and copy and paste the job description.

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.660
Okay. And automatically my agents are going to run. It's a

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:30.080
multi, multi agent system that I've created and, uh, it will

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.940
be able to parse your resume. It will try to understand the

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.180
skillset. It will try to understand the project, which is

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:39.060
available inside your resume or description about you, which

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:41.120
is mentioned or description about the project, which is

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:43.360
mentioned. So it will try to understand everything and step

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:46.320
-by-step manner. And then what it will do. So it will try to

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:50.920
rewrite the entire resume. So it is going to give a complete

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.980
content for your entire resume. So this is what it is trying

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:58.000
to do. Uh, do technically. So here, what I have done, so I

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.720
have used basically a crew AI, right? To create this agent.

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:04.900
It's not like it's my trade to create a, uh, use a crew AI.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.680
I can try to use any agentic system or any agentic

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:11.780
framework. And I can try to build the same application, uh,

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:14.780
just by using some other frameworks. But yeah, so as it's a

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:17.460
part of house labor, so I have used a crew AI, plus I'm

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:21.360
using LLM. So here I'm trying to use our open AI key, uh,

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:25.520
which I have integrated. And which I have given an access to

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:30.920
a crew AI for my LLMs. And uh, here is the final results.

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.820
Now similar kind of things we are trying to perform even

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:37.020
over here. Now whatever output it is going to give it to me.

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.020
So we are just going to format it because it's just a text,

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.960
right? And now we understand all the sections. Now my system

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.480
understands all the sections. So what I, what, uh, this

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:48.400
system is doing technically. So this system is trying to

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:52.580
create basically a final version of a resume by putting up

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:56.140
this particular data. Into one of the format that you are

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:58.060
going to select. So we have given you three formats,

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:00.440
whatever format that you are going to select, it will just

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:03.640
try to fill all of those data in that format and you all

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:09.000
will be able to download your resume. So now let's, uh, try

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.360
to understand that how code is working in a backend and how

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:17.260
it is able to perform all of these operations with the help

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:20.940
of multiple agents. And obviously I'm going to use a

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:24.720
framework called as crew AI. So shall we start now, we are

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:28.780
able to get the output. Yeah. I'll even tell you that, uh,

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:32.380
when it will take time. So why it was like giving me a

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:34.600
timeout issue, because even yesterday when I was building

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:38.280
this, uh, when I was like trying to tune this entire

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:40.900
project, right? So I have, uh, like a tried a multiple

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:44.840
approach, uh, and, uh, yes. So one of the approach is going

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:47.940
to take a lot of time. The other approach is going to

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:50.900
optimize the time, as you can see now quickly, I'm able to

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:54.180
get the results. Not, not even like a 32nd, uh, it is taking

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:57.620
now. So just within like a 22nd, so I was able to get the

00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:00.340
result. And in one of the approach, it was taking maybe more

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:03.420
than two minutes, three minutes. And, uh, it was not able to

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:07.180
produce the final result. It was getting stuck in some of

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:12.260
the agent loops. Yeah. So let's try to understand this

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:17.040
entire project, which I have created a step in a step-by

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.840
-step manner. So shall we share a project first? Or shall we

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:23.760
discuss a framework? A code? Yes. So which, which approach

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:24.580
we should follow guys?

00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:31.530
So maybe we can, we can follow two approach. One is that I

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:34.490
can share a code with all of you and then you can run it and

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:37.410
then you can try to test it. Other approaches file by file,

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:40.530
file by file, file by file, I'll just like, uh, explain the

00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:46.270
code. So, okay. Project first code walk through. Okay. Okay.

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:51.390
File by file approach as you think fine. So try to open up a

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:54.870
VS code by the way. Yeah. So just try to open up a VS code

00:32:54.870 --> 00:33:00.230
and, uh, here. So try to create one folder. Maybe I can try

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:04.710
to create a folder over here, resume underscore PR, a CR

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:12.630
parser, underscore through AI. Yeah. Now so inside this

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:15.030
folder, we are going to perform each and every operation.

00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:18.710
Fine. So just, just do it guys now.

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:31.700
So ideally what we are trying to do inside the system. Uh,

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:36.580
let me explain to that. That part first. So here in

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:45.100
this resume ATS or you can say ATS resume.

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:54.560
So we are trying to define a different, different kind of a

00:33:54.560 --> 00:34:02.580
task. So let's suppose we have a task number one. Now let's

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:07.680
suppose we have task number two, and then we have, let's

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:11.800
suppose task number three. Now what are these tasks by the

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:17.060
way? So task wise, I can say that, uh, in one of the task is

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:21.080
parsing a resume data. The another task is basically

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:25.580
rewriting as per the ATS. And then, uh, the another task

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:28.940
could be redefining or refining the entire bullet points,

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:32.720
which has been generated by the previous task. And then the

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:35.780
fourth task could be that evaluation of the entire

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:38.900
generation. So these are the four tasks you can say. Yeah.

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:40.740
We are trying to perform. So let's suppose we have a task

00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:43.480
number one, two, three, four, and so on, right? We have a

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:46.700
multiple task over here. Now what will happen? So we are

00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:49.760
trying to attach with this particular task. Let's suppose we

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:53.460
have multiple tasks, right? So we are trying to attach our

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:58.580
agents one with this particular task. We are going to attach

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:04.360
our agent two with this task. We are going to attach our

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:08.760
agent three with this particular task. So this is how this

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:12.380
entire flow is going to work by the way. So first of all,

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:14.820
I'm going to complete task number one, then task number two,

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:17.160
and then task number three. Now to complete each and every

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:20.240
task, there is a agent in place. So which is helping me out

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.220
that, okay, I'll give you, I'll try to do the completion of

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:26.760
this particular task now inside this particular agent. So

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:29.260
when I'm saying agent, so maybe inside this particular

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:33.260
agent, I can try to give a tool access. So tool access tool

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:36.420
is nothing but a function, right? So tool access. I can try

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:40.100
to give to each and every agent. Okay. So whenever I can try

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:42.920
to give one single tool access, I can try to give even a

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:46.500
multiple tool access. That's up to me. That's completely up

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:50.140
to me, but yeah, so I can try to give a tool access tool is

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:52.820
nothing but a function that we all understand that tool is

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:55.500
nothing but just a function. And this is how crew AI is

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:58.600
going to work. A crew we are going to create. So which is

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:01.600
going to complete a particular task in a sequential manner

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.960
that you do this, then I will do this, then I will do this

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.420
and everything is going to run in a sequential manner. And

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:10.260
to complete each and every task, we have a particular agent

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:13.400
which has been defined. So agent is nothing but again, like

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:16.260
something with the LLM access and something which will be

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:19.900
able to access the tools and something which you will be

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:24.320
able to configure as per your need, that what that

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:27.520
particular agent is going to do with respect to a prompt,

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:30.680
right? With respect to a prompt. So this is a very, very

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:33.640
simple structure we are going to follow. And even in real

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:36.220
time, we does the same thing, right? We try to take a task.

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:39.360
And then we try to break down those tasks into multiple

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:42.600
different, different small tasks. And because at the end of

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:46.860
the day, my task is to make my resume ATS compliant and

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:49.580
which should be in a sync with job description. That is the

00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:52.860
ultimate task that I have, what I have done. I have just

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:55.980
broken down that particular task into a small, small pieces.

00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:59.620
And for every task I have attached a particular agent that,

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:02.320
okay, this task will be done by this agent. This task will

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.640
be done by this agent and this task will be done by this

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:08.360
agent. Now. When agent will try to perform this task, I can

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:11.440
try to attach a tool. It's not mandatory by the way, right?

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.200
The tool, which I have mentioned over here. So the function,

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:16.840
so tool means those who don't understand it's completely

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:19.400
fine. So the tool, which I have mentioned over here, it's

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.920
not mandatory. You can try to attach a tool. You can try to

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:26.900
detach a tool. It's optional. Again, it's optional basically

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:29.680
while creating an agent. So you can try to give a tool

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:32.800
access to an agent, or you can just try to give me a simple

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:36.220
prompt instruction that you have to do this. And you don't

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:39.600
have to attach a tool. It's it's completely okay. And it

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.620
depends upon a task as well. What kind of a task that we are

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:45.560
going to perform? It is not mandatory. Generally people

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:48.060
think that, that whenever we are trying to create an agent,

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:50.720
so we have to attach a tool by default, but no, that's not

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:54.640
mandatory by the way. Yeah. So now, uh, let's start and

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:57.380
let's see that, uh, how we can try to create this kind of a

00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:00.740
system. But yeah, more or less, this is the complete flow of

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:03.860
this things that we are going to discuss. And as we all know

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:07.040
that, uh, what is agent? Yeah. And, uh, how it works. So it

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:10.700
is not going to be difficult for any one of us to understand

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.640
this entire code base. That's the first part. Second part is

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:17.060
I can try to use even a crew AI cloud platform. Yesterday I

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:18.980
have shown you, right, yesterday I have shown you, which is

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:22.900
in a beta mode, but still, if I have to build this kind of

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:26.580
application, so without even writing a single line of a code

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:30.700
by myself, I can do it. That's also possible with respect to

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:34.480
crew AI, uh, but yeah. So let's go ahead with the coding

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:38.020
based approach. A non coding based approach with respect to

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:40.860
a crew AI, I think we all can do it because just a prompt,

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.620
right. Prompt. And then once it will be able to create the

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:47.820
task, but the flow that I have drawn over here, this flow is

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:51.320
a same flow. If you remember, so yesterday we have done some

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:55.340
sort of a task and a system was trying to attach a agent

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:58.020
with respect to a task, or even if you'll go now on a crew

00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:00.800
AI platform, and if you'll try to build some system, it will

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.080
follow the exact same approach. And this is what like crew

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:05.960
AI does internally. internally, or even if you are going to

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:11.360
use a crew a cloud platform now here. So let's like a one by

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.900
one, let's try to like create a first of all environment.

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:17.260
Now once we will be able to create the environment, then

00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:22.100
let's try to configure each and every agents. So first of

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:25.800
all, I will try to create a Python environment just for this

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:30.520
particular project. And then I will start creating.

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:46.910
So I think we all know that how to create a Python

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:50.670
environment by the way, right? So just come over here,

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:58.090
right? So Python P Y T H O N, Python hyphen M V E N V. And

00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:01.550
then I can try to give an environment name C R E W. So it

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:04.810
will create a folder over here and all kinds of

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:07.070
installation. It is going to keep inside this particular

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:10.190
folder as simple as that. And if I have to activate this

00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:15.730
environment. So I can just try to go to. C R E W crew slash

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:17.310
scripts

00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:23.070
slash

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:26.400
activate.

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:33.220
So this crew environment is activated. Now what I will do,

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:36.840
I'll try to create a requirement.txt file. So here R E Q U I

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:41.400
R E M N T S requirement.txt. Now inside this requirement

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:44.800
.txt, I'm going to keep all of my requirement, whatever is

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:48.240
required. So here I need a couple of things as you can see.

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:51.300
So I need a crew AI. I need a crew AI. I need a crew AI

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:55.380
tool. If I'm giving an access of a tool to an agent, this

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:58.040
library is required. Otherwise this library is not required.

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.860
Python dot environment. So again, just a Pythonic one

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:04.680
request just to call the APIs or something. Py pdf, pass the

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:08.120
pdf, Python docs, just to pass the docs, Streamlink for the

00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:11.460
UI application and Pydentic. So obviously to pass the

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:14.740
schema, if I'm going to give a tool access, so I have to

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:17.760
follow a particular nomenclature, which is coming from a

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:22.020
Pydentic. So these installation is required. Now, once I

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:25.780
will be able to do installation, so then I will be ready and

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:30.780
I can start talking about the project. So here, pip install

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.220
hyphen

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:39.590
R requirements dot txt. Yeah.

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:54.320
Okay. So I have just given you a drive link guys. So here

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.600
you will be able to find out the code base, code base for

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:59.060
this entire project. So I have just zipped it. Environment

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:01.200
is not there. So you have to set up the environment by the

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:04.800
way. Plus API key is also attached. So here. I'm not using a

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:08.320
URI API. So directly I'm using a OpenAI API because some of

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:12.260
you have already told me that you have been using a URI API,

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:15.760
but somewhere we have to even like a use a OpenAI API

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.820
directly. So keeping that in our mind. So in this demo, so

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:23.080
I'm showing you OpenAI API, the API is like active and yeah,

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:26.100
so after this class it will be deactivated and then you can

00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:28.360
start using a URI API as well. That's completely fine

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:30.720
because at the end of the day, it's a LLM provider. Right.

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:33.380
But yeah. So in this application, so I have used directly a

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:35.500
OpenAI APIs, where

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:42.500
is a drive link in your chat? Uh, let me ping you once

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:45.680
again. So here is the drive link guys for all of you. Yeah.

00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:51.320
So everything is there. Requirement.txt file. Everything is

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:54.040
available inside this one. Environment is not available.

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:57.180
This one is not available. So you have to configure the

00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:59.520
environment, configure the environments. Just try to like a

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:02.400
right path in virtual environment, create it and then run

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:03.920
your requirement.txt.

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:10.550
So yeah. Do it quickly guys. Everyone.

00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:41.360
Everyone. Hmm. Okay. So environment is ready. Now we can

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:43.900
move ahead with the next step. So I believe all of you are

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:45.080
able to download the code. Yeah.

00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.850
Yes. Everyone.

00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:54.730
Code download done. Fine. So inside the code itself, you

00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:57.790
will be able to find out a requirement.txt. So quickly just

00:45:57.790 --> 00:46:00.550
try to install your requirement.txt after creating a Python

00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:03.350
environment. I have not shared a Python environment with you

00:46:03.350 --> 00:46:06.730
because the file will be like a very, very heavy. So

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:10.390
yesterday I have wrapped it up and the file size was like a

00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:13.650
too much. It was, I think 1.7 GB if I'm going to share the

00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:16.270
environment. So keeping that in a mind, I'm not sure the

00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:19.430
environment you can, I think, create it in your system. And

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:25.580
I believe we all know how to get the environment. Okay. So

00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:29.140
once this part is done, now let's go ahead with the next

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:32.280
step. Now what is the next step by the way? So our very

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:35.700
first step that we are going to take over here to create the

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:38.540
agent. So let's see how we can try to create the agent

00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:42.600
inside a particular project in terms of a crew AI. So how we

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:47.460
can try to create a crew AI agents over here. And then I'll

00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:51.640
be talking about a task. So my task is going to call agent

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:55.040
as per this particular flow. So first of all, I will try to

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:58.640
create the independent agents. Then I will try to create a

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:02.620
task. My task will be calling my agents. Then I will try to

00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:05.920
create a tools and then we'll see whether we can detach a

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:09.000
tool or we can try to attach a tool and in the simpler

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.760
manner. So we can try to build up. The entire flow, and then

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:14.900
we are going to attach a UI layer on top of this one. So

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:17.980
where I'm going to pass a resume technically input, right?

00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:21.120
So resume is an input. My job title is an input. My job

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:25.000
description is a input. So that is basically a UI side. So

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.160
where I'm going to provide these three inputs and then my

00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:30.660
entire flow will start running automatically as simple as

00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:34.400
that. So here to create an agent and just look into the

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:37.260
code. So code is now available to all of you. So here, what

00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:40.980
we can do, we can try to create a G NTS agents.com. So this

00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:41.400
is a code that is going to be called agents dot PI file

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:45.760
agents dot PI file. Now what we are going to mention inside

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:49.500
the agents and what kind of agents we have to create. So

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:52.620
basically we have to create our couple of agents over here.

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:56.680
So the very first agent that we have to create is a parse

00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:00.740
agent. Now what this parse agent is going to perform for me,

00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:04.620
or it is going to do it for me. So basically it is going to

00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:09.320
like a extract the data. It is going to take the data. It's

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:12.700
structured. The data, which will be suitable or which will

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:16.780
be optimized with respect to the ATS. This is the goal of a

00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:20.120
one of the agents that we are going to create. Now the

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:22.620
second agent that we are going to create. So basically it is

00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:27.200
going to be a ATS writer agent. So as per the ATS, it is

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:30.280
going to, or as per the job requirement, it is going to

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:33.820
create a data for me, basically it is going to generate a

00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:37.260
data for me and then a third agent we are going to create.

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:41.040
Okay. Which will try to evaluate the data, which has been

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:44.820
generated by my previous agent or previous task you can say,

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:49.200
and then we can try to create a refiner agent. So which is

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:53.660
going to transform each and every bullet points into a very,

00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:57.240
very high impact data set. So these are the four different,

00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:59.340
different, different, different kind of agents we are going

00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:04.300
to create over here. Now how we create a agent, by the way,

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:07.880
it's not very difficult. It's very simple. So. First of all,

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:11.780
they have already given you a agent library, or you can say

00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:15.020
they have already given you a agent API. So whenever you are

00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:19.680
going to do the import, so from crew, uh, AI, so you can

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:23.160
directly import agents by the way. So this agents, you will

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:28.240
be a capital, so you can directly import this agent, and

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:30.280
this is going to help you out in terms of creating the

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:33.660
agents. So simple call agents, and then you can try to pass

00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:36.540
all the parameters with respect to the agent. And

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:40.760
eventually. It will be able to create the one as simple as

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:44.740
that. So here, if we have to create one of the agent, let me

00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:46.960
show you the nomenclature. And if you are able to create one

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:49.760
of the agent, you will be able to create hundreds of agents.

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.880
It's the same thing, right? It's the same. So see, I'm

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:55.580
trying to create one agent, which is, uh, it's an

00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:58.960
independent one. So first of all, just try to detach. So

00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:01.540
it's not connected. Just try to detach this one. As of now,

00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:04.000
these two things are not connected. I will try to create an

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.920
independent agent. Number one, two, three, four, and so on.

00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:09.860
So whatever number of agents are required as per my task. So

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:12.400
I'll try to create that. So here, if I have to create the

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:15.160
agent, so simple, uh, create a function and then return,

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:18.140
return what? Return the agent and how I'm returning the

00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:21.940
agent. So from here and inside this agent creation of a crew

00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:24.860
AI, so you have to give a couple of parameters. These are

00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:28.140
the standard parameter as per crew AI. So I have not defined

00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:31.540
it. Basically it's a crew AI who has defined it. So whenever

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:34.280
you will end up creating the agents, you have to follow the

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:36.920
exact same approach. And it technically. You don't have to

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:37.580
follow the exact same approach. You don't have any kind of a

00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:40.620
control over to it, right? It's a crew AI, which, which does

00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:44.300
that. So here a role. So what is the role? So resume parsing

00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:47.080
a space list. This is the role. Now what is the goal? So

00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:50.920
extract clean structured text from a resume suitable for ATS

00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:54.300
optimization. So this is the goal. So you have to define the

00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:56.820
role, you have to define the goal, and then you have to give

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:59.920
a backstory. I have given a very small backstory. I have

00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:03.880
even tried with a very, very lengthy backstory. Uh, you can,

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:06.820
you can like, because this is a part of the fine tuning. So

00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:10.240
backstory wise, I'm saying that, that you efficiently clean

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:13.700
a resume text by removing the artifact and normalizing a

00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:17.140
formatting focus on a speed and accuracy preserve all the

00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:19.980
important content while removing the noise. Now this is the

00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:22.100
backstory which I have given, right? This is the backstory.

00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:25.780
Now I can, I can try to elaborate this backstory. I can try

00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:29.500
to make it lengthy by saying that, that, okay, uh, so try to

00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:33.600
pass my resume, uh, try to identify maybe, uh, email ID,

00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:36.020
which is available, a GitHub link, which is available, a

00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:38.100
link. A LinkedIn link, which is available, a certification

00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:41.780
link, which is available inside my resume and do not lose

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:44.900
all of those things. So maybe I can keep on elaborating it,

00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:49.540
always try to preserve the actual content or intent of my

00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:52.080
project. So maybe I can, I can write whatever I want, right?

00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:54.680
Just an instruction, just a prompting that we used to give.

00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:57.660
And like I said, yesterday when I was talking about, uh, I

00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:00.860
think in your class or maybe in a different class, uh, I was

00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:03.800
talking about a resume AI system that we have inside our

00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:07.000
urine. So technically it's, it's a prompting, right?

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:09.960
Technically that is, you may. So the main part was

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:14.400
prompting. So we have done a lot of prompting, uh, so that

00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:17.440
it will be able to give you a, uh, basically the prompting

00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:21.020
product, uh, resume AI, although agents and everything is

00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:23.300
fine, but technically agents are just a function calling,

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:27.460
right? But uh, the entire resume, which it is able to

00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:31.080
create, it's out of the prompt that you all are able to get

00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:33.300
it because whatever prompt, which I'm going to give. Okay.

00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:36.240
So agents are going to consider that as an instruction and

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:39.200
it is going to just follow along with that. So here I'm just

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:41.560
trying to give a little bit of backstory, but you can try to

00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:45.020
elaborate that backstory. You can try to elaborate even a

00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:48.680
goal part. Maybe you can try to make your prompt better if

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:53.280
you are not able to get the expected result. Then I have to

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:57.760
pass a LLM, right? So in all the agents, you can try to pass

00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:00.640
one LLM in different, different agents. You can try to pass

00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:03.660
at different, different LLMs. And again, this is true. For a

00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:06.780
Lang chain, this is true for even a Lang graph. And that's

00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:10.860
holds true even for a crew AI that you can try to pass a

00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:14.120
separate, separate model to a separate, separate, basically,

00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:17.980
uh, like, uh, agents that you are going to create because it

00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:20.980
needs model, right? And when model comes into a picture, you

00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:24.100
can set a temperature. So I'm keeping it as zero. You can

00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:27.120
try to give a value between zero to one. That's completely

00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:31.240
fine, but zero means no hallucination, maximum iteration. So

00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:34.140
I can try to configure a maximum iteration. Maybe 10, 20, a

00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:37.840
hundred. So it will just give a try that many number of a

00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:40.860
time. So I don't want to, you know, give a multiple time

00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:43.840
tries. So keeping that in a mind, I have just kept it at

00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:47.860
one. And for this agent, I'm saying that, that you should

00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:51.900
not take more than one 20 second of a time. So maximum

00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:55.320
execution time, you should take max to max one 20. And if

00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:59.160
some processes are going to cross this time, then you will

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:02.780
get a time out issue. And in an exception handling. You will

00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:05.740
have to handle it. I have not handled it here, but yeah, in

00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:08.800
a real time, obviously you will have to handle it. If it is

00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:11.380
going to give you the time, timeout issue the way I was

00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:14.700
getting, right. Maybe you have to go with the fallback that,

00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:17.940
okay. So if there is a timeout issue, then do this, maybe

00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:23.140
like a run this entire loop once again, or maybe just give a

00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:26.000
particular message that maybe your resume is very lengthy or

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.240
something like that. But yeah, so this is the execution

00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:32.380
timeout. So this is one of the agent that we have created.

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:37.820
Agent number one. Now we can try to create another agents as

00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:41.400
well. So this will, the first agent is going to read the

00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:46.120
data, clean it. The second agent, build a ATS writer. So

00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:48.700
what it is going to do? So basically rewrite the resume,

00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:52.000
like whatever resume that I have passed. So it is going to

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.920
rewrite the resume, which should be aligned with respect to

00:54:55.920 --> 00:55:00.180
the job description, which I have mentioned. So ATS role is

00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:02.900
again, nomenclature. As you can see, it's the same. Role,

00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:05.020
goal, backstory, model, temperature, maximum iteration,

00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:07.600
maximum execution time. I'm not doing anything different,

00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:10.060
right? So role, goal, model, temperature, maximum iteration,

00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:12.360
maximum execution time. Same thing you will be able to find

00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:14.620
out. Role, goal, backstory, model, temperature, maximum

00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:18.260
iteration and execution time. So role is ATS optimization

00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:22.080
writer. Goal is create a high scoring ATS optimized resume

00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:25.120
that matches our job requirement perfectly. So whatever JD,

00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:28.360
which I'm going to pass and backstory. So you are an expert

00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:32.100
transforming resume. Uh. You are an expert at transforming

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:35.600
resume into ATS friendly format that score 80 plus points.

00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:37.700
So I've given the instruction that, okay, go ahead with the

00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:41.080
80 plus, make it 80 plus. Right. Uh, it's not like a

00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:43.300
forcefully, it will give you that score, but yeah, it will

00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:48.260
try to make your entire resume a score 80 plus I can even

00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:51.000
give 90 plus that's completely fine. So it will try to give

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.980
me a resume, uh, with respect to my job description, which

00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:57.120
will be having ATS score is equals to 90 plus that that's

00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:01.080
completely okay. So I have a control of that. Right. Uh, you

00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:04.460
strategically place a keyword. I'm saying that you have to

00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:07.140
do it. I don't have to, I don't want to do it. Use a strong

00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:11.220
action verb and quantify all the achievements, whatever

00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:13.020
achievement that you have mentioned, maybe a certification,

00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:16.660
maybe, uh, any kind of a internship or maybe any kind of a

00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:19.540
price that you have won. So it will do that. Uh, you work

00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:22.100
quickly and deliver the result that passes the, that pass

00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:25.720
the ATS system. So fine. This is the task, which it is, it

00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:28.500
will try to perform again. It needs some model access. Uh.

00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:31.380
Temperature wise. I have just given 0.3, right? Just a

00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:34.280
balanced temperature over here. Maximum iteration one and

00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:36.900
maximum execution time or one 22nd, not more than that. You

00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:40.940
should pay. So this is another agent, which I will end up

00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:45.660
creating. Then there is a another agent, right? Then there

00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:49.020
is another agent. So basically this agent is going to, uh,

00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:53.660
behave like a evaluator. So basically, uh, it is going to

00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:56.420
evaluate my entire resume and it is going to highlight the

00:56:56.420 --> 00:57:01.300
gaps. Okay. I'm saying that your role is as a ATS evaluator

00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:04.420
goal is provide a accurate ATS score and actionable

00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:08.580
improvement recommendation. Backstory is you are precisely a

00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:11.360
ATS scoring expert who quickly identify a gaps and provide

00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:14.800
the specific actionable recommendation. You focus on keyword

00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:18.580
density, uh, section structure and a miserable achievement.

00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:21.300
So this is a story backstory, which I have given to this

00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:24.800
agent. Rest is same. So model temperature, I'm keeping zero

00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:27.160
maximum iteration is equals to one execution time is equals

00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:32.180
to 120.6. So this is my agent number three. Now let's talk

00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:35.880
about the agent number four. So which is going to give me

00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:40.060
the refined polished bullet points with the matrixes over

00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:44.100
the actions. So here, uh, bullet point refiner. This is the

00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:46.880
role. Now what is the goal? Goal transform the bullet point

00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:49.760
into a high impact ATS optimized statement with the strong

00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:53.360
matrices and backstory. You excel at creating a powerful

00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:55.800
bullet points that combine the action of a specific

00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:59.340
achievements and quantify the results. You work efficiently

00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:03.800
to maximize the impact. So these are the four independent

00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:08.120
agents so far we have created. Now this agents are nowhere

00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:10.860
connected to my application or nowhere connected to my data

00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:14.760
even, right? These are just, uh, independent agents I have

00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:18.860
created as simple as that. Now inside this agent, inside

00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:22.000
this crew, a agent. So there is a parameter called as tools,

00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:25.520
right? There is a parameter called as tools. So if you have

00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:29.700
to give an access of tools. Tools. So if you have to give an

00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:33.720
access of a tool, you can try to attach a tool. And again,

00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:37.000
that's optional, right? That's optional. See role, goal,

00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:40.040
backstory, and model. These are the like a parameter, which

00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:42.680
is a mandatory parameter. But as far as this tool is

00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:44.960
concerned, as far as this maximum iteration is concerned, as

00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:47.260
far as this maximum execution time is concerned, temperature

00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:51.100
is concerned. These are technically a optional one. If I

00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:53.700
would like to give an access, I can give it. If I don't want

00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:55.960
to give an access, it's completely fine. It's up to me.

00:58:56.220 --> 00:58:59.880
Basically. How I am designing the entire system. So tool

00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:03.740
means you can give a function access so that my LLM itself

00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:06.960
or my agent itself will be able to call some of the

00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:11.440
function. So I have followed both the approach. I was trying

00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:15.280
to give a tool access to an agent and I have kept all the

00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:17.900
tools means all the functions because those functions were

00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:21.180
required. So I have kept all the functions even as a

00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:24.140
separate function and I have used it separately without even

00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:27.180
passing those tools to the agent. So when I was trying to

00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:30.240
pass this tools to an agent, it was taking a lot of time

00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:34.300
because here LLMs are deciding when I was calling a function

00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:38.180
directly. So technically it was like a pure programmatic way

00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:41.680
of calling those functions. So it was not taking much of the

00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:45.380
time. But in case of my agents calling a tool, it was taking

00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:49.180
a lot of time. And because of that, you must have seen that

00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:52.740
we were getting a time out issue in the beginning. So when

00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:54.680
we have experimented, when we were trying to like a

00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:57.100
generator, as you may, you know, it was taking a lot of time

00:59:57.100 --> 01:00:01.600
again. So I would not have received that timeout issue. If I

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:04.520
can increase our time limit here itself, I can increase,

01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:08.080
right? Maybe it is not able to complete a task one agent

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:10.880
because one agent is nothing but one employee. So if one

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:13.520
employee is not able to complete a particular task in this

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:16.720
given time, maybe I can increase the time and my timeout

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:20.420
issue will be gone. Right? So that was not a very, very big

01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:24.580
issue. We can handle it. And maybe we can give a higher time

01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:27.740
over there. So what I'm trying to say that you can try to

01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:31.580
attach a tools, basically a function with an agent that

01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:35.740
parameter is already available, right? That parameter is

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:39.000
already available. You can even try to attach a memory

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.280
that's completely fine. That is also available. And that is

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:44.780
not available just with the land graph or land chain. It's

01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:48.300
available with all the framework that you are going to use

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:52.920
it. So if I'll talk about a crew AI, right, which is again,

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:57.040
eventually another platform. Right? Another platform. So

01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:00.880
here, uh, if you will go to the official website of crew AI,

01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:04.080
now these are the things that you will be able to configure.

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:07.220
They have clearly mentioned it, right? So you will be able

01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:10.340
to configure basically a task, which we are going to do,

01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:14.660
right? As per our design, we are going to create now a task

01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:18.000
and for every task, we'll give a access to an agent that,

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:20.360
okay, this task will use this agent. This task will use this

01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:23.720
agent. This task will use this agent. So as per the official

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:27.540
website of this crew AI. You can configure a task. So a list

01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:31.520
of the tasks assigned to a crew, right? Uh, agents. So list

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:34.400
of the agent that are part of the crew. You can define the

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:37.600
processes by the way, process flow. So whether it's going to

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.360
be a sequential or it is going to be the hierarchical, you

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:43.200
can try to define a Barbos. Barbos is nothing but a log,

01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:46.260
right? So by default, it will be false if you're going to

01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:49.220
like a keep it true. So it will keep on showing you all the

01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:53.220
internal logs, which agents are producing by the way, you

01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:55.720
can try to give a manager agent. You can try to give a

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:58.440
function calling LLMs. You can try to give a configurations.

01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:02.640
Basically you can try to give a maximum RPM memory part. You

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:05.240
can also give a short term memory, long term memory or the

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:08.640
entire memory. So we have also seen that there is a memory

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:12.240
called as a buffer memory, buffer window memory, KB memory,

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:15.760
knowledge based memory. So all of those options are

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:19.940
available even inside a crew AI. So what I'm, what I'm

01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:23.280
trying to show you over here that we are already aware about

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:27.780
some of the agent TKI frameworks. Now this is not very

01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:31.720
different, right? This is not very different. A base is

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:34.760
same. So whatever philosophy that we have been using in one

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:38.580
of the framework, same philosophy has been used even over

01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:42.160
here and they have created their own library. That's the

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:45.700
only differences you will be able to find out. Some are

01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:49.060
maybe easy to use. Some are a little bit difficult to use,

01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:52.760
but eventually we are doing the exact same thing and

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:55.380
whatever functionality. That you will be able to see or

01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:58.560
whatever theory, right? That we used to learn. It's it's

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:01.360
same everywhere, right? It's the same. It's the same like a

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:04.320
things that they have followed. So catchy. I can try to

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:06.760
integrate that in better. I can try to integrate that. I

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:11.100
believe we all know. So everything that we see in any other

01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:14.380
platform or in any other framework, same thing I will be

01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:18.520
able to find out even inside a crew. Okay. Let me ping you

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:20.300
this link now.

01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:38.980
So here. Let me remove this tool part. Yeah. So agents

01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:42.460
creation is done. Now once my agents creation are done, now

01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:45.260
maybe a model is required, right? Everywhere models are

01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:48.980
required by the way. So model wise, I can try to give any

01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:53.200
model access even from a URI. So and here I'm trying to use

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:57.700
our open AI now coming to an open AI part. So many people

01:03:57.700 --> 01:04:02.720
may be not aware about open AI API key creation. So let me

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:05.680
show you that part. So you can go to Google. If you have an

01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:10.940
open AI account, so open AI API, right? So you can just go

01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:16.280
to a platform.openai.com this particular one. And if you

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:18.780
have an access, maybe if you don't have access, you can try

01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:21.560
to create the account quickly. You can go to this gear

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:24.240
button, a setting, right? You can go to this setting and you

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:27.660
can just go to a API keys. So in a, after going to a gear

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:30.920
button setting, you will be able to see an API key option,

01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:34.380
right? You will be able to see a API key option. And if you

01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:37.100
have to create the API, you can directly click a new secret,

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:41.040
give a name the way you were giving a name in case of a URI,

01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:44.960
and then it will be able to create the API. You can try to

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:47.840
control the restriction permission is equal to all or maybe

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:51.140
restricted. You can try to even give a permission with

01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:55.380
respect to audio completion embedding means one single API

01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:59.160
key and that is going to give you an access of all the

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:03.120
ecosystem of open AI. Right? Whatever model, which is

01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:07.140
available with them, you will be able to access every model

01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:11.780
just with one single API key. This is how easy it is again.

01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:15.360
So whether you are looking for a audio model, chat

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:18.360
completion model, embedding model, image model, everything

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:22.160
will be available and you can even control it that, okay, so

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:25.940
this is the API key and you can just like a switch it on or

01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:29.360
maybe make it off simple as simple as that. So it's just

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:33.280
like using a URI. So it's not very different. It's it's like

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:37.680
a exactly same, you can say and create the API key. So API

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:40.780
key is already available. Like I said, it's already

01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:43.900
available inside your code base, which will be active till

01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:47.580
this class after this class, I'm going to deactivate it. So

01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:51.340
that because anyhow you have a URI API key access. So here

01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:54.580
what I'm trying to do, so I'm trying to set open API key and

01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:58.600
here my model is equal to GPT 4.0 mini. I can try to use any

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.520
other model as well. I can try to use. I can use even a five

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:04.460
series of the GPT that's completely okay. So now every agent

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:07.140
is having a model access, right? Every agent is having a

01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:10.320
model access and by default crew AI is compatible with the

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:15.560
open AI. Right? Almost all the framework which has been

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:17.540
designed, whether it's a lang chain, lang graph, Lama

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:20.740
indexes or crew, everything is first compatible with the

01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:24.140
open AI, whether it's compatible with other like a LLM

01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:27.000
provider or not, but yeah, by default they are making it

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.840
compatible with the open AI. So that you don't have to do

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:34.600
anything. Basically. So this is my agent creation now. So

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:38.120
once my agent creation is done, then what I'm going to do,

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:41.940
so then I'm going to basically create another file called as

01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:48.860
task, task dot Python file. So as we all know that we have

01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:52.280
to define a multiple task one by one, right? One by one. And

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:55.960
then we have to give a access of an agent to this particular

01:06:55.960 --> 01:07:01.040
task. So let's do it right. Let's do it first. So here. Task

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:04.600
wise, what we are going to do. So the very first task is

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:10.100
parse my resume, whatever resume I'm going to send. So it is

01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:14.400
supposed to parse the resume. Now to create a task again,

01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:22.080
crew AI has given you a simple API. So from crew AI, from

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:30.680
crew AI, import basically task. Yeah. Import task. Yeah. Now

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:33.260
this is going to help me out in terms of creating the task

01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:37.020
as simple as that. Now what is the very first task which I'm

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:39.980
going to create? The very first task, which I'm going to

01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:43.400
create over here is parse resume a task. Now what is the

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:45.720
input it is going to take? So it is going to take input is

01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:49.380
equals to agent, right? Input is equal to agent. And then,

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:52.320
uh, whenever I'm going to call it, right, wherever I'm going

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:54.580
to call it. So it is going to take input is equal to agent,

01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:58.320
and then it is going to take resume a text. So here I'm

01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:00.540
creating a independent task. So again, you can. You can

01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:03.800
imagine that, that everything is isolated for now. I'm

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:06.380
going, I have created an independent agents and I have

01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:09.620
created the independent task, but for task requirement is

01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:12.600
agent. And then obviously I'm trying to pass the data over

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:16.040
here. Now once I'm going to pass a data, so I'm just

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.580
limiting it towards a 1500 words by the way. Yeah. 1500

01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:23.120
words over here. And then what it is going to return. So it

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:26.840
is going to return the task, right? So what is a task by the

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:30.420
way? So task wise, you have to give a description. That what

01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:34.060
it is supposed to perform. So I'm saying that, that clean

01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:37.480
the resume a text quickly. So whatever data, which we are

01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:40.240
able to read, clean it quickly. This is the instruction

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:43.500
which I'm giving and then remove artifact, normalize bullet

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:47.020
points, keep all the content, be fast and direct. And to do

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:49.740
this, right, to achieve, this is just a description, right?

01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:52.120
This is just a description, which I'm trying to define. So

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:55.320
not to do this, you can use this agent. So whatever agent

01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:58.260
you are going to provide, it will be using that particular

01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:00.940
agent and I believe agent we have already created, right,

01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:04.780
for like a parsing the entire resume. And what is the output

01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:07.920
which I'm expecting? So again, in a prompt, clean resume a

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.420
text with the proper structure. So this is the output which

01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:14.500
I'm expecting. So basically this task, whenever you are

01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:18.300
going to call, it is going to call an agent. It is going to

01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:22.160
attach with the agents and with the help of agent, it will

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:26.340
try to use this data, technically a resume data, and then it

01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:31.140
is going to perform the task. Simple. Now let's go to the

01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:37.500
next step. Yeah. So here there is another task nomenclature

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:41.780
is same. There is no change at all. So here we are trying to

01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:44.660
give a description. We are trying to attach agents and we

01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:48.040
are saying that this is the expected output for me. So

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:51.300
description wise, I'm saying that, that, okay, a rewriter

01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:54.420
resume for a job title. So whatever job title, which I'm

01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:56.940
trying to provide with respect to a JD, right? Job

01:09:56.940 --> 01:10:00.960
description. Job. Job truncate a JD, right? And resume

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:03.940
truncate a resume. So here I'm saying that, that, okay, uh,

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:07.080
for this particular task, I'm going to provide agent that's

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:10.200
completely fine. One of the agent, and I'm going to provide

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:15.020
a clean resume text, which I'm doing it here, right? Which

01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:18.100
I'm doing it here. So clean resume text. I'm going to

01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:20.540
provide you a job title and I'm going to provide you a job

01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:23.880
description, which is another input, which I'm trying to

01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:26.820
give from my UI side. If you have seen that, right? So. So

01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:29.320
we are trying to give a job title and we are trying to give

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:32.500
a job description and we are trying to pass a resume, but

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:35.340
yeah, so whatever data it is going to give it to me, I'm

01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:38.680
going to pass it here. Clean resume text. This is how I'm

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:42.080
going to configure it. So here, what it will do, it will try

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:45.020
to truncate the resume, truncate a job description, and then

01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:49.220
it is going to fill inside the description. And as per the

01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:52.320
description, it is going to call my agents and it will go

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:54.780
and give an instruction to the agents. Or you can say

01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:58.060
employee that, okay. Uh, this is the description and

01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:00.140
employee will be having its own instruction. Agent will be

01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:02.740
having its own instruction. So basically it is going to call

01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:06.560
the agents and it is going to complete the task as simple as

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:13.780
that now. So next one, right? The next task, which I'm going

01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:18.640
to create is basically a refine a bullet, a task. So again,

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:22.800
it needs an agent. It needs a rewritten resume text. So

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:26.840
whatever this one is going to like, uh, return. So it is

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:30.100
going to rewrite the resume as per my job description and

01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:34.120
job title. So this I'm going to pass inside this one. And

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:37.100
again, I have given a description that Paul is this bullet

01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:39.840
point with the action warps and matrices. I can make it even

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:42.500
lengthy. And if you are going to make it lengthy, it means

01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:45.120
more instruction. If you're going to give that will be

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:47.720
always better, right? That will be always better. And that

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:50.680
is the fine tuning that you can do with respect to your

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:53.460
application that you are trying to create. And then here I'm

01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:56.220
trying to give an agent access. And then. This is the output

01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:59.800
expectation that I have. So again, another task, right? Task

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:03.800
number three. Now task number three, then task number four,

01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:07.180
the evaluation part, right? So for evaluation, so this is

01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:09.580
the task, which is going to take again, an agent access

01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:13.980
final resume text from where, from here, right? Job title,

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:16.940
the original one job description, the original one, because

01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:22.660
it has to evaluate my now produce data, a final data, final

01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:25.320
resume with respect to the activity. So this is the actual

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:28.380
job title and actual job description. Then only it will be

01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:32.220
able to evaluate that whether my resume is ATS compliant or

01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:34.980
not. And then only it will be able to give me the score. At

01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:37.140
the end of the day, I will be interested in to a score,

01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:40.180
right? I will be interested in to the score by the way. So

01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:43.880
here I'm taking a final resume. I'm taking a job title. I'm

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:46.680
taking a job description, the original one, original job

01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:49.360
title, original job description. I'm taking and the final

01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:52.060
resume text from the previous task, right from the previous

01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:55.120
task I'm trying to take. And then I have given our simple

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:58.820
description that, okay, score this resume based on job

01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:02.100
title, based on the truncated job description, based on the

01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:05.400
resume, the final resume that I'm getting over here. And

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:08.840
then rate one to five keyword structure, matrices, verb

01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:11.760
format, return JSON with the overall score between zero to a

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:14.300
hundred, right? So this is a simple instruction I have

01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:17.140
given. And obviously it will be having a worker agent

01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:19.620
access, basically employee access, basically, which is a

01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:23.780
agent by the way over here. And I'm saying that, that I'm

01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:27.320
expecting a output in a JSON format. Clearly I have defined

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:29.960
that in a JSON format, I'm expecting the output. So you must

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:33.920
have seen that it is giving me a basically an output of this

01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:37.460
score into a JSON format, right? Into a JSON format, it is

01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:39.660
trying to give me the output as per my instruction, which I

01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:44.080
have given. So fine. These are the tasks. So independent

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:48.260
agent creation is done. Independent task creation is done.

01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:51.920
Both are independent by the way. Yeah. Nowhere, these two

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:55.540
things are attached at all means literally attached at all.

01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:59.300
These things are not at all connected with any one of these

01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:04.580
making sense guys, all of us. Yeah. So in crew AI agent

01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:08.560
layer and task layer task is actually a main things task is

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:11.860
eventually calling the agents. So here, as you can see, task

01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:14.760
is eventually going to call the agent, whatever agent I

01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:16.980
would like to provide, I can try to provide that particular

01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:20.180
agent access means employee access. So it's a simple,

01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:23.440
simple, simple, similar like a, you can, you can say that

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:27.820
the kind of a work we do across organization inside the

01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:31.120
industry, same, right? Someone is going to define the task

01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:34.080
and some employees going to do the task. Same thing. We are

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:39.760
doing it here. Yes. Same thing. There is no differences. You

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:44.500
will be able to find out a line number 18 and 19. I think

01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:47.700
it's just a Python code, right? So we are trying to like a

01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:50.820
read this Python code. Whatever data, which we are going to

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:53.760
provide. So we are going to read a data till this 1200

01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:56.920
keyword. And then we are trying to check if length of clean

01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:01.780
resume is more than 1200, right? So do this, do this,

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:05.800
otherwise it is a clean resume. I think it's a basic Python

01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:09.820
code. Why you are facing an issue with respect to

01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:13.300
understanding this one is just a kind of a, you know, a

01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:16.520
list. And then we have written a condition over here, right?

01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:19.490
Right? Anyone? Yes.

01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:28.960
Yeah. Any difficulties anyone is facing? It's just a basic

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:32.100
Python code or passing a string. Why we are facing issue

01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:32.440
here.

01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:40.820
Fine. I'm just trying to truncate my data so that, you know,

01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:43.760
even if someone is going to pass a resume with the 10 pages,

01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:46.280
it is, it is not going to work on that. It is just going to

01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:50.100
take a first 1200 or first 1500. I can even control that

01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:53.500
part. Yeah. But I don't think that we should like, you know,

01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:55.820
face any kind of issue and we should be expecting an

01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:58.660
explanation for this. This one, at least this, this like a

01:15:58.660 --> 01:15:59.400
kind of Python code.

01:16:03.310 --> 01:16:10.590
Fine. Okay. Now, so agents are done, task are done. Then

01:16:10.590 --> 01:16:15.910
what? Right. Then what we have to basically do it here. So

01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:20.910
then what we can do, so we can try to create one folder as

01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:27.110
per my project nomenclature called as file tools. Tools.

01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:30.050
Yeah. Which, which is going to help me out in terms of. In

01:16:30.050 --> 01:16:32.990
terms of basically processing the file. So inside that let's

01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:36.170
create a blank underscore underscore I N I T so that a

01:16:36.170 --> 01:16:39.990
package model should not give me an issue dot PI, keep it

01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:44.330
blank. And then inside this folder itself, let's try to give

01:16:44.330 --> 01:16:52.530
a file, a loader for a loader dot PI file. Now so here I'm

01:16:52.530 --> 01:16:55.510
going to create a raw function, a raw Pythonic function. So

01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:57.870
which is going to help me out in terms of processing the

01:16:57.870 --> 01:17:01.170
data. Yeah. In terms of processing the data, because I need

01:17:01.170 --> 01:17:04.590
some function. So which will be able to read a PDF file or

01:17:04.590 --> 01:17:08.930
maybe a document file or maybe a dot TXT file, and it should

01:17:08.930 --> 01:17:12.490
be able to extract a data out of these files. So I need

01:17:12.490 --> 01:17:16.170
these kinds of a function, and this is something that you

01:17:16.170 --> 01:17:19.430
will be able to find out here inside this file loader dot PI

01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:22.890
file. So here the very first function that you will be able

01:17:22.890 --> 01:17:26.850
to see is basically extraction of the data from a PDF file.

01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:29.990
Okay. So if someone is going to pass a resume into a PDF

01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:33.710
format, okay, not an issue. So I'm trying to use a very

01:17:33.710 --> 01:17:37.310
simple library, PDF reader library. I'm not doing anything.

01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:40.330
So technically this PDF library will be able to handle

01:17:40.330 --> 01:17:42.830
everything for me. Everything means literally everything. It

01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:46.030
will be able to read the entire PDF. And here, as you can

01:17:46.030 --> 01:17:49.110
see, so page by page, we are reading it. So page by page,

01:17:49.190 --> 01:17:52.110
this function will try to read the PDF and then it is going

01:17:52.110 --> 01:17:57.450
to create a final list. So where it is going to keep the

01:17:57.450 --> 01:17:58.750
data. It is going to keep everything. So this code is clear

01:17:58.750 --> 01:18:01.330
guys, this part, do you need explanation for this one?

01:18:02.770 --> 01:18:07.910
Simple, read a PDF, run it page by page, and then append it,

01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:11.590
append into a list. Yeah. So now all data will be available.

01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:14.210
So these, these functions are very basic function. I think

01:18:14.210 --> 01:18:16.670
we have already written these functions more than like a

01:18:16.670 --> 01:18:19.470
thousand times in the past. If you have gone through a

01:18:19.470 --> 01:18:24.430
Pythonic lectures, then from a docs, right? So from a docs,

01:18:24.490 --> 01:18:26.610
let's suppose if someone is going to provide a PDF resume.

01:18:27.450 --> 01:18:30.150
You may do a document format. So again, we are not doing

01:18:30.150 --> 01:18:32.790
anything. We are just using a library, a document library,

01:18:32.970 --> 01:18:36.370
and then same thing. So one by one, go through page by page,

01:18:36.430 --> 01:18:39.510
page by page, page by page, and create a list inside that in

01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:42.190
just all the data, whatever pages of the data, whatever data

01:18:42.190 --> 01:18:45.430
is available in all the pages, just ingest it, right? Just

01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:49.150
ingest it. So this is like a raw function, nowhere again

01:18:49.150 --> 01:18:51.750
attached with an agent so far and nowhere it has been

01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:56.850
attached to a, basically like a task so far. Right? So there

01:18:56.850 --> 01:19:01.010
is a final function, which is, which I'm going to use. So

01:19:01.010 --> 01:19:05.130
detect and extract. So basically a person can pass or user

01:19:05.130 --> 01:19:08.550
can pass a PDF file or user can pass a document file. Either

01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:11.830
of these file, right? User can try to pass. So we have to

01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:15.030
like a process of all kinds of files and systems should be

01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:17.950
able to detect it automatically. So here what we are trying

01:19:17.950 --> 01:19:21.410
to do, so whenever someone is going to pass a file, file

01:19:21.410 --> 01:19:23.650
name I'm going to receive. So I'm going to keep it in a

01:19:23.650 --> 01:19:26.850
lower. And then we are trying to check. That if file name

01:19:26.850 --> 01:19:30.430
ends with .pdf, means if it is a PDF file, then call what?

01:19:30.550 --> 01:19:34.610
Call this one. Yeah. Call this function. Simple, which will

01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:38.270
be able to work with a PDF. If it is available into a doc

01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:42.650
format, .docx format, then just call the second function,

01:19:42.750 --> 01:19:46.450
this function. Yeah. Call this function. Simple. Right?

01:19:46.570 --> 01:19:51.090
Simple. And if someone is going to pass something into a

01:19:51.090 --> 01:19:54.470
text format, then return text as simple as that. Just return

01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:57.790
a text over here. So this is the actual function, which I

01:19:57.790 --> 01:20:00.530
will be using. And this function is by default calling PDF

01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:04.150
function and doc function, or maybe a TXT. Depends upon the

01:20:04.150 --> 01:20:08.610
file name that you are going to pass over here, right?

01:20:08.670 --> 01:20:10.670
Whatever file name that you are going to pass over here,

01:20:10.730 --> 01:20:14.870
based on that, it is going to give a call as simple as that.

01:20:15.170 --> 01:20:18.690
Nothing much, which we are trying to do over here. So this

01:20:18.690 --> 01:20:21.150
is just an independent supporter function, which I have

01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:26.910
created inside this file name. It is called tool folder. Now

01:20:26.910 --> 01:20:33.190
close it. So agents is done. Tasks are done. And then file

01:20:33.190 --> 01:20:36.510
reading function is done. Right? File reading function is

01:20:36.510 --> 01:20:44.470
done over here. Now what is next for us? So now, we are

01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:49.230
using basically bytes inside this one. So we are trying to

01:20:49.230 --> 01:20:52.330
provide everything as a bytes. So let's do one thing. So

01:20:52.330 --> 01:20:53.990
let's try to create a spreadsheet. So let's create a small

01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:56.550
util function, which will be able to give me a data as a

01:20:56.550 --> 01:21:04.100
bytes. So here, utils.py file, this is just a supporting

01:21:04.100 --> 01:21:07.240
library I'm trying to create. So which will help me out in

01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:10.140
terms of converting everything into a bytes, right? So text

01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:14.380
to doc to text to docs bytes, basically. So in a byte

01:21:14.380 --> 01:21:16.540
format, it is going to give me a return, just a supporting

01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:19.600
function, because I need everything to be passed as a bytes.

01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:23.300
A reason is very simple. These functions that I'm using over

01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:27.440
here, right? It expects input in that panel, right? So this

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:29.400
is the nomenclature of this function. This is the property

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:31.840
of this particular function, which I'm using. And if it

01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:34.300
requires something in a byte format, I have to convert it.

01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:37.260
So this is just a type conversion, which I'm doing. So over

01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:41.060
there, my utils function will come into picture. Now let's

01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:46.140
do a main job. What is the main job? By the way, the main

01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:51.480
job is to create a crew now. Yeah. Because now I have a

01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:56.080
task. I have agents. I have all those utility functions,

01:21:56.180 --> 01:21:59.740
which is going to read out my files. So now it's time to

01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:03.840
create a crew. Crew means this entire flow or this entire

01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:07.200
processes. This is the entire crew, which I have to create.

01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:11.360
I have to attach each and every crew members with everyone

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:15.440
because all this tasks are basically a members, right? And

01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:18.720
these agents are nothing but employee who's like attached

01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:22.200
with this members task, you can say. Okay. And now I have to

01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:26.160
build this entire funnel that, okay, do this, call this one

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:28.680
first, then this one for second, then this one third, and

01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:31.960
then that one fourth in this way. So now let's go ahead and

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:36.460
let's try to create a file called as crew C R E W dot PI

01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:41.520
file. Now what we are going to do with respect to a crew. So

01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:45.200
here, first of all, do the import through AI. So import crew

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.980
and import a processes. These two imports are required.

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:52.720
Okay. Okay. Okay. So you can import agents as well as try to

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:56.600
import your task both. So from an agent file, we are trying

01:22:56.600 --> 01:23:00.940
to import a build parser agent, build ATS writer agent,

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:04.060
build evaluator agent, build refiner agent. So all the

01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:07.320
agents will be available in this file and then task. So

01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:10.900
parse resume a task, rewrite for ATS task, evaluate ATS task

01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:14.300
and refine bullet task. So now all the agents and all the

01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:17.940
tasks will be available inside this file, which I'm going to

01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:20.880
use to build a crew. The final step you can say. Right?

01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:24.120
Final step. And then the last step will be my UI interface

01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:27.940
where I will connect because the UI is doing what just, uh,

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:30.680
it is trying to take a data input and then whatever data

01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:33.480
system is going to return. It is going to show it to you.

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:37.280
This is what my UI interface is doing. Nothing much by the

01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:42.040
way, right? Nothing much. So here, uh, agents are available,

01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:47.100
tasks are available. Now I will try to build my crew over

01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:50.860
here. So how I can try to build my crew again. It's a

01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:55.540
standard approach to build a crew. So here there is a

01:23:55.540 --> 01:23:58.420
function called as build crew. I'm just trying to call build

01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:02.000
parse agent, build ATS writer agent. So all the agents, all

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.200
the agents, and I'm trying to store it inside the variable

01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:06.980
so that I can use this variable. You can use this directly

01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:10.260
function, direct function. That's okay. Right. But, uh, just

01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:14.040
to make it clean. So we are using this variable. So inside

01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:16.920
this parser variable, this agent is available. And what is

01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:20.860
this agent? Same that we have created. Right? The agent that

01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:23.180
we have already created. So this agent is like a nothing

01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:26.260
different. And again, writer agent, we have already done

01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:29.740
that, right? We have already created it. So whatever agent

01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:32.780
that we have created, these agents that we have created, so

01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:36.200
we are just trying to store it into a variable. Okay, fine.

01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:39.940
Then we are trying to call what? Then we are trying to call

01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:45.560
a task. Like I said in a beginning itself, so there will be

01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:48.540
a task and for every task we are going to assign the

01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:52.640
employee. Technically an agent, right? So for every task we

01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:56.300
are going to apply them agents. And this is what we have

01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:59.860
done while we were trying to create the task, right? So task

01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:03.800
was trying to take what agents and then data, right? This is

01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:07.900
what this task we're trying to take as an input. So one by

01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:10.800
one in a sequential manner, what we are trying to do. So

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:14.860
first of all, I'm trying to call a resume a task. Now this

01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:17.680
resume a task is taking two inputs. One is an agent and one

01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:21.880
is a raw resume. Okay. So I'm trying to give a parser agent

01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:25.520
access to a parse resume a task. And then I'm trying to

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:28.800
provide the raw resume data, which I will be getting from my

01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:32.640
UI interface after reading the data with the help of some of

01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:35.640
my utility function, the utility function for a PDF and a

01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:39.620
doc reader that I have already created. Now once this is

01:25:39.620 --> 01:25:43.140
done, right? Once this part is done, once I will be able to

01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:48.440
parse the entire resume, this task will be done. Okay. So

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:51.980
then I'm trying to call task number two, rewrite for a ATS

01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:56.080
task and a here. So I'm trying to pass a agent. So I'm

01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:59.600
trying to give an access of writer agent by the way, right?

01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:05.420
Then I'm trying to give a clean resume access to this one as

01:26:05.420 --> 01:26:10.660
a parameter job title and a job description, simple job

01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:13.840
title and job description. So now you can say that, that,

01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:17.400
okay, you have defined this clean resume now from where we

01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:20.900
are getting this clean resume, obviously from a previous

01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:24.140
task. Yeah. Yeah. Just a placeholder. Obviously from the

01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:29.460
previous task, we are getting a clean resume symbol. So from

01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:31.700
the previous task, we are getting the clean resume to the

01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:34.460
next one. And this is what we are going to attach it here.

01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:40.140
So again, a third task, refine a bullet points. I have given

01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:44.840
the access to the agent and then the previous input as an

01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:47.700
previous output as an input to the next one. Then the fourth

01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:53.220
one, agent access, and then the rest of the access as per

01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:55.440
the parameter. So whatever task which I have created and

01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:59.920
whatever parameter it takes. So my task is done over here,

01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:05.080
right? My task is done. Now how to create a team who will,

01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:08.980
because now my team is like, Oh, there is one team. Then

01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:10.920
there is a second team. There is a third team and there is a

01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:13.700
fourth team. Or maybe I have a four employee or you can say

01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:16.480
I have a four team either way. It's completely fine. You can

01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:19.840
take any of these analogy. That's fine. So I have to

01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:24.060
basically align those entire team. So obviously I need a

01:27:24.060 --> 01:27:26.860
leader manager. So this is where this crew will come into a

01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:30.260
picture. So it is going to attach a team in a sequence that,

01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:32.680
okay, you will do this. You will do that. You will do that,

01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:36.600
but in a sequence. So who will come first and who will come

01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:41.540
last? That depends upon my crew. So this is the actual code

01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:44.840
where I'm creating my crew, or you can say I'm creating my

01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:49.460
team. And this will be responsible for running a task one

01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:55.100
after another. Is it making sense to all of us guys crew? So

01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:58.500
here I have given agents, parser agent first, then second,

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:01.260
then third, then fourth task wise. First, you should do

01:28:01.260 --> 01:28:04.620
this, do this, do this, do this, and how it will process. So

01:28:04.620 --> 01:28:07.060
I have simply said that in a sequential manner, not in a

01:28:07.060 --> 01:28:09.800
hierarchical means kind of a tree structure, right? Graph

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:12.460
structure, whatever we were able to achieve kind of in a

01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:15.360
land graph, that kind of a structure. But no. Go in a

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:18.980
sequential manner. Yes. Not in a hierarchical manner. Go in

01:28:18.980 --> 01:28:21.180
a sequential manner because crew AI provides you even a

01:28:21.180 --> 01:28:23.500
hierarchical approach. So you can even follow that

01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:25.780
particular approach where you can try to create a fork joint

01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:29.320
loops, all those things. So here in a sequential manner, you

01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:32.540
have to go. So do this task, then do this task, then do this

01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:35.700
task, then do this task. And this task already knows that

01:28:35.700 --> 01:28:38.540
what I have to use, which agent I have to use, right? Which

01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:41.240
employee I have to use to complete this task and what kind

01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:44.800
of input I will be able to get, right? Now, this task

01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:47.180
already knows that, okay, what kind of an agent I have to

01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:49.640
use and what is the input I will be able to get. This task

01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:52.180
already knows, and this task already knows, Bhavos is equal

01:28:52.180 --> 01:28:55.100
to true, means give me the log. Simple. Inside my console.

01:28:55.380 --> 01:28:59.660
You can make it off. By default, it will be false. So are

01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:02.520
you able to understand? So this is the only thing that we

01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:05.400
have to achieve guys. This is how we are creating a crew AI.

01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:09.820
That's it. In the highlighted code, only three to four line.

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:16.580
Yes. Which one will run first? Agent or task? Okay. You guys

01:29:16.580 --> 01:29:17.800
tell me, which one will run first?

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:27.760
Yes. I think you got the answer in the chat. I mean like

01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:32.400
people are seeing agent, first task, right? Agent is

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:35.860
basically an employee. So if I'm not assigning you a task,

01:29:35.980 --> 01:29:38.280
let's suppose you are my students, right? Obviously you are

01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:42.420
my students. There is no doubt about it, but yeah. So if I'm

01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:45.900
not giving you a task, what you will do? How you will

01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:49.040
activate yourself? Right? So obviously task will come into a

01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:52.560
picture and task is calling, see simply I have shown you

01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:55.540
here. These are the tasks, right? Task is calling what? Task

01:29:55.540 --> 01:29:56.400
is calling agent.

01:29:59.310 --> 01:30:02.150
Yes. We have, we have given that, right? So see this task

01:30:02.150 --> 01:30:04.450
calling which agent, parser agent, we have already written

01:30:04.450 --> 01:30:08.450
this agent over here. So my task is technically calling a

01:30:08.450 --> 01:30:12.430
respective agents. This is what I have defined right over

01:30:12.430 --> 01:30:16.230
here. Yeah. So here I have created my team. My entire crew

01:30:16.230 --> 01:30:19.750
is ready to perform this entire task. One by one, one by

01:30:19.750 --> 01:30:23.170
one, I can attach one agent, two agent, three agent. I can

01:30:23.170 --> 01:30:28.790
attach one agent to all the tasks possible. Yeah. If all the

01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:31.930
tasks requires a similar kind of agent, I can, I can do

01:30:31.930 --> 01:30:35.390
that. I can just use it. Right. Just, just a minute guys.

01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:41.760
Hello. Hi sir. I am already sitting in class. Hello. Yes

01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:48.260
sir. Yes, so tell me, my class has given me some time. We

01:30:48.260 --> 01:30:50.680
said after 12-1 o'clock. But it will not be possible. I am

01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:53.420
already sitting in class. In the middle of the class. No,

01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:55.600
no, no, we did not say no actually. We told them that we

01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:58.020
will be available only after 12-1 o'clock, after 11.30-12 o

01:30:58.020 --> 01:30:58.140
'clock.

01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:02.830
Yes, exactly sir. That is why. So other people should not be

01:31:02.830 --> 01:31:05.250
convinced. By the way, we are the most useless singers in

01:31:05.250 --> 01:31:09.050
the entire group. So I think they will not be able to eat

01:31:09.050 --> 01:31:09.410
our lack.

01:31:14.050 --> 01:31:17.670
Okay, okay. Okay sir. Okay sir. Bye. Bye.

01:31:23.230 --> 01:31:27.310
Okay. So yeah. So basically we have agents and we have a

01:31:27.310 --> 01:31:29.250
task. And we set that on the table. Okay, whenever you are

01:31:29.250 --> 01:31:31.370
trying to run these things, run in a sequential manner. Do

01:31:31.370 --> 01:31:33.810
not run in a hierarchical manner. I do not like because I do

01:31:33.810 --> 01:31:36.050
not want a graph structure over here. It should go in a

01:31:36.050 --> 01:31:40.390
sequential manner. So this is what it will do. This is the

01:31:40.390 --> 01:31:42.610
main code by the way. This is the main piece of the code.

01:31:42.730 --> 01:31:45.290
Only these three, four lines. Apart from that, it is

01:31:45.290 --> 01:31:47.530
nothing. You can create any number of tasks. You can create

01:31:47.530 --> 01:31:52.710
any number of agents and do whatever you want. Yeah. Now, so

01:31:52.710 --> 01:31:56.770
this main task is done. Crew is ready. Right. My entire team

01:31:56.770 --> 01:32:00.550
is ready. Now, what I have to do? Pass the data. Simple.

01:32:00.850 --> 01:32:06.470
Right. Pass the data and initiate it, run it basically. So

01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:11.250
to do that, we can try to create a run pipeline. So there is

01:32:11.250 --> 01:32:17.110
a code which has been implemented. So crew is created,

01:32:17.230 --> 01:32:23.230
right. Run pipeline. So what, so basically my UI is going to

01:32:23.230 --> 01:32:25.530
call this function, right. And this function will be calling

01:32:25.530 --> 01:32:28.870
like other things. So here a run pipeline. So what this run

01:32:28.870 --> 01:32:32.290
pipeline is doing? So this is just a same agent copy and

01:32:32.290 --> 01:32:34.690
pasted. You can use the previous function. That's up to you

01:32:34.690 --> 01:32:39.430
now. So we are trying to call this task and we are trying to

01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:43.710
say that, okay, uh, built so independent one, right? So

01:32:43.710 --> 01:32:46.350
basically independently task I'm trying to call. So I'm

01:32:46.350 --> 01:32:50.050
saying that, that, okay, uh, just try to like create a crew,

01:32:50.190 --> 01:32:54.330
use this parser and use this task and run it, run it means

01:32:54.330 --> 01:32:56.850
kick off, kick off is going to actually call, call the

01:32:56.850 --> 01:33:01.730
actual. Uh, you know, the final execution. So a crew, this

01:33:01.730 --> 01:33:05.310
crew. So means just try to kick off the first one, this one,

01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:11.510
yeah, kick off the first one. Now second, this one again,

01:33:11.570 --> 01:33:15.770
call kickoff same, right? Then third. So independently, I'm

01:33:15.770 --> 01:33:18.990
trying to run one by one, one by one, one by one, one by

01:33:18.990 --> 01:33:23.450
one, each and everything. And finally it should be able to

01:33:23.450 --> 01:33:27.530
give me, so once I will be able to like, uh, do this. So.

01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:30.630
Finally, it should be able to give me cleaned rewritten

01:33:30.630 --> 01:33:35.590
final resume evaluation. So why I have done that, see, just

01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:39.610
try to understand this part, uh, every task, right? Every

01:33:39.610 --> 01:33:42.830
task is giving me some sort of output, right? Every task is

01:33:42.830 --> 01:33:45.770
giving me, so this task is giving me one output, clean

01:33:45.770 --> 01:33:50.630
resume. This task is giving me a rewritten resume. This task

01:33:50.630 --> 01:33:53.230
is giving me all the highlights, bullets, points, and then

01:33:53.230 --> 01:33:57.030
next task is going to give me maybe a ATS score. So what I'm

01:33:57.030 --> 01:34:00.970
trying to do. So from every task, whatever output I will

01:34:00.970 --> 01:34:04.270
get, I am trying to return because that's, that's maybe a

01:34:04.270 --> 01:34:07.370
need, right? Uh, maybe that's, that could not be a need and

01:34:07.370 --> 01:34:10.250
that could be a need. So in my cases, I have to show you the

01:34:10.250 --> 01:34:13.750
output that, okay, this agent or this task is giving me this

01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:17.050
as an output, this as an output. So independently I'm

01:34:17.050 --> 01:34:20.490
running all of these tasks. Let's suppose I'm not worried

01:34:20.490 --> 01:34:24.470
about, uh, like a independent output from each and every

01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:27.050
task. I can just avoid it. I can just. I can just avoid

01:34:27.050 --> 01:34:31.330
calling all of these things independently. All of this one

01:34:31.330 --> 01:34:33.890
crew at a time, one crew member at a time. I could have

01:34:33.890 --> 01:34:39.210
called the entire crew member like before at a time. So like

01:34:39.210 --> 01:34:43.670
I said, this is the process of creating a crew. There is a

01:34:43.670 --> 01:34:47.290
possibility that I can keep only one agent and only one

01:34:47.290 --> 01:34:50.990
task. Simple. It's a list, right? I can try to pass any

01:34:50.990 --> 01:34:54.170
number of agent or maybe single one and this is what I'm

01:34:54.170 --> 01:34:57.410
trying to do. Because I'm looking for output, which I have

01:34:57.410 --> 01:35:00.870
to show it to my students that, okay, this task is giving me

01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:04.430
this output. This task is giving this output. So same crew I

01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:08.110
have used, as you can see, uh, again, nomenclature is same

01:35:08.110 --> 01:35:10.790
for this entire things, creating this particular crew.

01:35:11.110 --> 01:35:13.930
Nothing has changed. The only thing is I'm using one, one,

01:35:13.930 --> 01:35:17.070
one, one, one, one at a time. And every step is going to

01:35:17.070 --> 01:35:19.830
return me some output means every crew is going to return me

01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:22.110
some output. I'm just trying to show you. And I'm going to

01:35:22.110 --> 01:35:28.030
show this one. Into a UI part. As well. So this is this now,

01:35:28.110 --> 01:35:31.870
once this part is done, right? Once this entire part is

01:35:31.870 --> 01:35:35.810
done. So my crew is ready. My agent's task, everything is

01:35:35.810 --> 01:35:39.470
ready. And now I'm able to attach it, right? Now I'm able to

01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:42.830
attach. And now I know that every crew can give me output

01:35:42.830 --> 01:35:45.830
its own output, which I can see, which I can visualize in a

01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:50.550
easiest possible manner. Now what is next? So the next part

01:35:50.550 --> 01:35:56.190
is you have to basically create a UI interface. Now. So on

01:35:56.190 --> 01:36:00.510
top of this entire things on top of this entire things, I

01:36:00.510 --> 01:36:04.290
have to create basically a UI interface where I will try to

01:36:04.290 --> 01:36:08.910
pass three things resume job title, job description rest.

01:36:09.090 --> 01:36:12.550
I'm going to call run and it will be able to run each and

01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:18.710
everything. So now let's try to call the streamlint part,

01:36:18.870 --> 01:36:20.750
which is like a final part by the way.

01:36:33.980 --> 01:36:37.920
Yeah. So. So majorly this streamlint part is like a, just a

01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:42.020
UI part. So this is like a nothing different. So we are

01:36:42.020 --> 01:36:44.160
setting, this is something that we do in all the

01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:47.780
applications, I believe. So we are giving a title. We are

01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:50.980
like a giving this write up over here. We are trying to

01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:53.520
create a sidebar where we are trying to show that, that we

01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:58.080
are using like a GPT 4.0 mini kind of a things simple. And

01:36:58.080 --> 01:37:02.200
then we are trying to create three fields, one field, upload

01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:05.280
your file in a PDF format, doc format or text format. Okay.

01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:09.220
Another field for a job title and another field for a job

01:37:09.220 --> 01:37:12.440
description. So these are the three input we are trying to

01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:15.840
take only three inputs we are trying to take from the UI

01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:21.700
side. So your resume, your title and your description, and

01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:25.820
then we are giving you a button so that run the button. Now

01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:28.380
when you are going to click on this button, so if this

01:37:28.380 --> 01:37:31.940
button is true, means if you have clicked on this button, it

01:37:31.940 --> 01:37:35.720
will start doing this entire processes. So what is the first

01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:38.680
process it is going to do? So basically the very first

01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:42.540
process is whatever file that you have passed, extract a

01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:46.320
data out of it. Right now to extract our data, we have

01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:49.300
already written a function, right? What is the function? So

01:37:49.300 --> 01:37:52.240
detect and extract. So this is the function we have already

01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:57.720
written. It is not able to understand. Maybe there is a

01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:04.920
import issue. Let me check, detect and extract. Okay. So.

01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:07.060
Okay. So crew app file tool file.

01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:17.630
Okay. Fine. So there is no crew app hierarchy. There is

01:38:17.630 --> 01:38:25.390
directly a file tool. Okay. Remove this part to remove this

01:38:25.390 --> 01:38:31.790
part as well. Now it is able to detect fine. So here there

01:38:31.790 --> 01:38:34.070
was another separate folder I have created in the previous

01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:36.750
one, but yeah, here I have not created that, but I've just

01:38:36.750 --> 01:38:39.690
aligned it. So now it can identify this function, this

01:38:39.690 --> 01:38:42.690
function and this function. So here what we are trying to

01:38:42.690 --> 01:38:46.790
do. So once you will be able to click on this button, now

01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:49.010
whatever data, three data that you have passed, it will

01:38:49.010 --> 01:38:51.410
start processing it. So first it is going to call what

01:38:51.410 --> 01:38:55.830
detect and extract function, right? So here it is going to

01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:59.230
call up dot name. What is up by the way, up is a variable,

01:38:59.390 --> 01:39:02.130
which is trying to take this files, right? So up dot name.

01:39:02.230 --> 01:39:05.210
So it is going to take the file names and then entire file

01:39:05.210 --> 01:39:09.390
read. These are the two parameter. So file name and file

01:39:09.390 --> 01:39:11.610
reading it is going to do. These are the two parameter it is

01:39:11.610 --> 01:39:14.610
going to pass and then it will try to identify that whether

01:39:14.610 --> 01:39:17.650
it's a PDF, whether it's a docs, if it is a PDF, call

01:39:17.650 --> 01:39:20.850
extract PDF function. If it is a document, call a document

01:39:20.850 --> 01:39:25.090
function, simple, right? Now it is going to give me two

01:39:25.090 --> 01:39:28.270
things, this one and this one. So I'm going to use like a,

01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:32.370
this raw text, whatever text that it is going to return. It

01:39:32.370 --> 01:39:34.990
is going to give me extension ext, ext is nothing but dot

01:39:34.990 --> 01:39:39.530
PDF or dot docs or dot ext, and we will start processing it.

01:39:39.530 --> 01:39:44.990
So here we are like a going to call basically this main

01:39:44.990 --> 01:39:48.550
part, which is our run pipeline. Now what is this run

01:39:48.550 --> 01:39:52.090
pipeline by the way? So as you can see, run pipeline is

01:39:52.090 --> 01:39:58.790
taking three things, resume, raw data, job title, raw job

01:39:58.790 --> 01:40:02.770
description, raw, and eventually this is calling the entire

01:40:02.770 --> 01:40:05.470
sort, right? This is calling the entire sort, right? One by

01:40:05.470 --> 01:40:08.870
one, it is calling the crew members by the way. So run

01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:11.650
pipeline. Okay. Again, and here I'm trying to provide a raw

01:40:11.650 --> 01:40:14.970
data, the raw data, which I'm getting from the resume. Oh,

01:40:14.990 --> 01:40:16.530
sorry. This, this particular function, which is getting

01:40:16.530 --> 01:40:19.910
coming from the resume by the way, job title, which again,

01:40:20.010 --> 01:40:25.880
I'm getting from here input and job description, which is

01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:29.100
again, I'm getting from the input and this run pipeline is

01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:32.460
returning four things, right? It is returning. What it is

01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:34.860
returning for things means it is returning the output of

01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:38.980
four tasks, cleaned, rewritten, final resume and evaluation.

01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:46.100
Okay. So it is returning four things to me and rest is just

01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:49.740
a story by the way. So once I will be able to get this, I

01:40:49.740 --> 01:40:54.460
have to just showcase in tab number zero, this clean data,

01:40:54.820 --> 01:40:59.880
tab number one, rewritten data, tab number three, final

01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:03.380
resume, tab number four evaluation. So the main task has

01:41:03.380 --> 01:41:06.760
been done by this and before that we are parsing the data

01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:09.820
only this much is required. Okay. Is it making sense to all

01:41:09.820 --> 01:41:13.400
of us guys? So is it, is it tough by the way, or is it like

01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:16.240
a easy, I think it's a very plain Python code.

01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:23.680
Yeah. Pretty much easy. Right. We are, we're not doing much

01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:26.380
by the way, even Python code wise. So this is the beauty of

01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:30.080
agentic AI. So like just by writing some sort of a prompt,

01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:34.940
majority of things has been handled. See the main power you

01:41:34.940 --> 01:41:40.120
will be able to see, right? Like gets into a prompt by the

01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:44.280
way. So here we can write anything in English. Right? Now

01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:48.560
just imagine if you have to do the exact same thing via

01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:52.820
coding, how many line of code you will end up writing? Just

01:41:52.820 --> 01:41:55.680
read any of this backstory, any, any means literally any

01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:59.420
backstory of any agents. Now just imagine that if you have

01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:05.060
to perform this operation via, via code, not via LLMs, how

01:42:05.060 --> 01:42:07.300
many line of code you will end up writing and then, then

01:42:07.300 --> 01:42:10.340
like you will write a code, you will debug it. Right. Right.

01:42:10.340 --> 01:42:14.060
And it will increase a lot of complexity. Can I say that?

01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:14.960
Yes.

01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:23.940
Yeah. Maybe just to fulfill one backstory, just to fulfill

01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:27.620
one single backstory, maybe thousand, maybe 10,000 line of

01:42:27.620 --> 01:42:30.260
code you will end up writing. Maybe you will end up creating

01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:33.740
10, 20 different, different file and you will end up

01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:37.320
maintaining it. So are you able to understand the benefit of

01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:44.970
using agentic AI agents by the way? Yeah. Just, just read

01:42:44.970 --> 01:42:47.450
any backstory. Any backstory that we have given. Even to any

01:42:47.450 --> 01:42:50.810
agents. Right. And if you have to fulfill that, how many

01:42:50.810 --> 01:42:54.690
line of a code and with the help of this LLMs eventually

01:42:54.690 --> 01:43:00.090
called by my agents, right? Even I'm not even writing a code

01:43:00.090 --> 01:43:03.050
by the way. Right. I'm just giving a prompt to it that,

01:43:03.110 --> 01:43:06.490
okay, do this, do that. So this is where the power of agents

01:43:06.490 --> 01:43:09.970
comes into a picture. And this is where this agents are

01:43:09.970 --> 01:43:13.790
different. It's agentic AI approach is different. And the

01:43:13.790 --> 01:43:17.470
legacy one, right? So where we used to do automation. But by

01:43:17.470 --> 01:43:20.650
writing a code, by writing some sort of a condition, by

01:43:20.650 --> 01:43:23.530
observing each and everything, but again, everything is

01:43:23.530 --> 01:43:27.030
having a pros and cons in, in terms of like a legacy system.

01:43:27.230 --> 01:43:29.590
So obviously if you have written some condition, it will

01:43:29.590 --> 01:43:33.550
work in that way. But in case of agents, you have to be very

01:43:33.550 --> 01:43:39.130
much careful with respect to your prompts. Right. If you are

01:43:39.130 --> 01:43:42.830
not careful about it, then it will hallucinate for sure.

01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:49.000
Why do we have both build crew in this one? I have shown you

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.640
that you can try to create a one single team, or you can try

01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:54.620
to use even an independent team. I have not using it. I'm

01:43:54.620 --> 01:43:56.540
just showing you that, okay, this is the crew which I've

01:43:56.540 --> 01:44:00.000
created, but as I need the output of each and every steps.

01:44:00.220 --> 01:44:03.120
So I have just separated it instead of calling this one.

01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:05.180
Let's suppose if I'm not looking for all the outputs, maybe

01:44:05.180 --> 01:44:08.940
I'm looking for like something from the final stage. I can

01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:13.680
just like a call the crew one, you call function, kickoff

01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:16.040
function is the actual function, which initiates or which

01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:18.420
starts the crew. A particular team. All

01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:33.060
of these things are basically a placeholder, placeholder of

01:44:33.060 --> 01:44:36.960
an agents. So agents are transferring. That's the reason. So

01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:38.620
inside the curly braces, we have written those.

01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:45.440
It's an agents. So one agent output will go into the next

01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:46.660
one, the next one, the next one.

01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:59.360
Yeah. Okay. So hope we all are able to understand it now.

01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:17.380
So once everything is done, maybe I can just like a, I think

01:45:17.380 --> 01:45:21.180
API key is already available. It will be able to take this

01:45:21.180 --> 01:45:23.740
API key now.

01:46:06.210 --> 01:46:09.530
So it's time to run the application. So now if I have to run

01:46:09.530 --> 01:46:11.870
the application, simply I have to call like a streamlint app

01:46:11.870 --> 01:46:16.270
and then it will be able to run it. So S T R E A M L I T

01:46:16.270 --> 01:46:20.330
streamlint run, and then a streamlint app.py file.

01:46:23.970 --> 01:46:27.550
So yeah, it will start my application.

01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:33.500
Attempt retrieving border known the attempted relative

01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:37.160
import with no known parameters. Okay.

01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:44.740
So parse resume a streamlint app line number six model from

01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:49.880
crew import or run pipeline. Okay. Agent import. So this

01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:57.860
seems to be my init issue. Let's check. So I think I should

01:46:57.860 --> 01:47:01.480
create one more crew

01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:10.020
is fine file tool in it is fine board

01:47:36.860 --> 01:47:39.160
with no known parent model.

01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:46.360
Okay. It

01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:30.700
is able to identify. So from, yeah,

01:48:53.940 --> 01:48:57.560
so it was just a module conflict issue. I have just removed

01:48:57.560 --> 01:49:02.320
a dot and then it, it is working right simple. So now you

01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:06.880
can pass a resume simple and I can give a job description,

01:49:07.100 --> 01:49:09.560
maybe machine learning engineer as a title, machine learning

01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:13.680
engineer as a JD run the agent. Now if you will check in a

01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:18.140
backend, so it is going to kick off the crew one by one, as

01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:19.640
you can see. Right. it took a couple of moments around at

01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:19.640
say. is a considered user when this is a video program for

01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:22.860
AI in your console and what ever. So because I have kept a

01:49:22.860 --> 01:49:25.640
burNothing is equal to two minutes, you will be able to see

01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:29.240
everything, everything here. Slight, everything was

01:49:29.240 --> 01:49:31.260
literally, you will be able to see each and every DJ Qision,

01:49:31.300 --> 01:49:34.500
what it is trying to do. And would you like to view the

01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:38.320
education trace? Yeah, let's, let's see it. Okay.

01:49:46.170 --> 01:49:48.790
All, but still

01:50:46.070 --> 01:50:47.350
that is okay. Because I'm doing business means them without,

01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:51.430
and if I give you a functional per. Yes. Let's, let's see it

01:50:51.430 --> 01:50:53.490
yesterday. Actually, perfect. And then test it.

01:51:03.710 --> 01:51:07.910
Yeah. So now I'm able to get the report 75% is overall

01:51:07.910 --> 01:51:11.310
score. And again, there is a lot of chances and a lot of

01:51:11.310 --> 01:51:13.710
like a things which I can do over here in terms of

01:51:13.710 --> 01:51:16.930
enhancement. So final refined a bullet points a skill set

01:51:16.930 --> 01:51:19.850
professional all the output which I'm looking for I can I

01:51:19.850 --> 01:51:23.350
can get it here, right? So everything is available to me and

01:51:23.350 --> 01:51:26.090
you can test it with your own resume and then let me know.

01:51:26.290 --> 01:51:30.310
So whether you are able to get a result or not the final

01:51:30.310 --> 01:51:34.450
result that you are looking for or not. Now and here you can

01:51:34.450 --> 01:51:37.630
come and you can even try to check the entire traces entire

01:51:37.630 --> 01:51:41.750
logs over here. So here as you can see inside my streamlint

01:51:41.750 --> 01:51:48.510
app. So I'm trying to call basically my agents and I'm

01:51:48.510 --> 01:51:54.190
trying to call tab zero. This one is fine. Okay, so I'm

01:51:54.190 --> 01:51:57.310
trying to call this run pipeline fine. I'm trying to call

01:51:57.310 --> 01:52:00.550
basically run pipeline. Now if I would like to call this

01:52:00.550 --> 01:52:04.110
This build crew function directly I can do that as well so

01:52:04.110 --> 01:52:06.930
that it will be able to you know, like take this entire crew

01:52:06.930 --> 01:52:11.210
all together and then it will be able to execute all of this

01:52:11.210 --> 01:52:14.290
crew in a sequential manner and finally it will be able to

01:52:14.290 --> 01:52:17.370
give me all crew output together. So that is that is also

01:52:17.370 --> 01:52:19.450
possible. I'm leaving up to you. So if you would like to do

01:52:19.450 --> 01:52:24.630
it you can just go ahead and you can do it. So it making

01:52:24.630 --> 01:52:29.110
sense guys. Yeah, I think it's a easy implementation, but

01:52:29.110 --> 01:52:33.390
finally we are able to achieve a task. And if you are going

01:52:33.390 --> 01:52:37.430
to do a refinement then you can try to make it as a product.

01:52:38.030 --> 01:52:41.390
The next step is so whatever output system is giving it to

01:52:41.390 --> 01:52:44.310
you. You have to show it to the user in a beautiful manner.

01:52:44.650 --> 01:52:47.690
So maybe in a beautiful PDF format. So maybe you can try to

01:52:47.690 --> 01:52:50.770
select hundreds of different different like a resume

01:52:50.770 --> 01:52:54.350
templates and you can just give an option to an user that

01:52:54.350 --> 01:52:56.850
choose any of this template and any of this template. I'm

01:52:56.850 --> 01:53:00.190
going to give you your final resume and open it up as a

01:53:00.190 --> 01:53:05.430
service to the entire world. Yes, you can even try to make

01:53:05.430 --> 01:53:09.450
some sort of a like a tuning in terms of you know,

01:53:09.450 --> 01:53:14.410
optimizing the entire processes that is also possible those

01:53:25.550 --> 01:53:29.690
who are facing this module issue, right? So basically try to

01:53:29.690 --> 01:53:33.570
check whether it is able to recognize your functions or not,

01:53:33.670 --> 01:53:36.690
which is available in other file is just a simple Pythonic

01:53:36.690 --> 01:53:41.290
issue guys. I believe you will be able to solve it. Yeah, I

01:53:41.290 --> 01:53:45.900
have already solved it. I was getting the same error. It's

01:53:45.900 --> 01:53:48.960
just a module conflict issue nothing much. So it is not able

01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:50.360
to reach out to that particular file.

01:53:55.630 --> 01:53:58.890
It's not an installation issue. Basically. It's basically a

01:53:58.890 --> 01:54:02.030
module issue. Your modules are already available. You just

01:54:02.030 --> 01:54:03.730
have to call it to

01:54:06.260 --> 01:54:09.900
run this application. We may need to have a open AI key not

01:54:09.900 --> 01:54:13.500
necessarily. I have used open AI key go with the URI both

01:54:13.500 --> 01:54:18.600
will work because URI is also providing you GPT-4 models.

01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:24.780
You just need a LLM access not open. AI you can try to use

01:54:24.780 --> 01:54:28.200
LLM from any other plate for maybe you can try to use even a

01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:31.460
local LLMs. Maybe you can host your own element then use

01:54:31.460 --> 01:54:37.040
that LLM simple. It just need a LLM access. That's it means

01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:38.460
some model you

01:54:43.450 --> 01:54:47.890
can use URI SDK or maybe you have to like a use some sort of

01:54:47.890 --> 01:54:50.630
a vibe coding and then you can try to create a wrapper. It's

01:54:50.630 --> 01:54:53.170
just a single class wrapper. Basically. It's a pidentic

01:54:53.170 --> 01:54:55.450
wrapper that we try to create so that we can make any

01:54:55.450 --> 01:55:00.290
external API compatible with. A crew AI or maybe a lang

01:55:00.290 --> 01:55:03.290
chain or lang graph. This is what we have done in a SDK side

01:55:03.290 --> 01:55:03.630
of it.

01:55:08.380 --> 01:55:14.460
No module name pi PDF use the same environment. I think you

01:55:14.460 --> 01:55:17.280
must be using a different environment if it is same and if

01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:20.280
you have already run the executed your requirement or TXT

01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:21.880
file, then it will never give you an issue.

01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:29.820
Yeah, so it's a beautiful application by the way an

01:55:29.820 --> 01:55:32.700
application that you can elaborate the application that you

01:55:32.700 --> 01:55:36.180
can use it in a real time. I believe we all are using it

01:55:36.180 --> 01:55:41.340
resume. AI is an application and yes, if you have to build

01:55:41.340 --> 01:55:45.800
such kind of a system, this is the point where you should

01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:49.580
start. So almost 80% of the work majority of the work you

01:55:49.580 --> 01:55:54.400
can say we have done 20% of this polishing work creating a

01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:58.560
beautiful UI interface the way we have done that in a resume

01:55:58.560 --> 01:56:03.280
AI system, you know creating a log we have given you I think

01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:08.020
resume limit is equal to 3 on. A monthly basis, I believe or

01:56:08.020 --> 01:56:11.300
maybe a 10, right? So just with the authorization

01:56:11.300 --> 01:56:14.120
authentication of with your sign up user sign up the based

01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:17.600
on the free user or based on the paid user. Basically, you

01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:21.060
can try to like, you know, give a limit that one user will

01:56:21.060 --> 01:56:24.800
be able to use it only this many times this particular

01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:28.360
application. We have given you three beautiful format offers

01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:31.720
you may in a resume AI where it shows the final output,

01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:36.300
right? You can try to give maybe 300. That's completely up

01:56:36.300 --> 01:56:39.260
to you. And then you will be end up building a final

01:56:39.260 --> 01:56:40.980
beautiful product.

01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:49.020
Yeah, can we say we all can do that? Yes, and then bring it

01:56:49.020 --> 01:56:52.500
to a production monetize it. Maybe you can start charging

01:56:52.500 --> 01:56:59.900
people. Maybe like a 49 rupees only. Yes. So in case of our

01:56:59.900 --> 01:57:03.380
resume AI, so if you'll go and check our resume AI, it's not

01:57:03.380 --> 01:57:06.700
just giving you a resume. It's giving you questions as well.

01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:09.900
So see and against coming from a LLM by the way. So if I'll

01:57:09.900 --> 01:57:11.820
show you. You resume AI and if I'll show you like a

01:57:11.820 --> 01:57:15.760
previously analyze the resume. So yes, it is showing you a

01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:18.180
scores in a beautiful manner. It is giving you your enhanced

01:57:18.180 --> 01:57:20.780
resume the format that you have selected plus it is

01:57:20.780 --> 01:57:23.280
generating a cover later. I can do that. I can create one

01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:26.900
more agent for a cover later generation, right? And then

01:57:26.900 --> 01:57:30.440
interview preparation. So I can configure one more agent. So

01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:33.820
which will try to configure my entire interview. So again,

01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:36.960
we have a multiple rounds inside the interview. So for all

01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:40.240
of these rounds one one one one one one agent or maybe. One

01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:42.720
single agent with all the instruction that okay do the HR

01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:44.980
round technical round coding around everything do the DSA

01:57:44.980 --> 01:57:49.000
round system design round and if someone has uploaded their

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:52.820
resume who is a non-technical person, so this DSA

01:57:52.820 --> 01:57:54.580
programming and system design round will not be applicable

01:57:54.580 --> 01:57:57.360
for everyone, right? So basically we have to understand the

01:57:57.360 --> 01:58:00.720
resume and LLM is good, right? LLM can understand resume in

01:58:00.720 --> 01:58:02.680
a easiest possible manner. I don't have to write any piece

01:58:02.680 --> 01:58:04.680
of the code. I just have to give the instruction that

01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:07.260
understand the genre of the resume domain of the resume

01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:10.580
everything technology everything. So if person is in tech

01:58:10.580 --> 01:58:14.680
then try to give these round DSA programming and system

01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:17.520
design if person is not tech then try to give a general

01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:21.580
question managerial round HR round behavioral round. Can I

01:58:21.580 --> 01:58:23.440
say this can be done easily?

01:58:29.300 --> 01:58:37.920
Yes. Yeah. So now this is your task by tomorrow, right by

01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:43.420
tomorrow. I want you to like know maybe just on a daily

01:58:43.420 --> 01:58:46.560
basis. Do it posted do it posted kind of approach if you are

01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:48.840
going to follow and take a feedback from the people, right?

01:58:49.780 --> 01:58:54.800
So try to create a resume AI try to re replicate the resume

01:58:54.800 --> 01:58:59.580
AI whatever feature that we have given to you. Try to build

01:58:59.580 --> 01:59:06.240
the exact similar kind of a feature. Can we do it? And it

01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:07.360
will be a full-scale project.

01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:15.970
Yeah, it will be a completely full-scale project by the way.

01:59:17.330 --> 01:59:20.330
So can we expect from today onwards? You guys will start

01:59:20.330 --> 01:59:24.210
working on it and maybe in next three to four days. I will

01:59:24.210 --> 01:59:28.530
be having a very very good beautiful full-scale demo just

01:59:28.530 --> 01:59:31.290
like a resume AI where it will show the score which it is

01:59:31.290 --> 01:59:34.610
showing even now enhance resume. Okay, fine. Try to create

01:59:34.610 --> 01:59:37.770
one agent which will create a cover later for you right and

01:59:37.770 --> 01:59:41.150
then interview duration and believe me you will end up

01:59:41.150 --> 01:59:45.150
getting a lot of like a edge cases. And you will end up

01:59:45.150 --> 01:59:47.910
learning a lot of things. So once you are going to build

01:59:47.910 --> 01:59:56.040
such kind of a system. With react also it will be better if

01:59:56.040 --> 02:00:00.680
you can use maybe like a mon is not mon stack. Maybe just

02:00:00.680 --> 02:00:04.240
try to use a next J's or react basically react is

02:00:04.240 --> 02:00:07.300
deprecated. But yeah, you can use react or maybe next to

02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:11.500
create the UI interface. Fine

02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:19.260
and make it like a public a flaunt flaunt. It may be like do

02:00:19.260 --> 02:00:22.440
some sort of a flex about it in a social media or anywhere

02:00:22.440 --> 02:00:25.520
you want and keep those code base entire inside your GitHub

02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:27.900
repository and say that okay, I have built the product.

02:00:31.860 --> 02:00:36.820
We should know little bit of see nowadays in a era of AI

02:00:36.820 --> 02:00:43.020
knowing UI UX is not a big deal. I think we all should be

02:00:43.020 --> 02:00:45.740
aware about all of these things because when we talk about a

02:00:45.740 --> 02:00:48.960
software engineering right everything comes into a picture

02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:53.840
ops cloud UI UX front-end back-end machine learning deep

02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:56.220
learning everything comes into a picture. So as a software.

02:00:56.220 --> 02:00:59.380
And now it's not difficult, right? Maybe like couple of

02:00:59.380 --> 02:01:02.500
years back. It was very much difficult and people, you know,

02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:05.980
try to train themselves in a one specific technology. Maybe

02:01:05.980 --> 02:01:08.400
a front-end maybe just a back-end maybe just in the ops.

02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:11.100
Maybe just in a cloud. But if I'll talk about ops and cloud,

02:01:11.260 --> 02:01:13.820
it's been used everywhere, right? Doesn't matter which

02:01:13.820 --> 02:01:16.980
product you are going to create. It is going to follow the

02:01:16.980 --> 02:01:19.700
same kind of a philosophy. If I'll talk about a software

02:01:19.700 --> 02:01:23.180
designing or maybe like a product designing anything. So

02:01:23.180 --> 02:01:26.240
obviously front-end back-end is required if I'll talk. About

02:01:26.240 --> 02:01:29.160
maybe a data processing. So big data will be required or if

02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:31.720
I'll talk about AI integration. So data science email is

02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:34.180
required and again, which is pretty much possible with the

02:01:34.180 --> 02:01:36.900
help of Y coding. If you have a that visualization if you

02:01:36.900 --> 02:01:42.300
have that kind of intention, so it's better. Yeah, it's

02:01:42.300 --> 02:01:45.500
better to you know, know

02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:50.780
about it and it's not difficult. Believe me. It's not very

02:01:50.780 --> 02:01:51.180
difficult.

02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:58.360
Can you show us UI with the next in a coming classes? Why

02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:00.080
you want me to show you everything?

02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:06.580
So then what you will do? I'm not giving you a class so that

02:02:06.580 --> 02:02:09.420
you know, I'll come and I'll show you one application. Then

02:02:09.420 --> 02:02:11.980
you will ask me for a next feature. Then again, I will come.

02:02:12.060 --> 02:02:14.000
I will show you that feature. No next feature. You have to

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.440
build right then only you will be able to write it down

02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:18.660
inside your resume proudly. Otherwise what you will write?

02:02:19.200 --> 02:02:21.620
Are you going to just copy and paste my code base and then

02:02:21.620 --> 02:02:24.620
you can say that I have done that. No, this is not how it is

02:02:24.620 --> 02:02:29.200
going to work. Yeah, so do it.

02:02:32.340 --> 02:02:35.820
This is your job. My job is to teach you. My job is to show

02:02:35.820 --> 02:02:39.180
you a path. My job is to motivate you. My job is to provide

02:02:39.180 --> 02:02:41.740
you a platform. My job is to provide you a thought process.

02:02:41.980 --> 02:02:44.960
Basically and the product you have to build.

02:02:49.380 --> 02:02:56.640
Yeah. Okay, so okay. Someone is asking for a code base. Once

02:02:56.640 --> 02:02:59.220
again, anyone who can ping a drive link. I think I have

02:02:59.220 --> 02:03:00.200
already shared a drive link, right?

02:03:11.420 --> 02:03:13.600
Yeah. So someone has already put many people have already

02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:15.860
provided. Okay, that's cool.

02:03:22.010 --> 02:03:25.630
Okay. So fine guys, this is it again. So we have launched

02:03:25.630 --> 02:03:28.410
our bed development course. We have launched our DSA course

02:03:28.410 --> 02:03:32.610
Ram is teaching Ram is taking this DSA with python and bed

02:03:32.610 --> 02:03:35.550
development has been taken care by Ajay, Ajay Sharma and

02:03:35.550 --> 02:03:39.610
yeah, so my another batch is going to start from next week

02:03:39.610 --> 02:03:43.750
onwards for a AI ML Masters. So those if your friends

02:03:43.750 --> 02:03:46.330
families or anyone is interested or if you are interested

02:03:46.330 --> 02:03:49.210
and you already have a your own plus access then without any

02:03:49.210 --> 02:03:51.190
doubt you can join this particular batch. So where I'm going

02:03:51.190 --> 02:03:54.290
to start. Everything from a python. Yeah. So python stats

02:03:54.290 --> 02:03:57.410
machine learning ml ops part little bit about a deep

02:03:57.410 --> 02:04:00.070
learning. I think I have already mentioned and obviously a

02:04:00.070 --> 02:04:03.730
beautiful high amazing project. Not a regular project. I

02:04:03.730 --> 02:04:06.170
have the project which I have mentioned over here again is

02:04:06.170 --> 02:04:08.310
not a regular one. It is using a machine learning. It is

02:04:08.310 --> 02:04:11.390
using also agent tiki. It is using also a cloud. It is using

02:04:11.390 --> 02:04:16.110
a ml ops kind of a things because this this kind of a

02:04:16.110 --> 02:04:18.230
project is a real one and which you can write into your

02:04:18.230 --> 02:04:20.850
resume. So everything is mentioned inside this entire

02:04:20.850 --> 02:04:24.030
curriculum. If you are interested, you can just go ahead and

02:04:24.030 --> 02:04:28.010
then you can start with this course which which will be

02:04:28.010 --> 02:04:32.190
started like from next week next weekend onwards Saturday

02:04:32.190 --> 02:04:39.010
Sunday. I have given a timeline so obviously but again so it

02:04:39.010 --> 02:04:43.030
is going on it will be available. I know I was not able to

02:04:43.030 --> 02:04:45.190
like a you know upload all the lectures on time.
