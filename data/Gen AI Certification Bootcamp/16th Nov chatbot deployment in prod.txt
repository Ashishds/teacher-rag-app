WEBVTT

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.860
okay so shall we start everyone yes shall

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.090
we start now okay

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.080
fine so let's start so i'm going to share my screen now what

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.180
we are going to do today so we are technically going to

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:32.200
build a chat gpt so we are going to build chat gpt in my

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.250
today's class and in a simplest possible manner so we are

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.950
going to build a chat gpt now to build a chat gpt obviously

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.650
we need a front end so we need basically a ui interface you

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.050
can say we

00:00:51.640 --> 00:01:01.140
need a ui interface plus we need open ai key open ai key so

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.420
those who is not having open ai key not an issue so for

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.700
today at least i am going to provide you open ai key so that

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.060
you know you can build a chat gpt and in a simplest possible

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.580
manner so we are going to build a chat gpt you can you can

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.760
try to use it directly inside your configuration and then

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.200
you will be able to host it now once we are going to create

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.540
this entire thing so let's suppose we are going to like

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.240
enable our ui interface and we are able to create a open ai

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.400
key now on top of that so what we are going to do so we are

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.240
going to perform a monitoring so we are going to perform a

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.940
monitoring with the help of prometheus adam grafana so we

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.940
are going to attach prometheus

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.480
plus grafana so grafana is basically a kind of a tool you

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.600
can say so which you can try to use it which we all can try

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.860
to use it for basically showcasing all kind of a statistics

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.880
with respect to a application so whatever statistics that we

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.380
are trying to generate how many people are hitting my system

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.860
how many users have logged in inside my system or what is

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.720
the response time that system is trying to take so each and

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.940
everything we can try to do a setup inside a grafana so we

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.800
are going to do a monitoring so again even going forward so

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.380
in many of my projects i'm going to use a prometheus and

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.060
grafana so that you all will be able to do a monitoring and

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.800
again based on those monitoring so if you have to generate

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.460
some sort of alert so you can try to even generate some sort

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.780
of a alert as well so prometheus is something which is going

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.800
to capture the logs and grafana is something which is going

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.340
to showcase a log so grafana provides you a ui interface a

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.740
beautiful beautiful ui interface you can say grafana is

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.940
going to provide now so today this is something that we are

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.400
going to do so we are going to do it and everything is going

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.200
to run on ec2 instances so we are going to launch one of the

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.600
ec2 instances elastic compute cloud so now this is a service

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.420
which is available inside aws right this is available inside

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.320
aws so by which you will be able to get any kind of

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.640
instances means machine basically you all will be able to

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.700
get a machine and inside this machine so we are going to

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.200
configure our ui interface plus inside that ui interface so

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.260
we are going to configure our openai and along with that so

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.660
we are going to configure prometheus and a grafana now ui

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.060
interface wise so if i'll talk about a euron so we have a

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.100
multiple ui interface not just one i'll not be using that in

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.100
my today's class so today's class we are going to use ui

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.160
interface wise basically open web ui right so open web ui

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.880
interface we are going to use it going forward so i'm going

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.780
to even show you that we have our in-house ui interface

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.080
which is exactly same which is exactly same as like a chat

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.340
gpt interface you can say or whatever open web ui is trying

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.500
to provide so you can use even that particular one and then

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.060
you can try to host it uh but yeah so today let's go ahead

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.260
with the open web ui interface and let's try to build this

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.680
entire system so where just like a chat gpt you will be able

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.760
to access all the models and whatever model chat gpt is

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.720
providing or whatever model is available even inside your

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.920
account so let's suppose if i have some sort of a custom

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.520
model in my account inside my openai account so even that i

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.760
will be able to call inside my open web ui and with that

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.240
model i will be able to do a chat i will be able to generate

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.560
images i will be able to send a speech and then i will be

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.020
able to you know process those speech or by sending a speech

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.880
itself i will be able to give a command to my entire chatbot

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.600
going forward so we have to even attach a flavor of rag over

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.820
here so on top of the same layer so we are going to attach

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.320
we are going to configure our rag based framework so where

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.100
we are going to pass our own data which is nothing but a

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.720
private data right so we are going to pass our private data

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.760
and system is supposed to respond back with a private data

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.640
not just that so we are going to even attach our private

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.840
model so we are going to attach our private llm you can say

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.520
or any other kind of a model which is equivalent to a llm so

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.220
for example we have already seen that that we were able to

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.920
train our model we were able to train our model or to fine

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.060
tune our model this is the like a kind of things that we

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.360
have already done right in our live class itself so here

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.300
what we are going to do so we will try to see that how we

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.700
can try to securely host those models a model which is

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.920
running on my gpu on my private infrastructure so that kind

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.200
of a model also you will be able to attach in a same kind of

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.000
a system so in that manner this entire you know application

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.460
is going to be a sophisticated application it is going to be

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.700
a kind of application which will be private to you to your

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:52.320
company to your model to your data set plus we are going to

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.540
even see that how we will be able to do a domain domain

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:02.520
mapping domain mapping so domain mapping means so the way we

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.400
are trying to host yuri on a url right on a url domain name

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.120
so in the similar manner so you can try to get some sort of

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.380
a domain name so the way we are trying to host yuri on a url

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.360
right on a url maybe like just by spending one dollar on

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.840
godaddy or similar kind of a platform and they are going to

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.500
give you a domain name you can try to go and check whatever

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.000
domain that you are looking for and obviously you have to

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.940
pay accordingly so that domain is going to be your asset it

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.060
is going to be your property and then you can try to

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.000
configure that particular domain with respect to this entire

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.020
interfacing so this is something that we have to achieve uh

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.920
so everything we are not going to achieve today so obviously

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.800
we will try try to achieve something in my next class, which

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.740
is going to happen next week on Saturday. But yeah, so today

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.780
what we are going to achieve so today at least we will be

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.980
able to do a UI configuration, we are going to attach our

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.580
open AI key. So where I will be able to access all the model

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.100
which is available inside my open AI account. And then we

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.120
are going to attach Prometheus and Grafana. So till this

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.100
point, we are going to do it today. Now rest of the things

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.960
like RAG or private LLM hosting, which is running on my GPU,

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.400
my private infrastructure, and then this domain mapping. So

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.000
all of these things I'm going to show you in my next

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.080
Saturday class. So you don't have to wait much just next

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.160
Saturday class, you will be able to even configure these

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.060
things on top of the same one for everything. So I'm going

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.640
to provide you a documentation so that you know, even in a

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.000
later stage, you are not supposed to struggle just follow

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.380
along with the documentation. And eventually you all will be

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.700
able to do same thing, right, you will be able to replicate

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.800
each and everything in no time. Okay. So is it clear guys,

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:43.520
what we are going to do today? Yeah. Is it clear to all of

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.860
us? Fine. Okay, now, let's get started. So first of all,

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.040
like I said, so we need an AWS account. So I'll be like a

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:57.660
login into my AWS account, by the way. So let me open up my

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:08.330
AWS console login. And let's go there. Sign into a console.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.780
Okay, so now I'm able to land into my AWS account, I'm able

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.500
to do a sign in and I believe you all are able to do a sign

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.400
in as well. This is one part. The other part is here, so you

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.240
will be able to see a reason right here, you will be able to

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.180
see a lot of reasons and you can try to configure your

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:16.360
services, even reason wise. So try to select a nearest

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.400
reason for all of you. So for example, if I'm in Asia, so

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.440
and especially if I'm in India, so maybe I can try to select

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.120
Mumbai. Or maybe I can try to select Hyderabad, that's going

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.980
to work for me. Let's suppose if you are from some other

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:33.620
part of like a planet. So in that case, you can try to

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.700
select the nearest reason, whatever nearest reason that you

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.840
have, and then you will be able to do each and everything.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.880
The reason is very simple behind selecting a nearest reason

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.260
so that it will be able to, you know, send a data and it

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.060
will be able to receive a data or latency is going to be

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:54.280
very, very less. So that is a reason. So just select one of

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.900
the nearest reason and leave it as it is. So for example, in

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.520
my case, I'm selecting Mumbai, you can try to select maybe

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.400
Hyderabad. Maybe you can try to select North Virginia or you

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.880
it's completely fine. Just select a nearest one if you are

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.480
in Europe. So in that case, you have an option called as

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:14.140
Frankfurt, Ireland, London, Paris, Stockholms, right? So

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.960
maybe you can try to select any of these regions as well if

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.680
you have joined from Europe. Simple everyone. So just change

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.520
this one. So I'm logging from South Africa, I would select

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.520
Ohio. Yeah. So whatever is your nearest region, just simply

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.720
select like that particular region or San Francisco, right?

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.100
So from San Francisco, so yes, Ohio is going to be the

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.320
nearest one or whatever is the nearest one. I believe we all

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.940
are aware about that. So just go ahead and select that

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.060
particular region. Now once you are going to select that

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.420
particular region, so what you have to do, so you have to

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:47.120
basically call EC2 and search for EC2 over here, Elastic

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:51.900
Compute Cloud. So EC2 is one of the services. Which AWS is

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.320
providing you one of the powerful service, I would say,

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:58.540
which AWS is providing you and here. So you will be able to

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:01.340
get any kind of instances that you are looking for of your

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.680
choice. So obviously the kind of application that we are

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.160
holding or the kind of application that we are going to

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:12.960
host, it requires a bare minimum configuration means a bare

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.220
minimum machine. Above that, everything is fine. But below

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.540
that, this machine is not like your application is not going

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:23.880
to work. So first of all, just search EC2, click on EC2 and

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:28.060
go inside EC2. Now once you will come inside this EC2 for

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.640
the very first time, so you will be able to see a launch

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.400
instance option. So just follow along with my mouse cursor.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:37.220
So here you will be able to see a launch instances. So I'll

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:41.520
just click on this launch instance and here I will be able

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.560
to land this kind of interface. So where it is going to help

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.140
me out in terms of creating a EC2 instances. So here the

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.600
very first part that you have to do is fill this particular

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.980
form and select all of these like a required things for your

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:01.220
EC2 instances. So here, first of all, it is looking for a

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.960
name. So I'm going to give a name. So S U D H underscore

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.840
Euron. So let's suppose this is a name which I have given

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.920
fine. You can try to give any other name of your choice.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.360
That's completely okay. And then it is looking for a

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.640
machine, right? So what kind of images you will be looking

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:21.740
for inside your machine? So I want Ubuntu image inside my

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:25.540
machine. So just try to select Ubuntu, Ubuntu as an

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.240
operating system, yeah, Ubuntu as an operating system. You

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.080
can try to select over here. They have other categories as

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.940
well, but yeah, they have thousands of images available. But

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:37.220
I'm going to select a Ubuntu as simple as that. You can

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:40.820
select Mac OS as well. Even Amazon based Linux is available.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.300
You can even go ahead with the Windows machine. You can go

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.680
with the Red Hat, SUSE, which is nothing but a variant of I

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.460
can say a Linux machine itself. Or Debian, or maybe you can

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:54.200
try to browse any other images. But yeah, Ubuntu is going to

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:58.160
work fine for me. Yes, please explain in which situation we

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.760
choose which one. See everything is going to work in every

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.560
situation. It's just our operating system layer. So let's

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.740
suppose if I'm comfortable with the Linux command in that

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.920
case, I can go ahead with any of these variants Red Hat,

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.800
SUSE, Debian or Ubuntu. If I'm comfortable with my Mac

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.720
operating system, so in that case I can go ahead with the

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.380
Mac operating system. If I'm comfortable with the Windows

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.760
machine. So in that, in that case, I can go ahead with that.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:21.040
I can go ahead with the Windows machine. But yeah, Ubuntu is

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.940
going to be one of the standard one. So simple. Let's go

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:27.720
ahead with that. Now here, so it is asking you to like give

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.920
a number of instances that you will be looking for. So as of

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.800
now, I'm looking for only one instance. By the way, if I'm

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.460
looking for maybe a hundreds of instances, I can try to give

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:40.180
that as well. Yeah. So I will be able to like get 100

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.440
instances as well. But as of now, only one instance is

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:48.860
something which is required for me. Now. So here. Uh. So

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.960
here, Ubuntu machine I have selected. Now this is going to

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.900
be like a same. Just leave it. Right. Just leave it. Leave

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:58.840
this one. Now, architecture wise. So again, 64 bit. This is

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.740
going to work for me. I don't have to worry about that. Now

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.880
here you have to come instance type. So here you will be

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.880
able to select your compute power by the way. Right. So

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.900
instance type means compute power. You will be able to

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:14.820
select. So just click on this one and uh, here. So like a

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.940
with T2 nano, these are the names by the way. These are the

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.740
names which, uh, AWS or you can say, uh, nomenclature that

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:25.980
AWS has given to their machine. So T2 series and inside a T2

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:28.840
series, we have a nano, we have micro, we have a small, we

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.520
have medium, we have large, we have extra large. So such

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.620
kind of machines we will be having. Then we have a C series

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:39.040
machine over here. Then we have like, uh, something D series

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.180
machine over here. Then we have a G series machine over

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.540
here. And if you will go and check all of these machines, so

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.700
obviously all of these machines are coming with. A

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.380
different, different kind of a configuration. So if I'll

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.880
talk about a T2 micro over here, so it gives you one virtual

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.900
core CPU 0.5 gigabyte of memory. And, uh, that is something

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.520
that you will be able to get along with that. You will be

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.720
able to see even a pricing part that what it is going to

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:07.720
cost you, right? What it is going to cost you. So on demand

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.180
Linux based pricing. So if you are running like a Linux

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.220
based, uh, images, then in that case, it is going to cost

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:17.560
you 0.0062 USD per hour. Uh, if I'm talking about a nano.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:21.620
And, uh, if I'm like, uh, running a windows based, uh,

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.640
images inside this machine, because this is, this is just a

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.020
machine, a bare cell, you can say, or a machine, it is going

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.000
to give you on top of that. So obviously these images will

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.360
be installed. So if I'm going ahead with the windows based

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.740
installation, in that case, it is going to cost me a little

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.540
bit more, maybe because of licensing, right? Because windows

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:42.520
machine comes with the licensing, right? So they have, they

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.880
have already given you all of those details and with each

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.960
and every machine, you will be able to see all of those

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.800
details. Okay. Now the kind of our application that we are

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.800
going to run today. So the bare minimum requirement is going

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.960
to be at least two V core CPU, right? The kind of

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.180
application that we are going to run. And at minimum, we

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:06.640
need four gigabyte of a main memory. This is a bare minimum

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:10.260
requirement for my today's application. So if someone is

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.460
going to select it to a small, if someone is going to select

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.260
it to micro nano, you will be able to do a setup, but your

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.520
application is not going to work. Okay. So keeping that in a

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:22.220
mind, so we are going to select basically a T2 medium and

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.080
above that, anything is going to be fine. Yeah. So you can

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.320
select T2 large. You can select extra large. You can try to

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.800
select maybe like a, you know, C series, D series, G series.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.240
That's completely fine. But this is a bare minimum

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:39.800
requirement. So I need a T2 medium over here. Simple. So

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.160
just go ahead with T2 medium. So where it is going to give

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.860
you two virtual core CPU, four gigabyte of a, you know,

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:53.100
memory. Okay. And then so with my Ubuntu, so it is going to

00:16:53.100 --> 00:17:00.760
cost me 0.0531 USD per hour. So on an average it is going to

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:04.640
cost you approximately in Indian currency, if this machine

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:09.720
is running for an entire month, around 6,000 to 7,000 rupees

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.840
INR. So this is something that it is going to cost you in

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:16.840
dollar. It is going to cost you like 80, 90 dollar. In a

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:20.720
month, if your machine is running for an entire month, that

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.280
will be the cost that you will end up getting. So let's go

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.040
ahead and select this particular machine. And again, cost is

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.780
given to you per hour cost is given to you. So per hour into

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.860
24 into 30, that is going to be a monthly cost. So you can

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.380
try to do a math on your own and then you can try to do a

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:40.460
conversion of USD into INR or whatever currency that you are

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:43.400
following in your like a country. So you can try to select

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.440
that particular part. So here, just go ahead and select T2

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:51.100
medium. And once you are going to select a T2 medium, then

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:55.320
maybe you can come on next side. So key pair login. So we

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:59.000
have already seen that that to login into a GPU, we have

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.660
created a private key, right. And with the help of private

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.040
key, public key we have already attached and with the help

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.920
of private key, so we used to basically do a login. So let's

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.440
suppose from my machine or from any other machine, so I

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.440
would like to login into the machine. Which I am creating on

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:17.240
a AWS. So obviously I need a key, like I have to attach a

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:20.760
key. So here maybe you can try to select an existing key if

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:24.180
you have. So I already have one key, but I will not be using

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:27.100
that. I'll try to click on create a new key pair. So just

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.620
click over here, right. And RSA token based key, I would

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.940
like to create and then just select PPK. If you would like

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:37.380
to like, you know, login through a putty. And if you are

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.400
going to do an open SSH in that case, you can try to use

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.820
this PEM key. So PPK key. We all are aware about it. We have

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:47.000
already used this PPK kind of a key so many times, even in

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.460
past, right. So just try to like click on this PPK key under

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:55.280
RSA and then click on create key pair. You can give a key

00:18:55.280 --> 00:19:02.980
name. So SUDH, Huron, URI, new, today date is 16th, right.

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:06.680
So that I can remember. So 16th November, this is the key

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:10.500
name which I have given so that I can remember. So yeah. So

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.280
once you are going to click, it will be able to download

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:16.060
your key inside your local system. So my key has been

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:19.980
downloaded and I can try to use it even in future. And this

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.700
is a key which has been attached as you can see, right. This

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.920
is a key which has been attached with respect to this

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:28.100
particular instances as simple as that. Now in a later

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.560
stage, I can use the same key so that with the help of

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:34.000
putty, I will be able to log in with the help of maybe some

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
file transfer things. I will be able to transfer a file from

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.200
my local system to an AWS. Any file which I want. I can

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.040
actually use it. I can do a transfer as simple as that. Now

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.180
coming to the next section, right. Coming to the next

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:50.080
section. So by default, they have checked create security

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:54.540
group and inside that allow SSS traffic from anywhere. So 0

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:59.020
.0.0.0 slash masking 0, right. So it simply means that that

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:03.820
we are going to allow traffic, right. And then allow HTTPS

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:07.040
traffic, allow HTTP traffic from the internet. So just

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.820
select everything. Yeah. Just select everything by default.

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.920
So this two option will not be selected, but selected,

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:16.040
right. So from HTTPS, we are allowing it and from HTTP, we

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:19.760
are going to allow it. Even in later stage, if I forgot to

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.120
like do these things, even in later stage, I can go and I

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.600
can change a setting. So once my machine will be launched,

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:28.240
this setting can be modified even in a later stage. That's

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:34.000
completely fine. Okay. Now, so our machine is ready. Our

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.620
machine configuration is two virtual core CPU, 4 gigabyte of

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.960
a RAM. Okay. My main memory, right. We need hard disk as

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.140
well, right. We need hard disk as well, SSD or HSD we need.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:49.460
So here, uh, minimum hard disk requirement is 20 GB. So by

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:52.060
default, they're giving you eight, but my application size

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:56.360
itself is 8 GB. So if my application size itself is 8 GB. So

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.880
in that case, I need some buffer memory as well. So here I'm

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:03.920
going to give a 20 gigabyte, so 20 gigabyte of storage I'm

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:08.240
trying to add over here as simple as that. Okay. So for the

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.360
sake of a general purpose SSD, I'm going to attach a G3, a

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:15.480
GP3, like a, you can say, uh, generations, right. I'm going

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:18.700
to attach it. So simple, right. General purpose, like a SSD

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.920
GP3, I'm going to attach of 20 gigabyte. If I would like to

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:24.920
attach more such kind of this one, I can try to attach it.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.920
So it's under my control. How much like a, you know, hard

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.800
disk I would like to attach. I can try to even click on add

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:33.180
new volume. So it will try to add more hard disk inside my

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:36.660
system. So I'm able to select my hard disk. I'm able to

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:40.000
select my virtual core. I'm able to select my RAM. All three

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.100
selection is done. And this is something which is required

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.960
for any computer, like even a laptop that you are using. It

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.520
must be having some virtual core. It must be having some

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.340
sort of a RAM and must be having some sort of a hard disk.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.580
These three things are required. And yeah, so I'm able to do

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:58.300
a setup for all those three things. Nothing else is

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:02.140
required. Nothing else is required. Now I can directly go

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:05.260
and I can try to click on launch instance. It is going to

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.580
take maybe 30 seconds of time or maybe max to max. 60

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:12.240
seconds of time for me and my instance will be ready. So are

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.060
we able to do all of these things guys? So before clicking

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.660
on launch instance, are we able to do all of these things?

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:20.700
Anyone who is having any doubt, any concern, any confusion

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.200
with any points that I've shown you?

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.100
T3 medium is not active for free version. Yeah, in a free

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.360
version, so you will be having access of, I think micro, but

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.540
micro is not going to work. So like you, you have to like go

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:35.140
ahead with this one.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.980
Which machine? Okay. So machine wise, basically you have to

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:44.300
select T2 medium minimum. Okay. So any machine, so which is

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:48.040
having two virtual core CPUs and minimum 4GB of RAM. So that

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.680
is a bare minimum requirement for my today's application.

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:55.440
Yeah. It is a free version or a paid version. In a free

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.460
version, you will be able to get a nano or like a micro. I

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.720
think max to max, they are giving you one virtual core CPU,

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.960
one gigabyte of a memory. But yeah, so that is, that is not

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.500
going to like be a sufficient for this application.

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.360
T2 medium will not be eligible in a free version. So maybe

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:15.220
you have to like activate your paid version. How

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.580
much should I pay? So I think if you are running for maybe

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:25.900
like a payment by, so it is, it is already giving you, so

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.140
giving you this price. So let's suppose if I'm running it

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:32.020
for one hour, so in that situation, it is going to cost you

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:38.640
0.06 kind of a USD. So 0.06 USD means what? In INR if I have

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.140
to convert, maybe I can convert it as per the current rate.

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:46.840
So 0.06 USD to INR. Yeah.

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:56.420
Yeah. So approximately 5.3 rupees. So 5 to 6 rupees, it is

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:59.200
going to cost you for one hour. That is the cost that will

00:23:59.200 --> 00:23:59.700
come on you.

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:06.930
This is your paid version. Yeah. My entire account is paid

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:09.850
version because like I have to show many application. I do a

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:13.090
lot of experimentation. So obviously a free version accounts

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:16.050
is not applicable for me in any situation.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:24.520
I have chosen C7i flex large. Okay. So I'm like your wish,

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:29.720
anything above 2GB, sorry, anything above 4GB of a RAM. I

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.660
have chosen C7i flex large. And 2 virtual core is going to

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:34.620
work for me. You can go and select as big machine as

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:38.460
possible. But yes, try to check its cost as well. It is

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:43.680
going to cost you on a hourly basis. So be careful. For one

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:48.300
month, how much paid 6,000, 7,000 rupees for T2 medium. I

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:50.740
mean like I have already given you like hourly charge,

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:54.260
right? So anyone can convert into a monthly one. I mean like

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.400
why you are even asking this question?

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.840
Okay. So done guys. So I click on launch instance.

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:12.890
Yeah. Okay. So I'm going to click on this launch instance

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:15.650
and like I said, so it is going to take maybe like a couple

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:19.950
of second of time and my machine will be ready. So here is

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:23.690
my machine. So I can click and I can check the status and as

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:27.990
you can see, so it is trying to provision my machine. It

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:30.970
will, it will take maybe like some time. So I can just try

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:35.790
to click on refresh and yeah, so instance state is running.

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:41.070
Everything looks fine to me. My private IP address is

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:44.650
available. My public DNS is available. Yeah. So all of these

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:47.770
things are available. So just let me know guys, once you are

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:50.970
able to like a launch your machine, then we'll go with the

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:51.330
next step.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.720
Yeah. So how many of you are able to launch the machine and

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.800
for how many of you like this is working?

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.480
Okay. So working, working, working great.

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:56.750
So how many of you are able to see this connect button? So

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:59.330
this, if this connect button is active, this one, the

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:01.570
highlighted one, right? If this button is active, this one

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:04.150
is active. Then in that case, I think we are good to go.

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.220
So are you able to see your connect active button guys?

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:17.590
Everyone? Yes. Okay, cool. So just try to do one thing. So

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:22.310
just try to click on connect. Yeah. And again, so once you

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:25.390
are going to click on this connect, you will be landing into

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:28.930
this particular screen and here. So again, you will be able

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:31.690
to like a see a button called as connect. So just try to

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:34.070
click on this connect once again. So connect and then

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:38.530
connect. Okay. So that will give you a CLI. So fail to

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:41.930
connect to your instances. Try again later. Okay. Not an

00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:42.150
issue.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.180
AWS compute optimizer finding.

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:41.960
Okay. So this time it is not giving me issue. So like I

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.800
said, it is going to take couple of minutes and then only it

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:47.520
is going to allow you. So just simple click on this connect

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.480
button. So once you are able to click on this connect

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:52.520
button, you will be able to see a next connect button. Maybe

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.700
you will have to wait for a couple of minutes so that you

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:57.180
know your machine will be like a warm and up and running.

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.860
Now, once your machine is warm up and running, so you can

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:02.560
click on connect and you will be able to see this SSH

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:06.060
basically, or you can see a console, a similar kind of a

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:09.240
console. You will be able to get even from a putty. So here

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.020
is my machine. I'm able to access my machine through this

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:15.400
interface, through this SSH, I'm able to like access my

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:18.600
machine. And if I would like to access my machine from my

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:21.940
local, like a system from my windows machine. So in that

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:25.160
case, putty is an option for me for windows especially if

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:28.020
I'm using Mac or if I'm using Linux. Then SSH is going to be

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:30.920
the another option and I will be able to log into my machine

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:34.180
and that is a reason. So we have downloaded a PPK file,

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:38.200
right? PPK file. So I can use a, you know, putty or I can

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:41.280
directly come into this console without even doing an

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.700
installation of the putty. Anything is going to work fine

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:46.780
for me. So are you able to see this black console, black

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:51.400
screen? Yeah. Are you able to see this black screen guys?

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:56.400
Everyone? Yes. Fine. It will take some time. So once you are

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.180
going to click on this connect. So maybe for, for a couple

00:29:58.180 --> 00:29:59.040
of minutes. This is the first time it is going to fail

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:02.400
because it tried to like, you know, spin your machine and

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:05.400
again in some time, in just one or two minutes of time,

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:07.900
again, just refresh and click. It will be able to connect.

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:12.200
This is how easy it is to access your machine as simple as

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.620
that. So this is your machine and technically this is your

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:19.220
machine. If you'll go back to instances and here you will be

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:21.160
able to see a list of instances and this is your instance

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:25.360
ID. Click over here and then this is your public DNS. So

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:30.720
basically this is a URL. For your particular machine. So

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:34.160
with the help of this URL, you will be able to reach out to

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.940
your machine. So if you have to do maybe a login through a

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:40.600
party, so obviously I need a public DNS. Now this is the

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.980
highlighted one, the highlighted one. You can try to use it

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:46.160
and that is going to be your login URL and a password wise.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:50.300
You can try to use your, uh, like a private key, the key

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:53.200
that we have already downloaded and in that manner. So you

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.900
all will be able to log in as simple as that. So not a big

00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:59.300
deal, right? Not a big deal in terms of launching a machine

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:05.320
now. Uh, so once we are here inside this particular machine,

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:08.940
so we have to run some sort of a command so that I will be

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:12.500
able to update my machine. So one by one, one by one, I'll

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.200
start giving you a command. Just try to follow those

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:19.920
commands and in some time, uh, like our UI interface or open

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.980
web UI interface will be ready. So first of all, whenever we

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:26.820
launch any kind of a machine, so we try to do some sort of a

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:30.180
update. So one by one guys, I'm pasting this command over

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:33.780
here and I will give you a command. So this is a command

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:37.560
just to update my, like a packages inside a current machine.

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:41.860
So run this particular command first. I have already pinged

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.680
you inside a chat. Let me ping you once again. So yeah, just

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:45.100
use this.

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:56.160
So by doing this, we are just trying to update our machine.

00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:01.340
It will take some time, maybe like a couple of minutes, PPK

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:04.480
key and T3 medium, T2 medium, you can select T3 medium. Also

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.740
you can select. This is completely okay.

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:11.680
So our very first command guys, just try to update your

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:16.240
system, the system that you have launched and this is a,

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:20.500
like a general procedure and if you remember when we have

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:23.660
launched our GPU instances, even at that point of time, we

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:29.450
have like a fired this kind of a command. So here, if anyone

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:32.210
would like to understand a meaning of this command, so I can

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:35.130
give you explanation. So here, those who don't understand

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:38.570
Linux, those who understand Linux in that case, the command

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:41.630
explanation is not required because it's just a simple Linux

00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:44.930
command. Anyone and everyone can understand it, right? So

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:47.930
here, sudo is nothing but I'm running this command on a root

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:51.930
user, basically admin, you can say. APT is nothing but a

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:55.330
package manager. So basically the way we were using pip, pip

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:58.310
is nothing but a Python package manager or UV. UV is also a

00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:01.050
package manager. So in the similar manner, in case of

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:05.150
Ubuntu, so APT is basically a Ubuntu based package manager.

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:07.790
So whatever, like, you know, things that we try to create,

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:10.450
whatever library that we try to create. So we try to release

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:14.050
it under APT. So APT is nothing but package manager for

00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:17.890
Ubuntu. Update means update is just a command inside Ubuntu

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:22.610
and, and upgrade why. So basically it is going to ask a lot

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:26.030
of yes, yes, yes. So instead of doing that, so we have given

00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:28.670
update why means all yes, just install each and everything.

00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:33.630
So this is what we have done just now. Now once this is

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:36.530
done. So then we are going to install little bit of

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:39.810
dependencies. So once I'm able to update my system, then

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:43.030
this is the next command that we are going to execute. So

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:46.790
here is the next command goes inside your chat, do it. And

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:50.710
as you can see, so yes, I'm able to update my system. So let

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:54.650
me like run the next command, basically. So command I have

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:59.650
already pinged you inside your chat. Now let me explain you

00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:02.330
the meaning of this command. So sudo apt. So again, sudo is

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:03.870
nothing but root user. APT is nothing but root user. APT is

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:06.690
nothing but a package manager install. And then we are

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:09.410
trying to call what so we are trying to call CA certificate

00:34:09.410 --> 00:34:15.550
curl G N U P G and ISB release. So here CA certificate is

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:19.050
nothing but it is going to help me out in terms of like

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:23.790
verifying a HTTPS certification, a secure certificate, HTTPS

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:27.350
certificate curl. I think we all know, right? So curl is

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:30.690
nothing but kind of a command by which I will be able to hit

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:33.850
any kind of a URL, any kind of API. Okay. So we are using

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:38.630
it. So that is a package we are trying to install. So G N U

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:41.510
P G. So basically it's tool for encryption and signature,

00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:45.470
which has been used. And LSB release is nothing but so it

00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:48.730
has been used to get information about Ubuntu version. So

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:52.050
these are just a package. For example, in Python, we try to

00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:55.050
install pandas, then numpy, then matplotlib, then Seaborn,

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:58.270
then TensorFlow, then PyTorch in a similar manner. So we are

00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:00.690
trying to install basically the CA certificate, this curl

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:03.830
with GNPU ISB release. So these are the packages. These are

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:05.430
the packages. So that we are trying to install it. This is

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:08.930
what it means. Done everyone. Installation of package.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:13.800
Yeah.

00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:30.550
Fine. Now, once you are able to do that, right, once you are

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:33.450
able to do that, so basically what we have to do, so we have

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:37.710
to like any anyone giving error. Okay. So why should not

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:40.250
give you error if you are using a Ubuntu based machine, it's

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:46.690
a simple Ubuntu command. Okay. So now what we are going to

00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:50.670
do. So we are basically going to create a database. We are

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:52.210
going to create a directory and inside that directory. So we

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:56.490
are going to basically keep our key rings for our docker. So

00:35:56.490 --> 00:36:02.530
here there is our next command, right? So this command I'm

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:06.170
going to hit and this is going to create a directory for me.

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:09.790
So just try to hit this command guys. I have already printed

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:14.310
this command sudo mkdir hyphen p etc apt and inside apt so

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:14.670
key rings.

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:24.840
So inside that generally like we are going to hold all of

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.300
our key.

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:40.280
Now, so once we are able to do that, so we have to basically

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:44.720
install a docker. So basically we are going to like use a

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:49.000
docker and docker based open web UI image. And now so to run

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.760
that obviously we need a docker installation. We need a

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.920
docker setup inside our machine. Now keeping that in our

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:57.500
mind. So this command comes into a picture and I'll give you

00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:03.340
an explanation about this command. So just try to hit this

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:06.300
particular command. So curl command. And it is going to

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:10.400
like, you know, download a docker from a repository and

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:14.360
inside this key ring directory that we have created. So it

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:17.960
is going to store a docker key, jpg.

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:29.320
So run this command guys. It is going to like a, it will go

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.820
to internet. Basically this is what curl does and curl is

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:33.920
something that we have installed, right? As a package we

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:36.880
have installed curl just now and we are using curl over here

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.860
to download a docker.

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:14.710
Okay. So now we are going to do a echo just like a, we are

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:17.210
going to echo is nothing but a print. A statement. So the

00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:19.970
way we use to write a print. So in the case of a Linux, it's

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:23.250
called as echo. So here it is going to like, you know, uh,

00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:27.010
show me like, uh, if there is such kind of a repository

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:29.510
which is available. So yeah, just try to do a echo.

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:36.810
Now just try to update, uh, so sudo apt update is the next

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:40.970
command so that I will be able to, you know, update my

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:42.870
docker engine and tools which I have installed.

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:53.320
So just call sudo apt update once again. Now once this is

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:56.100
done, right? Once this part is done. So then we can try to

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:59.900
like, uh, just to double check. So we can try to call sudo

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:05.150
apt install and all the docker packages to just try to call

00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:11.430
sudo apt install. So docker CLI, docker container,

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:16.030
everything it will try to install. So basically we are

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:18.690
trying to call docker C. docker C is nothing but a docker

00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:21.610
community edition. We are trying to call docker C CLI. So

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:25.490
basically for docker C CLI edition, we are going to install,

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:28.610
uh, for this community edition. And then we are trying to

00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:31.970
call a container dot IU. So container runtime, we are going

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:34.950
to install over there. Then we are going to call docker

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:37.150
build X plugins. So basically we are trying to like, uh,

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:41.350
install a next gen plugin for a docker. And then we are

00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:43.810
going to call a docker compose plugin. So which is nothing

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:47.370
but, uh, to build any kind of a package inside a docker. So

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:49.170
we are trying to install it. So these are just a

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:51.550
installation, the command which I have given to you. So

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:54.730
again, sudo apt install, apt means package manager, install

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:57.210
means install. And then like, uh, we have done that. We have

00:39:57.210 --> 00:40:00.910
given all the installables just in the way we try to do it

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:02.670
in a pip, pip or maybe UV.

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:15.180
Okay. So once Selvi move ahead guys, or I'm

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:23.580
looking for your comment inside a chat. So if you are saying

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:25.920
that we should wait, we will wait for a couple of more

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:26.280
minutes.

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:36.400
Okay. So I'm, I'm waiting. I'll wait for one or two minutes.

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:45.090
Okay. Ram is saying done, done. Silp is saying done. Okay.

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:45.390
Good.

00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:56.570
So now

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:13.640
one,

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.400
we are able to install docker light. Once we are able to

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:20.560
install all the dependencies with respect to docker. So now

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:23.740
let's do one thing so we can try to add Ubuntu user to a

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:27.020
docker group. So inside a docker, there'll be a docker

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:30.460
group. So pseudo user mode ag docker ubuntu. So we are just

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:33.420
trying to add a ubuntu user to a docker group so that ubuntu

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:37.400
user will be able to access a docker. So this is a command

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:43.200
that you have to fire, pseudo mode user ag docker ubuntu. So

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:46.220
user mode is nothing but is a command which has been used to

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:50.440
modify the user and ag is nothing but a for user for a

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:53.480
supplementary group, g for group basically and ubuntu is my

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:58.280
actual username for this machine. Now, so once this is done,

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:01.300
right, once this is done, so we can try to test a docker, we

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:03.680
can try to like, you know, enable and start a docker

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:07.360
services. To enable and start docker services, a command is

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:12.700
basically this one. So this is going to enable and start my

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:16.800
docker. So here we have written a pseudo systemctl enable

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:20.460
docker hyphen hyphen now. It simply means that that

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:24.180
systemctl is nothing but it's a command to control a system

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:26.700
services, whatever services which is running inside my

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:29.820
system. My current ubuntu system enable means I think we all

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:33.040
understand just enable it, enable what a docker now means

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:35.940
now simple in a current time, just enable it.

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:47.020
Yeah. Okay. So we have already enabled it fine. Now once we

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:49.840
are able to enable it, so maybe you can try to cross verify

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:52.700
from your end. So docker hyphen hyphen version. So which is

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:55.180
going to tell you like what is the version that you have? So

00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:59.100
my docker version is 29.0.1 and I believe you will be having

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:02.920
a same version, right? Anyone? Yeah. So are you able to see

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:04.620
a docker version facing

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.980
issue in terms of running an echo command? You can leave

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:15.540
echo command. Echo is just for print. So leave it. Echo is

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:19.360
just like a printing something. So are you able to see?

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:21.920
Okay. People are saying yes, yes, yes. It simply means that

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:26.000
that till this point we are together, right? And this was a

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.480
major milestone because if my docker setup is ready inside

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:34.500
my machine, then like I can go with the next one and next

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:36.460
one is going to be very, very easy. So docker is ready.

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:39.540
We'll download some packages or we'll try to download

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:43.060
something like some docker images. Just spin it. Just run

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:44.080
it. Fine.

00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:50.710
Whenever you copy from control C and control V, it's giving

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:53.550
an issue, try right click copy and right click paste. Yeah,

00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:55.250
this is what I'm doing, right? So paste.

00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:00.960
Then docker compose version. So basically docker compose

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:03.640
version. Let's go and check. So docker compose version is

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:08.060
basically 2.40.3. I believe you all will be able to get the

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:11.220
same version. So just use it. Docker compose version. So

00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:13.740
basically we have a docker and then we have to like compose

00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:16.720
the docker, right? We have to build a docker images. So for

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:19.920
that, and we have, if you remember, so docker compose C,

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:23.320
community edition, we have already installed. So if you look

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:25.780
into my above command, so you will be able to find out

00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:28.020
docker compose C. That is something that we have installed

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:31.520
as a package. So we are just trying to cross check whether

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:34.780
these versions are available or not. Yeah, that's it.

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:48.840
Fine. Okay. So if we are able to do it, right? If we are

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.540
able to do it. If we are able to do it till this particular

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:53.760
point, we are able to do it till this particular point. We

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:57.400
are good. Right? Docker is installed. Now let's go ahead and

00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:00.820
let's try to create any directory of my choice, right? So in

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:03.120
whatever directory I would like to like, you know, keep all

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:08.300
my like UI interface, right? All my software, right? So I

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:10.520
can try to go ahead and I can try to create any kind of a

00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:14.240
directory and you know, I can, I can try to keep it over

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:17.600
there. So here what you have to do. So just try to create

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:22.680
one directory. A simple folder, mkdir, open web UI. So just

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:26.500
try to create one directory. So here we are going to keep

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:28.920
our entire distribution. So let's suppose if I'm trying to

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:31.780
build something in my local system, so obviously there will

00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:34.700
be a folder, right? Similarly, I'm just trying to create a

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:37.340
folder over here and I'll try to transfer everything here.

00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:40.360
So let's suppose something is running, some like server is

00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:43.540
running on my local system or maybe some a stream into UI,

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:46.060
let's suppose is running in my local system. So I'll just

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:49.980
transfer all those files in this directory. Okay. Going

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:52.320
forward for this one, we are going to download it from my

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:56.900
internet. But yeah, so going forward, we are going to, you

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.520
know, transfer the file.

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:07.520
So mkdir, open web UI. So just create this directory by the

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.020
way. Now once we are able to create this directory, so we

00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:12.520
have to give a permission. Maybe before that you can do LSL

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:16.280
and you can try to check. So yeah, this is our directory,

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:19.820
which it has created on November 16 and it's showing my

00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:22.280
system like EC2 instance. Okay. So let's try this time.

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:27.100
Maybe I can change that part. And here, so let's give a

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:31.140
correct permission to this particular directory. So here, so

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:34.700
that, you know, it will be able to do everything or Ubuntu

00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:36.980
user will be able to do everything. So just give a correct

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:37.280
permission.

00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:45.020
So I'm just trying to like call chown, chown is nothing but

00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:47.600
change the owner, owner of this particular directory. So I'm

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:50.860
trying to make this Ubuntu as a owner and I'm trying to

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:53.360
attach this directory to a Ubuntu group.

00:46:56.290 --> 00:46:58.630
So sudo chown, ubuntu-ubuntu.com. I'm going to do open web

00:46:58.630 --> 00:47:02.270
UI, the directory that we have created. Now once we are able

00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:05.250
to give a correct permission, again, I can do maybe LSL and

00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:08.790
I can try to check. So yeah, I think it's, it was same. It

00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:11.110
was having all the permissions, but just to cross verify,

00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:14.930
cross check, I have given permission once again. Now here,

00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:19.690
let's do one thing, go into this directory. So cd open web

00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:23.530
UI. So now do LS, you will not be able to find out anything.

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:27.010
So just go into this open web UI directory. The directory

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:31.170
that you have created. Get into that. So just call cd,

00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:38.630
change directory. So go into this folder. Now once you are

00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:42.050
into this folder, this is my working folder, right? Whatever

00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:44.930
I'll do, I'll do it inside this folder. So now what I have

00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:48.730
to do, so I have to basically like, you know, go to internet

00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:54.130
and from internet, I have to download open web UI. So open

00:47:54.130 --> 00:48:00.490
web UI. Basically GitHub. So this is going to provide you

00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:04.710
open like a UI interface by the way. So this repository is

00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:06.910
an official repository and they are going to provide you a

00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:10.630
UI interface. This kind of a UI interface that you will be

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:13.790
able to use it. And then here you can try to configure your

00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:17.830
model, maybe a model that you are hosting, maybe a model

00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:22.330
which you are trying to consume via an API key. Or maybe if

00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:25.050
you are looking for a RIG implementation, you can do that as

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:28.170
well. If you are looking for, maybe a user. You will be able

00:48:28.170 --> 00:48:30.990
to do that as well. If you would like to do a setup for

00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:34.410
Prometheus and Grafana, you will be able to do that as well.

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:37.150
So all of these things you will be able to do it, which we

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:41.550
are going to do now. Yeah. So basically this is our

00:48:41.550 --> 00:48:44.550
repository and I have to download this entire repository so

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:46.950
that whatever they have built, it should be available inside

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:50.390
my system similarly. So let's suppose if I'm going to push

00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:53.670
some code and it is available on a GitHub so I can try to

00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:56.330
download it or maybe directly I can transfer the file from

00:48:56.330 --> 00:49:00.210
my local. To this one, either way it's going to be fine. So

00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:04.050
here to download this one. So maybe I can try to do get

00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:08.710
clone. So paste this command. So get clone and I'm giving

00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:11.990
this URL. So get clone and this URL, open web UI URL, so

00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:15.110
that it will be able to clone each and everything, whatever

00:49:15.110 --> 00:49:18.550
is available on that particular URL. So clone it guys,

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:19.170
everyone.

00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:01.220
Done everyone. Okay.

00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:14.180
So now you will be able to see so many files over here. and

00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:16.940
these files are nothing but a same file which is coming from

00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:19.600
this repository so whatever files was available here on this

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:22.780
repository i have just cloned it as simple as that i have

00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:25.440
not done anything different over here so simple and

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:28.240
similarly so if something is available in my local system

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:31.420
and if i have to run it on maybe my ec2 instances if i have

00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:34.620
to make it global similarly i can just transfer and i will

00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:37.540
try to make it global now this is one of the option apart

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:42.160
from that inside aws inside azure inside gcp there are other

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:46.040
managed services which is also available and by which you

00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:49.240
will be able to deploy you will be able to basically make it

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:53.240
global so this is one of the way i am showing you going

00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:57.160
forward i'll try to show you other way as well yeah this is

00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:01.260
one of the way a raw approach you can say so where i'm

00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:04.280
launching my own so we are not using any managed services we

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:07.300
are launching our own ec2 like a you know a machine we are

00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:07.300
launching our own ec2 like a you know a machine and we are

00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:10.000
launching our own connect And we have a simple bare machine,

00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:12.620
or you can say empty machine, and we are just configuring

00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:16.820
everything on our own. There are other managed services as

00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:19.120
well. So where I don't have to, you know, do this updates

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:21.760
and all those things, I can simply dump and then I will be

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:24.600
able to make my services up and running. So those kind of

00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:28.100
services are also available inside AWS, Azure and GCP. But

00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:30.880
this is a bare approach. I mean, like starting from scratch

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:31.700
kind of approach.

00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:40.740
Okay, so once we are able to do this, right? So now, like my

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:44.680
entire like files are available. My entire OpenWeb UI is

00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:48.780
available over here. Now what we have to do, so we have to

00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:53.480
change a couple of things. As like, because the way this

00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:57.520
OpenWeb UI has been built, so maybe it is not going to like,

00:51:57.580 --> 00:52:01.020
you know, behave in a similar manner for me. So there is a

00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:05.140
file called as Docker Compose OTEL YAML file, right? This is

00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:09.460
one of the configuration file. And where they have written a

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:12.880
port that they would like to expose or I would like to

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:16.760
expose. So inside this file, Docker Compose OTEL YAML, you

00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:19.900
will be able to see that file after cloning this GitHub

00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:23.060
repository. So I have to change something inside this file.

00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:26.040
So technically, I have to do a change of or I have to do

00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:29.200
like a port mapping, basically. So port mapping is something

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:33.240
which I have to change. And that I can do it inside this

00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:36.660
particular file, OTEL file. So likewise, for like a GPU,

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:39.140
they have. Given you a file for data, they have given you a

00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:42.760
file for a API, they have given you a file for AMD based

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:46.160
GPU, right? For Nvidia based GPU, this is the file for AMD

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:48.500
based GPU, this is the file. So they have already given you

00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:51.820
a separate, separate configuration file. And this is how any

00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:54.880
standard, you know, a software development happens whenever

00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:57.320
we do a development. So obviously, we try to like a keep

00:52:57.320 --> 00:53:00.200
everything segregated so that if any new person is looking

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:03.440
into your files, they will be able to quickly understand and

00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:06.520
they will be able to get into it. So here inside this file,

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:09.240
there is. Is a port mapping OTL file. Generally, we try to

00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:13.240
keep a port mapping, so we will try to open up this file and

00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:16.360
we'll try to, you know, do some sort of a modification into

00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:19.600
a file. Otherwise, system is not going to work for me. So

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:22.960
let's go ahead and do it. So here what I will do. So I'll

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:26.180
try to open up this OTL file. You can try to open up other

00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:30.260
file as well. That's completely OK. So here to open up this

00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:33.600
file. So maybe I can try to use an editor. So just like we

00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:36.740
are using VSCode inside our local system or maybe a notepad.

00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:41.160
Or maybe like some other editor. So notepad plus plus. So

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:43.640
where we go, we open up some file. We try to make some sort

00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:47.020
of a edit in a similar manner. So there is a VIM editor, V I

00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:49.980
M VIM editor, which is available inside a Linux machine or

00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:53.200
this Ubuntu machine that you are using. So VIM and then your

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:55.720
file name. So whatever file name that you have, you can try

00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:56.760
to not this.

00:53:59.770 --> 00:54:02.850
So VIM and then you can try to write over here a Docker

00:54:02.850 --> 00:54:08.670
compose. Docker compose OTL YAML file. So VIM Docker

00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:11.470
compose. Docker compose OTL YAML file. Open up this file.

00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:13.130
Everyone.

00:54:18.250 --> 00:54:20.770
So this is a command. VIM is nothing but VIM is a editor.

00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:28.990
So just try to open up this file so that we can try to make

00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:33.130
some sort of a changes over here. Now, so here inside this

00:54:33.130 --> 00:54:36.850
one, you will be able to see, you know, like so many things.

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:53.970
Yeah. So you will be able to see something called as here

00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:55.390
port wise.

00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:12.710
Yeah. So here inside this one, you will be able to see

00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:15.090
something called as ports, right? Something called as ports.

00:55:15.370 --> 00:55:17.890
And this is basically a parameterized one. This is the

00:55:17.890 --> 00:55:20.610
parameterized one. So what we can do, so we can try to, you

00:55:20.610 --> 00:55:23.130
know, remove that particular port.

00:55:40.550 --> 00:55:40.950
Clear.

00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:48.100
Open up.

00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:07.960
My mouse is giving me some problem. Let me.

00:56:17.610 --> 00:56:20.270
So once you will come inside this file, you just have to

00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:23.530
press I. I means insert mode. So once you are going to be in

00:56:23.530 --> 00:56:26.170
an insert mode, you can try to do, you know, whatever.

00:56:26.170 --> 00:56:26.710
Whatever you want.

00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.480
So good inside this file.

00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:45.700
It's going up and then again fluctuating a lot. So just go

00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:49.320
into this file and click on insert mode. Right. So once you

00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:53.680
will be into insert mode, just click I. I after that. And

00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:56.960
then let's suppose I'm coming to this particular line. This

00:56:56.960 --> 00:57:01.460
particular line. Open web UI port. Again fluctuating. I

00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:04.260
don't know whether my default key is pressed or something.

00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:09.390
Yeah. So you have to. Maybe it will not happen for you. So

00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:15.070
simple. Click on I. And then. Oh, shit. So

00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:25.800
again,

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:30.960
mine is also fluctuating.

00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:41.860
Then I'll open up inside. Party. It's happening inside this.

00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:48.580
Amazon console. So I have to.

00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:56.660
It should not happen. I mean, like Amazon console. Should

00:57:56.660 --> 00:57:58.640
not. It should not give me this kind of a issue. Let me

00:57:58.640 --> 00:57:59.880
refresh once again.

00:58:15.710 --> 00:58:19.690
Vim, Docker, Compose, OTEL. Okay. Everything is gone. Fine.

00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:21.310
Not an issue.

00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:35.320
LSL. Oh, I'm not into open web UI. So CD open web UI. I have

00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:38.960
to go into that directory first. After refresh. Do the LS.

00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:43.760
All the files are available. Then I can try to go into this

00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:52.320
OTEL. File. Okay. So now I'm here. Click I. And then come to

00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:53.580
this

00:58:57.450 --> 00:59:01.490
port. Yeah. So you have to come to this port. So I've just

00:59:01.490 --> 00:59:05.030
refreshed it, guys. And now it's not fluctuating for me.

00:59:05.470 --> 00:59:12.070
Maybe you can try this out. Insert. Replace. Insert. Okay.

00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:18.410
So here what you have to do. So you have to basically change

00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:22.290
this particular port number. Yeah. So you have to change

00:59:22.290 --> 00:59:25.410
basically this particular port number. So you have to give

00:59:25.410 --> 00:59:32.250
port 8000. Just remove slash data part as well. Slash data

00:59:32.250 --> 00:59:36.990
part. So 8000 you have to give. And then you have to give

00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:43.550
comma 8000. So this is what you have to configure over here.

00:59:43.730 --> 00:59:48.090
So 8000 comma 8000. And this is going to work for you. And

00:59:48.090 --> 00:59:51.250
leave rest of the things as it is. So this is. This is one

00:59:51.250 --> 00:59:57.370
of the changes. 8000. Column 8000. And then you have to

00:59:57.370 --> 01:00:04.350
enable OTEL trace as well. So where is my OTEL trace? So

01:00:04.350 --> 01:00:07.330
that I will be able to trace each and everything. So inside

01:00:07.330 --> 01:00:09.870
my environment. Okay.

01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:20.060
Again started fluctuating.

01:00:42.350 --> 01:00:42.910
Insert.

01:01:25.790 --> 01:01:29.710
Okay. So this Vim editor is giving me a lot of problem. Let

01:01:29.710 --> 01:01:33.650
me use some other editor. Fail to connect to your instance.

01:01:33.810 --> 01:01:37.670
Okay. Fine. Close it. Close it. And then I will go back to

01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:41.690
my instances. Once again. Go inside instance ID. And then

01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:44.570
click on connect once again. So click on connect. I am

01:01:44.570 --> 01:01:45.830
launching my instance once again.

01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:54.050
Okay. So LS. Open BVUI is available. So just go into this

01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:57.910
open BVUI directory. LS. Okay. All those files are

01:01:57.910 --> 01:02:03.070
available. Then maybe I can try one more time Vim. If it is

01:02:03.070 --> 01:02:07.670
not going to work. I will change it. So just we have to go

01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:11.310
into. I just have to like do you know two changes. So one is

01:02:11.310 --> 01:02:14.750
a port number mapping. And another one is basically a trace.

01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:22.310
Looks like it has deleted everything from this file.

01:02:58.950 --> 01:03:04.170
Okay. Data is available. So volume. So here port number I

01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:09.250
can see. But not inside the port. It has done

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:14.640
a lot of like changes here. Which is not required.

01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:44.740
It has already made a lot of like changes.

01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:59.060
Okay. Let me do one thing guys. So we have this open BVUI

01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:02.820
folder right. I'll just delete it. I'll install it once

01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:07.500
again. So here to delete this folder. Pseudo RM. RM is

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:11.180
nothing but remove and then RF. So like a recursively remove

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:15.800
everything. Open BVUI folder. So now if I'll go and like

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:18.640
check it. So I don't have any kind of a folder called as

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:21.960
open BVUI. So. I'm I'm just like I've deleted the open BVUI

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:28.020
folder. You can try to delete the same if you want. So just

01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:32.800
delete this folder. And then after deleting this folder. So

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:41.220
maybe MK. DIR. Open. BVUI. So create a folder then do ls.

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:43.820
You will be able to find out the folder right once again.

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:47.400
And then you can try to like run the same command. Pseudo ch

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:50.280
own so that you can give a permission. And then go inside

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:54.000
open BVUI folder. The folder that you have created. And

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.200
inside that again run the git clone. So I'm deleting it and

01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:02.650
I'm like cloning once again. Because during that edit. My

01:05:02.650 --> 01:05:07.670
file has made a lot of like a changes which it was not

01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:11.050
supposed to do. So I'm downloading once again guys. I'm

01:05:11.050 --> 01:05:12.310
doing once again git clone.

01:05:32.250 --> 01:05:37.370
Okay. So done. It seems. Let's do lsl.

01:05:41.650 --> 01:05:44.370
And you can see that. Yeah. So again this OTEL file is

01:05:44.370 --> 01:05:46.390
available. So I have to go and I have to make a changes.

01:05:47.090 --> 01:05:50.050
Let's see. So this time it should not give me an issue. If

01:05:50.050 --> 01:05:51.930
it is giving me an issue then I'll be using a different

01:05:51.930 --> 01:05:54.430
editor. Maybe a nano editor. I'll install. I'll try to use

01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:58.050
it. If vim is going to give me an issue. So vim docker. And

01:05:58.050 --> 01:06:01.890
then OTEL file. So OTEL yaml file. Now inside that just

01:06:01.890 --> 01:06:04.530
press I. So that you will be into insert mode as you can

01:06:04.530 --> 01:06:08.670
see. And here. So port number wise. So I have to change the

01:06:08.670 --> 01:06:09.470
port number.

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:20.980
So I have to make 8000. Column. 8000. Simple. So this is

01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:24.840
going to be the port number. 8000. Column. 8000. And then we

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:30.420
have to add one line. So we have to add basically one more

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:35.740
line over here. So let me try to add that one more line. In

01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:39.740
the same. So

01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:55.220
here. I can do hyphen. Back. And. Then I can try to add a

01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:59.540
line over here. So what is the line that we have to add over

01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:07.360
here. So I have to add ENA. So all caps ENABLE underscore

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:13.660
OTEL underscore TRACE. So that I will be able to trace it.

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:17.440
So trace is equal to T. All small. TRUE.

01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:26.770
TRUE. True. So enable OTEL. TRUE. TRUE. So this is something

01:07:26.770 --> 01:07:29.710
that I have to enable it so that you know I will be able to

01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:34.210
like use it inside my Prometheus and technically I will be

01:07:34.210 --> 01:07:38.050
able to use it inside Grafana. Now here. So we have given

01:07:38.050 --> 01:07:41.350
8000. 8000. What is the meaning of this? So here we are

01:07:41.350 --> 01:07:44.410
trying to do a tunneling you can say. So host port number is

01:07:44.410 --> 01:07:47.430
8000. So the very first one is representing a host port

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:51.790
number. And then the second one is representing basically a

01:07:51.790 --> 01:07:55.270
container port number. This is what it means. So this is

01:07:55.270 --> 01:08:00.550
like what we have done. You can even try to maybe keep host

01:08:00.550 --> 01:08:09.290
port number is equal to 8000 and maybe you can try to keep

01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:17.240
this port number even in this way 8000 and then 8080. So

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:20.240
container port number is 8080 and host port number is 8000

01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:23.140
means from wherever my client is going to log in into the

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:25.820
system. So maybe I can hit 8000 port number. And I will be

01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:29.700
able to log in into that. So this is what it means. So

01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:33.080
simple once we are able to change this port 8080 and then

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:38.000
once we are able to change this enable OTEL trace just do

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.700
one thing escape colon WQ. So escape colon WQ. That is how

01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:45.720
it is going to save it and quit it basically. So WQ means

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:48.620
save and quit. I can try to do a cross verification. So

01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:52.040
maybe I can do a cat cat means nothing but show me the

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:57.780
entire content of the file. So docker compose OTEL and I can

01:08:57.780 --> 01:09:00.700
try to check over here that everything looks fine for me or

01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:05.840
not. So yeah, open web UI volume. That's fine. Okay, port

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.320
number it has not changed.

01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:15.980
Enable OTEL trace. So I'm able to see that it has added some

01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:20.800
ambiguous line over here, which I have to go and remove by

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:29.920
the way and this port number. 8000. It has added which is

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:36.620
again not good. It has added this line I have to remove this

01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:40.080
particular line and here so we should have 8000 port number.

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:45.320
So no, it has not done changes as per my expectation. Let me

01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:55.260
try once again. So vim and then same command I I don't know

01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:57.800
why it is giving me issue like today because generally it

01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:03.600
never gives an issue. I use it all the like time and it

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.220
works and

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:09.950
entire world is using this you know.

01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:13.310
Again,

01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:19.360
no, it should not behave

01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:35.710
in this manner. No, let me install some other editor guys.

01:10:35.830 --> 01:10:38.290
Let me check with like a nano editor.

01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:52.060
It should not you know, behave this like randomly. When I'm

01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:53.660
trying to make some sort of a editor. If

01:10:57.410 --> 01:11:00.670
nano is also not going to work, then I'll try to log in

01:11:00.670 --> 01:11:03.350
through my putty. That will work because in my local system,

01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:06.330
so through putty, it should not give me an issue.

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:26.820
Nano docker OTEL, okay. So I'm able to get into a nano now.

01:11:29.490 --> 01:11:33.730
So let me do some sort of a edit.

01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:59.700
Nano was working fine. Then this one, 8000 and then here

01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:00.980
inside

01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:07.900
our volume, just remove everything and

01:12:13.050 --> 01:12:18.670
here. So we have to technically keep volume,

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:28.600
then hyphen,

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:45.000
open, bev, ui, colon, app, class, putty, backend, slash,

01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:49.020
data. Yeah. So that was the default one. So basically guys,

01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:51.480
what we have done, we have made a change inside the port

01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:54.460
number. So whatever parameter argument that was given, so I

01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:57.420
have removed that argument and replace it with 8000. That's

01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:00.300
the first change. And another change is enable OTEL trace.

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:03.280
This is what we were trying to do it since like the last 10

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:06.520
minutes, I would say. But because of that editor, vim

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:09.140
editor, it was giving me an issue. I have used nano editor.

01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:12.540
So simple nano and then file name. It will open up in that

01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:15.660
one. Now, if you have to save like something inside a nano,

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:18.640
you just have to do control s. Control s means saved

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:22.220
basically. And then you can do control q. So control q means

01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:26.760
quit. As simple as that. Right. So control s and control q.

01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:31.760
You can try to do it. It supports mouse as well. So yeah.

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:41.360
And then you can do control x for exit. Very simple. So you

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:44.000
can use vim editor or you can use a nano editor. If anyone

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.340
is facing issue with the vim. Generally. It will not give an

01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:49.740
issue. I mean, like entire world is using it. But maybe in

01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:53.780
this AWS like, you know, console. So it is giving me an

01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:57.600
issue. It will not give issue otherwise. Yeah. Now I can do

01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:06.520
a cross verification. So Docker OTEL and yeah, so looks fine

01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:11.020
now, 8000, 8000. So this looks fine to me. And then enable

01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:13.920
OTEL trace. Yeah, this looks fine to me. So everything looks

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:17.040
fine to me. I'm able to make a changes. And I'm able to

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:19.700
verify it with the help of cat. So cat means just show me

01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:22.840
the data content of the file. This is what cat means. So

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:26.220
once this is done, right? Once this is done, this particular

01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:32.480
changes is done, then we are good to go. And we are good to

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:39.280
even launch our instances, our UI, by the way. And with the

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:43.580
help of this OTEL file itself, we are going to launch it. So

01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:47.360
now we are on a final stage. Almost. Yeah, we are on a final

01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:52.560
stage almost. So how to like, you know, launch this in

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:56.540
anyone so who is not able to do it so far, guys. So see, we

01:14:56.540 --> 01:14:59.500
have made only two changes. One is a port number inside a

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:02.560
port tab, as you can see, and one is enable OTEL trace

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:08.540
through. So let me ping you this part. One is a port, port

01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:27.450
and one is a enable OTEL trace is equal to true. Fine.

01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:34.800
Apart from that, no changes is required. Now,

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:40.780
after that, now we are reaching to the final stage. Now we

01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:44.200
are good to go with the UI launch. So here, clear

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:48.280
everything, right? And then just fire this command, sudo

01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:52.620
docker compose f docker compose OTEL YAML file. The file

01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:55.260
that we have changed just now. So with the help of that, so

01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:58.480
we are trying to like, you know, fire the entire Docker

01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:01.760
instances. So here basically docker compose is nothing but

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:05.780
sudo means like a sudo means from admin. And then docker

01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:09.400
compose means. So we are trying to start our Docker image or

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:12.340
we have like a, we will like a start our Docker by the way.

01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:16.740
And then here, so which Docker compose file we are using. So

01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:20.120
this Docker compose file we are using and D is nothing but

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:23.000
in a detached mode. So in a background, keep on running this

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.880
entire things hit enter, right? So hit enter additional

01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:32.120
property, I service not allowed validating Docker compose

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:38.940
OTEL. Okay. Now we can try to even like a check. So by using

01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:42.420
a Docker PS, so Docker has not fired itself.

01:16:47.790 --> 01:16:51.390
Let me check. So there is this

01:16:54.430 --> 01:16:55.070
issue.

01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:12.630
This is the last step. If this is going to work, it simply

01:17:12.630 --> 01:17:15.010
means that I will be able to access my UI. Then we have to

01:17:15.010 --> 01:17:17.370
do a setup for Prometheus and Grafana.

01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:24.550
This file is a last file.

01:17:32.530 --> 01:17:36.210
Okay. So it is telling me that I service. I think. I think

01:17:36.210 --> 01:17:42.110
something has been added by mistake. Let me check my cat. So

01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:49.650
okay. I service fine I service. Okay it should not be I

01:17:49.650 --> 01:17:52.370
service. It's basically a service because of that it is

01:17:52.370 --> 01:17:55.350
giving me an issue. So it should be by mistake I have added

01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:58.150
I over there and because of that it is giving me an issue.

01:17:58.310 --> 01:18:08.250
So nano and then Docker OTEL. And. Let's do I and remove

01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:13.370
this I service from this one. So control S and then control

01:18:13.370 --> 01:18:16.230
X. So S for saving X for exit.

01:18:21.290 --> 01:18:25.450
Okay now I can try to run the same command sudo docker

01:18:25.450 --> 01:18:30.050
compose docker compose OTEL. And now it has started running

01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:35.110
everyone. That was my mistake. Basically while pressing I so

01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:38.510
I have added I over there. So now it has started running

01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:41.830
everyone. Everything looks it is trying to build my image

01:18:41.830 --> 01:18:45.750
right. It is just trying to build my image. Please send the

01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:48.790
command. I have. Okay. So this docker compose command right.

01:18:48.970 --> 01:18:54.560
Fine. So I am sending you a command guys. This is a command

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:58.820
docker compose. The OTEL file that we have changed. So we

01:18:58.820 --> 01:18:59.820
are running that file itself.

01:19:27.790 --> 01:19:30.650
Can you give that OTEL command. I mean like there is nothing

01:19:30.650 --> 01:19:34.490
OTEL command. So there is a inside a docker OTEL file. So I

01:19:34.490 --> 01:19:36.450
have already pinged you above if you will check in a chat.

01:19:36.450 --> 01:19:40.270
So you have to change two things port number 8000 and then

01:19:40.270 --> 01:19:42.670
enable OTEL trace is equal to true. These are the two things

01:19:42.670 --> 01:19:46.250
that you have to change inside that file. After opening up

01:19:46.250 --> 01:19:49.770
your OTEL file. So you can open up OTEL file into a vim

01:19:49.770 --> 01:19:53.190
editor or maybe into a nano editor. Just like notepad

01:19:53.190 --> 01:19:55.010
notepad plus plus kind of a things for Linux.

01:21:37.010 --> 01:21:39.550
What is our next step sir? I will tell you next step. Just

01:21:39.550 --> 01:21:41.830
wait for like this build is

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:51.120
we need to do our daily day to day every day deployment. So

01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:53.940
we do not do our like this kind of a deployment every day.

01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:57.380
We do a setup once and then we build a pipeline on top of

01:21:57.380 --> 01:22:00.280
that CICD kind of a pipeline. So where you will push a code

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:03.360
and automatically deployment will happen. So automatically

01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:06.880
it is going to like create a build or maybe like a manually

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:10.180
we can try to trigger a build and then it will go for the

01:22:10.180 --> 01:22:14.500
final production and then we will be doing a worsening

01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:17.880
control as well. So with the help of that so you know we can

01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:21.240
roll back our like current check ins and quotes many more

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:21.500
things.

01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:55.360
So. So how to save and exit the YAML file. So if you are

01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:59.760
into a vim editor then escape colon wq. If you are into a

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:03.280
nano editor then control x control control s for save and

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:04.300
control x for exit.

01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:10.450
Okay so docker build is done. Maybe we can try to call

01:23:10.450 --> 01:23:16.030
docker ps docker ps just to like a check. So it looks like

01:23:16.030 --> 01:23:19.550
it's running right. Looks like it's running over here and if

01:23:19.550 --> 01:23:21.950
it is running so maybe I can go and I can try to check and

01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:26.090
even tunneling is done. See. So here port tunneling is done.

01:23:26.310 --> 01:23:30.470
So and even for 3000 port and even for 8000 port number. Now

01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:33.350
what I can do. So my application is up and running the open

01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:36.450
ai that we have downloaded. So open web ui. So basically

01:23:36.450 --> 01:23:39.710
it's running in my system and yeah so as you can see there

01:23:39.710 --> 01:23:43.070
is a 8000 port and there is a 3000 port at 3000 port I can

01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:46.070
configure Grafana and then at 8000 port number so I can try

01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:50.770
to configure basically open web ui. It's running right. Now

01:23:50.770 --> 01:23:54.590
what I can do. So. So I can try to copy this one this this

01:23:54.590 --> 01:23:57.650
URL the URL that you are able to see right the public DNS

01:23:57.650 --> 01:24:00.190
URL that you are able to see for your instance for your

01:24:00.190 --> 01:24:03.890
machine. So the public URL or maybe you can refresh and just

01:24:03.890 --> 01:24:07.210
try to copy this public DNS this one and it's running at

01:24:07.210 --> 01:24:10.310
8000 port number. So just do call an 8000. This is what we

01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:13.150
have exposed right. This is what we have done into a OTL

01:24:13.150 --> 01:24:18.470
file. So now if everything is good on 8000 port number as I

01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:22.930
can see inside my docker right inside my container at 8000

01:24:22.930 --> 01:24:27.010
my host is running. But here so when I'm trying to refresh

01:24:27.010 --> 01:24:30.030
this it is giving me an issue maybe I'm not able to load it.

01:24:30.270 --> 01:24:34.070
A reason is very simple. So from outside because I'm trying

01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:37.330
to ping it from my system right my system my system is a

01:24:37.330 --> 01:24:41.250
outside system for AWS. So there is a EC2 and inside EC2

01:24:41.250 --> 01:24:44.670
there is a docker yeah and I'm trying to ping from outside

01:24:44.670 --> 01:24:47.250
and if I'm trying to ping from outside and if like I have

01:24:47.250 --> 01:24:52.190
not allowed that particular port number. Then it will it

01:24:52.190 --> 01:24:55.710
will not even allow me to like you know use that particular

01:24:55.710 --> 01:25:00.270
like a URL and that but at this URL there is a machine

01:25:00.270 --> 01:25:03.130
right. This there is a machine the way we use like inside a

01:25:03.130 --> 01:25:06.830
local host and inside that 8000. So I can see that that 8000

01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:10.470
exposed but I'm not able to log in. So a reason is very

01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:14.850
simple. It's running it's running inside a AWS EC2 machine

01:25:14.850 --> 01:25:19.610
but I'm not allowed to access from outside. Now I have to

01:25:19.610 --> 01:25:23.990
like enable it so to enable like a hit from outside. So what

01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:29.470
I can do I can go down right I can go down and I can try to

01:25:29.470 --> 01:25:34.030
go into security over here and then there is a security

01:25:34.030 --> 01:25:38.930
group you will be able to see. So just go down yeah. So this

01:25:38.930 --> 01:25:41.930
is my machine right this is my instance go down and go into

01:25:41.930 --> 01:25:45.170
a security and here inside a security group you can define

01:25:45.170 --> 01:25:48.090
your inbound rule. I think we have already done that. For

01:25:48.090 --> 01:25:52.170
our GPUs as well right. So we have defined up inbound rule

01:25:52.170 --> 01:25:55.890
even inside a GPU. So what we can do so we can try to click

01:25:55.890 --> 01:25:59.910
on this inbound rule and yeah so we can try to maybe modify

01:25:59.910 --> 01:26:03.650
this inbound rule and you know we can we can try to add a

01:26:03.650 --> 01:26:08.890
new rule for us. Is it making sense to all of us guys if I'm

01:26:08.890 --> 01:26:13.410
not able to you know launch something it simply means that

01:26:13.410 --> 01:26:17.750
that inbound rule and here. So nowhere port 8000 is allowed.

01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:23.370
Right from outside. So like traffic to a 8000 port number is

01:26:23.370 --> 01:26:27.130
allowed from outside. So that's the only reason that's the

01:26:27.130 --> 01:26:30.030
only reason apart from that there is no other reason you

01:26:30.030 --> 01:26:33.330
will be able to find out. So maybe you can see a security

01:26:33.330 --> 01:26:36.590
group over here. So you can go into a security group on my

01:26:36.590 --> 01:26:40.730
left hand side this panel and then create a security group

01:26:40.730 --> 01:26:45.370
and I can try to attach it or maybe I can try to go to a

01:26:45.370 --> 01:26:49.310
dashboard. I can go into this instance. It's self. So this

01:26:49.310 --> 01:26:53.250
is my instance by the way I can get into this particular

01:26:53.250 --> 01:26:57.670
instances and then I can try to even change inbound rule

01:26:57.670 --> 01:27:02.210
here itself. So what are inbound rules and why we are need

01:27:02.210 --> 01:27:05.550
those rules simple right. So here something is running

01:27:05.550 --> 01:27:08.270
inside AWS there is a machine. This is a machine by the way

01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:11.630
this URL is nothing but a machine just like a local host and

01:27:11.630 --> 01:27:14.850
inside that machine. So there is something like at 8000 port

01:27:14.850 --> 01:27:17.450
something is running something is my application opened. The

01:27:17.450 --> 01:27:22.070
UI is running now it's available inside AWS instances. I'm

01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:26.170
trying to access this URL and this 8000 port of that machine

01:27:26.170 --> 01:27:30.750
from outside right. So when I'm trying to hit it's inbound

01:27:30.750 --> 01:27:33.730
inbound for AWS machine and that's the reason. So you have

01:27:33.730 --> 01:27:37.170
to add as an inbound rule if you are not going to add as an

01:27:37.170 --> 01:27:40.690
inbound rule it is not going to work for you. It is not

01:27:40.690 --> 01:27:46.680
going to even allow you by the way so are we are we able to

01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:52.260
understand inbound rule. By the way yeah and same thing I

01:27:52.260 --> 01:27:54.440
believe we have done right even

01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:02.940
with respect to a GPU. So when we were trying to access a

01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:04.680
GPU we have done the exact same thing.

01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:47.600
Okay so now what I will do I'll just go and I'll try to

01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:51.580
change the inbound rule nothing much and yeah so with the

01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:56.480
help of that you know I will be able to like do the changes.

01:28:56.660 --> 01:29:01.740
It's very simple so like go to your security and here so

01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:04.860
this is a security group which has been attached to your

01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:10.920
like this one your instances so click on that yeah click on

01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:15.480
that so click on this one and then try to add a new inbound

01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:19.060
rule so edit inbound rule click over there and then over

01:29:19.060 --> 01:29:26.420
here add rule so add what so add a custom TCP and then again

01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:29.760
so just try to add a port number so port number is basically

01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:33.360
8000 so that from outside anyone can hit on 8000. Okay. And

01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:37.580
then CIDR block so 0 slash 0 slash 0 so 8000 you have to

01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:40.620
open up and then you have to open up even 3000 3000 for

01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:45.120
Grafana means for a monitoring. So again here 0 0 so these

01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:48.120
two like a rules you have to add so I'm just trying to allow

01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:53.060
traffic to these two ports so any other port people will not

01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:57.860
be able to hit so this is again one of the security part if

01:29:57.860 --> 01:30:02.280
I have opened up 8000 anyone will be able to hit on 8000

01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:06.200
itself. So again I have defined 0.0.0 let's suppose if I'm

01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:09.260
going to define a particular IP address for example my

01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:13.920
system IP address so only I will be able to hit you will not

01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:17.560
be able to hit that I have defined 0.0.0. slash masking 0

01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:20.520
right it simply means that everyone open to the entire world

01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:24.240
let's suppose I just want a traffic only from India not from

01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:28.120
outside I can configure each and everything inside my

01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:31.600
security group so this is how again one layer of security we

01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:34.900
try to manage. Okay. Okay. Any kind of you know traffic that

01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:37.880
is going to hit or anyone who is going to hit my application

01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:41.500
so here I have simply defined that from outside you can hit

01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:46.540
only 8000 3000 like I said I have an option and I can try to

01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:51.080
define all of these things so from where only which range of

01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:54.240
IP addresses everything I can define and beyond that no one

01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:58.800
will be able to hit my system at all. Okay so for 8000 3000

01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:02.520
and then save the rules simple save the rules so again go to

01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:06.860
your EC2 instances dashboard instance running and here so

01:31:06.860 --> 01:31:09.940
now if you will go and check your security so we have added

01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:15.680
3000 8000 right 3000 8000 now go ahead and hit this URL and

01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:20.620
now URL is up that was the only issue so it's running it's

01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:24.560
running in my system and click on get started and now I am

01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:28.280
able to see for the very first time my UI interface as of

01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:33.340
now just a UI interface which is ready to me. And those who

01:31:33.340 --> 01:31:36.600
are going to join for the very first time you will become an

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:39.520
admin so this is an admin account you have to create and

01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:42.400
then you can create even a user account I will show you that

01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:45.540
part so maybe admin account let me create it so enter my

01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:48.980
name so maybe I can enter my name enter my email id so maybe

01:31:48.980 --> 01:31:52.900
I can try to enter my email id I can give my like a password

01:31:52.900 --> 01:31:58.660
over here so this is for the very first time this is going

01:31:58.660 --> 01:32:00.860
to be the admin account basically I can control a lot of

01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:04.060
things from here itself. So click on create admin account

01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:11.240
and bingo right I am able to land into my UI interface as of

01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:14.820
now there is no model which is available it is not going to

01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:18.000
respond back to you at all we have to configure that

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:22.540
particular part as of now just my UI interface is ready only

01:32:22.540 --> 01:32:26.040
UI interface right let's suppose I am going to share my your

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:29.060
own UI interface again in the similar manner just a UI

01:32:29.060 --> 01:32:32.640
interface then I have to you know either configure my API's

01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:34.020
or maybe I have to configure my API's. Maybe if I am trying

01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:37.100
to like host some of my own custom model then I have to

01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:41.820
attach that particular back end so just a UI interface and

01:32:41.820 --> 01:32:45.560
as you can see it is available into HTTP mode not in a HTTPS

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:50.100
mode at this URL so are you able to get this open web UI

01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:57.640
guys at your URL not my URL your URL basically. So what is

01:32:57.640 --> 01:33:01.060
your URL it is already visible so this is your URL if you

01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:03.700
will go into your instance. This is your DNS this is your

01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:08.040
URL at means by this URL you are reaching out to your

01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:11.740
machine a local host right you can say local host we do so

01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:17.660
127.0.0.1 similarly this is the URL and then in that machine

01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:21.340
we run application at certain port number 8000 3000 whatever

01:33:21.340 --> 01:33:25.580
it is so colon 8000 so this is what we have done even over

01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:28.280
here this is something that you will be able to see even

01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:31.380
inside your docker compose so docker ps and you will be able

01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:34.900
to see that. If your docker ps is running then obviously

01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:39.100
everything is up and running for you okay so this is

01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:42.440
something that is done we have opened up 3000 port as well

01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:46.400
so 3000 port is nothing but here open web UI has configured

01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:49.880
Prometheus which is going to capture a log yeah which is

01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:54.800
going to capture a log now I have to showcase a log right I

01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:58.940
have to showcase a log so by default at 3000 port number for

01:33:58.940 --> 01:34:02.300
open web UI Grafana is also configured so I can copy the

01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:07.620
same URL right copy the same URL and then colon 3000 port

01:34:07.620 --> 01:34:10.900
number and I have already opened inbound rule for 3000 port

01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:15.160
number so I will be able to see this Grafana I will be able

01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:18.820
to see this Grafana UI and as of now there is nothing you

01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:21.740
will have to do some sort of a configuration over here I am

01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:24.600
going to like send you one script and you have to configure

01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:27.100
that particular script for a Grafana so that you will be

01:34:27.100 --> 01:34:30.620
able to see a stats in a real time. So here you will be able

01:34:30.620 --> 01:34:31.800
to see a log monitoring. So here you will be able to see a

01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:34.480
log monitoring or system monitoring and again this is what

01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:38.560
we do even inside a enterprise grade application so Grafana

01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:42.560
is something which we do use everywhere right everywhere so

01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:45.800
here you will be able to see a dashboard right here you will

01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:49.380
be able to see a dashboard now so inside a dashboard you

01:34:49.380 --> 01:34:52.640
will be able to see like a new option so you have to go and

01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:56.380
you have to click on new and you have to basically click on

01:34:56.380 --> 01:34:59.200
add visualization so you have to click on add visualization.

01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:04.580
Loki Temto. This is fine I am not going to do that yeah

01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:29.820
so dashboard and then click on new and you will be able to

01:35:29.820 --> 01:35:32.740
see one option called as import option and once you are

01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:36.560
going to simple so at 3000 port number go to dashboard and

01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:39.300
go to new and click on import I am going to give you one

01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:43.020
file one JSON file so which we have created just for this

01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:46.020
application so that you know you will be able to render all

01:35:46.020 --> 01:35:49.300
the logs from your open web server to this one so the docker

01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:51.380
which is running over there. So it is going to like you know

01:35:51.380 --> 01:35:54.600
fetch each and everything from there to here so let me share

01:35:54.600 --> 01:36:03.100
that JSON file I have already created that one so JSON file

01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:09.680
yeah open web UI monitoring yes so this is a JSON file that

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:16.040
we have written a custom one for this particular purpose so

01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:27.850
you have to like a paste a content of this JSON file here.

01:36:27.930 --> 01:36:29.870
So this is a JSON file. So let me send you a JSON file

01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:35.520
somewhere in my drive you just have to open it up and copy

01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:38.020
it I don't think I will be able to copy and paste that much

01:36:38.020 --> 01:36:43.900
content here let me see no it's not possible let me try

01:36:43.900 --> 01:36:47.140
uploading this JSON file okay

01:37:28.450 --> 01:37:30.990
so I have already uploaded the JSON file guys inside your

01:37:30.990 --> 01:37:34.490
chat so you can download it now itself so just open up your

01:37:34.490 --> 01:37:37.790
JSON file and inside your JSON file so you will be able to

01:37:37.790 --> 01:37:41.210
find out JSON configuration for Grafana. Right and which we

01:37:41.210 --> 01:37:44.050
have written especially for this particular purpose for this

01:37:44.050 --> 01:37:47.950
particular deployment right so where so this JSON file is

01:37:47.950 --> 01:37:50.230
nothing but it tells you what kind of a graph I am looking

01:37:50.230 --> 01:37:53.510
for that's it right so all of these things inside a JSON

01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:57.450
file like we have written and proper Mathias and Grafana and

01:37:57.450 --> 01:38:01.030
it is trying to pull all those like data and then it is

01:38:01.030 --> 01:38:04.790
going to show you the graph as simple as that so just try to

01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:08.450
like open up this JSON file copy and paste control C control

01:38:08.450 --> 01:38:10.090
V simple. So let me show you the graph. So let me click on

01:38:10.090 --> 01:38:14.450
load right click on load so once you are going to click on

01:38:14.450 --> 01:38:19.430
this load and then if you will go to your dashboard let me

01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:20.870
refresh import

01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:31.670
and then this load click on this load and import yeah so now

01:38:31.670 --> 01:38:34.690
once you are going to click on this import you will be able

01:38:34.690 --> 01:38:38.810
to see a dashboard open BI monitoring dashboard so now if

01:38:38.810 --> 01:38:41.810
you will click over here as of now. it is not showing you

01:38:41.810 --> 01:38:45.050
any kind of a data let's suppose there is no data which is

01:38:45.050 --> 01:38:49.910
which it is showing you as of now yeah so maybe i can i can

01:38:49.910 --> 01:38:53.350
try to like a login over here say some sort of a high let's

01:38:53.350 --> 01:38:57.690
suppose and here it is telling me that model not selected

01:38:57.690 --> 01:39:01.970
there is no model so far which is available to me and even

01:39:01.970 --> 01:39:05.690
this grafana grafana dashboard which i am able to like a

01:39:05.690 --> 01:39:09.330
look at so this grafana dashboard is not giving me any kind

01:39:09.330 --> 01:39:12.190
of a data it is looking for a data it is looking for a data

01:39:12.190 --> 01:39:15.730
but as there is no interaction with my application so there

01:39:15.730 --> 01:39:19.110
is no data which has been generated for this application the

01:39:19.110 --> 01:39:22.350
open bvi application which i have hosted now to do that so

01:39:22.350 --> 01:39:25.390
maybe i have to do a model configuration so i can do a model

01:39:25.390 --> 01:39:28.990
configuration my own model so let's suppose my self-hosted

01:39:28.990 --> 01:39:32.190
model i can do that configuration as well or else i can do a

01:39:32.190 --> 01:39:35.470
open bvi configuration gemini configuration cloud a

01:39:35.470 --> 01:39:38.630
configuration purpose really whatever whatever i want in

01:39:38.630 --> 01:39:40.730
this entire world or i want to expand all of those model

01:39:40.730 --> 01:39:44.030
configuration i will be able to do it so let me do a model

01:39:44.030 --> 01:39:47.390
configuration for open web ui in a very first place so that

01:39:47.390 --> 01:39:49.770
i will be able to see some graph because everything is up

01:39:49.770 --> 01:39:53.550
for me right everything is up for me in a real time so i'll

01:39:53.550 --> 01:39:56.470
just do a configuration now to do a model configuration i

01:39:56.470 --> 01:40:02.790
need a open ui sorry open a key so let me go to my open a

01:40:02.790 --> 01:40:09.970
official account open ai key api key bvi open bv bvi here i

01:40:09.970 --> 01:40:11.170
think all the key ok

01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:20.920
so I will just go over there and I will try to you know

01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:25.260
create one new secret so let's suppose I am going to create

01:40:25.260 --> 01:40:30.460
a secret so you know on live test secret let's suppose I

01:40:30.460 --> 01:40:34.940
have created simple key I am trying to create and I just

01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:38.120
need this particular key only this key I need yeah so let's

01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:41.240
copy this key and then let's do a configuration so that my

01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:43.880
application will be up and running so how I can do a

01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:48.080
configuration I can go here inside my name right active user

01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:52.420
is equals to 1 I can go to a admin panel and I can go to a

01:40:52.420 --> 01:40:56.040
setting over here inside a setting I can go to a models

01:40:56.040 --> 01:41:00.880
there is a model option which is available or I can go even

01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:03.960
inside a connection yeah connection so just go inside the

01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:07.640
connection and then from a connection there is a setting

01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:11.740
configure option for open API which is available over here.

01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:14.920
Ulama is another one even from anywhere I can I can call

01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:17.780
this one anyone from anywhere I can configure it but first

01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:20.320
of all let's do a open AI configuration and even custom

01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:23.880
configuration I can do it so here I can go inside the open

01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:28.360
AI API click and then here so it is looking for a bearer it

01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:32.180
is looking for a API key so paste it paste your open AI key

01:41:32.180 --> 01:41:34.640
leave everything as it is there are lot of configuration

01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:37.460
which I will teach you in a later stage but yeah just copy

01:41:37.460 --> 01:41:41.100
and paste your API key and click on save now open AI setting

01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:45.980
is updated refresh it once again yeah refresh it once again

01:41:45.980 --> 01:41:51.200
and now if you will go to a new chat now you will be able to

01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:55.800
see tons of models just with one API key tons of model and

01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:59.760
even my like a own model some of my model which I have fine

01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:03.860
-tuned as you can see FTFTFTFTFT so these are my own fine

01:42:03.860 --> 01:42:06.740
-tuned model inside a open web UI environment so all of

01:42:06.740 --> 01:42:10.620
these models is available right. So, if I would like to

01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:13.960
initiate an API. So, okay let's support let's suppose like I

01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:19.300
am going to select GPT 4.1 or maybe a SORA model GPT 4.0 all

01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:22.800
of these model whatever model is available under this API I

01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:25.580
am able to access it so let's suppose I am selecting GPT 4.1

01:42:25.580 --> 01:42:33.220
and I can say hi how are you and let's see the magic yeah so

01:42:33.220 --> 01:42:36.400
yes my model has started responding 4.1 has started

01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:39.920
responding so likewise I can select GPT 5 if I want that you

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:41.140
can see GPT 5 now. So,

01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:44.100
some types of data encouraged control multiple models

01:42:44.100 --> 01:42:50.260
includingành opening..... have a full control are you moving

01:42:50.260 --> 01:42:53.420
to been seen to the third generation only one model ..ktor

01:42:53.420 --> 01:42:57.120
Clarke同edy you've removed the user 거예요 this is a user and

01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:59.580
all of the now let's suppose I'll move on this with you I

01:42:59.580 --> 01:43:04.480
have a full control right that only three models will be

01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:08.520
visible to you are two models. Only one model is visible to

01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:08.700
you and you have other models. Another model is visible to

01:43:08.700 --> 01:43:10.880
you later. I have all sort of control over there another

01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:13.160
model is visible. I can control..". here right so what I can

01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:16.080
help you like let's do some sort of a chatting over here

01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:21.040
right I can add a file upload a file attach a notes even a

01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:23.520
speech I can enable lot of things are not enabled by default

01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:26.600
so yeah as you can see speech and everything is enabled even

01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:29.580
MCP I can try to enable code interpreter I can try to enable

01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:37.220
so give me 10 program in Python for Python so

01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:43.440
a lot a lot of configuration like I can I can do I can try

01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:48.120
to you know change it over here a lot of so and again now if

01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:51.160
I will go to my Grafana and now if I am going to refresh it

01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:54.980
it should show me some data dashboard

01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:11.780
open by view I monitoring

01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:32.580
okay still it's not showing me a data let me check the

01:44:32.580 --> 01:44:34.600
configuration because

01:44:37.700 --> 01:44:44.180
3000 is up simply means that that an

01:44:48.020 --> 01:44:54.100
OTL like a trace I have already enabled it so enable OTL

01:44:54.100 --> 01:44:54.480
trace

01:44:57.340 --> 01:45:02.650
let me check my docker file so docker compose OTL YAML and

01:45:02.650 --> 01:45:04.490
enable

01:45:06.060 --> 01:45:18.160
OTEL ENA BLE fine OTEL TRA CE. Oh! It should be S actually

01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:23.300
yeah so this is a mistake which I have done so enable OTEL

01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:27.860
traces it should be not E it should be S inside my OTEL file

01:45:27.860 --> 01:45:33.740
so control S control X and again I have to run my docker

01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:37.480
then probably like because

01:45:51.940 --> 01:45:54.800
of that mistake I am not able to see because of that

01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:58.080
spelling mistake so S mistake okay

01:46:12.290 --> 01:46:15.950
server is running let me check docker P S. Okay this is

01:46:15.950 --> 01:46:20.030
running let me refresh this one hopefully

01:46:22.430 --> 01:46:23.850
it has not changed my

01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:31.420
2310918310

01:46:33.700 --> 01:46:38.920
23109 okay fine so this one and sign

01:46:41.770 --> 01:46:48.010
in okay so now I am able to see all the models and let me

01:46:48.010 --> 01:46:50.190
refresh this dashboard

01:46:56.940 --> 01:46:58.460
okay

01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:51.780
so maybe it is I have to build my image once again still it

01:47:51.780 --> 01:47:56.200
is not able to take the S part it looks like okay it is

01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:58.000
looks like so docker P P andgan here is the last photo

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:01.180
always ok now I will go back and let me like build it once

01:48:01.180 --> 01:48:07.580
again docker image so first of all I can try to YAML like

01:48:07.580 --> 01:48:10.560
just keep it down it is ok let me do an example. ok now I am

01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:21.020
able to do this type of progress and then compose a docker

01:48:22.980 --> 01:48:26.900
dot com. So I am stopping my container once again and let's

01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:32.940
go and check my OTEL file as well. So here I can do maybe

01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:39.200
cat cat so that you know I can rectify my mistake. So here

01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:45.500
this looks fine Grafana 3000 3000 port UI so I am able to

01:48:45.500 --> 01:48:51.400
launch that as well and this is fine and then enable OTEL

01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:55.200
TRS CES mistake is rectified this was the mistake which I

01:48:55.200 --> 01:49:03.620
have done apart from that there is no other mistake it looks

01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:05.160
like ok.

01:49:13.150 --> 01:49:19.370
So there is something called as depends on after I think

01:49:19.370 --> 01:49:26.010
that was removed by mistake. Hmm. That was there but it was

01:49:26.010 --> 01:49:30.370
like a by mistake it was removed while editing so it depends

01:49:30.370 --> 01:49:33.230
on Grafana so nano build

01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:43.680
is fine volume is fine now here I

01:49:45.860 --> 01:49:51.220
can try to write one thing dpn ds depends underscore on. So

01:49:51.220 --> 01:49:54.920
this changes you don't have to do it guys while I was doing

01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:59.080
editing so basically it was like you know. By mistake like

01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:04.520
got removed so hyphen and then here I can try to write gra

01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:12.080
fana Grafana so depends on Grafana hmm control s control x

01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:19.200
do once again cat so here depends on Grafana which has been

01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:25.200
mentioned volume is fine port is fine traces is fine. Ok.

01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:29.720
Now. So now let's try to again run the same command so sudo

01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:38.560
compose docker otml upd same command so let's run it ok. So

01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:41.920
this has started itself maybe I can try to do docker ps

01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:46.700
docker ps just to check ok so things looks like running over

01:50:46.700 --> 01:50:54.020
here now I can try to refresh it remove refresh and

01:50:56.160 --> 01:51:03.420
then remove refresh. This dashboard ok so I have to attach

01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:07.000
once again because that was gone so I can click on new I can

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:11.380
click on import and then I can try to like copy and paste

01:51:11.380 --> 01:51:16.320
the json file load import

01:51:20.450 --> 01:51:23.890
and here so this one still

01:51:53.460 --> 01:51:57.320
it is not pulling data ok

01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:25.900
hmm let me do one thing let me stop once again. I will build

01:52:25.900 --> 01:52:27.700
the entire image I

01:52:31.030 --> 01:52:33.170
am stopping it once again ok

01:52:55.570 --> 01:53:00.290
so clear and let's try to do some sort of a clean up of an

01:53:00.290 --> 01:53:03.630
image because I believe that is required docker compose otl

01:53:03.630 --> 01:53:11.240
upd that's not a command I would like to run let me remove

01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:17.260
all the images which is available sudo docker compose rmu ok

01:53:17.260 --> 01:53:18.140
let

01:53:25.180 --> 01:53:29.480
me remove all the volumes as well so hyphen hyphen. I will

01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:32.300
remove all the volumes removed fine let

01:53:34.670 --> 01:53:41.670
me see the logs hmm no log fine and let me check docker ps

01:53:41.670 --> 01:53:45.430
so whether something is running inside docker or not ok

01:53:45.430 --> 01:53:50.770
docker ps ok so nothing is running my docker is clean maybe

01:53:50.770 --> 01:53:54.970
I can try to you know build it once again so docker upd same

01:53:54.970 --> 01:53:58.270
command so I have just removed everything guys I have

01:53:58.270 --> 01:54:01.550
removed my volume I have removed my images. I have removed

01:54:01.550 --> 01:54:05.130
my images. Let me build it once again so that I can resolve

01:54:05.130 --> 01:54:08.210
this grafana issue because my open baby UI is working fine I

01:54:08.210 --> 01:54:11.130
am not able to get a stat like you know a data over here

01:54:11.130 --> 01:54:15.610
that's the only concern that I have inside my grafana so I

01:54:15.610 --> 01:54:17.490
am just trying to rebuild it ping

01:54:52.140 --> 01:54:54.940
me the remove command ok I am pinging you it's nothing but

01:54:54.940 --> 01:54:57.860
like just remove that the docker compose command that you

01:54:57.860 --> 01:55:01.460
have right so up and d that is been written remove up and d

01:55:01.460 --> 01:55:05.040
and like keep it down that is going to like keep it down and

01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:07.700
if you have to remove it then you have to like a change it

01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:11.800
with RMI RMI all so remove all the images so that is the

01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:14.100
remove command the rest of the command is going to be same

01:55:14.100 --> 01:55:18.120
you just have to change that last part so I have pinged you

01:55:18.120 --> 01:55:21.820
the remove command and if you have to remove even a volume

01:55:21.820 --> 01:55:24.840
so volume that has been done so again the entire command is

01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:28.620
going to be same till down just hyphen hyphen volume so all

01:55:28.620 --> 01:55:31.300
those commands are you know very easy to remember and

01:55:40.390 --> 01:55:42.330
if you have to check whether something is running or not

01:55:42.330 --> 01:55:45.810
some container is running or not so simple docker ps docker

01:55:45.810 --> 01:55:49.470
ps for checking the like a runs in a docker I

01:56:24.190 --> 01:56:28.350
changed to port 1000 port number 8001 is still not opened no

01:56:28.350 --> 01:56:31.670
it should I so basically you have to allow inside your

01:56:31.670 --> 01:56:35.750
security group if you have given us like a port 8000 go and

01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:40.350
allow that over here so otherwise it will not work check

01:56:40.350 --> 01:56:44.070
first of all docker ps whether something is running on 8000

01:56:44.070 --> 01:56:48.890
port 1 in your container or not if that is running then just

01:56:48.890 --> 01:56:50.530
docker ps is running on 8000 port 2 allow the inbound so you

01:56:50.530 --> 01:56:55.370
can try to like make it 8001 first of all check inside if

01:56:55.370 --> 01:56:58.650
inside itself is not running then how you will even if you

01:56:58.650 --> 01:57:00.870
are going to expose it with the security group it will not

01:57:00.870 --> 01:57:02.110
work although

01:57:06.180 --> 01:57:09.580
I am able to open both the app baby why 8000 grafana on 3000

01:57:09.580 --> 01:57:15.780
is there any application to open the port no there is no

01:57:15.780 --> 01:57:18.200
application to open the port it is basically inside your

01:57:18.200 --> 01:57:24.690
like this one security group in AWS itself. It is keeping.

01:57:27.250 --> 01:57:30.150
Docker ps is not working it simply means that docker is not

01:57:30.150 --> 01:57:34.890
installed maybe you can just type docker and then check okay

01:57:57.930 --> 01:58:01.450
so looks like everything has started maybe I can check

01:58:01.450 --> 01:58:07.530
docker ps let's see docker ps and yeah things are running

01:58:07.530 --> 01:58:12.930
let me do the refresh I have built the images so it is going

01:58:12.930 --> 01:58:16.730
to start from like a scratch it has removed everything from

01:58:16.730 --> 01:58:19.310
like the previous one. Okay

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:32.580
let me attach a key so here setting connections open ai open

01:58:32.580 --> 01:58:36.860
up setting and then over here so I have to keep a key so

01:58:36.860 --> 01:58:43.000
let's copy this key and then copy a key there save now I can

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:46.420
go to new chat I am able to see all those like a search apis

01:58:46.420 --> 01:58:52.460
and everything give me a news for news.

01:58:55.350 --> 01:58:59.050
Docker ps is running. Bangalore. Bangalore or maybe Bihar

01:58:59.050 --> 01:58:59.430
politics.

01:59:08.880 --> 01:59:12.120
ideally it should work let me go and check my grafana at

01:59:12.120 --> 01:59:20.180
3000 so 3000 and then here dashboards let's attach click on

01:59:20.180 --> 01:59:24.220
import and then import the json file same json file that I

01:59:24.220 --> 01:59:28.700
have used before click on load click on import still

01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:40.550
no data there is a issue with my data is there otl file

01:59:40.550 --> 01:59:42.030
itself then there

02:00:20.490 --> 02:00:23.330
is some issue with my passports

02:00:33.220 --> 02:00:37.900
open web ui that is not able to fetch a data

02:00:43.820 --> 02:00:46.420
logs i

02:00:48.630 --> 02:00:51.010
am getting a log and

02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:03.000
say failed with ssl error this this this this grafana failed

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:08.400
to export the matrix to grafana ok so here i can see open

02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:13.500
telemetry exporter this one and failed to export error code

02:01:13.500 --> 02:01:18.640
status unavailable so here i can see that that it is

02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:24.780
generating this transport but it is not able to pass it to

02:01:24.780 --> 02:01:31.600
the grafana that seems to be an issue let me check why i am

02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:37.000
getting this issue and let me fix it because now we are able

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.640
to see it inside the log which

02:01:48.310 --> 02:01:51.210
is a normal one right so generally we get this issue and we

02:01:51.210 --> 02:01:55.290
have to fix it so here it is clearly visible that failed to

02:01:55.290 --> 02:01:58.270
export traces to grafana 4317 let

02:02:09.310 --> 02:02:11.290
me fix it hmm

02:03:01.530 --> 02:03:06.790
so otl file issue only apart from that there is no issues so

02:03:06.790 --> 02:03:14.950
otl yaml and here 4317 so otl exporter is already set so

02:03:14.950 --> 02:03:20.250
enable otl trace enable otl otl trace is equals to true

02:03:30.430 --> 02:03:39.250
otl exporter otlp end point grafana http 4317 which looks

02:03:39.250 --> 02:03:46.210
fine to me there is no issue at all otl export insecure this

02:03:49.250 --> 02:03:55.100
is giving me a lot of pain it should have worked basically

02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:01.980
nano let's go here otl

otl export insecure this is giving me a lot of pain to me

02:04:33.630 --> 02:04:38.710
finally

02:04:38.710 --> 02:04:38.710
i am done so terms poles are used beforeapple beforeazuje

02:04:38.710 --> 02:04:48.110

me open bby not working 8000 word port right still it will

02:06:40.780 --> 02:06:46.980
work like if you have not made a mistake because this otl

02:06:46.980 --> 02:06:49.200
file right that is the only file in which you have to go and

02:06:49.200 --> 02:06:52.060
make a changes and just try to give a port whatever port

02:06:52.060 --> 02:06:55.240
number that you have given it will work on that port number

02:06:55.240 --> 02:06:56.400
okay

02:07:12.370 --> 02:07:16.590
so now i have restarted the container

02:08:30.900 --> 02:08:36.560
uh yeah so bingo guys bingo now we are able to see the

02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:39.980
grafana this is what i was trying to show you so now we are

02:08:39.980 --> 02:08:44.280
able to see that how many total user have see the main file

02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:47.980
is basically otl file over there you have to expose a port

02:08:47.980 --> 02:08:50.360
and over there itself you have to you know handle the

02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:53.000
grafana apart from that there is no main file and in real

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:56.320
time this is what i was like trying to show you so how many

02:08:56.320 --> 02:08:59.560
user is like uh you know have registered so total number of

02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:03.260
user is equals one now if i am going to uh you know give my

02:09:03.260 --> 02:09:07.320
url so now even you will be able to register and as of now i

02:09:07.320 --> 02:09:09.480
am showing you all the models but yeah i do have a control

02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:13.280
over all the models maybe you can try to use my url now and

02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:15.880
in a real time i will be able to see that that how many user

02:09:15.880 --> 02:09:19.760
have logged in and then total what is the total request rate

02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:23.480
per second which my server is getting right what is uh like

02:09:23.480 --> 02:09:27.040
a response time basically for my server what is the https

02:09:27.040 --> 02:09:31.760
status code so whether successful some of the things http

02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:35.240
response time like uh basically i am able to get so

02:09:35.240 --> 02:09:38.780
everything everything i'm i will be able to uh see it uh

02:09:38.780 --> 02:09:43.760
from here right this is a complete real time monitoring of

02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:47.480
my application my hits and these are some of the graph which

02:09:47.480 --> 02:09:50.360
we have configured uh we can configure many more things

02:09:50.360 --> 02:09:53.880
right so this is just a sample graph uh we have configured

02:09:53.880 --> 02:09:56.740
from this json json file that i have shared with you right

02:09:56.740 --> 02:10:00.520
but a lot of things which can be configured as per business

02:10:00.520 --> 02:10:03.760
seed or as per my client need that is possible practically

02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:06.360
so still no one has logged in

02:10:10.510 --> 02:10:13.620
okay there is no sign up option right okay let me do one

02:10:13.620 --> 02:10:20.200
thing enable the user part so so so active user is equals to

02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:27.820
one setting and then not here admin panel and then i can go

02:10:27.820 --> 02:10:33.320
to user okay so function evaluation

02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:47.560
can enable basically default user role user enable new sign

02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:50.080
up yeah now you can try this out guys i have just enabled

02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:56.100
the new signups so now anyone can like you know uh come to

02:10:56.100 --> 02:10:57.860
my system just

02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:06.960
just log in everyone now you will you will be able to log in

02:11:06.960 --> 02:11:10.000
and i will be able to see it how many people have logged in

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.960
how many people have technically registered i can see that

02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:14.020
i'm

02:11:16.680 --> 02:11:22.920
done so let me see so it is not click okay so user and then

02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:26.300
okay so many users fine 11

02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:33.060
users see i'm able to get a stats in a real time i'm able to

02:11:33.060 --> 02:11:36.060
see all the users here and in a real time i'm able to get

02:11:36.060 --> 02:11:39.520
the stats and then how many requests right per second so

02:11:39.520 --> 02:11:42.120
this is basically like uh tell us that okay fine so whether

02:11:42.120 --> 02:11:45.740
we have to uh like when we are configuring a server so like

02:11:45.740 --> 02:11:48.780
uh what is the latency and then if latency is going high

02:11:48.780 --> 02:11:52.040
then we have to move a server on auto scale mode this is

02:11:52.040 --> 02:11:55.040
going to like help me out in terms of taking a decisions by

02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:57.760
the way yeah and in terms of you know doing a monitoring in

02:11:57.760 --> 02:12:01.220
a uh real time so this is a grafana dashboard there are a

02:12:01.220 --> 02:12:03.220
lot of things i can configure inside the grafana dashboard

02:12:03.220 --> 02:12:06.220
but yeah as maybe most of you have seen this kind of a

02:12:06.220 --> 02:12:09.060
dashboard for the very first time uh so i think it's it's

02:12:09.060 --> 02:12:11.820
like a more than enough and even in detail for every request

02:12:11.820 --> 02:12:15.920
for every log for every hit right for every i would say like

02:12:15.920 --> 02:12:20.760
you know a query i will be able to monitor everything no

02:12:22.900 --> 02:12:26.660
models showing okay maybe i have not enabled the model so

02:12:26.660 --> 02:12:31.940
enable new sign up that is fine uh so enable api key

02:12:31.940 --> 02:12:38.420
endpoint restriction so no pending user overlay content find

02:12:38.420 --> 02:12:45.860
pending user overlay title so models wise i think a couple

02:12:45.860 --> 02:12:48.620
of models is already enabled all

02:12:51.880 --> 02:12:53.620
this inside

02:13:19.350 --> 02:13:28.250
a setting user default user role fine so user and yeah

02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:06.280
now you can check now

02:14:15.950 --> 02:14:18.550
i believe model will be available to you uh

02:14:35.730 --> 02:14:40.370
because from here all the models is enabled from

02:14:52.400 --> 02:14:56.900
here i can see all the models are already enabled for the

02:14:56.900 --> 02:14:58.540
users so

02:15:04.020 --> 02:15:06.800
setting and then models and

02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:22.400
it's technically on okay

02:15:25.960 --> 02:15:31.940
fine so here public fine so model was on for admin but maybe

02:15:31.940 --> 02:15:37.480
for not not for you so let me like uh enable one by one now

02:15:37.480 --> 02:15:40.180
you will be able to see couple of models i am allowing you

02:15:40.180 --> 02:15:44.480
web search image generation and code interpretation so i

02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:47.720
have all the control on each and every model so let me allow

02:15:47.720 --> 02:15:54.620
you uh gpt4 so maybe gpt4 i am going to make it public and

02:15:54.620 --> 02:16:01.060
web image code fine now i am going to allow gpt4 gpt5 as

02:16:01.060 --> 02:16:08.620
well so let me like uh call gpt5 and then public web image

02:16:08.620 --> 02:16:12.600
and code save update yeah so now you will be able to see

02:16:12.600 --> 02:16:17.860
couple of model a model which i have allowed yeah okay and

02:16:17.860 --> 02:16:23.120
uh yes this is my grafana right an amazing dashboard it

02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:27.260
looks beautiful so as my data is going to be more and more i

02:16:27.260 --> 02:16:31.200
mean like my entire like uh dashboard will look even more

02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:37.900
beautiful right so yeah it's in production now it's it's

02:16:37.900 --> 02:16:42.360
like showing you like this url so this url is basically a

02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:47.640
machine url that you are able to see we can try to map it

02:16:47.640 --> 02:16:51.000
with our own url as well so we can try to change the dns and

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:55.060
if i'm going to change a dns so eventually it will be hosted

02:16:55.060 --> 02:16:59.360
on my url and yeah so i can try to configure my own sign in

02:16:59.360 --> 02:17:03.580
sign up the way we have configured it uh for huron right so

02:17:03.580 --> 02:17:06.480
with the help of jur зак and sign up plus i can limit your

02:17:06.480 --> 02:17:11.020
number of messages the way we have limited it like 50. apart

02:17:11.020 --> 02:17:13.340
from that so we have done a lot of like a code modification

02:17:13.340 --> 02:17:16.080
as well so as of now you are just downloading open web ui

02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:19.120
but we have done a lot of internal code modification because

02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:22.560
it has to associate and do a lot of like a hand stick with

02:17:22.560 --> 02:17:26.200
our system right it should work as per our existing

02:17:26.200 --> 02:17:29.660
configuration and as per our user basically and as per our

02:17:29.660 --> 02:17:30.160
like a lot of like a handshake with our system right it

02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:32.140
should work as of models so a lot of like our changes we

02:17:32.140 --> 02:17:36.200
have done but yeah so even in this way so now you have your

02:17:36.200 --> 02:17:38.620
own real-time chat GPT and I just have to like change this

02:17:38.620 --> 02:17:41.700
URL so once I am going to change this URL once I am going to

02:17:41.700 --> 02:17:46.280
do this mapping with your URL basically you can say that

02:17:46.280 --> 02:17:49.500
okay I have my own GPT right and that to international grade

02:17:49.500 --> 02:17:52.480
because whatever GPT is giving you as a feature whether it's

02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:56.100
RAG custom model everything is available to you believe me

02:17:56.100 --> 02:17:58.900
everything means literally everything right whatever model

02:17:58.900 --> 02:18:01.200
if I would like to give an access of hundreds of models not

02:18:01.200 --> 02:18:04.220
just from GPT maybe from LAMA maybe from you know group

02:18:04.220 --> 02:18:09.380
maybe from like any other provider I can do it it will just

02:18:09.380 --> 02:18:12.320
take like another one two minute of time for me yeah

02:18:18.780 --> 02:18:23.760
so the real product the real one the real game right so

02:18:23.760 --> 02:18:28.160
launching your own GPT with all fully loaded feature is not

02:18:28.160 --> 02:18:30.880
a big deal I mean like this is one of the UI interface like

02:18:30.880 --> 02:18:34.040
I said again we have done the UI that you are able to see as

02:18:34.040 --> 02:18:36.900
of now on like a your own URI UI. We have done a lot of

02:18:36.900 --> 02:18:39.920
internal code modification and we have a lot of our own UI

02:18:39.920 --> 02:18:43.520
as well so because we work for a client right so whether

02:18:43.520 --> 02:18:46.520
they where they don't want this like a open web UI kind of

02:18:46.520 --> 02:18:49.060
interface they are looking for something different we like

02:18:49.060 --> 02:18:52.960
create something different as per their UI design basically

02:18:52.960 --> 02:18:56.600
right a lot of configuration can be done so which I am going

02:18:56.600 --> 02:19:02.420
to teach you going forward. How I can show my self-hosted

02:19:02.420 --> 02:19:05.720
LAMA model here simple click over I will show you that part

02:19:05.720 --> 02:19:08.080
in a practical but yeah. So as of now as you have asked the

02:19:08.080 --> 02:19:11.300
question so click on admin go to setting go to our

02:19:11.300 --> 02:19:14.360
connections over here and then over here so direct

02:19:14.360 --> 02:19:17.480
connection right so direct connection allow user to connect

02:19:17.480 --> 02:19:21.460
to their own open AI compatible API endpoint so this is the

02:19:21.460 --> 02:19:24.220
option that you are able to see right now this option is

02:19:24.220 --> 02:19:28.200
going to help you out to host your own model and again so

02:19:28.200 --> 02:19:30.600
when you are hosting your own model so you will be using

02:19:30.600 --> 02:19:34.200
VLLM let's suppose even we have used VLLM so when we were

02:19:34.200 --> 02:19:37.220
trying to host our model VLLM is a framework which helps us

02:19:37.220 --> 02:19:41.660
out to host our model right for inferencing so like a VLLM

02:19:41.660 --> 02:19:44.300
compatible model and that is going to give you endpoint so

02:19:44.300 --> 02:19:47.260
we have done that we have even generated our own endpoint

02:19:47.260 --> 02:19:51.420
simple come over here enable it and then you can try to

02:19:51.420 --> 02:19:53.960
basically chat based model you can try to you know configure

02:19:53.960 --> 02:19:57.440
it over here so by this you are enabling it and then you can

02:19:57.440 --> 02:19:59.740
try to you know attach it inside the setting simple it's

02:19:59.740 --> 02:20:02.860
done. I will show you that part so we are going to host our

02:20:02.860 --> 02:20:06.640
model on a GPU and that GPU model means. That means my own

02:20:06.640 --> 02:20:09.600
private model I am going to call it here so

02:20:12.920 --> 02:20:17.880
anything can be done even RAG right RAG so it is going to

02:20:17.880 --> 02:20:21.460
give me a response from my data set everything can be

02:20:21.460 --> 02:20:25.020
configured this was the main part even database I can

02:20:25.020 --> 02:20:27.640
configure over here lot of pipelining I can configure over

02:20:27.640 --> 02:20:30.720
here images I can configure over here audio inferences code

02:20:30.720 --> 02:20:34.780
execution real time web search RAG this is where this RAG

02:20:34.780 --> 02:20:37.380
comes into picture this documentation so I can define my

02:20:37.380 --> 02:20:40.060
embedding models. Some different models some self-assured

02:20:40.060 --> 02:20:43.880
model I can try to define every control you have means if

02:20:43.880 --> 02:20:46.740
anyone is going to ask you to build this like a things I

02:20:46.740 --> 02:20:51.640
mean like it will be easy but yeah like beyond that if you

02:20:51.640 --> 02:20:53.660
have to do some sort of modification then you have to get

02:20:53.660 --> 02:20:59.760
into a actual code that's required so you have to be very

02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:06.280
good developer in that case. So okay my model is running 30

02:21:06.280 --> 02:21:08.100
user I can see as of now. So I am going to create a new

02:21:08.100 --> 02:21:12.840
model. So many people have not logged in it seems right let

02:21:12.840 --> 02:21:17.980
me take a snapshot for my LinkedIn post for today it looks

02:21:17.980 --> 02:21:19.440
beautiful let

02:21:25.780 --> 02:21:29.600
me ping inside a group as well fine.

02:21:30.820 --> 02:21:34.560
So yeah that's it guys I am going to share like this JSON

02:21:34.560 --> 02:21:39.600
file as well as I am going to share this entire document

02:21:39.600 --> 02:21:43.520
which I have already prepared for this entire configuration.

02:21:43.880 --> 02:21:44.840
So I am going to share this entire configuration. The major

02:21:44.840 --> 02:21:50.040
part was basically this one OTL file apart from that it's

02:21:50.040 --> 02:21:53.080
just a easy peasy kind of a configuration. Even OTL is not a

02:21:53.080 --> 02:21:56.340
heavy configuration it's a very simple one but I mean like

02:21:56.340 --> 02:21:59.100
if you are making a mistake then it will give you a kind of

02:21:59.100 --> 02:22:00.060
a pain that's it.

02:22:03.360 --> 02:22:07.580
Suppose we want to left should I stop the EC2 server yeah

02:22:07.580 --> 02:22:11.260
now coming back to your EC2 so as of now things are running

02:22:11.260 --> 02:22:14.400
as we can see and we are able to experiment we are able to

02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:17.140
even generate a log. We are able to even like log it. We are

02:22:17.140 --> 02:22:20.500
able to launch a Grafana over here Grafana UI dashboard and

02:22:20.500 --> 02:22:23.820
we are able to see all of those log. Now if you will keep

02:22:23.820 --> 02:22:27.700
this things up and running so as of now the machine that we

02:22:27.700 --> 02:22:30.820
are using it is going to cost you around 7000 rupees or 6000

02:22:30.820 --> 02:22:34.560
INR Indian rupees right you can convert it into your

02:22:34.560 --> 02:22:38.540
currency. So 6000 to 7000 INR it is going to cost you for

02:22:38.540 --> 02:22:44.740
one month and again so it will be able to host maybe 50s or

02:22:44.740 --> 02:22:47.000
100 concurrent connection right. So it will be able to host

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:47.920
maybe 50s or 100 concurrent connection right. So if 50 or

02:22:47.920 --> 02:22:51.220
100 people are supposed to use your application you can just

02:22:51.220 --> 02:22:55.880
like you know concurrent I am talking about plus you will be

02:22:55.880 --> 02:22:58.600
able to you know see the request over here see the request

02:22:58.600 --> 02:23:01.200
and even you will be able to see the response time. So

02:23:01.200 --> 02:23:03.480
everything is under your control you can try to judge it if

02:23:03.480 --> 02:23:05.940
like people are getting slow response maybe you can try to

02:23:05.940 --> 02:23:09.420
increase the instances increase the machine size but like 50

02:23:09.420 --> 02:23:11.860
to 100 people like you know because everyone is not going to

02:23:11.860 --> 02:23:14.000
hit immediately I am just talking about the concurrent

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.980
connection. So 50 to 100 people can hit with the help of the

02:23:16.980 --> 02:23:19.720
machine. So that is going to cost you in total 6000 to 7000

02:23:19.720 --> 02:23:23.620
INR and plus open AI key is different right key is

02:23:23.620 --> 02:23:26.760
different. So that will be your total cost total key

02:23:26.760 --> 02:23:31.160
consumption and this one and just distribute it to 100

02:23:31.160 --> 02:23:31.520
people.

02:23:35.320 --> 02:23:41.060
In that way it is going to be affordable solution right okay

02:23:44.040 --> 02:23:47.860
Grafana file let me ping you once again I will even upload

02:23:47.860 --> 02:23:50.000
it inside your dashboard yeah.

02:24:03.980 --> 02:24:08.160
So it is going to be affordable solution. So you

02:24:10.110 --> 02:24:13.310
will limit the 50 numbers prompt for each person yeah so I

02:24:13.310 --> 02:24:15.690
mean like a paid one so those who have subscribed for

02:24:15.690 --> 02:24:22.410
courses or maybe for any other you know like Euron plus

02:24:22.410 --> 02:24:26.030
technically or any other courses so generally for them it is

02:24:26.030 --> 02:24:33.190
a 50 is a limit per day input output and again so for a free

02:24:33.190 --> 02:24:33.930
user it is a 10.

02:24:36.980 --> 02:24:39.760
Can we create a snapshot for the future use yeah it is just

02:24:39.760 --> 02:24:41.920
a machine right so you can take a snapshot of it you can

02:24:41.920 --> 02:24:47.200
maybe try to like keep it inside a cool tier so that is fine

02:24:47.200 --> 02:24:48.200
yeah

02:24:53.960 --> 02:24:56.820
you can use open router as well open router AI and then you

02:24:56.820 --> 02:24:59.780
can like you know try to because open router is doing

02:24:59.780 --> 02:25:02.220
nothing so they are just trying to give you like a interface

02:25:02.220 --> 02:25:05.680
and they are just trying to give you basically finally the

02:25:05.680 --> 02:25:09.520
API key for a different different model. So even Grooke is

02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:12.780
doing the same thing so nothing new nowadays many people are

02:25:12.780 --> 02:25:14.280
doing it yeah.

02:25:17.760 --> 02:25:21.120
So you can go and you can try to check. Like over here if I

02:25:21.120 --> 02:25:23.720
will talk about a chat interface so yeah they are like

02:25:23.720 --> 02:25:26.360
having a chat interface they are giving you everything but

02:25:26.360 --> 02:25:28.660
accordingly they are going to charge and if you will go and

02:25:28.660 --> 02:25:35.740
check their pricing so like it is not quite affordable I

02:25:35.740 --> 02:25:38.440
mean like for the same token because they have just created

02:25:38.440 --> 02:25:43.500
a wrapper on top of it right so you can just go and like use

02:25:43.500 --> 02:25:46.440
it I mean like same model you will get an access of it is

02:25:46.440 --> 02:25:48.320
not a different model they are giving you.

02:25:53.740 --> 02:25:56.960
Okay. So open AI directly is more expensive comparatively I

02:25:56.960 --> 02:26:02.700
mean like no in general depends okay

02:26:04.650 --> 02:26:08.470
so fine fine guys so this is all about this entire class let

02:26:08.470 --> 02:26:11.050
me go to my instance and let me do one thing so let me

02:26:11.050 --> 02:26:15.650
terminate my instances so click on instances and then here

02:26:15.650 --> 02:26:21.510
so click on action and then sorry instant state go here

02:26:21.510 --> 02:26:26.790
action sorry instance state and then terminate. So here you

02:26:26.790 --> 02:26:29.510
will be able to get an option called as terminate option I

02:26:29.510 --> 02:26:32.230
will just click on terminate and skip OS shutdown

02:26:32.230 --> 02:26:36.090
terminated. So it will call for the termination and in that

02:26:36.090 --> 02:26:39.590
way it is not going to charge me anything not even a single

02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:45.090
rupees simple yeah so I have just like used it I have

02:26:45.090 --> 02:26:50.650
terminated it and my entire EC2 instances will be gone in

02:26:50.650 --> 02:26:51.190
some time.

02:27:02.420 --> 02:27:05.100
So again if you have to use it then in that case you can

02:27:05.100 --> 02:27:07.340
just try to stop you do not have to delete the instances

02:27:07.340 --> 02:27:11.280
right but again they are going to like charge you maybe you

02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:15.600
can click on stop instances right but still even in a cool

02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:17.000
off so there will be some charges.

02:27:21.360 --> 02:27:24.360
Amazing sir. Phir se maja aa gaya. Haa matlab ye to real

02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:29.200
time application abhise real time kya hoga aur. Right and we

02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:31.520
will keep on adding lot of things on top of the same thing

02:27:31.520 --> 02:27:36.200
yeah. So fine with that guys thank you so much I will just

02:27:36.200 --> 02:27:39.880
upload a file so those who are not able to do it. Okay. Go

02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:43.500
through it go through the document and then do it and then

02:27:43.500 --> 02:27:46.540
let me know about your concern yeah then let me know about

02:27:46.540 --> 02:27:49.360
your concern hope all of you have liked it all of you have

02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:52.180
enjoyed it and with file so you will be able to do it even

02:27:52.180 --> 02:27:53.940
after 6 months of time yeah.

02:27:57.240 --> 02:28:00.720
So with that thank you so much everyone take care see you

02:28:00.720 --> 02:28:03.700
next class next Saturday. So again next Saturday class is

02:28:03.700 --> 02:28:06.420
going to be extension of the same class that we have this

02:28:06.420 --> 02:28:10.400
week. We will try to attach a REG inside this one. We will

02:28:10.400 --> 02:28:15.840
try to host on REG. So if you are familiar with REG you can

02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:17.740
see it is an old friend of mine and right now it is in my go

02:28:17.740 --> 02:28:20.760
daddy account which is available in my go daddy account. So

02:28:20.760 --> 02:28:23.760
maybe you can purchase some of the domain of your choice

02:28:23.760 --> 02:28:27.040
right from go daddy from mail chain from anyone right there

02:28:27.040 --> 02:28:29.760
are so many vendors out there. So you can just purchase it

02:28:29.760 --> 02:28:33.160
and keep it tracker ready I will show you a domain mapping

02:28:33.160 --> 02:28:37.860
in that way it will not show you the instance URL and before

02:28:37.860 --> 02:28:40.520
that so we have to go with the elastic IP address I will be

02:28:40.520 --> 02:28:42.680
talking about it. So what is the meaning of elastic IP

02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:46.440
address, what are the charges that AWS is going to like give

02:28:46.440 --> 02:28:48.720
you for elastic IP address, everything I will be talking

02:28:48.720 --> 02:28:52.440
about and then a mapping of the domain. So this is something

02:28:52.440 --> 02:28:56.360
that I am going to teach you in next class. So that our app

02:28:56.360 --> 02:28:59.200
instance will be live and again we will go through the same

02:28:59.200 --> 02:29:01.940
process but quickly, maybe in 5 minutes of time I will spin

02:29:01.940 --> 02:29:04.840
the entire machine and I will do the setup in 5 minutes.

02:29:06.950 --> 02:29:10.830
Which one is good one, godaddy, doodaddy, right godaddy, I

02:29:10.830 --> 02:29:15.170
know it is a typo. So godaddy or maybe anyone you can use,

02:29:15.310 --> 02:29:19.630
whoever is giving you in a cheap like a cheap price and

02:29:19.630 --> 02:29:22.430
whoever is having your domain available so we can just go

02:29:22.430 --> 02:29:22.810
and check.

02:29:27.750 --> 02:29:30.810
Yeah okay fine everyone, thank you so much, take care, see

02:29:30.810 --> 02:29:33.130
you again next week, Saturday.
