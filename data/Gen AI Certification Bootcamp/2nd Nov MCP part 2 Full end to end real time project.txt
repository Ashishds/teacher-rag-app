WEBVTT

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:04.390
Okay, so hi everyone, I think I'm audible and visible. So

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.910
please confirm me yes or no. So if I'm audible and visible

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.550
to all of you. Okay, so everyone good morning. Good morning,

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.420
everyone. Yeah. Okay, so let's start with the class. So I

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.960
believe we all are aware about the agenda. So yesterday we

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.780
were talking about basically MCP. And we all have done a

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.800
setup. So the code base which I have shared with all of you

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.460
and same code base is available even inside your dashboard.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.280
I will try to understand that particular code base because

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.420
to understand that particular code base, we have to do a

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.460
couple of like installation and couple of setups. So we'll

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.760
we'll try to understand that how we can do all of those

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.940
setups in in our system and what an all component that we

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.860
have inside MCPs. So how we can configure each and every

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.500
component. So shall we start guys? Everyone? Yeah.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.690
Okay, so let's start. Let me share my screen. And yeah, I

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.610
believe my screen. Is visible to all of you.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.980
Okay, so finally do you want so what we have done and what

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.880
we were trying to perform in my studies task is that that we

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.960
were trying to create. Let me open up my eraser. So

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:44.060
basically, we have a data into a MongoDB database. I think

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:52.380
my subscription has expired. Plan final limit. Create a

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.360
blank file. It's not allowing me. That can.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.460
Okay, so basically what we are like trying to achieve over

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:15.220
here is that that we have basically a data into a MongoDB

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.420
second.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.980
So we have a data set available inside our sequel databases.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.080
So where I'm using a neon DB, let's suppose so neon database

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.420
I'm trying to use you can use any other services now third.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.600
So basically we have our. Gmail right and fourth. So we have

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.040
a calendar

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.400
and then we have fifth entity Google seat seat.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.470
So we have basically this five entities and we have to

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.890
expose this five entities to our elements, right? This is

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.910
what we were talking about in case of our MCPs and yeah, so

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.750
we all have done a MCP code configuration inside our system

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.730
and many of us have already tested it and it's basically up

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.130
and running now. How you will. Be able to do a set up one by

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.370
one one by one one by one for all of these entities and if

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.970
you are able to do a set up for all of these entities now

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.330
tomorrow, if you have a requirement to do a set up of any

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.930
other entities, you will be able to do it in the exact

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.450
similar manner. So in a step by step manner, we'll do a set

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.190
up for a MongoDB and sequel and Gmail and calendar and a

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.010
Google seat each and everything one by one one by one and

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.210
then we'll go back to a code and then we'll try to

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.070
understand that what kind of a function we have implemented.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.810
And yeah. So yeah. So I have implemented like a four or five

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.350
functions in each and every segments and if you would like

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.170
to add more and more function in the same segment so that

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.890
your MCPs will be more and more powerful, you can do that

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.150
because this is what we do in case of MCPs. So if there is a

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.610
requirement of the client that even give me this service or

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.770
even try to expose this service to the entire universe, we

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.770
can do that. We can do that in a modular way and we can try

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.590
to add more MCPs over there or we can try to add more tools.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.310
For my MCPs. Technically, this is what and this is how MCPs

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.950
are going to work in general. Now, so first of all, let's

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.430
talk about a MongoDB. So as we all know that MongoDB is

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.010
basically a NoSQL based databases. So where you will be able

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.370
to store our data in a form of document, right? In a form of

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.570
document, you will be able to store the data set and you

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.850
might have used it multiple times again. So MongoDB Atlas is

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.650
providing you a complete online cluster. So where you can go

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.510
and you can try to, you know, create a cluster and then you

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.350
will be able to store a data as per your use. And now to

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.030
create a cluster. So maybe you can try to go to this

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.330
particular link. So just go to Google and try to search for

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.230
or maybe I have pinged you the link, right? So it will be

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.090
looking for it will be asking you for a sign in and just do

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.270
a sign in with the Google, right? No need to do a sign up or

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.010
all those process. So just do a sign in with the Google and

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.950
you will be able to log in immediately. And I will. After

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.250
login. So you can start creating a cluster, which is pretty

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.130
much easy. It's not very difficult and they allows you to

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.330
create a free cluster as well. So don't have to like a pay

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.350
or you don't have to even add up card over there. It's very,

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.190
very simple, by the way. So here anyone guys who is not

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:31.010
aware about how to create a cluster in MongoDB? Yeah.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.870
Anyone?

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:46.400
Yes. Okay. So basically, let me use some new email ID. Maybe

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.540
I can delete this one because in a free tier, they are not

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.920
going to allow me to create like a two clusters.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.850
So just log in. First of all, everyone. Yeah. Just just try

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.770
to log in. Yeah. I will not be able to create two clusters

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.510
in a free tier, basically. So I'll have to add my card or

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:19.590
use my official account for that one. Just just try to log

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.130
in. First of all, log in. And then I'm going to show you

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.750
like how to create a cluster inside a MongoDB.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:46.370
So google.com. And then I'm going to show you. And let's

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:51.150
suppose if I'm going with a MongoDB online. Now I can just

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:55.150
try to log in over here or maybe just go and do a sign in

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.870
directly. That's completely okay. So just try to do a Google

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.230
sign in over here. Now after doing a Google sign in. So what

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.650
you have to do. So basically you have to.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:13.710
Yeah. So it's trying to do a sign in over here. Now submit.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.580
So primary goal and all this like basic information and

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.380
forms. They are going to give. So maybe you can try to fill

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:39.400
all of those like forms just like a filled with some random

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.440
data. That's okay. Now you will come to this particular

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.600
screen. This is a very first screen. So where you can come,

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.300
you can try to create a cluster. So basically machine you

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.480
will be able to create machine of your own choice. In case

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.940
of MongoDB, you can select for the free tier so that they

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:58.420
are not going to charge you anything. And then you can try

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:01.580
to give a cluster name now in which cloud platform you would

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.020
like to create a cluster. So AWS, GCP or Azure in every like

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:08.080
a like cloud platform, they are giving you a free tier.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.380
Right. They're giving you a free tier. So simple. I'm going

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.060
to select AWS. Doesn't matter which one I'm going to select

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.180
because it's a MongoDB manage things. I am not managing any

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.220
of these things. So I can simply go and I can try to create

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.380
a cluster. That's that's the whole idea that I have. So

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.380
simple guys come over here and then select your cloud tier.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.840
Right. Always select free. Otherwise in the next step,

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.160
they're going to ask you to add a card if you're going to

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.320
select a paid one. So just try to select a free one, which

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.060
is more than enough for any kind of experimentation or even

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.280
to build up MVPs because they're giving you enough like, you

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.120
know, storage, they're giving you a shared RAM, they're

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.340
giving you a shared virtual core CPU. If you are looking for

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.420
a dedicated one, then you can go for a dedicated one. But

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:52.900
yeah, in that case, basically that is not required for this

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.200
MVPs kind of a project or you can say a POC kind of a

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.800
project. So it's required basically for a production. Yeah.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.200
Done everyone. So just, just go to this, uh, this one and

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.480
then create a cluster. So I've used my new email ID to

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:12.280
create a same thing. So yeah, done because the cluster

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.800
creation, anyone

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:31.460
who has done that, people who said that that, uh, like, uh,

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.880
they're not aware about a cluster creation.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.720
Yes. Okay. So, uh, fine. Uh, now here are free and then you

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.500
can try to click on create a deployment. So it will start

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.140
doing a deployment and it will take maybe like a couple of

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:53.080
minutes of time. Not much, I would say. And uh, here, so

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.480
they are going to pop up a screen. So where you can try to

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.740
give your username and then you can try to give your

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.720
password, keep it simple, uh, or maybe keep it complex,

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.460
doesn't matter at all. You can try to, you know, give your

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:07.320
own username. So I can try to give your own underscore like

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:11.100
a user over here because this user ID and password will be

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:16.260
required at any point of a time, uh, for all of you to log

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.840
in into your MongoDB. Without this, you will not be able to

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:23.440
hit a MongoDB. Uh, you can try to do a setup as of now, and

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.860
even in a later stage, so I'm going to show you that how you

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.480
will be able to alter your username and password. So

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.620
basically you can try to create even a new user. You can try

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.240
to alter a password of the existing user. All of these

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.560
things are technically possible. So maybe I can try to use

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:42.740
this user and somewhere into my notepad. So I'm going to

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:46.120
store it, let's suppose. So this is a Euron user and this is

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:52.220
my password by the way. So let me store it. For my Mongo,

00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:03.400
MongoDB as simple as that. Yeah. Now, so once I'm going to

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:07.340
like, uh, store this one, uh, store this one somewhere. So

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:12.060
again, this requirement is done. Uh, now after that, uh,

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:17.080
basically, so we can try to close this entire interface

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.360
directly. So we don't want this interface. It's completely

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:23.240
fine. And, uh, just wait for your cluster to be updated. It

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.520
will be up and running. So it will take some time. So like I

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.720
said, so it is going to take maybe like a couple of minutes

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.360
of time for you. Uh, and, uh, in a couple of minutes, it

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:37.900
will be up and running. So it is a refreshing and, uh, so

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:43.080
project zero overview now here. So by the time it is going

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.860
to create a cluster, yeah, it's still, it's creating a

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.340
cluster as you can see. So you can come to the cluster tab

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.180
and you will be able to see that what and all activities

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:54.920
happening inside the cluster. Now I'm not interested into

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.340
any of these activities. So basically I'm interested into

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:59.880
this connect part. This is the connect part. So which is

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.480
going to give you a connection string and with the help of

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.200
that connection string, I will be able to connect from

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.200
anywhere with any programming languages. So this is where

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.780
this, you will be able to find out the connection string. So

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.820
just click on connect and then after clicking on connect,

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.620
uh, you can try to give maybe your own user ID and password

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:21.440
for our connection, or maybe you can try to use the

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.580
predefined user. So here I can try to give over here, S U D

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:28.340
H and then I'm going to define my password. Let's suppose

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:33.900
so, so this one, and then I can try to click on create

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.900
database user and then choose a connection method. So here

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.200
after choosing connection method, so I can try to click on

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.600
driver basically. So click on driver and then I can try to

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.480
select my programming languages. So maybe Python, but a

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.360
connection string is going to be same for all the languages.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.320
It's not going to be different. Uh. They have just given you

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.200
a provision of a languages where you can go and select the

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.360
languages so that they will be able to generate some

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.680
prebuilt code for you. Some three, four line of code.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:05.160
Otherwise we just need a connection string. We don't need

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.900
like a, you know, anything extra apart from the connection

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:11.060
string. So this is your connection string. If you are going

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:14.000
to enable this particular mode where they have showing you

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.900
view full code sample. So in that case, they are going to

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.880
give you a full Python client code with the exception

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.920
handling, which is technically not required for me. So if I

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.220
have only this particular connection string, so where all

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.860
the informations are available, so it's pretty much good for

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.360
me because here if you will read out this connection string,

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:33.920
so it is telling me that MongoDB server and then my user ID,

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.380
and then I have to pass my password over here inside this

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.860
triangle bracket. And then this is my cluster information.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.140
So where my cluster is hosted and then where my cluster is

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.920
up and running basically. So this is my instance address.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.980
You can say the free instance that MongoDB has provided me.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.600
So. So at the end of the day, I just need this connection

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:56.540
string to connect with my MongoDB to store a data set.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.760
That's it. And I will be able to hit it with the help of any

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.220
programming language in this entire world, means any

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:05.240
programming languages. So yeah, this is the connection

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.640
string which is required. So maybe I can try to store this

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.700
connection string somewhere. So I'm going to copy this

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:14.020
connection string maybe inside my notebook, right? And in a

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.960
runtime, so I just have to change this password. And I have

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:21.080
already set my password for my user. So this is one of the

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:26.140
user I have created and then like this is one of the

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.840
password that I have created for this particular user, SUDH

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:33.600
user. So which I may try to use in a runtime. Then you can

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.580
try to click on done. So this is the only information which

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.620
is required. So once my cluster will be up and running, you

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:43.280
will be able to use that credential. And with the help of

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.060
that credential, you will be able to store our data into a

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:49.960
MongoDB. This is how it is like going to happen. Okay. It

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.640
will take some time. So just wait for maybe like one or two

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:57.160
minutes, when your cluster will be up and running. Yeah, so

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.620
still it's like preparing my cluster that

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:05.570
I use same credential in both the places, will it create a

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:08.470
problem or no, it's not going to create a problem. So even

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:12.330
over here, if you will come like in this place, there is a

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:15.970
place called a database and network, right? So here you will

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:19.450
be able to see my user, I can use, I can edit the user, I

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:23.290
can even create a new user. Basically. Right. And I can try

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:26.590
to choose a credential type that whether I would like to log

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:29.290
into a password or I would like to log into a certificate or

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:33.830
AWS IEM user. So again, let's suppose I'm going to create a

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:37.130
new user. So fine, not an issue. So maybe I can create SUDH1

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:40.570
over here, enter password. So maybe I can try to like 1, 2,

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:48.920
3, 4, let's say 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, maybe this kind of a

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:52.920
password I have given over here. Right. Right. So let's try

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:53.480
to create a new user. So I'm going to define a role over

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.460
here that what kind of a role this user will be having. So

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:59.600
if I'm going to give an admin role, in that case user will

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.600
be having every kind of access read and write to any

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.400
databases that also I can configure, only read any databases

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.300
so that also I can try to configure. So Atlas admin so I can

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.680
try to even create another user. So SUDH1 has been created,

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:16.000
SUDH1 will be created. Likewise hundreds of other users I

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.940
will be able to create it. Password provided is too weak.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:22.680
Okay, fine. So not an issue. Let me give a little bit of a

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.340
shot. strong password fine

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.610
so as you can see i am able to create a multiple user now

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:34.530
even this user is having admin access even this user is

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:36.970
having admin access i can use any of this credential to

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:40.670
login into my mongodb so it's just up to you it's it's not a

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:44.670
big deal you know to create a user and then assign a role to

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:48.230
the user in case of a mongodb so everything is possible just

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:51.310
with the help of a clicks you can even try to come over here

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:53.390
and you can try to create a custom role so whatever

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:56.170
privileges you would like to give to the user so based on

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:59.090
your custom role you will be able to give a privileges to

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:02.390
the user again network wise so if you would like to like do

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:05.990
a whitelisting of an ip address for example this is the ip

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:09.590
address which is including my current ip address so i will

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:12.050
not be able to hit from each and every ip address so maybe i

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:15.830
can try to click on add ip address and then here so i can

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:21.030
try to maybe like a say that allow 0.0.0.0 it simply means

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:24.270
that that allow access from anywhere i can even they have

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.130
given you like a direct click over here so by the way if you

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:27.130
are using a mongodb you can do that so if you are using a

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:28.250
mongodb you can by the time you are going to click it is

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:32.450
going to autofill simple 0.0.0.0.0 simply means that that

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:35.990
allow from anywhere right and you can even set that you can

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:39.450
allow from anywhere for how many hours one day one week or

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:43.150
maybe six hours or maybe switch it off means permanently you

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:46.410
are allowing everyone to hit your cluster right so you can

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:49.410
even create this kind of a restrictions and that is also

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:52.890
possible you can even try to allow just your own ip address

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:56.350
so that anyone and everyone from any other ip address even

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:58.810
they will be having a credential even they will be having

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:01.550
you know their user your user id and password they will not

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:04.190
be able to hit your cluster at all because you have not

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:06.730
whitelisted their ip address so these are just a security

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.710
check that we always do whenever we are going to create any

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:13.770
kind of a system and by default inside a mongodb atlas which

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:16.770
we are using even in production so if i'll talk about our

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:19.330
job system so we are using actually mongodb cluster over

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:23.510
there uh in many places in like an iran system we are using

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:26.490
a mongodb cluster as well as we are using a post grace uh

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:29.050
depends on the architecture that we have designed for a

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:32.430
specific product that we have created uh so yeah mongodb is

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:35.050
one of the active databases that we are using since a very

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:38.730
very long time it's one of the world's best stable reliable

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:42.150
you can say database where you can run your entire

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:45.330
production system and obviously they have given you

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:48.450
everything just on a click itself so you don't have to do

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:51.510
much even they have started providing you a vector databases

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:54.890
right so even you can try to store your data into in a form

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:58.870
of vector and that also mongo supports now originally it was

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:02.410
designed for a no sql collection based databases but

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:05.510
eventually they have started at adding more and more more

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:10.430
and more services into it and now in a age of gen ai so they

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:14.770
have started supporting even a vector databases it's a bit

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:19.470
expensive as compared to any other uh like you know a no sql

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:22.850
databases which is available in a market but i believe

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:26.050
that's okay because uh it's because of its reliability

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:30.870
obviously the kind of a market share that mongodb holds so

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:33.890
you can't run your production databases on these like you

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:37.130
know a new platforms uh that will be too much risky for you

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:39.950
in terms of a data governance and data security and

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:43.750
generally we try to go ahead with this kind of a solution so

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:46.070
yeah all of these things you can try to do a setup in the

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:49.070
easiest possible manner now let's go back and check uh about

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:54.710
the cluster so uh yeah i think it's still in a provisioning

00:20:54.710 --> 00:21:03.950
state uh by the way so as you can see so foreneeye

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:05.550
and tabEveryOnlightTalk of the non-cı mongodb内 extent will

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:08.430
be available and inside it um get something like rc to

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:10.790
connect you can see that i will try to uh connect this until

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:13.850
these pelo connectedph reveal and so now i have get this

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:17.070
deploy actually there only off to this according to the

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:17.870
Arduino that i interviewed has been done so i have yellowed

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:17.870
it so that they can get us you can use this moo rightlean

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:21.430
whatever it is which is i'm surprised i am not sure although

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:27.090
i know that sql just

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:29.330
explained collections which is available and i can come and

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:32.430
i can try to browse it over here yeah i can come and i can

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:35.290
try to browse it over here which is good which is like a

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:39.330
pretty much good for our experimentation so i'll try to ask

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:42.390
my mcps that okay fine so try to give me all the collections

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:47.010
and all the database it will be able to give me and plus i

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:50.370
can ask for the data so some sample data is already

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:53.070
available so for your practice so you don't have to load a

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:57.070
data in case of in in this one by the way if you would like

00:21:57.070 --> 00:22:00.630
to load it you can do that as well yeah like i said so they

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:02.770
have started providing you a vector search as well so as you

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:05.490
can see search and vector search this option they have added

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:08.150
newly this option was actually originally it was not

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:11.710
available so recently they have like you know added this

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:15.370
particular options so fine once your cluster setup is done

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:19.210
then bingo and we are like good to go with the next step so

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:23.190
done guys everyone yeah mongo dv yeah

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.740
how to choose between postgres and mongo dv postgres is

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:32.160
basically a sql system right so wherever you have a

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.500
structure kind of a data so in that case you can just go

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.700
ahead with the postgres whenever you have an unstable data

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:40.420
so in that case go ahead with the mongo db simple so

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:46.200
postgres is a sql mongo db is a no sql based databases now

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:52.360
so mongo db is fine so mongo db is one of the database that

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:55.640
i have now another database is basically some sql based

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.820
databases so again there are so many other platforms which

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:03.360
i'm using one of those so neon platform i'm trying to use i

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:07.440
believe i have already used this database in this class i

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:11.260
don't remember because i have used it somewhere i know but

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:14.960
not sure whether i have used this database in your class or

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:20.780
not so neon is one of the database provider you can say so

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:24.300
where you will be able to configure your sql db so

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:29.600
technically a postgres db you will be able to configure this

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:29.600
database for that reason when there will be another database

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.740
or when where you can try to store your data into some of

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:36.740
the tables and views and all sql kind of operation you all

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:40.240
will be able to run in a easiest possible manner and again

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.860
they are providing you a free instances so no need to pay no

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:45.740
need to add a card even you can come over here and you can

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:48.060
try to use it directly and that is the reason so we are

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:51.600
choosing these databases now these databases again plays a

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:55.440
crucial role because when i will be teaching you a project

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:59.020
which is very soon going to start I think within like a two

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:01.260
week of time we are going to start with the project right

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:04.500
over there I will be using everything I will be using like a

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:08.100
database configuration writing lots of APIs over there using

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:11.940
even a GPUs and we are going to use even a kubernetes we are

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:15.700
going to use even a docker instances over there in some of

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:19.460
the project apart from that so we will be using even a login

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:23.080
monitoring for that Prometheus Grafana we are going to do a

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:27.020
setup for that one so everything will come in one single

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:31.400
package in one single project because we are going to build

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.360
a real time project a project which will not just behave

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.500
like a PoCs but it will more like behave like a product

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.940
basically right so that is a kind of a project we are going

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:44.240
to look into and obviously database plays a pretty much

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:47.280
crucial role so at that point of a time I will be using

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.860
these right. So maybe I will be using this. I will be using

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.420
this in some of the project and then I will be using like

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:56.020
AWS based Postgres I will try to go and spin some machine

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:59.960
over there and then inside AWS inside Azure inside GCP we

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:03.840
will be using this. So it's good to have some sort of a you

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.980
know heads up about these databases in between and it's not

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.100
that tough I think we all can understand in the easiest

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:13.880
possible manner. So here like I said so just go to this neon

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:20.140
console and try to create a try to again create a database

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:23.080
over here and which is like a pretty much easy they are

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.480
giving you a direct connect over here so you can just click

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.960
on connect and then you will be able to get a connection

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.640
string so as you can see so you will be able to get a

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.780
connection string so by default they are giving you a

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:37.060
connection string for your particular databases if you want

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:40.760
you can go and by default there will be a neon DB they are

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:44.040
like a creating and if you would like to create a new

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.960
database you can try to create a new database inside a neon

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.640
DB. So I am inside a neon DB database. By default. By the

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.160
way and I am just like I have to copy this particular string

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.420
so that whatever table that we have inside this neon DB

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:58.320
database I will be able to get an access with the help of

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.440
this particular credential. It's again very simple right

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:07.200
neon databases and if you will go and check so inside my SQL

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.720
editor so I can try to show you this is the neon DB and I

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.940
have created couple of table inside it. So I have created a

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:16.320
customer table order table order item table this this this

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.500
this is something which I have already created. So maybe I

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:24.700
can try to give you a create table command yeah

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:31.460
so these are the tables which I have created so I am pinging

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:34.200
you this create table command so that even you will be able

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:38.400
to create a table so they are giving you a beautiful UI and

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.840
nowadays everyone is giving you a beautiful UI interface

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:44.060
without any kind of a hustle without setting up you know a

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:48.400
black console you can like hit and you will be able to do

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.220
each and everything in a just possible manner. So. So these

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:54.980
are the table couple of table I am like a creating yeah and

00:26:54.980 --> 00:27:00.180
then after that so you can start inserting basically a data

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:05.080
inside this table one by one one by one one by one. So in

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.100
this way your SQL databases will be prepared so we are just

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:10.840
preparing it so that my MCPs can talk to it and then MCPs

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:14.180
will be able to show me a data and I will be able to do a

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:17.640
validation that's a that's the only idea right so you can

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:21.160
basically come to a SQL editor. Right. You can run it one by

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:24.900
one or maybe all in one single sort you can try to run it

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:28.860
very very simple. So just try to copy this entire things

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.840
guys the things which I have pinged you and

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:41.150
try creating it so let me copy this even over here so that I

00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:43.830
will be able to upload it inside your dashboard at the time

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:49.190
of uploading a recordings so here

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.280
so

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:10.580
create tables inside any database. Mine is neon DB your

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:13.220
could be different you can try to give your own name that's

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:16.560
completely okay in a connection string so connection string

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:20.660
basically they provide you on a database label so anyhow it

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:24.080
will be available inside the connection string and you can

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.740
talk to it okay.

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:34.080
So basically my database setup is done for MongoDB as well

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:37.160
as for a SQL databases this like a database setup is done

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:41.220
and I have a table inside the table I have some data set.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:44.180
Okay. Which is available to me now if I have some sort of a

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.920
data set which is available inside my table so I am good to

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.280
go right my MC I will be able to test my MCP that whether

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:53.960
they are giving me correct result or not with this like a

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:57.040
four five table which I have already created over here right

00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:01.060
and like I said so you can you can just like go to your

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:03.780
dashboard and then you can try to click on connect very

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:06.860
simple select your databases because they are providing you

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:10.420
a connection string on a database label so just copy it and

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:13.600
by default they are attaching a key so you don't have to do

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:16.640
much over here so you can just copy the snippet copy this

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.200
entire like a string and this string is going to help you

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.060
out in terms of login right so this is the string which is

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:25.420
required so which I am going to use it to you know do a

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:31.660
setup of my MCPs as simple as that so this is my for a SQL

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:34.780
database and this is the string so this is my user ID and

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:38.720
this is my password by the way so this is yeah till this

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:41.540
point this is a password. Okay. Okay. So all of the

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:46.260
information is about my cluster basically inside my SQL

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:50.940
system by the way so everyone are you able to get your

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:56.140
connection string yeah even for a SQL DB neon and

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:01.650
I have already pinged you a create table and insert data

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:04.870
into a table everything I have pinged you inside a chat box

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:08.530
so is it done guys everyone yes

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.920
I am just waiting for the confirmation from everyone of you

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:20.880
okay.

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:35.410
So no one has confirmed I think people are feeling lazy in a

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:40.350
morning that's okay but try to do it as soon as possible

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:44.870
okay all done all done okay adding tables okay fine just try

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:47.650
to add tables quickly just just copy all this command in one

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:49.870
single sort you don't have to like run this command one by

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:52.350
one one by one so already we have tested this command so

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:56.870
just copy and run it in a one single SQL editor just within

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:59.590
a fraction of second it will end up creating it this is how

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:01.990
simple it is and I believe we all know like creating. A

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:05.030
table statement and insert data into a table statement right

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:10.250
so okay so this setup is done now the next one right so the

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:13.890
next one which is required for me is a Gmail calendar and a

00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:18.250
Google seat right now all of these three set up you will be

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:22.170
able to do it from one single place and to do all of these

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:25.870
three set up I don't need much so basically I need an access

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:30.130
of a Google console that's it so and again that is free so

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:33.270
Google is providing you. Like these services just for free

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:37.510
now to do that what you will have to do so basically I

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:41.470
wanted to expose my mail id I wanted to expose my Google

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:45.690
seat I would like to expose my Google calendar or Google is

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:48.810
providing you a multiple other services as well as you can

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:52.170
see right they are providing your drive YouTube Gemini map

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:55.010
search calendar many more things right many more things they

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:58.790
are providing you so if I would like to access any of these

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:01.330
services programmatically right programmatically. Then

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:04.670
obviously I have to expose those services and then only I

00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:09.670
will be able to access it programmatically now keeping that

00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:13.330
in a mind what you have to do so let's suppose this account

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:16.130
I would like to access so whatever Gmail account you have

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:20.690
right whatever Gmail account you have just do one thing go

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:24.090
to Google and then Google cloud console just try to search

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:27.090
for Google cloud console that's it for any Google services

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:30.630
so tomorrow even if you have to spin a machine. Maybe a GPU.

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:34.790
Maybe a CPU maybe a VMs maybe a Kubernetes cluster you can

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:37.790
do it from a Google cloud console itself so everything is

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:41.330
from a Google cloud console just like a AWS cloud console so

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:44.350
AWS is also providing you AWS console in a similar manner so

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:47.250
Google is having a Google cloud console and in your project

00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:50.130
in one of the project so as per your syllabus I will be

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:53.130
using even a Google services so in one of the project I will

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:55.790
be using Google services in one of the project I will be

00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:58.550
using Azure services in one of the project I will be using a

00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:01.850
AWS services. Because these are the three major market

00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:04.570
player and majority of time if you are going to join an

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:08.330
industry so you will end up using these three majorly AWS

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:11.070
but yeah these three because these three are the major

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:14.410
player then other like things you will end up using so

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:17.050
simple search for Google cloud console you can create an

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:20.370
account just for free right with the same email id same

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:24.210
email id not a different one and they are not going to ask

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:27.290
you to add a card they are going to give you a free credit

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:29.930
by the way right they are going to give you a free credit.

00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:34.150
So here just in no time you will be able to log into a

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:36.450
Google cloud they will be looking for some verification

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:39.610
initial verification and they are giving you like a some

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:42.730
credit so as you can see so this is the new account which I

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:45.730
have created I have multiple accounts and in this account so

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:51.110
they are giving me like a 26615 like a rupees of a credit or

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:55.050
approximately I think 3 dollar of credit 300 dollar of

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:57.850
credit you will be able to get inside a Google cloud

00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:01.530
console. So 300 dollar of credit 26000 rupees even in Indian

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:04.970
like a currency is like a pretty much enough right pretty

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:08.650
much enough and just by like a clicking on like a couple of

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:11.310
steps you will be able to simply log in and then you will be

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:15.150
able to create the account so just go ahead and go to the

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:17.750
Google cloud console and create your account guys and this

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:22.990
account we all need it even for a future. Asking for a

00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:26.110
payment verification do it then do it they

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:30.580
are they are giving you a 300 dollar of credit. Once you are

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:32.700
going to exhaust this credit then only they are going to

00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:36.080
charge you from your like a card that you are going to add

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.880
or payment method that you are going to add before that they

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:42.900
are not going to charge you so don't use our services beyond

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:45.660
that maybe go and create a new account yeah.

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:54.750
So just do it guys quickly in 2 minute of time so that I

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:57.770
will be able to expose my Gmail I will be able to expose my

00:34:57.770 --> 00:35:01.430
calendar I will be able to expose any other Google services

00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:02.150
going forward.

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:08.050
They provide you. They provide you even a beautiful vortex

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:11.770
AI so which is basically been used for entire I would say

00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:15.950
machine learning like a model training hosting everything

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:18.590
everything and vortex AI is very very popular like a tool

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:24.210
among like everyone I would say plus big query table they

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:28.610
are going to give you plus so many like API services for all

00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:32.370
kind of AI job computer vision job I have been using like

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:35.850
their computer vision APIs since a very very long time I

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:40.050
think. Since inception of the computer vision API in some of

00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:45.130
my project I have been using it need to login with the same

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:47.110
account which I have a Gmail account right obviously yes

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:49.550
then only you will be able to expose otherwise you will not

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:53.170
be able to expose so whatever Gmail account that you have so

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:56.690
just try to expose just try to login with the login into a

00:35:56.690 --> 00:36:01.650
Google cloud console it's very simple couple of steps just

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:05.250
try to add and they are giving you a lot of credit. So don't

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:08.610
worry for 6 months. I think 6 months or 3 months. I don't

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:10.710
remember correctly but yeah they are giving you enough

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:16.110
credit for like a particular tenure a 3 months okay so for 3

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:18.250
months I think yeah they are giving you like a credit.

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:30.790
So now just just ping me guys once you are able to login

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:33.050
just login and then I will tell you how to like you know

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:36.390
proceed ahead how to create a project and then how to enable

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:40.590
your like calendar and Gmail and other things okay

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:37.730
so is it done guys anyone and I am just waiting for you for

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:40.150
all of you. Yeah. Yeah. So Dhruv is saying that okay it's

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:43.770
done. What about others guys please respond and do it

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:45.150
quickly just

00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:50.990
just login after that so I am going to show you the steps

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:54.290
because we have a couple of steps after that and you need my

00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:56.150
assistance over there yeah

00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:10.170
so we proceed ahead with the next step okay

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:23.040
so it is saying done okay fine I am proceeding ahead so just

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:25.460
like those who have not done that those who have not logged

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:28.840
in so you can just like a watch over here Dhruv is saying

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.420
yes also wanted to know what after 3 months if we deploy.

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:34.520
Yeah. With the live system obviously you have to pay very

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:37.980
simple so after 3 months you have to pay none of the cloud

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:40.460
services are free basically and it should not be free right

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:44.160
because like it takes a lot of cost to you know spin a

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.460
machine so yeah

00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:53.210
Santanu is saying your payment method require you to make a

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:56.210
one time payment thousand rupees prepayment no no you don't

00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:58.410
have to go for the prepayment or anything just verify your

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:02.410
card it will deduct 2 rupees and then again within 24 hours

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:05.970
so it will like you know credit a 2 rupees and then again

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:05.970
within 24 hours so it will like you know credit a 2 rupees

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:08.170
and then you can see that the card is inside your account no

00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:11.730
need to make any kind of a payment not at all they are

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:14.070
giving you enough credit which is require which is like more

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:18.470
than enough after verification this message is coming I

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:20.870
don't think so no means

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:26.000
they are giving for a testing purpose yeah I mean like 26

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.840
,000 credit is you know you can use it for I will say more

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:34.020
than testing purpose maybe you can run your production

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:38.140
system for 1 2 months with this with the limited users. So

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:40.500
if you have let's suppose 100 to 100 users right and if you

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:44.760
have built some product. So for 100 to 100 user I think this

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:47.720
much credit you can run entire production system in that.

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:53.040
For that many number of users. And again depends upon what

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:55.600
services you are using. So it's not like thumb rule

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:59.000
basically because charges will be different for all the

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.920
different different services. If you are spinning a big

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:04.820
machine then maybe you will end up burning this amount in 1

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:08.400
-2 days only possibly possible for

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:13.060
me deducted 2 rupees yeah it will deduct just 2 rupees.

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:17.400
After that we will migrate I mean like how many times you

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.300
will migrate if you are running a production system you

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:23.120
can't do that right yeah if you are building a MVPs then

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:27.040
obviously like you can do it but in case of production

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.600
system we can't migrate that's the reason so we carefully

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:34.720
choose all the services because once setup is done you can't

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:38.040
you know keep on jumping from one cloud to another cloud. We

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:42.410
are doing our main project in GCP yeah so one main project

00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:45.730
in GCP one in Azure and one in AWS plus

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:53.860
yesterday like a couple of you have requested I have seen in

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:57.560
a new batch which we have launched right the new generative

00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:03.420
2.0 batch so people have asked me to discuss about even a

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:07.880
WhatsApp URI API. So let's see how it goes we will try to

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:11.760
discuss that. So that is basically based out of AWS. We are

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:14.280
we are using AWS stack so we

00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:21.490
will try to give you that project as well. So we will try to

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:24.890
discuss and again so that project backend is completely

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:27.630
developed in a node.js so we will try to talk in that

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:31.210
language itself means I will give you a complete overview so

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:33.310
that anyone and everyone who would like to do the setup of

00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:35.410
that project and they will they would like to build it they

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:40.090
can they can build it on their own okay. So fine once this

00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:44.230
is done right you can try to go to like a cloud this is a

00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:46.650
screen that you will be able to see and then you can try to

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:49.910
click on this project part yeah project part. So as of now I

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:52.570
have created a couple of projects but here so you will be

00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:55.210
able to see a option called as new project so just click on

00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:58.690
new project first of all and then try to give a project name

00:41:58.690 --> 00:42:01.430
yeah any project name of your choice you can try to give so

00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:04.710
maybe I can try to give a Euron underscore sudh underscore

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:09.670
underscore project. So maybe this is the name which I have

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:13.690
given to this particular project and then you can try to

00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:18.150
click on. Like a you know create so name has an invalid

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:22.770
character okay fine let me remove it. So Euron sudh project

00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:26.490
okay now you can try to click on creating a project so it is

00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:30.390
going to create a project for you and as you can see it is

00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:33.770
still creating right. So once this project will be created

00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:36.850
so I will go into this particular project so likewise you

00:42:36.850 --> 00:42:40.650
can try to create as many project as possible and you will

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:44.210
be able to perform a project specific task. In case of GCP

00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:47.390
yeah so Google Cloud basically. So let's suppose this is a

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:49.830
new project which I have created just now for all of you so

00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:52.450
I will click on this particular project and here this

00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:55.970
project has changed. Now I have to do what so I have to

00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:59.410
expose my Gmail I have to expose my calendar and I have to

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:03.090
expose my Google seat. Now to do that so you have to first

00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:06.750
of all enable from your Google Cloud console how so maybe

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:09.870
you can come over here you can try to search for a Gmail

00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:14.150
yeah so here you will be able to see. A top result wise

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:18.470
Gmail APIs simple so you can try to click on this Gmail APIs

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:21.530
because APIs wise you have to enable so that anyone and

00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:23.810
everyone will be able to do whatever they want with respect

00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:27.950
to your Gmail create updates and Gmail anything anything

00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:31.370
with respect to a Gmail account that you are holding simple

00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:34.630
go ahead search for a Gmail APIs and once you are going to

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:38.370
search for the Gmail APIs so here by default it will be

00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:41.370
disabled for you. So as you can see it is asking me to

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:44.950
enable it right. So first of all you have to enable it so

00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:47.850
click on this enable it will take couple of second of time

00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:51.410
not minute I would say but just a second and it is going to

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:55.250
enable it for you. So as you can see it is enabling so and

00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:59.810
now it is throwing me to a API and services part and here so

00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:02.890
this is basically status is basically enabled by default it

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:06.550
will be disabled yeah so just click on enable and then you

00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:11.230
will be like a coming to this particular page so where APIs

00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:14.530
and service things. Right and this is the Gmail API now

00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:17.790
similarly so you can try to search for basically this

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:24.930
calendar calendar services. So Google Calendar API now click

00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:28.570
again and then you have to enable a calendar API same wise

00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:31.850
same way so enable a calendar API for that particular

00:44:31.850 --> 00:44:36.390
project now once you are going to enable again you will fall

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:39.450
under the same page API and services page by the way fine.

00:44:39.730 --> 00:44:43.390
Now here. So what you have to do. So you have to create a

00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:46.530
credential right you have to create a credential so that you

00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:52.370
know you will be able to log in by the way so inside by

00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:55.850
using this API. So maybe you can try to create your

00:44:55.850 --> 00:44:59.490
credentials over here and after creating a credentials so

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:03.710
you can you can you know use that particular credential. So

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:07.850
are you able to enable it guys everyone yeah. So just just

00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:10.710
try to enable first and then confirm me and then I will show

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:13.270
you how to create a credential in a next step.

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:34.750
Yes just enable you don't have to do anything like just

00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:39.130
click on the enable and then it will be like done yeah and

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:41.970
then you will fall under the same page so you will be coming

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:45.550
inside this APIs and services page itself and you can

00:45:45.550 --> 00:45:49.290
directly even from here so you can try to search for API and

00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:52.550
services as you can see right API and services and you can

00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:55.830
go to that particular page even directly and then you will

00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:58.790
be able to you know so as you can see. I have enabled two

00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:01.510
things right Gmail APIs and Google Calendar APIs now there

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:03.630
are so many other things which is available inside this

00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:07.650
particular project I can try to enable even those things as

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:11.370
well that is like a possible by the way yeah that is

00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:15.090
basically possible. So two things I have enabled not other

00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:18.610
things basically I have enabled now I have to create a

00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:22.650
credentials credentials and URL so that you know I can log

00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:27.110
in from any other services or login programmatically over

00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:31.250
here. To do that so you can try to see over here OAuth

00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:35.170
consent screen right so this is you can just follow with my

00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:38.530
cursor right so OAuth consent screen just try to click on

00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:42.570
this OAuth consent screen and by default there won't be

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:45.350
anything that you will see yeah by default there won't be

00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:48.210
anything that you will see so what you can do so maybe you

00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:53.650
can try to like click on this get started yeah get started

00:46:53.650 --> 00:46:57.010
and then you can try to give your app name. So any app name

00:46:57.010 --> 00:47:00.050
you can try to give. So maybe like I'm creating an app for a

00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:04.070
test right test your own app name I have given use a support

00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:07.310
email address so try to give a same email address as a

00:47:07.310 --> 00:47:11.130
support email address over here right simple then you can

00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:14.850
try to click on next basically and then audience so audience

00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:17.650
is internal or audience is external so audience internal

00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:20.610
means only available to the user within your organization.

00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:24.330
So let's suppose we have an email ID with your own dot one

00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:28.490
right so basically that's our org email ID. So your own dot

00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:31.890
one is a org email ID your gmail.com is not a org email ID

00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:35.870
by the way it's a generic one right but even we are using a

00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:39.770
gmail services inside a your own but yeah so we have

00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:43.090
basically org email ID and likewise other organization will

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:46.650
be using gmail services with the org so some people uses

00:47:46.650 --> 00:47:49.590
gmail some people uses outlook some people uses like

00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:53.850
something different some Joho email services so we are using

00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:56.810
Google email services and we have a org but yeah that is not

00:47:56.810 --> 00:47:58.690
applicable here. So you have to choose basically what

00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:01.730
external right so I was able to any test user and Google

00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:05.090
account this one now you can try to click on this next

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:08.790
basically and contact information so maybe you can try to

00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:12.250
like you know give the same email ID that you are using or

00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:15.950
any email ID for a support so I'm going to give a same email

00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:21.090
ID over here now click on next yeah I agree nothing much

00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:24.710
then continue and then you have to click on create so this

00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:28.970
is the only steps guys we have to follow. Okay. At the time

00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:33.170
of creation of app so is it done everyone yeah

00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:42.300
so this is a step number one that you have to follow now in

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:45.020
this way what we are trying to do so we are trying to create

00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:48.280
a application inside a project so first of all we have a

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:51.020
project now inside that project so we are trying to do what

00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:53.960
so we are trying to basically create a application fine

00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:58.180
simple so we are trying to create a application now once you

00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:01.760
will end up doing that right once you will end up doing

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:06.680
that. So let me go back let me go to the project okay

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:19.940
so once you are going to like do that basically so then what

00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:23.180
you can do so you can try to again come back to API and

00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:26.180
services same place right where you have started so the

00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:28.420
service which is helping you out in terms of creating the

00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:32.900
APIs right exposing your other services to a outer world you

00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:36.220
can come to a part called as credential so API and services

00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:38.700
again come back to a credential click on this credential

00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:43.360
part. Okay. So from here so you can try to click on create

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:46.600
credential simple so here is a plus button that you will be

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:51.920
able to see now so create credential wise what kind of a

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:57.020
credit credential so API key or OAuth client ID or maybe

00:49:57.020 --> 00:50:00.100
like this one so maybe you can try to go with any of these

00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:05.040
service account OAuth client ID or maybe a API key. So here

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:07.920
OAuth client ID what is the kind of access it will give you

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:10.520
so request user consent so your app can access. This is the

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:13.940
users data so basically I am looking for this this option

00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:17.960
right so here I will try to select that application type so

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:21.120
application type is always try to select a desktop app over

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:25.320
here yeah desktop app for local testing or if you are like

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:28.140
deploying your application then in that case try to select a

00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:31.200
web application so if you are doing a local testing in that

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:34.340
case desktop otherwise web application you have to select

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:37.340
otherwise Android if you are using Android iOS if you are

00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:39.640
using iOS if you are building a Chrome extension plug-in

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:42.060
then in that case go ahead with the Chrome extension if you

00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:46.460
are using like these things inside a TV application then you

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:49.260
can go with that so they have given you all of these options

00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:53.420
so we are doing a local testing from my system so I can try

00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:56.320
to select with the desktop app so you can try to give a name

00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:59.200
or just leave it as it is and then you can try to click on

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:07.200
create yeah so OAuth client ID now so this is a OAuth client

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:10.120
ID they have created and then I can go. And I can try to

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:14.640
download a JSON my work is done so this is the this was

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:19.340
technically a last step that we had so we were looking for

00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:22.640
this one basically so inside this JSON that you have

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:25.560
downloaded you have everything so if you will go and if you

00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:30.160
will try to check so technically you have a client ID as you

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:33.860
can see you have basically a project ID so you are on to the

00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:37.700
project right you have a project ID over here if you will go

00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:41.740
and observe this one. You have basically a client secret

00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:45.340
right so basically password right so we have a client

00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:49.700
password we have a URL as well certificate OAuth URL we have

00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:51.980
which is going to be a generic one we have a token URL

00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:56.560
inside this OAuth URI so we have all the information inside

00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:59.600
this JSON that we have downloaded so finally and

00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:02.620
successfully we are able to create a secret create a

00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:05.540
credential that's it this is the only thing which is like a

00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:11.020
required apart from that nothing is required. By the way so

00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:15.180
are we are we able to like a do it guys so I just need a

00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:18.340
client ID I just need a client secret that's more than

00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:22.440
enough for me to hit my exposed services so I have exposed

00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:26.420
my Gmail I have exposed technically my calendar and

00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:28.740
programmatically I will be able to access my calendar

00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:34.360
programmatically I will be able to access my Gmail yeah PK

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:37.400
was asking me sir why desktop app not a web application I

00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:40.500
think I have already given you a reason. So when you are

00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:43.600
sending something in a production and desktop app so when

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:46.540
you are doing a local testing so as we are doing a local

00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:50.320
testing so in that case it's not required for me okay so

00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:54.200
that's cool right that's cool and OAuth credential I am able

00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:58.040
to like a create it so all the setup is done guys by the way

00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:01.180
so everything is done for me and now with the help of that

00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:04.920
credential I will be able to access the exposed services I

00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:07.300
can try to expose more and more services even that is

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:10.260
possible. Now I can leave this stream. I don't want this

00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:13.000
Google Cloud console the work of Google Cloud console is

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:18.520
done for today okay now now what we have to do so now we

00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:22.460
will go so we have now everything so we have basically no

00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:25.860
sequel we have basically a sequel system ready we have a

00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:30.740
Google you know secrets client secret and client ID ready

00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:34.940
with me. I can go with the next step so inside a code maybe

00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:39.980
I can try to do all those modification. Yeah so here

00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:43.160
yesterday

00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:46.020
I have already shared a code so code is already available

00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:51.580
mcp latest v1 yeah so this mcp practical code I have already

00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:56.560
uploaded inside your dashboard even this studies with the

00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:59.060
studies class so please go there and then you can try to

00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:05.920
maybe open it up fine. Now let's open up our vs code. Okay.

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:11.340
Okay. So let's try to open up the same project now okay

00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:21.400
so just open up the same project now so this project is

00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:24.660
already available right inside my dashboard now we have to

00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:29.180
do a couple of configuration over here you know so that I

00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:32.220
will be able to access each and every system for which I

00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:35.800
have done the setup so here as you can see so we are doing a

00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:39.500
setup for a Google here you can see we are doing a setup for

00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:42.620
my sequel and then here you can see we are doing a setup for

00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:46.260
a MongoDB and setup wise we are not doing anything whatever

00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:49.560
information which is available to us so far so we are just

00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:53.640
trying to use the exact same information for example Google

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:57.840
right so here you have to replace this client ID by your

00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:01.680
client ID just now we have downloaded right just now we have

00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:03.860
downloaded our client ID so

00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:12.160
maybe I can try to like open it up with notepad or

00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:12.460
something.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.200
Okay. Okay. So we have those information right so our client

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:40.400
ID so my client ID is available to me the selected one

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:45.040
simple right so this is my technically client ID and then

00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:48.280
apart from that what so just just copy and paste the

00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:51.920
downloaded secret that you have basically and then it will

00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:55.280
be done so this is my client ID and then my client secret so

00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:57.740
my client secret is also available inside that JSON file

00:55:57.740 --> 00:56:02.860
right so here is my auth token this this this this this and

00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:05.960
then my client secret. So my client secret is again this one

00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:09.720
right this portion so just try to update your client secret

00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:15.640
over there right and then your redirect URL so localhost by

00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:19.360
default you can just keep it as it is then I am trying to

00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:23.100
give an access of my spread sheet as well right spread sheet

00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:26.420
as well so now from where I will be able to get this

00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:29.980
particular ID right so this is going to help me out this

00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:32.920
client ID and client secret is going to help me out in terms

00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:36.880
of accessing my Gmail and my calendar because I have exposed

00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:40.800
or I have enabled those two services by the way right let's

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:43.840
suppose I have a Google seat and I would like to

00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:47.800
programmatically control this Google seats as well so in

00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:52.000
that situation so I can just go and then I can try to create

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:57.720
a Google seat right so I think we all know how to create a

00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:59.000
Google seat by the way.

00:57:12.990 --> 00:57:16.270
Am I audible everyone? I think I am facing some issues. With

00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:22.320
respect to connectivity yeah am I audible to all of you yes

00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:29.130
yeah then why I am not able to hit Google or maybe Google is

00:57:29.130 --> 00:57:32.830
having some issues I don't know maybe possible okay

00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:46.980
so just a minute I think there is some packet drops in

00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:48.340
between it's

00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:05.020
working Google website yeah in my system so it's like a

00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:07.160
giving me an issue maybe

00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:23.550
for couple of minutes will give me an issue after that will

00:58:23.550 --> 00:58:23.950
be fine.

00:58:40.050 --> 00:58:46.590
Okay. I don't know why I am not able to open up from my

00:58:46.590 --> 00:58:50.010
location hmm okay

00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:53.560
just a minute everyone

00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:06.600
okay so it's it's back so yeah it's it's working fine so

00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:12.700
here basically we are trying to do a setup for like a each

00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:15.860
and everything now so we have to give an access of our

00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:18.940
spreadsheet as well. So I think we all know how to create a

00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:20.820
Google seat. We can create a Google seat. We can go here and

00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:24.620
then we can try to create a seat basically see it from here

00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:27.940
or maybe rightly search for the Google seat and I can just

00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:30.900
click on plus I will be able to create a Google seat now

00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:33.920
whenever Google is trying to create a Google seat by default

00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:38.640
just look into the URL part in between slash D and edit so

00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:43.000
always in between slash D and edit. So this is the unique ID

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:46.480
to a seat Google used to provide so whenever you are

00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:48.980
creating a Google seat and you just need this particular.

00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:53.880
One basically so if you have like this one so you will be

00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:57.740
able to access a Google seat programmatically so this is

00:59:57.740 --> 01:00:01.220
what we can do so we are like going to copy this particular

01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:04.300
portion of a Google seat and then I can try to keep it

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:08.140
inside my credentials or inside my configuration now here

01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:12.280
you can come and you can just try to paste that particular

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:15.680
seat ID that's it spreadsheet ID you have to paste it over

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:19.820
here rest is same so this URL. So directly copy paste from

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:23.940
the NeoDB for MongoDB so whenever you are going to paste

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:27.700
this URL so just change your password so by default they are

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:30.380
going to give you a placeholder inside a triangle bracket

01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:34.200
remove that placeholder and try to replace it with your own

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:38.400
password rest is going to be same. So now I am able to set

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:44.500
up my no sequel sequel my Google seat my calendar my Gmail

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:47.660
by the way yeah. So this is the credential which is required

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:52.400
for me. And I am able to get this particular credential. Now

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:55.960
I can go ahead and I can try to build a MCPs or any other

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:59.080
things right to build a MCPs I need all of these five

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:02.680
services. So all of these five services are available to me.

01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:06.460
So one by one one by one what I can do so I can go ahead and

01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:10.740
I can try to build all of these MCPs in my own way and we

01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:14.300
all understand what is the fundamental meaning of a MCPs.

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:18.900
Simple giving my system access to a LLM. Okay. That's a

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:21.980
fundamental meaning of model context protocol. So it's you

01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:25.740
can say that that it's a sibling of your HTTP request or

01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:31.240
REST API right. So it's basically a way by which anyone can

01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:35.140
expose their own system to the outer world and especially

01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:39.140
when I say outer world especially I'm talking about LLMs so

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:41.960
that LLMs can talk to it and LLMs will be able to access

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:44.840
those functions and eventually it will be able to access my

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:48.380
tools by the way. Right. Yesterday I have given you so many

01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:51.300
different different kind of analogy and examples. So let's

01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:55.860
suppose I have my maybe a Euron website right. And if I'm

01:01:55.860 --> 01:02:00.060
going to create a MCP for Euron so you all can you know call

01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:04.020
that MCP anywhere. So anywhere in case of any LLMs if it

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:07.340
supports because everyone is not supporting as of now MCP.

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:10.060
Right. So there are a couple of vendors who are supporting

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:14.440
this MCP part directly where you can configure it. So you

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:17.520
can talk to like whatever like MCPs. Right. This function

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:20.060
that we have created or tool we have created for a Euron. So

01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:22.640
you will be able to get all the information as simple as

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:26.700
that. Right. So now let's come over here and one by one one

01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:29.160
by one in a structured manner you will be able to find out

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:31.800
that we have created a function. Right. We have created a

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:35.320
basically a function. So let's talk about first of all Gmail

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:38.680
one by one. Yeah. So you will be able to find out a Python

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:42.740
file called as Google underscore Gmail dot py file. We are

01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:45.320
not doing much. So what we are doing over here. So we are

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:49.960
trying to expose all the. The Gmail services in the form of

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:53.420
function. So here you will be able to find out all the

01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:58.620
functions for a Gmail services as simple as that. So there

01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:01.900
is a like a import that we are trying to do. So import wise.

01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:06.000
So we are trying to like Gmail API client discovery and then

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.680
like a Miami text and then get credentials. These are the

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:13.080
things that we are trying to import and then this is the

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:15.300
function. Now what this function will do. So get

01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:18.140
credentials. So it will try to you know give me the

01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:21.560
credentials basically. Yeah. So basically it is going to get

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:24.980
me credentials from my configuration file as simple as that.

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:29.960
This is what my credentials is going to do for me. So get

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.700
credentials and I will be able to get my credentials. Now

01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:36.320
there is a function for listing all the emails. So maximum

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:38.940
result I'm saying that like always try to give me 10 result.

01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:42.580
If I want more results maybe I can try to make it 100 that's

01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:45.980
completely fine. So everything starts with a credential. So

01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:49.280
first we are trying to call a credential. So credential will

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:52.960
be returned by this function. Basically your client ID and a

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:56.420
client secret. So this will be returned by that and this is

01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:59.620
a standard function. So again doesn't matter whether I have

01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:01.620
written this or whether you are going to write it down or

01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:04.080
today or tomorrow you are going to use it. You will end up

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:06.920
using a similar kind of a functions. It's not like your

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:09.200
functions is going to change and mine is different because

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:11.440
Gmail is a standard service. Right. Calendar is a

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:14.480
standardized service. By the way the seat is a standardized

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:18.540
services, MongoDB is a standardized services or like any SQL

01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:21.200
DB that I'm trying to hit is going to be the standardized

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:25.360
services. So there is no logic in that I would say. So it's

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:29.800
just like accessing those data or maybe doing some sort of

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:33.080
manipulation with that data. That's it. So there is no logic

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:36.200
behind that. As simple as that. Yeah. In between while you

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:39.260
are able to fetch a data then you can write your logic and

01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:42.600
then while sending a data back so maybe you can try to like

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:46.300
write a logic and based on your logic send a data. But in

01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:50.020
terms of getting a data in terms of you know sending a data

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:53.200
there is there is no logic and there is no like a science in

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:57.040
that one as simple as that. So your function my function is

01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:59.920
going to be same. It's not going to be different even if you

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:04.300
are going to write it down on your own logically. So here we

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:06.440
are getting our credentials. Right. We are getting our

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:10.200
credentials. And then we are trying to call service dot user

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:14.420
dot message dot list as simple as that. So we are trying to

01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:18.500
call service dot so credential dot user dot message dot

01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:22.920
list. So user me and then maximum result is 10 and query if

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:26.960
we have any right. So if we are saying if we are sending a

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:30.200
query just like we do a Gmail search right. So we try to

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:32.740
search with the keyword inside our Gmail so we can try to

01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:36.740
send that as a query and it is going to execute it. And then

01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:40.100
it will try to get me the result. So result dot get it is

01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:42.620
going to give you the message and it's going to give you the

01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:47.040
message details as simple as that. So hope this piece of

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:51.800
code is fine. The highlighted part yeah and doesn't looks

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:57.480
like an alien kind of a code to us. Yeah everyone does it

01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:59.400
look like an alien code or does it look like a difficult

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:02.700
one. And again we don't have to remember it's like I told

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:05.460
you right. So it's a standard service that we are using. So

01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:07.420
simple. There is a library which is available and just

01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:11.560
calling that library and then like you know fetch all the

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:15.000
result from my Gmail. So just like doing a sequel query

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.060
right correcting it and doing a sequel query. Now once I am

01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:21.800
able to get a message over here then we are looping through

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:24.600
those messages because we have a multiple messages right. So

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:27.440
one by one we are trying to loop it through the messages as

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:30.700
you can see and then if it is a success so we are trying to

01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:33.840
append it and we are trying to return that messages finally.

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:37.180
Yeah. So we are trying to send a message to a user or to the

01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:39.780
client basically right that okay these are the messages

01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:47.440
which is available to all of me. So here user ID me means

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:50.480
basically like I'm just sending that I'm trying to like hit

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:54.380
this entire things. That's it. Just one of the flag we are

01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:59.400
trying to send nothing much. Now so this will try to give me

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:03.840
a list of all the emails. Now here. Uh. To get a email

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:08.260
detail so inside that email so if we have to get a detail so

01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:12.680
again service dot user dot message and then get and here so

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:15.720
format is equals to full. So ID is equal to message ID

01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:18.980
whatever message ID you are going to pass. So you are going

01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:22.520
to like a pass it here as a parameter and then you will be

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:25.360
able to like a format full means just give me everything. So

01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:27.860
this is again a standard like a method which has been

01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:30.540
defined for a Gmail. You will be able to get all the

01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:34.200
messages one by one. One by one. So above one is going to

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.840
list down and then this one is going to give you the content

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:40.020
entire content of your like a mail. So if you are looking

01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:44.380
for a content so this is that function now here. So inside

01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:48.160
that we are trying to you know get a header. Header means

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:51.400
basically a message title or anyone who is going to send you

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:53.940
a mail. So obviously there will be some sort of a header

01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:57.100
right there will be mail title. So it is trying to like

01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:01.720
fetch that one over here now. So data wise. So we are trying

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:05.260
to like a prepare all of these data. So ID message ID thread

01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:09.400
ID subject form to date snippet body everything. It is going

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:13.260
to extract and then finally I am trying to return. So

01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:16.720
success message success flag basically and then our data. So

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:19.980
we are trying to return it over there. That's it. So this is

01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:24.160
going to give you the full messages by the way this service

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:28.660
then extract only a body part. So this is a mess like a

01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:31.080
basically function. So which is going to. This is going to

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:34.240
help me out in terms of extracting just a body part of it.

01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:38.520
So here we are trying to call MIME and MIME means we are

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:42.060
trying to pass our data type that text and plain text if it

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:45.040
is available just extract it or else text or HTML if it is

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:48.500
available just try to extract it. We can try to pass a MIME

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:52.200
type for maybe a PDF maybe for a videos maybe for some other

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:55.960
format of the data as well. If we are expecting that we have

01:08:55.960 --> 01:09:00.080
to process even that kind of a data otherwise it is fine. So

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:03.780
we are just trying to convert that into a URL safe byte 64

01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:07.720
decoded and then we are trying to get that body part of the

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:11.520
mail. So if we have like this kind of a MIME type or data

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:14.820
type you can say so MIME is just for the like a

01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:18.580
representation for the data. Now if we have to send a mail

01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:22.380
so we can try to like again call the credentials and then we

01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:26.860
can try to prepare the message that to whom we are sending a

01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:29.400
message. What is the subject for the message. What is the

01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:32.880
raw message that we are supposed to send over there and then

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:37.420
simple body. So user ID me raw body and execute. So it is

01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:40.020
going to send a particular message to the particular user.

01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:45.720
So this is for sending messages again easy kind of things

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:48.820
and a standard like a piece of the code. Now if we are like

01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:52.100
just trying to search some of the mail. So in that case I

01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:55.520
can try to use this particular like a function so I can try

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:59.720
to like send a query. I can try to send a maximum result

01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:02.400
just like a above one. I am not using anything different.

01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:05.200
This is just a separate function which we have created or

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:08.040
tool you can say which we have created and we can try to use

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:11.880
this particular tool. So these are some of the functions

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:16.000
which we have created which is a simple you can say a

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.020
standardized function to deal with my Gmail account has been

01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:25.720
created. Now once I have these functions so then I can try

01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:28.220
to use this function I can try to export this function to

01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:31.740
the outer world which eventually I am going to do. So this

01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:36.300
is all about my Gmail by the way. Now let's look into the

01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:40.160
calendar part. Yeah similarly so just like a Gmail. So we

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:43.100
are going to use a standardized services for a calendar. So

01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:46.520
first credential. So access the credentials by the way. Yeah

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:50.360
and then list all the calendar events whatever calendar

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:52.700
events that you have. So calendar ID is primary. Primary

01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:57.120
means yours basically. So the configuration that you have.

01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:02.100
So for that we are trying to access it. So by default your

01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:05.320
calendar ID is going to be primary by default right. If you

01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:07.460
are trying to access someone else calendar ID then you have

01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:09.480
to put that calendar ID. But if you are trying to access

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:13.600
your own in that case it's going to be basically primary.

01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:19.560
Maximum result so 10 time minute so it's fine nothing. Now

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:22.420
here we are trying to call our credentials and then we are

01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:27.120
trying to basically like you know check our time. Time zone

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:31.000
because time zone is something which matters a lot right. So

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.700
we are going to check our time zone and then after checking

01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:36.460
our time zone. So we are trying to call this particular

01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:40.560
method which is again the standard one service.event.list.

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:44.680
So just try to list all the event basically. So calendar ID

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:48.020
for this particular calendar time minute and maximum result

01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:52.380
and then single event true order wise start time execute. So

01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:56.020
this is going to pull all the event result. Or you can say.

01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:59.020
It is going to. List down all the events. So once it is

01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:01.740
going to list down all the events. So we are just trying to

01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:04.520
go through all the events one by one one by one one by one

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:09.280
and on an event basis we are trying to return the details of

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:12.660
my meetings basically from my calendar that what is the

01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:16.600
status email location date time start time end time. So

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:19.340
whatever entities will be available inside the calendars we

01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:22.220
are trying to access that particular part. This is one piece

01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:26.460
of the function. Now if we have to create the event right.

01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:30.280
If we have to send a calendar invite just by chatting. So in

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:35.320
that case I can try to use this one. So for that we have to

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:39.820
like give a summary we have to give a description we have to

01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:43.640
give a start time we have to give a end time and then only I

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:47.780
will be able to create an event as simple as that. So here

01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:52.220
service.event.insert this is again a inbuilt function which

01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:54.720
is available. So we are just trying to call that one and

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:57.180
then we are trying to give a calendar ID. And then event

01:12:57.180 --> 01:13:01.940
body. So event body we are trying to send which is coming

01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:05.740
from the like event data. So again it is like going to give

01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:08.880
you a success if it is able to create a calendar invite for

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:11.860
me. This is one of the function. Now if we have to update

01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:14.680
some existing event in that case first of all fetch the

01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:19.020
event right. So get the event first of all and then we have

01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:21.900
written the if else kind of a condition. So get the summary

01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:25.600
and then after that do some sort of a validation. And then

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:29.000
after that so do some sort of a manipulation and then update

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.720
it. So again you are just trying to like use a create kind

01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:36.460
of a things over here and you are just sending a new body

01:13:36.460 --> 01:13:39.960
inside that one. So in this manner we will be able to update

01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:44.080
the particular event. Now if we have to delete some of the

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:47.660
events so for delete some event fetch it and then just like

01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:50.620
a service.event.delete. So this is again a inbuilt function

01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:53.620
which is available. So give a calendar ID. Give a event ID.

01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:55.480
And then it will be able to delete. And then delete the

01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:58.100
particular event. So this is what this piece of code is

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:02.400
trying to perform. Now get a event. So just fetch a event

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:06.680
data. So here so service.event.get calendar ID and event ID

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:10.160
and then it is going to return all the event details. Same

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:12.580
as the above one. So where we were like trying to use it

01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:15.900
just for the creation purposes. So these are the functions

01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:19.160
which we have created with respect to the calendar. If you

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:21.240
have to create more function if you would like to do more

01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:25.120
manipulation you can do it on your like your own. Okay. Now

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:29.320
so Gmail is fine. Calendar is fine. Then there is a Google

01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:33.240
seat right. There is a Google seat. So here in case of a

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:37.040
Google seat again read seat data is a function right. So

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:40.600
service.spreadseat and then get. So get and then spreadseat

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:43.920
ID and then range name. So from where to where you would

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:47.160
like to read it and you will be able to read a seat over

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:52.860
here. It is going to return you that. Now write a data to a

01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:57.160
seat. So again seat. So first of all service.spreadseat and

01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:01.440
then seat.value.update. So inside this seat whatever value

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:04.200
you would like to update you can try to pass it as a body

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:07.320
and then it will try to update inside my particular seat.

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:11.720
This is a function just to write a data. Then append. So

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:15.280
here if I have to append into the existing one. So again I

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:18.480
can try to call this one. I can try to pass a body and then

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:22.280
it will be able to append the information. Now if you would

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:25.320
like to get the seat information a metadata by the way of a

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:28.800
seat. So title seat ID row count column count all those

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:32.260
things. So here seat info you can try to call and then you

01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:35.000
will be able to get this particular part again like pretty

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.460
much standard like a piece of the code. So these are the

01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:40.880
function which is available with respect to the seat. Now

01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:43.980
these are just a simple plain Pythonic function as you can

01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:48.240
see we have created nothing to do with MCPs or any other

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:51.080
technology or any other things. It's. It's just a plain

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:54.940
function right plain function for a Gmail calendar and seat

01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:58.180
we have created over here. Nothing different means literally

01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:03.200
nothing different we are trying to do over here. Simple

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:07.000
plain function eventually I'll try to like a convert those

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.780
entire things into an MCP server inside this particular file

01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:14.440
called as MCP server dot py file by calling tools of the MCP

01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:19.540
or inbuilt library for like a tool calling inside a MCP. So

01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:24.060
is it fine guys yeah is this three things fine pretty much

01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:27.660
standard code and the standard function for like doing some

01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:32.020
of the operation on my Gmail and seat and my calendar yes

01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:35.920
everyone

01:16:39.090 --> 01:16:41.370
yeah so we

01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:46.380
haven't enabled seat API okay just go ahead and enable it

01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:50.460
just enable it I think if we forgot to enable it so just go

01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:55.420
and like you know call the seat and then enable that one.

01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:58.360
Okay. Okay. So the procedure is same so you don't have to do

01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:01.480
much over here so I'll go to my project so this is my

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:05.360
project right and then here I can try to search for a seat

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:09.220
because the credential is going to be same right so just go

01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:12.980
to a seat and then click on enable it yeah click on this

01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:18.740
enable simple so it will be enabled and credential same same

01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:21.520
client ID and client secret we are supposed to use so we

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:24.580
don't have to use any other different thing okay so now even

01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:30.620
this one is enabled for. Okay now so once this part is done

01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:34.000
so once this like this entire part is been like a enabled

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.320
for me then what we can try to do so then we can try to

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:43.760
basically convert this as a MCP which is again a standard

01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:47.460
approach for example when we create a API right so it's a

01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:50.000
standard approach right just by following the standard

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.640
approach just by like you know doing a standard things we

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:56.320
try to convert anything into an API. So people have already

01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:59.460
defined that approach that there will be a function and then

01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:02.780
on top of that you have to decorate it with the particular

01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:06.620
path particular route right and technically when someone is

01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:10.200
going to call that route eventually that function will be

01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:12.680
executed inside that particular route that's the meaning of

01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:18.240
API right everyone yeah that's the meaning of API right and

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:23.020
yes so post get put delete update so basically those things

01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:24.780
are defined. Okay.

01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:33.180
So this is just a procedure right so post means I'll send a

01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:35.920
data into a body get means I can try to send the data into a

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:39.000
URLs or get a data into a URLs which will be exposed to the

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.300
outer world so these are just a method for doing a data

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:46.940
transfer via that URL or that particular route so ideally if

01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:50.240
you'll try to understand so this is this is like a how you

01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:53.340
can understand the API which we have like a built a lot

01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:57.680
right since the beginning itself. So we have a very good

01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:00.820
understanding or very strong understanding I would say in

01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:05.460
terms of creating the API is part now similarly so MCP I

01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:08.580
told you again and again since yesterday's class that it's

01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:11.680
just a set of rules it's a protocol which has been defined

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:15.940
for a LLMs so if I have to give access of these tools which

01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:18.380
I have created or these functions which I have created as of

01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:21.320
now it's a function it will become tool right it's also

01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:25.220
called as tool calling right. So don't get confused. Right.

01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:27.900
You don't have to like you know coin a term called as tool

01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:30.560
calling tool calling nothing but function access giving to a

01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:36.200
LLMs that's called as tool calling right. So here basically

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:40.280
like a pretty much standard approach by which you will be

01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:43.260
able to do the tool calling. So here what we are doing so we

01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:47.740
are trying to you know call MCP servers right and MCP type

01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:50.440
tool and text context. So these are two things which we are

01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:54.200
calling and then we are calling our seat Gmail and a

01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:56.240
calendar. So we are calling from source dot Google seat

01:19:56.240 --> 01:20:00.660
source dot like Gmail source dot calendar means these files

01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:05.120
SRC folder SRC folder dot this one and we are trying to just

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:09.340
call seed Gmail and a calendar as simple as like this is

01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:12.480
just alias right so that all of these functions inside this

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:14.720
one this one and this one will be available which is which

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:18.520
we have discussed just now. Okay so this is done right and

01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:20.680
this is going to help me out and this is going to help me

01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:24.400
out in terms of now converting this as a MCP. Right

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:28.600
converting now as a MCP. So here we will just try to like a

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:32.820
load a configuration configuration means config dot JSON

01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:35.860
file. So configuration that we have set for our Gmail seat

01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:42.060
and calendar and Mongo DB and a SQL system neon DB neon DB

01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:45.160
inside that we have a post grace. So this is just going to

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:48.500
load a configuration file and return JSON dot load. So

01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:51.280
whatever we have inside this config it is going to return it

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:56.520
to me right all of this configuration. Now once this will be

01:20:56.520 --> 01:21:01.560
done right. So here we are doing a tool calling or you can

01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:05.380
say we are trying to convert our you know all of these

01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:11.180
functions to a MCP compatible things and again someone has

01:21:11.180 --> 01:21:14.120
already defined it. I just have to follow that way as simple

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:17.020
as that. Right. So someone has already defined that that

01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:20.800
this is how you can convert any kind of a function as a

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:25.960
tool. Okay. And expose it to the MCP server just like a API.

01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:29.440
So it's a standard procedure. It's a protocol right protocol

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:31.800
means just a rule set of rules. Someone has already defined

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:34.800
it and then I just have to follow that part. I do. I can't

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:37.980
do much over here. Right. So we are just following that

01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:40.600
particular part. So here we are trying to create our

01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:44.660
synchronous function. So list tool function this list tool

01:21:44.660 --> 01:21:48.780
and then we are trying to like create an object of servers.

01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:52.180
Observer is what? It's again coming from the MCP part.

01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:54.900
Right. Yeah. So server is coming from the MCP part. So we

01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:58.560
are trying to create a server means a back end you can say

01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:02.020
right back end instances or back end object and then we are

01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:05.500
trying to decorate our function with this server so that you

01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:10.320
know it will be exposed to as a back end to any other MCP

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:13.420
client basically. So my client is what my client is clouded.

01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:16.740
My server is what my server is going to be this Python code.

01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:19.720
Right. So my server will be up and running and my client

01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:22.680
will be able to talk to it. Once I'm going to attach my

01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:25.160
client and server we can say front end and back end. Right.

01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:27.840
So this is technically a back end that we are trying to talk

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:30.900
about and we are trying to build now our sync dev list tool.

01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:34.900
So here it is going to return. So return what. So again this

01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:38.540
is a tool inbuilt function we are trying to use this one.

01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:42.480
Right. Which we have done as an import over here. So tool

01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:45.680
and name is a read seat description. We are trying to give

01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:48.740
that read data from the Google seat input schema. So type

01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:52.640
object properties. So a spreadsheet ID and then range and

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:56.900
then required ID all of these input schema means this is

01:22:56.900 --> 01:23:00.720
something which whenever I'm going to like you know query my

01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:04.320
spreadsheet. So this is something that I have to give as a

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:08.120
input over here. So required a spreadsheet ID and a range

01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:11.600
value. Now from where these things will come. So if you will

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:17.140
go back once again just one step back. Right. So here. Here.

01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:21.180
So here you will be able to see that read seat data. What is

01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:24.580
required a spreadsheet ID and a range name. So these two

01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:27.840
things are required to call this particular function because

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:29.940
technically this is just a normal Pythonic function. Right.

01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:33.320
And if it is having some parameter you have to pass that

01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:36.080
parameter without that parameter we all know that that

01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:39.720
Pythonic function is not going to work. So in general we

01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:44.940
used to pass it in case of MCPs my LLM will call it and my

01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:47.440
LLM will try to understand. And it is going to pass a

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:52.060
spreadsheet ID and a range name on behalf of me. I am not

01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:55.380
doing it right. I will just go and chat. Right. I'll just go

01:23:55.380 --> 01:23:59.300
and chat with the LLMs. So LLMs will try to do those kind of

01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:04.140
things for me on my behalf. Right. So here if you will come.

01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:08.160
So this in required things are coming from your function

01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:11.880
itself. Right. That OK. This is something which is a bare

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:16.800
minimum one which is required. And. And here. So input

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:20.180
schema wise. So we are trying to like make it a schema

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:22.920
driven because this is what MCP requires. So here you have

01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:25.020
to define OK fine. So this is the input. This is the output.

01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:28.340
So a spreadsheet ID type is going to be string means

01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:31.200
whatever the spreadsheet ID you are going to pass type is

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:34.320
going to be string and description the ID of this. So just

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:38.320
for the LLM awareness I'm giving this description over here.

01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:41.580
Now whenever you are trying to put a range so range type is

01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:45.000
going to be a string once again. Yeah. So I'm just trying to

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.820
define that. OK. So whenever you are going to pass an input

01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:51.460
inside the function that you have defined you have to pass

01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:56.000
these two things and this should be that type. So again this

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:59.420
is something that you have to define so that whenever your

01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:03.040
LLM is trying to call it it will always otherwise how LLM

01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:05.760
will understand right how my LLM will understand that what

01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:09.520
type of the data I have to pass. So particularly we are

01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:13.740
trying to define all of these things beforehand. Is it

01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:18.040
making sense guys how LLM will be able to understand like

01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:22.080
what I have to pass and then descriptions we have given over

01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:25.580
here and this is something which has been set for you.

01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:29.180
Right. You can't do much. So see this is coming from what

01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:31.640
your function itself. You have written a spreadsheet

01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:34.040
function. Right. So maybe if you are going to write some

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:36.520
other function so obviously this required is going to change

01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:39.300
accordingly. Then inside this required we have two fields.

01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:42.080
Now what will be the property of those two fields. Because

01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:45.740
LLM would like to understand right as a human you are going

01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:49.240
to take a decision. But when you are trying to just chat so

01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:52.420
on behalf of you LLM is trying to pass that information.

01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:57.460
Right. So now to make my LLM understand that OK I consume or

01:25:57.460 --> 01:26:01.360
I take this kind of input specifically you have to define

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:04.500
it. Right. That's a definition we are trying to give. If I

01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:07.520
would have written integer over here and if it is taking a

01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:10.680
string it is not going to work for me. Right. It is like my

01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:13.300
LLM will not be able to because my LLM will try to pass

01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:16.020
integer and then there it is expecting something different

01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:22.020
and then it is going to crash. Right. So here so this is

01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:25.260
like for one of my tool read a spreadsheet. Right. Read a

01:26:25.260 --> 01:26:28.540
spreadsheet. Now write a spreadsheet. Now if you will go and

01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:32.200
check my spreadsheet function over here so read is one.

01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:35.340
Right. Right. What it is taking. It is taking three

01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:38.060
arguments. Spreadsheet ID, range name and a value. Three

01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:41.500
things it is trying to take. My right spreadsheet. Now if I

01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:45.420
am if I have to expose that as a tool. Right. So just try to

01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:48.020
check over here. Three things is required. Spreadsheet ID,

01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:52.380
range and values. Right. And now I am trying to define that

01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:55.500
OK. Spreadsheet ID wise what is the type. Range wise what is

01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:58.700
the type. Value wise what kind of a values I will be able to

01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:04.420
pass. Simple. So same as previous one. So whatever input of

01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:07.540
your tool that you are trying to pass you have to define.

01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:11.340
Right. You have to define inside the input schema. I think

01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:13.900
this is where the pidentic things comes into picture.

01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:16.720
Pidentic meaning is same. Right. In case of pidentic and

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:19.760
nowadays like whatever new things you are able to see inside

01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:22.360
a python. So everyone is trying to make it pidentic

01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:26.120
compatible. So that it will be able to do a schema check or

01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:29.000
data type check beforehand. So similarly we are trying to

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.180
like a see even this one that tool always says that whenever

01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:36.640
you are trying to expose something as a tool all that is

01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:39.540
completely fine. But you have to give this bare minimum

01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:43.160
requirement to me. Right. And this is not something which I

01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:46.000
have defined. No. If you will go inside this tool library

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.080
MCP official library you will be able to find out this

01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:52.740
nomenclature. You just have to follow it. That's it. As per

01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:56.880
your function. So here I am trying to just follow it up as

01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:59.860
per my function. That's it. Nothing different I am trying to

01:27:59.860 --> 01:28:02.480
do. Then there is something called as append sheet. Right.

01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:05.980
Now just go here. Google sheet and then look into your

01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:08.060
append sheet function. What is taking? Three things.

01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:10.820
Spreadsheet ID, range name and values. Right. These three

01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:14.320
things append sheet is trying to take. Okay. That's cool. So

01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:17.100
what I can do I can try to again define these three things

01:28:17.100 --> 01:28:20.320
it is trying to take and what is a type of those three

01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:24.820
things. So like a spreadsheet ID, range and values. So this

01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:29.140
will be for a append sheet. Okay. Fine. Now get sheet info.

01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:32.760
So again I will go and check. So what kind of a function I

01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:35.260
have defined. So get sheet info. It is taking just a

01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:37.300
spreadsheet ID. Just a spreadsheet ID. Spreadsheet ID is

01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:40.320
required for this particular function. Now to expose that as

01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:44.300
a tool. Right. So I have to give only a spreadsheet ID and

01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:46.240
what should be the type of a spreadsheet ID. I am just

01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:50.700
trying to define it. Yeah. Simple. Now similarly it goes for

01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:54.260
a mail basically. Right. So we have a list mail function. So

01:28:54.260 --> 01:28:58.680
if you will go into your like a Google email dot pi file. So

01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:03.680
here you have list email. You have written. Right. It is

01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:06.140
taking two things. Maximum number of queries and queries

01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:08.100
basically inside your Gmail.

01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:15.960
Inside this Gmail you will be having. So same you are going

01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:18.420
to define over here if you are going to expose that as a

01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:22.520
tool. So list email. Fine. And then it is going to take like

01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:26.080
a property wise it is going to take maximum result and then

01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:28.660
query. So this is something that it is going to do it.

01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:33.660
Required. I think I have missed or maybe. Yeah. I think. I

01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:35.600
think I have missed for that. So maybe I will have to

01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:40.860
rectify that part. Now same thing. Right. List email. Get

01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:48.020
email detail. Default. Yeah. So basically I could have like

01:29:48.020 --> 01:29:50.720
a pass that one. That is completely fine. We have a default

01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:54.180
argument over there. So maximum result by default is going

01:29:54.180 --> 01:29:57.100
to take 10. But let us suppose I would like to like get 50.

01:29:57.320 --> 01:30:00.700
Right. Or maybe a 60. So from the same function. So in that

01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:03.300
case I will not be able to run it. So by default we are

01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:05.900
trying to pass these two. But it is better to parameterize

01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:09.740
it. I think I forgot to do that. Maybe I will do it. Yeah.

01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:13.820
So as a parameter by default it is taking like these

01:30:13.820 --> 01:30:17.300
parameter as we can see over here. So default is 10 and

01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:19.980
default is equal to blank string in this particular place

01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:24.840
for a query and a maximum result. Now get email detail. So

01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:29.340
now here again so get email detail this function. So it is

01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:32.080
taking just a message ID. So same thing I am trying to

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:35.440
follow inside MCP server. So message ID we are trying to

01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:39.080
pass and then we are able to get the tool basically. So

01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:42.620
similarly right. So you will be able to see that everywhere

01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:48.140
I am following same thing. So are we doing different guys.

01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:51.540
Can I say that after looking into these many tool calling or

01:30:51.540 --> 01:30:56.920
tool like a listing. So can I say that now I can convert or

01:30:56.920 --> 01:31:00.100
I can write a tool for any functions. I do not have to write

01:31:00.100 --> 01:31:02.880
technically like I can just like you know copy my function

01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:06.480
and then copy one of the tool sample and give as a prompt.

01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:09.840
It will be able to you know create this structure for me.

01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:14.120
Create this tool structure for me. Yes it can create this

01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:18.500
tool structure for this particular thing. So these are the

01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:22.620
tool listing we have done. So all of these tool listing has

01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:27.860
been done. Now here it is going to do a main thing. This is

01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:30.600
just a tool listing. That okay fine. So this is the input

01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:33.680
schema. This is the description. This is the name. So this

01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:36.960
is just a list of the tool I have created list of the tool

01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:39.660
as I have created. As you can see I am using a decorator

01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:43.620
list tool with a server. So now server will know right. My

01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:46.180
server my backend will know that okay these are the list of

01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:50.380
the tool I have already created and for these tools this is

01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:53.680
the input that it is going to take and this is the meaning

01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:57.780
of this like a particular tool. Okay now tool calling wise

01:31:57.780 --> 01:32:01.640
right. So again we have a synchronous function for a tool

01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:06.960
calling. Now here you are going to define right here you are

01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:10.960
going to define that for which tool right for which tool

01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:14.660
which function will be actually called means here you are

01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:18.280
doing a binding basically binding between what binding

01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:21.260
between the function that you have. So let's suppose inside

01:32:21.260 --> 01:32:24.220
this we have so many functions inside this we have so many

01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:26.920
functions inside this we have so many functions. Okay. So in

01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:30.340
case of tool listing so we just while looking into those

01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:32.980
functions I have defined the properties that okay this is

01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:36.100
the input this means kind of a skeleton we have already

01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:40.440
created. Now calling wise here we are doing the actual job

01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:44.860
so where it is going to bind my list of the tool which my

01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:48.380
server understands versus the function which is available to

01:32:48.380 --> 01:32:52.840
me. So here one by one I am trying to call this is my tool

01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:56.700
name. This is my tool name. So this is a read sheet. And if

01:32:56.700 --> 01:33:00.840
you will go and check over here so this is my own name that

01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:03.660
I have provided. You can try to give whatever name that you

01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:07.020
want my name your name doesn't matter at all right. So read

01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:10.140
sheet I have provided but how read sheet will try to

01:33:10.140 --> 01:33:12.380
understand how read sheet will be able to understand that

01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:14.540
which function I am supposed to call. So this is where we

01:33:14.540 --> 01:33:17.860
are trying to do a binding. So if name is equal to read

01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:22.200
sheet right. So in that case do what. So in that case try to

01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:25.240
call from this sheet try to call this function. Now this

01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:26.920
function is available where. This function is available

01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:30.240
inside my python file right. Google sheet python file

01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:33.500
basically it's available and it is taking what argument to

01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:36.560
argument spreadsheet ID and the range. So these are the two

01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:39.820
things which it is trying to take by the way. So spreadsheet

01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:42.660
ID we are trying to you know fetch and then we are trying to

01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:46.540
provide a range of it as an argument. So this is where the

01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:51.840
actual call is going to happen. But just understand right.

01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:54.740
Just try to understand MCP means what. My LLM is calling

01:33:54.740 --> 01:33:59.360
right. So first of all LLM will. So whenever you are going

01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:03.040
to write some English like you know sentence LLM will try to

01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:08.800
check that which tool is basically fit for this job yeah. So

01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:12.400
just by looking into these things it will be able to

01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:15.400
understand that okay which tool I am supposed to call. So I

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:19.400
am giving like a 10 20 tool access just in this sheet itself

01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:22.840
right. I think it's a 13 right. So 13 tool access I am

01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:25.360
trying to give. So just by looking into a large number of

01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:29.600
tools. LLM will now decide based on your query LM will

01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:33.120
decide that okay this tool I am supposed to call now when it

01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:36.380
will be able to decide that okay I have to call this tool

01:34:36.380 --> 01:34:40.140
then I have to call tool means what actual function right

01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:43.100
actual function I have to execute. Then it is going to

01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:47.320
execute this actual function from here. So it goes always to

01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:50.780
a tool list. It will check that okay this tool this time

01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:53.700
this tool this time this tool this time and once it will be

01:34:53.700 --> 01:34:57.020
able to take a decision. Okay. then it comes here then it

01:34:57.020 --> 01:35:01.160
comes to the calling part is it making sense how llm is

01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:03.500
going to work internally how llm is going to behave

01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:05.220
internally yes

01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:09.430
everyone yeah

01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:15.920
so how internally it is trying to like a do so first llm

01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:18.440
will try to understand my language and then it will try to

01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:20.800
you know check what and all tools are available as per my

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:25.080
query and or maybe not available right and once it will be

01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:27.520
able to make a decision then only it will come to the

01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:29.620
calling part otherwise it will never come to the calling

01:35:29.620 --> 01:35:32.480
part and when it will come to a calling part it simply means

01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:36.700
that executing the actual function right so if i have to

01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:40.020
send a gmail if i have to check some data inside my seat or

01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:42.700
maybe fetch some data inside my seat calendar event so

01:35:42.700 --> 01:35:45.500
basically this can be done by the actual function which i

01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:48.580
have written right so actual function execution need to be

01:35:48.580 --> 01:35:52.320
called so this is where called as tool calling right tool

01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:54.860
calling so as you can see now it is calling the actual

01:35:54.860 --> 01:35:57.360
function and this is how we are like binding it right that

01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:01.300
okay fine so if my llm has decided that we have to call this

01:36:01.300 --> 01:36:04.660
tool then eventually it should execute this function a read

01:36:04.660 --> 01:36:07.240
seat data function if it has decided that i have to write

01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:11.020
something into the seat then i have to call this particular

01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:14.140
function right this particular function eventually and llm

01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:18.280
is going to create all of those argument and parameter as

01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:22.480
per my input and then it is going to basically call it right

01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:28.640
it is going to basically call it as simple as that. Now so

01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:32.620
again for this tool this tool this tool so one by one one by

01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:36.500
one one by one so it is going to like you know based on the

01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:41.040
llm it is going to just fire that function means generally

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:43.860
we try to call as a human being so we try to call a function

01:36:43.860 --> 01:36:46.980
now my llm will try to execute that function on their own

01:36:46.980 --> 01:36:48.860
that is something called as tool calling so if someone is

01:36:48.860 --> 01:36:51.640
going to ask you a question generally like people ask you a

01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:53.820
question like what is the mean what do you understand by

01:36:53.820 --> 01:36:57.980
tool calling you can explain in that way right so all of

01:36:57.980 --> 01:37:01.860
this tool calling is been done over here right all of this

01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:05.740
tool calling is been done over here now once that is like a

01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:10.980
done right once that tool calling is done so now i have to

01:37:10.980 --> 01:37:15.780
up my server right i have to execute my server so that you

01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:22.940
know i will be able to or my client will be able to list all

01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:25.600
the tools which is available to me and they will be able to

01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:28.060
eventually call. the function and they will be able to do

01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:30.520
some sort of a job so this is what we are trying to do over

01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:34.180
here now so there is something called as ssc and there is

01:37:34.180 --> 01:37:37.260
something called as studio studio means standard input and

01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:39.920
output so let us suppose if i am trying to do a like some

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:44.180
testing in a local system or maybe if i am trying to use a

01:37:44.180 --> 01:37:48.040
mcp inspector in my local if i am trying to fire so in that

01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:51.860
case i can try to use a studio right studio server studio

01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:56.000
means basically standard input output. and over in that

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.820
situation basically i have to configure in this way let us

01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:03.320
suppose if i have deployed my service on some cloud platform

01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:08.800
right so in that way i will have to call ssc right ssc and i

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:11.640
have to just do a little bit of modification in terms of

01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:16.000
converting my mcp servers into a ssc and i can just deploy

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:20.120
it somewhere and i will be able to get ssc urls and with the

01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:23.980
help of ssc i will be able to call it. in a platform. in a

01:38:23.980 --> 01:38:29.160
platform in a place which supports ssc ssc mcp right so

01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:31.880
testing wise i can even do a testing in postman that

01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:35.720
supports ssc kind of a testing but yeah so calling wise i

01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:39.380
will be able to call it if some framework supports that kind

01:38:39.380 --> 01:38:43.540
of a ssc so people are exposing it almost every llm provider

01:38:43.540 --> 01:38:46.020
is now trying to work on that and they are trying to you

01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:50.380
know give you a tool calling or they are giving you to like

01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:53.860
you know attach your own connector or mcp servers. most

01:38:53.860 --> 01:38:57.420
everyone is working on that fine

01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:04.820
so here in a studio manner i have to call standard input

01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:07.480
output manner i have to call so that is the reason i am just

01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:10.180
trying to call a studio server and we are saying that that

01:39:10.180 --> 01:39:14.180
with the studio server as a read stream and write stream so

01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:17.500
just try to run the server read stream write stream and

01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:21.420
initialize option and then here so run run what so run this

01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:24.860
main function so in this way my server will be up and

01:39:24.860 --> 01:39:27.760
running. running. Now once my server will be up and running

01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:32.900
I can attach this server to my MCP client. So now to attach

01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:36.120
my server to my MCP client so for example I am using Cloud A

01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:39.700
as a MCP client. So Cloud A has already defined that right

01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:42.200
so Cloud A has already defined that that whenever you have

01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:46.560
to attach something in me so in that situation right so you

01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:50.060
can go to a developer this is a tab then there is something

01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:53.000
called as edit configuration right then there is something

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.220
called as edit configuration inside that Cloud A desktop

01:39:56.220 --> 01:39:59.520
configuration right which is which is a file which is

01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:02.140
already available and by default this file is going to be

01:40:02.140 --> 01:40:05.180
blank that there won't be anything inside this particular

01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:10.320
file except one small JSON. So you can try to like open up

01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:16.740
this file and then you can try to write your own JSON over

01:40:16.740 --> 01:40:21.100
here so that my client which is my Cloud A this is my client

01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:24.120
right this is my client so my client will be able to

01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:26.820
understand. That okay this is the MCP server that you are

01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:32.880
trying to attach. Now so run it and then what so simple here

01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:39.000
we have basically MCP server file so yeah we have basically

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:43.880
MCP server file and all the servers code all the back end

01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:46.340
code is available inside this particular file so when we are

01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:49.040
trying to create a configuration file so we are simply

01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:53.180
saying that that okay over here just try to execute this

01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:56.220
file it is all already just try to access this particular

01:40:56.220 --> 01:40:59.740
file which is like a running in a back end which is like a

01:40:59.740 --> 01:41:02.360
running in a back end or just try to execute or just try to

01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:05.320
access this particular file which is available in my back

01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:08.280
end and which is available at this particular place that so

01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:12.440
here we have like a command is equal to python so basically

01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:14.700
it is going to help me out in terms of executing this

01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:18.260
particular python file because I need python.exe to execute

01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:22.360
this particular file I need so again if I have multiple

01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:24.440
server files so I can just simply try to execute this

01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:26.220
particular file. So I can try to call those multiple files

01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:29.280
and then I can try to attach it so I can try to attach as

01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:35.080
many server as possible as simple as that and to my client

01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:38.140
and I just have to you know update this things I just have

01:41:38.140 --> 01:41:41.500
to keep on adding one more one more and one more JSON string

01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:45.820
over there nothing much is required yeah nothing much is

01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:48.660
required over here and system will be able to execute it

01:41:48.660 --> 01:41:52.160
automatically and system will be able to do the same means

01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:55.480
it is executing this file on the go. Right it is trying to

01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:57.780
like a search for this file and then it is trying to execute

01:41:57.780 --> 01:42:02.560
this particular file on the go for me. So this is how client

01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:05.100
attachment is going to happen so you have a client side and

01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:08.200
then you have a server side and all of these things are

01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:12.400
running in this particular manner. Now so this is one of the

01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:16.780
server that we have created similarly for a mongodb right so

01:42:16.780 --> 01:42:19.720
for a mongodb so we have created a couple of functions as

01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:24.200
you can see list collection or list databases, find a

01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:31.340
document, insert a document, insert many documents. So these

01:42:31.340 --> 01:42:33.800
are just a standard mongodb functions which we have created

01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:37.700
and then we are creating a mongodb mcp file over there we

01:42:37.700 --> 01:42:40.580
are doing nothing different so it is exact same thing that

01:42:40.580 --> 01:42:44.700
we are doing so first of all listing a tool right so listing

01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:48.420
all the tools defining all the input schema for like that

01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:52.760
particular function and then tool calling. So if you will

01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:55.620
come down you will be able to find out that we are doing a

01:42:55.620 --> 01:42:58.760
tool calling right so when system will be able to decide

01:42:58.760 --> 01:43:01.860
that which one to choose then it will start doing a tool

01:43:01.860 --> 01:43:05.980
calling for me and then eventually it will like you know try

01:43:05.980 --> 01:43:08.660
to call that particular tool so list database, list

01:43:08.660 --> 01:43:13.020
connection, find document like insert document all of these

01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:15.600
tool automatically system will be able to call so

01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:17.820
technically it will be able to execute a particular function

01:43:17.820 --> 01:43:22.540
this is what I mean to say. And then finally same thing

01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:27.060
right run the server so this is not at all like a different

01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:31.140
in a studio mode basically same thing we are trying to do it

01:43:31.140 --> 01:43:34.180
with the post grace so we are trying to define like all the

01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:38.220
standard function that I want right execute query or like

01:43:38.220 --> 01:43:41.620
you know execute write all of these things we are trying to

01:43:41.620 --> 01:43:47.870
define and then we are trying to basically do a tool listing

01:43:47.870 --> 01:43:50.630
first of all right so we are trying to define all the

01:43:50.630 --> 01:43:51.410
parameters right. So we are trying to define the required

01:43:51.410 --> 01:43:55.930
query exact same manner nothing different and then

01:43:55.930 --> 01:43:59.550
eventually we are trying to do a tool calling so once my LLM

01:43:59.550 --> 01:44:01.610
will be able to decide so it will be able to call the

01:44:01.610 --> 01:44:08.670
respective tool over here. So code looks like a repetitive

01:44:08.670 --> 01:44:13.270
after like writing one or two tool calling and listing of

01:44:13.270 --> 01:44:16.330
tool so you will be able to find out that it is kind of a

01:44:16.330 --> 01:44:19.230
you know repetitive things repetitive task that we are

01:44:19.230 --> 01:44:22.110
doing. And anyone and everyone who. Who are going to like

01:44:22.110 --> 01:44:25.370
you know ask me to perform anything I can do it right this

01:44:25.370 --> 01:44:28.130
is the kind of a feeling that you will be able to get. So in

01:44:28.130 --> 01:44:31.470
total three server file we have right and all of these three

01:44:31.470 --> 01:44:35.050
server file I have to update inside my cloud if I wanted to

01:44:35.050 --> 01:44:38.690
give three all of these three access so which eventually we

01:44:38.690 --> 01:44:43.510
have done yeah which eventually we have done. Now once I am

01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:47.370
able to attach this file so simple I will go to a cloud and

01:44:47.370 --> 01:44:52.890
again so to do this. You don't have to you know basically

01:44:52.890 --> 01:44:55.330
need

01:44:57.540 --> 01:45:00.220
a paid version of a cloud so with the free version you will

01:45:00.220 --> 01:45:02.860
be able to do each and everything. So now here I can see

01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:07.300
that that Google service MongoDB PostgreSQL all of these

01:45:07.300 --> 01:45:11.180
tools are available to me they have also given you if I talk

01:45:11.180 --> 01:45:15.060
about cloud even if I talk about chat GPT so they have also

01:45:15.060 --> 01:45:18.200
given you basically connectors now these connectors are

01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:21.460
nothing but same. Yeah. These connectors are nothing but

01:45:21.460 --> 01:45:24.240
same so for example if I am going to click on like a Gmail

01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:28.940
search right click on continue now it is like going to ask

01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:32.220
me for the authorization now see this is the window which

01:45:32.220 --> 01:45:35.040
has popped up and then I can click on basically continue

01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:38.400
let's suppose if I am like trying to click on my Gmail and

01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:43.780
then continue right and then continue so I am just trying to

01:45:43.780 --> 01:45:48.540
like you know authorize my cloud a to access my Gmail right

01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:51.920
to access my Gmail. Now if I am going to enable it so

01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:55.160
basically it will be able to access my Gmail directly so I

01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:58.480
can just like a click connect and then I can even give an

01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:02.680
access to my Gmail I can switch it on switch it off as per

01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:05.580
my need I can do it so now these connectors are nothing but

01:46:05.580 --> 01:46:09.180
the same right so you are trying to create your own

01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:12.900
connector otherwise someone has already created a connector

01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:17.900
you are just trying to do a login and then done so you will

01:46:17.900 --> 01:46:21.940
start like you know using it. So nowadays everyone so this

01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:24.940
is where the standard MCP approach comes into picture and

01:46:24.940 --> 01:46:27.780
they have not done anything so whatever you are doing here

01:46:27.780 --> 01:46:31.740
they are doing the same thing so but what is the reason we

01:46:31.740 --> 01:46:35.640
are trying to like learn all of these things because let's

01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:39.460
suppose I have my own like a database I have my own system I

01:46:39.460 --> 01:46:42.360
have my own file system so obviously for that no one can

01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:45.400
create like a you know a generic connector so in that

01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:47.900
situation I can just follow the approach and then I will be

01:46:47.900 --> 01:46:50.260
able to create my own connector otherwise they have already

01:46:50.260 --> 01:46:52.580
given you a lot of like a connectors you can try to click on

01:46:52.580 --> 01:46:55.520
add connector so many connectors you will be able to find

01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:57.900
out yeah so many connectors you will be able to find out

01:46:57.900 --> 01:47:00.960
which they have given and soon you will be able to see that

01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:05.840
that you know they will be adding like a more and more over

01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:13.320
here yeah more and more so let me disable this Gmail yeah ok

01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:16.640
so the other connector which is available to me now I can

01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:20.800
just go over here. 1. i can start chatting with it that give

trying to technically do so yeah aws india auto charge 15k

01:47:51.540 --> 01:47:57.600
like from aws web services timing is this one so your aws

account has automatic payment enabled but invoice amount

01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:03.340

01:48:03.340 --> 01:48:05.320
another mail i have received this is another mail that i

01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:08.920

mails i have like or four one two three four right yeah 15k

01:48:13.100 --> 01:48:15.700
it is able to fetch this one it is able to fetch this one it

01:48:15.700 --> 01:48:16.140
is able to fetch this one it is able to fetch this one it is

01:48:16.140 --> 01:48:17.760
able to fetch this one it is able to fetch so it is able to

01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:22.160
successfully fetch my email id or it is able to fetch my

01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:26.880
email information very very simple right uh okay so tell me

01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:31.820
tell me my calendar schedule

01:48:35.020 --> 01:48:39.680
for tomorrow yeah so maybe it will go it will try to check

01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:43.220
my calendar if so tomorrow it is automatically able to

01:48:43.220 --> 01:48:46.720
understand because llm right that's the beauty of llm and it

01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:49.280
is trying to call list calendar event so first it is trying

01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:49.320
to call list calendar event and you can see that after this

01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:50.960
it will automatically to check that whether there is some

01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:55.380
like a calendar events are available or not and step by step

01:48:55.380 --> 01:48:58.400
right so it is trying to like a call calendar id is primary

01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:01.500
time maximum result is equal to 50 so these are the

01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:05.240
parameter it is trying to send right because these are the

01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:07.840
parameter which is required to execute my function and then

01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:11.920
this is the response which i will be able to get so based on

01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:14.400
the calendar check you don't have any event schedule for

01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:17.080
tomorrow november 3 your calendar appears to be clear for

01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:21.280
the day now yes if i'll go and if i'll try to check this

01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:25.160
email id and if i'll check this calendar so there is nothing

01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:28.320
over here right there is nothing over here for like a third

01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:31.740
of number for attached with respect to this particular email

01:49:31.740 --> 01:49:35.360

imagine so this my our life is literally very very easy if

01:51:10.970 --> 01:51:15.110
we are using such kind of a system uh means i'm able to talk

01:51:15.110 --> 01:51:17.930
to my gmail i'm able to talk to my calendar i'm able to talk

01:51:17.930 --> 01:51:19.970

01:51:19.970 --> 01:51:21.010
to my gmail i'm able to talk to my spreadsheet i'm able to

01:51:21.010 --> 01:51:21.530
talk to my calendar i'm able to talk to the entire digital

01:51:21.530 --> 01:51:25.950
world that's that's a beauty that we are talking about over

01:51:25.950 --> 01:51:29.050
here right so technically we are able to talk to the entire

01:51:29.050 --> 01:51:32.190
world so whatever system solution which i am using from

01:51:32.190 --> 01:51:37.510
morning till evening i can just access it on a chat yes

01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:44.720
yeah so

01:51:47.090 --> 01:51:51.670
that's a beauty of mcp that's a real power of mcp that you

01:51:51.670 --> 01:51:56.170
all will be able to find out so see uh pretty much amazing

01:51:56.170 --> 01:51:59.630
right we we had a never imagined like a couple of years back

01:51:59.630 --> 01:52:03.030
that we will just chat we'll just talk and maybe i can

01:52:03.030 --> 01:52:06.530
enable it by the speech because uh cloud day gives you that

01:52:06.530 --> 01:52:09.210
option right i can try to give an input as a speech in my

01:52:09.210 --> 01:52:12.410
own language maybe hindi english or something right and then

01:52:12.410 --> 01:52:14.870
i will be able to you know communicate directly and it will

01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:18.950
be able to do it for me so that is the power of this uh new

01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:22.730
technology or new protocol you can say mcp by which i'm just

01:52:22.730 --> 01:52:27.330
like a chatting to my lms and then my work is going on right

01:52:27.350 --> 01:52:31.990
my work is like a going on uh if i have to generate some

01:52:31.990 --> 01:52:36.170
sort of a reports right uh maybe i'll just say that that uh

01:52:36.170 --> 01:52:39.570
like you know data

01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:49.750
for me okay so i'll just try to add couple of data inside my

01:52:49.750 --> 01:52:52.670
seat and then i'll say that that try to generate or maybe i

01:52:52.670 --> 01:52:59.790
can uh just say that that uh try to look into my uh database

01:52:59.790 --> 01:53:03.870
or i can say my sql database because i have already given a

01:53:04.170 --> 01:53:10.730
like access to it database and give me give me all the

01:53:10.730 --> 01:53:17.010
tables details yeah so give me all the tables details so

01:53:17.010 --> 01:53:24.290
let's see it is like a going to hit my table so five table i

01:53:24.290 --> 01:53:30.930
have so i have basically uh allow ones okay so list table so

01:53:34.030 --> 01:53:37.250
order table table name and like uh order table order name

01:53:37.250 --> 01:53:37.250
mess with place last does this mean easy well i don't think

01:53:37.250 --> 01:53:38.590
we have enough API menu for this one item table i can see

01:53:38.590 --> 01:53:39.270
here so

01:53:45.930 --> 01:53:49.950
i'm able to talk to my like any system simple five system i

01:53:49.950 --> 01:53:52.250
have already shown i'm already showing you right if i can

01:53:52.250 --> 01:53:55.090
talk to my five and that is my personal system right all my

01:53:55.090 --> 01:53:58.110
sql mongo and all those like a gmail and everything i can

01:53:58.110 --> 01:54:01.490
talk to entire world i can talk to 5000 system as well in a

01:54:01.490 --> 01:54:06.150
similar manner yeah so let's suppose uh like i'm a manager

01:54:06.150 --> 01:54:09.550
i'm like uh going to wake up to uh every morning and then

01:54:09.550 --> 01:54:12.130
i'm looking for a report right so obviously my data will be

01:54:12.130 --> 01:54:15.410
available somewhere maybe into a seat maybe into a gmail i

01:54:15.410 --> 01:54:20.010
can just chat so in a morning sitting in a bathroom and then

01:54:20.010 --> 01:54:22.290
instead of checking my reel what i can do i can just chat to

01:54:22.290 --> 01:54:26.490
my you know my lms and i will be able to get update of my

01:54:26.490 --> 01:54:28.950
calendar i will be able to you know see all the reports

01:54:28.950 --> 01:54:32.630
whatever i want i can i can see it simple so these are the

01:54:32.630 --> 01:54:35.590
table which i have so basically i have order table playing

01:54:35.590 --> 01:54:39.170
with the neon and then we have a product table right we have

01:54:39.170 --> 01:54:44.150
a customer table so uh i'll just say that look into look

01:54:44.150 --> 01:54:51.530
into my order table order table and prepare the full

01:54:51.530 --> 01:54:52.910
graphical

01:54:54.670 --> 01:55:03.830
based report for me and all the data analysis

01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:10.140
and summary okay so it is it is going to like show me the

01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:12.440
report or whatever i wanted to know like what was the

01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:15.540
revenue yesterday what was the sales yesterday What is the

01:55:15.540 --> 01:55:18.320
total number of customer which I have acquired, who has done

01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:21.320
what, who is the top customer. So as per my data, as per my

01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:25.900
business I will be able to search anything, I can talk to my

01:55:25.900 --> 01:55:30.200
database, I don't have to aware about a SQL query, I don't

01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:33.480
have to even go and ask my junior that prepare a report for

01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:37.380
me and I will be able to get all the insights and that too

01:55:37.380 --> 01:55:40.280
in a real time on the fly I will be able to get all the

01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:44.120
insights. So I don't need someone to create a report for me.

01:55:46.620 --> 01:55:51.280
So now I simply said that create a graphical thing, see it

01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:55.620
is writing a CSS, LLM is writing a CSS and I will be able to

01:55:55.620 --> 01:55:58.980
get everything in a beautiful graph format in next like a

01:55:58.980 --> 01:56:03.060
two minute itself. And if I am going to ask my junior to

01:56:03.060 --> 01:56:06.340
create a Power BI tableau report with this the kind of a

01:56:06.340 --> 01:56:08.840
beautiful report it is going to produce, they won't be able

01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:10.540
to do it, they will take time. I mean like they will be able

01:56:10.540 --> 01:56:13.480
to do it but eventually they will take time. Now here

01:56:13.480 --> 01:56:14.660
everything

01:56:16.650 --> 01:56:23.020
is under my control, I don't need anyone inside under me. So

01:56:23.020 --> 01:56:27.600
in this way if you can see the future that what AI is

01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:33.140
capable of like now just in three year itself and what AI

01:56:33.140 --> 01:56:39.580
will be capable in next decade. So see report highlights and

01:56:39.580 --> 01:56:45.880
yes this now if I am going to ask a data analyst to prepare

01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:48.780
this kind of a report, this kind of a beautiful UI based

01:56:48.780 --> 01:56:52.540
report, graph based report and that one on daily basis, it

01:56:52.540 --> 01:56:56.780
is a kind of a job for them right, it is like I have to pay

01:56:56.780 --> 01:57:01.320
them like a huge amount of salary to them, yes. Maybe I can

01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:03.880
just sedule the report and I don't have to even come and you

01:57:03.880 --> 01:57:06.780
know ask the same query again and again. It will be able to

01:57:06.780 --> 01:57:09.400
give me like a report and that too without any mistake

01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:13.000
right, just by looking into the data. So total order was

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.860
this much, total revenue was this much. Average order was

01:57:15.860 --> 01:57:19.200
this much. Highest order is this much right. Revenue by

01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:22.740
customer, so Alice John's he has because I have asked that

01:57:22.740 --> 01:57:26.520
in my question right. Revenue distribution by city, so New

01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:30.540
York is has done basically 54% of the revenue 1500 rupees

01:57:30.540 --> 01:57:34.160
and Chicago has done basically 450, I am just like my data

01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:37.520
is in rupees or maybe you can say just represent that in

01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:41.640
dollar, you will do it in dollar, 450, 16.4%, then this is

01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:46.260
29.1%, order timeline is this much right. Sales product by

01:57:46.260 --> 01:57:48.920
category, so I can try to observe. I have not even asked

01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:52.440
this one. I just asked like LLM that okay give me like

01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:56.960
everything like data analysis and summary. I have just like

01:57:56.960 --> 01:58:00.940
you know if you look into my language, it's a very vague

01:58:00.940 --> 01:58:02.960
language right. It's a very generic language which I have

01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:06.260
given but still I am getting so much right and if I am going

01:58:06.260 --> 01:58:08.520
to ask for the specific things, it will do it for sure

01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:11.200
right. So top selling product, I am able to get it. A

01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:14.160
detailed order information, I have to get it. So even if I

01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:17.580
have to do it. In my like a by writing a pandas, it will

01:58:17.580 --> 01:58:19.880
take some time for me right and it's kind of a redundant job

01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:22.700
for me. Every day I have to open up a laptop. Now I just

01:58:22.700 --> 01:58:26.560
have to open up my mobile and like bingo then I can do it.

01:58:26.700 --> 01:58:29.880
Key highlights okay. So before going into a meeting, so I

01:58:29.880 --> 01:58:34.140
will be able to get all the heads up over here and I can go

01:58:34.140 --> 01:58:37.380
to a meeting happily right. I will be having an edge.

01:58:44.620 --> 01:58:48.460
Yes that is up. So this is what I wanted to show you

01:58:48.460 --> 01:58:52.760
actually right. So. So like that what AI is like you know

01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:56.260
capable enough, what AI is able to do it. Hope all of you

01:58:56.260 --> 01:58:58.940
are able to get a good demo and all of you will be able to

01:58:58.940 --> 01:59:03.060
you know write like inside a resume that I have created 500

01:59:03.060 --> 01:59:05.920
MCPs. I have created MCPs for sales team, HR team, this

01:59:05.920 --> 01:59:08.840
team, that team, my manager, the managers of managers, their

01:59:08.840 --> 01:59:11.560
director, all those like a story build up. You will be able

01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:17.060
to do it now. Right. Yes. Guys, all of you will be able to

01:59:17.060 --> 01:59:20.360
build up a story. I believe now. Okay. Yes. That I have

01:59:20.360 --> 01:59:24.400
built 500 MCPs. Right. Just mentioned, just mentioned that I

01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:27.980
have built 177 MCPs. I mentioned that number into your

01:59:27.980 --> 01:59:32.000
resume. Then you will get a call when people will say, okay,

01:59:32.060 --> 01:59:35.800
wow, you have built 177. People will be amazed because see

01:59:35.800 --> 01:59:39.860
there is a AI right and AI is real. There are many like

01:59:39.860 --> 01:59:43.360
argument that you know AI will not do anything. It's just a

01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:47.040
hype. See there are two sides of it always right. When we

01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:50.720
are saying that AI is a hype. Again, it depends what kind of

01:59:50.720 --> 01:59:53.180
a comparison we are looking for. So are we doing comparison

01:59:53.180 --> 01:59:56.580
with the AGI? Then if you're doing it, it's the wrong

01:59:56.580 --> 01:59:59.480
comparison, right? Then you will say that, okay, fine, 95%

01:59:59.480 --> 02:00:02.760
of the AI product is going to fail, right? Then that

02:00:02.760 --> 02:00:05.040
argument will come into a picture. But we have seen that,

02:00:05.060 --> 02:00:07.640
that just a couple of days back, right? This week itself,

02:00:07.840 --> 02:00:12.300
Amazon has fired 30,000 people, 30,000 just imagine and

02:00:12.300 --> 02:00:14.860
people who joins Amazon, right? They are not like a, you

02:00:14.860 --> 02:00:19.720
know, a beginner. They all are pro. 30,000 pro engineer they

02:00:19.720 --> 02:00:23.600
have fired. Yeah. Everyone is having a dream to get into a

02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:25.940
fang kind of a company, right? Amazon is one of those

02:00:25.940 --> 02:00:30.360
companies and all 30,000 engineer, anyone in this world can

02:00:30.360 --> 02:00:34.020
blindly say that all of them was superior in their field,

02:00:34.120 --> 02:00:38.460
right? Still they got fired. And what is the reason AI. So

02:00:38.460 --> 02:00:42.820
it's not a hype by the way, right? It's actually not a hype.

02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:46.700
Things are happening. There are people. There are team.

02:00:47.060 --> 02:00:50.900
There are like a segment who is reliably trying to implement

02:00:50.900 --> 02:00:54.640
all of these things. They are automating things. And yeah,

02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:57.640
so these things are happening nowadays in a, in a very fast

02:00:57.640 --> 02:01:01.680
pace, right? And because, and there are some set of people,

02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:04.020
whether they are in Amazon or Google or anywhere, right?

02:01:04.180 --> 02:01:07.320
They're not able to align themselves with AI and they're

02:01:07.320 --> 02:01:11.900
getting fired as simple as that. So just try to align

02:01:11.900 --> 02:01:16.660
yourself with AI. Try to adopt AI as soon as possible. And

02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:20.580
this is what I'm trying to show you possibility wise, right?

02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:24.600
This is real, right? This is in front of you. So you can't

02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:27.760
say that AI is hype. You can't come and say that no, AI

02:01:27.760 --> 02:01:29.980
can't do anything, 95,000 product is going to fail. No,

02:01:30.120 --> 02:01:34.260
product never fails, right? It's a team. It's a person who

02:01:34.260 --> 02:01:37.320
fails. So if your implementation, if your analogy is

02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:39.680
incorrect, obviously product is going to fail. Product is

02:01:39.680 --> 02:01:42.960
what? Something which you have created, right? So if you

02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:45.540
have created or with the wrong assumptions. If you have

02:01:45.540 --> 02:01:47.700
created with the wrong speculation, obviously it is going to

02:01:47.700 --> 02:01:50.260
fail, right? It was meant to fail always since the beginning

02:01:50.260 --> 02:01:53.240
itself, since the inception itself. Otherwise product never

02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:59.360
fails. So that's my analogy and AI is real, visible in front

02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:02.680
of all of us, right? And many people who try to give this

02:02:02.680 --> 02:02:04.940
argument, so they have not written a single line of a code

02:02:04.940 --> 02:02:07.220
in their entire life. They have never used it. They have

02:02:07.220 --> 02:02:10.940
used just a chat GPT and they think that chat GPT is the

02:02:10.940 --> 02:02:17.290
only part of the AI. Polymath here is coming. Generally

02:02:17.290 --> 02:02:22.330
people think that the meaning of AI is like a chat bot,

02:02:22.570 --> 02:02:28.010
which is not true. But yeah, it will take some time to maybe

02:02:28.010 --> 02:02:33.530
change the general perception. Can we suggest for the

02:02:33.530 --> 02:02:35.710
accuracy? Can we take an enterprise level decision based on

02:02:35.710 --> 02:02:38.790
these reports? Your opinion please. Yeah. So maybe one year

02:02:38.790 --> 02:02:42.350
back I would not have suggested you that it will give you a

02:02:42.350 --> 02:02:45.770
hundred percent accuracy or maybe even a 90%. But now I can

02:02:45.770 --> 02:02:49.350
bet you that. Yeah. So this kind of a task accuracy is a

02:02:49.350 --> 02:02:51.450
hundred percent, almost close to a hundred percent, right?

02:02:51.490 --> 02:02:54.490
Especially this kind of a task where your data is already

02:02:54.490 --> 02:02:56.570
available. You are just rendering report, you are kind of

02:02:56.570 --> 02:02:59.790
doing, you know, analysis. In that case, this never fails.

02:02:59.970 --> 02:03:02.910
At least now the kind of a system or the kind of LLMs that

02:03:02.910 --> 02:03:06.430
we have, right? And again, so there is always a possibility

02:03:06.430 --> 02:03:08.670
and whenever we are going to deploy into a production we

02:03:08.670 --> 02:03:10.970
will test it, right? So especially for this kind of a task,

02:03:11.090 --> 02:03:14.210
accuracy is going to be a hundred percent, unless and until

02:03:14.210 --> 02:03:17.530
you have a problem into a data. If you have a problem into a

02:03:17.530 --> 02:03:20.950
data. Then obviously accuracy will fluctuate, otherwise it's

02:03:20.950 --> 02:03:22.570
a hundred percent or

02:03:25.990 --> 02:03:29.050
we see it's already better than human. Yeah. It's not

02:03:29.050 --> 02:03:31.690
better. I would say, but yeah, faster than human in terms of

02:03:31.690 --> 02:03:34.510
doing a, you know, repetitive job because unless those does

02:03:34.510 --> 02:03:37.010
what they just do a repetitive job, right? Every day

02:03:37.010 --> 02:03:40.970
generating the same reports. I mean like what kind of a

02:03:40.970 --> 02:03:43.170
brain they're applying on a daily basis. Someone has like

02:03:43.170 --> 02:03:45.570
created a report once and then they're using it for a month

02:03:45.570 --> 02:03:47.590
or months, right?

02:03:51.420 --> 02:03:53.800
It will be efficient for 10 million recorded data. So let me

02:03:53.800 --> 02:03:56.800
go back to the data basis. That's see, I have already shown

02:03:56.800 --> 02:03:59.220
you this part, right? You should not ask this question, but

02:03:59.220 --> 02:04:02.920
as you have asked, let me give you the answer. Technically

02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:06.740
what it is doing, it is trying to call a function, right?

02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:09.620
Now that function will be executed where inside your

02:04:09.620 --> 02:04:12.980
database. So that depends upon the latency of the databases,

02:04:13.100 --> 02:04:15.720
whether you are fetching one record or maybe a 1 million

02:04:15.720 --> 02:04:20.300
record, your query is same, right? So my responsibility of

02:04:20.300 --> 02:04:25.100
my LLM is technically to frame that query. Are you getting

02:04:25.100 --> 02:04:29.420
my point? Yeah. Naresh has asked me this question, right? So

02:04:29.420 --> 02:04:32.180
basically whether it's a one record or it's a 1 million

02:04:32.180 --> 02:04:34.480
record or whether it's a hundred million record, how does

02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:37.460
that matter? What is my response? What is the responsibility

02:04:37.460 --> 02:04:41.760
of LLMs? Frame the query. Now that query will go and hit

02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:44.560
that. This is what this tool calling is doing, right? LLM is

02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:48.060
selecting a tool. It is trying to phrase the query and then

02:04:48.060 --> 02:04:52.060
it is going to fire basically my database. So to execute

02:04:52.060 --> 02:04:54.960
those like, you know, 10 million records. It's a

02:04:54.960 --> 02:04:58.380
responsibility of database by the way, right? So obviously

02:04:58.380 --> 02:05:01.800
my database is supposed to be big enough to take the

02:05:01.800 --> 02:05:04.980
execution of 10 million of record. So it depends upon the

02:05:04.980 --> 02:05:07.340
latency of the databases, not your LLMs by the way.

02:05:07.700 --> 02:05:11.160
Responsibility of LLM is just to frame the query and select

02:05:11.160 --> 02:05:15.080
a correct tool. So basically to make a decision that whom to

02:05:15.080 --> 02:05:16.360
call, how

02:05:23.910 --> 02:05:26.190
to run a project with my credential, it shows need a

02:05:26.190 --> 02:05:29.110
permission for a spreadsheet. I don't think that just go

02:05:29.110 --> 02:05:34.110
inside your, you know, Google search. Google this, this one,

02:05:34.190 --> 02:05:39.370
search for a seat and then Google seat API enable it. So in

02:05:39.370 --> 02:05:42.690
that case it will not look for the enable it. So by default

02:05:42.690 --> 02:05:45.730
this won't be enabled, enable it. So seat, email and

02:05:45.730 --> 02:05:49.070
calendar, all three and credential is same. Client ID and

02:05:49.070 --> 02:05:52.290
client secret is same for all. The client's ID and client

02:05:52.290 --> 02:05:55.130
secret that you have created, then you can go and talk to

02:05:55.130 --> 02:05:59.300
it. Mohamad, you are asking that it is possible to achieve

02:05:59.300 --> 02:06:01.920
MCP where the platform does not support connectors. How? How

02:06:01.920 --> 02:06:07.120
we have in Cloud A? See the thing is that that platform

02:06:07.120 --> 02:06:11.220
should support the connectors. Otherwise you will have to,

02:06:11.260 --> 02:06:14.540
you know, use maybe a URI kind of a system. So where you

02:06:14.540 --> 02:06:17.420
have your own LLMs and then you are calling through SSC or a

02:06:17.420 --> 02:06:20.640
studio. That is also possible. That is also possible because

02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:24.240
even like many platform, Langchain, Langraph, all of these

02:06:24.240 --> 02:06:28.520
things allows you to, you know, plug your, so here we are

02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:30.780
using a Sonnet model, right? As you can see here, we are

02:06:30.780 --> 02:06:33.960
using a Sonnet model. From a Cloud A. So we are using LLMs.

02:06:34.240 --> 02:06:36.700
Let's suppose I wanted to use maybe a URI model. That is

02:06:36.700 --> 02:06:39.720
also possible. It's fine. I will create my own UI interface.

02:06:40.460 --> 02:06:43.660
This is this kind of a, you know, chat interface and then it

02:06:43.660 --> 02:06:47.040
will be like doing all the task and job for me. That is also

02:06:47.040 --> 02:06:52.020
possible. In that way you can call the MCPs and you can

02:06:52.020 --> 02:06:52.480
achieve it.

02:06:57.360 --> 02:07:00.620
There are other options instead of LLMs. See MCPs means

02:07:00.620 --> 02:07:04.780
LLMs, right? MCP simply means that, that you are trying to

02:07:04.780 --> 02:07:07.920
give a functional access to your or your digital world's

02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:11.860
access to a LLM. So that LLM can decide which tool to call

02:07:11.860 --> 02:07:14.740
from your tool list and then it will go for a tool calling.

02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:19.320
Already enabled eBay for the spreadsheet, then check your

02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:23.360
credentials once, right? Test it a little bit. Maybe try to

02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:25.900
do some sort of a bug fixing. You will be able to do it.

02:07:26.160 --> 02:07:30.900
Yeah. It's not very different. And check if you are not,

02:07:30.940 --> 02:07:33.760
just check like you should not use my API. If you are using

02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:37.020
my API, then obviously it is not going to work for you. So

02:07:37.020 --> 02:07:41.220
hope it is a good demo. For all of us, we all are able to

02:07:41.220 --> 02:07:44.000
understand again, the power of AI, which we are trying to

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:48.500
understand since last three months. Right. And yeah, so you

02:07:48.500 --> 02:07:52.640
can try to like, just, just try to implement these MCP

02:07:52.640 --> 02:07:56.220
things, guys. Just as try to implement this five things, try

02:07:56.220 --> 02:07:59.380
to execute it with your own credential. Believe me, you will

02:07:59.380 --> 02:08:02.720
feel literally happy. You will feel literally happy. And

02:08:02.720 --> 02:08:06.660
then you will be able to understand the real power of MCPs

02:08:06.660 --> 02:08:10.160
that, okay, this is what AI world can do. And this is how

02:08:10.160 --> 02:08:16.800
beautiful a MCP can be, right? MCP can be, uh, and then

02:08:16.800 --> 02:08:21.340
like, uh, build as many MCP as you want. Yeah. So simple. So

02:08:21.340 --> 02:08:23.740
just try this out, try this out. And if you're facing any

02:08:23.740 --> 02:08:26.720
kind of issues, so keep on pinging each and every one, uh,

02:08:26.860 --> 02:08:30.380
even me, uh, so that, you know, we can fix because, uh, with

02:08:30.380 --> 02:08:32.640
code, you will not face any issues only with credentials.

02:08:32.780 --> 02:08:35.300
You are going to face the issues. Uh, that's it. Right.

02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:38.120
That's it. Anyhow. We have solved a lot of like, uh,

02:08:38.140 --> 02:08:42.360
connectors issues, the study itself. Uh, so, uh, you can,

02:08:42.360 --> 02:08:45.880
you can, you know, uh, try to check now things are very easy

02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:49.120
to implement with AI. It's actually very easy. Yes, it is.

02:08:49.160 --> 02:08:55.320
It is easy. Yeah. So just look into it and then, uh, uh,

02:08:55.420 --> 02:08:59.100
come to our next class and then let's have a, so next time

02:08:59.100 --> 02:09:01.720
I'm going to discuss A2A protocol, agent to agent protocol.

02:09:01.900 --> 02:09:04.920
So how agent and agent can communicate between each other.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:08.660
They can try to, you know. Take a decision, uh, among

02:09:08.660 --> 02:09:11.820
themselves, just like we, as a human being, we talk to each

02:09:11.820 --> 02:09:14.580
other, right? So agent to agent protocol is similar to that.

02:09:14.760 --> 02:09:18.780
So like talking to a multiple, like a human being. So

02:09:18.780 --> 02:09:21.140
similarly, so agent will be able to do a communication

02:09:21.140 --> 02:09:23.660
between each other that you do this, then you will do this,

02:09:23.700 --> 02:09:27.200
then I will do this kind of a communication and, uh, it is

02:09:27.200 --> 02:09:29.480
going to achieve a particular task. So that is, that is

02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:31.460
something which I'll discuss. I'll be discussing on a

02:09:31.460 --> 02:09:34.480
Saturday's class, by the way. So next, next class agenda is

02:09:34.480 --> 02:09:37.360
going to be that one. Okay. So fine guys, but that, uh,

02:09:37.500 --> 02:09:40.360
thank you so much. Uh, nothing much to discuss code is

02:09:40.360 --> 02:09:43.100
already available inside your dashboard. Uh, just to try to

02:09:43.100 --> 02:09:45.900
like, you know, execute it once and you will be, you will

02:09:45.900 --> 02:09:49.380
enjoy it. You will enjoy it. And you can write, uh, like,

02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:53.340
uh, you know, that directly into your resume. Simple. Like I

02:09:53.340 --> 02:10:02.040
said, I have created a 177 MCPs, then use case where we can

02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:05.080
use an agent and MCP together. Yeah. Obviously agent can

02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:08.260
call MCP. You see MCPs are nothing but I exposed tool,

02:10:08.440 --> 02:10:12.400
right? Exposed tool. Your agent is what your agent is

02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:15.160
someone who takes a decision just like a L. So generally,

02:10:15.420 --> 02:10:18.020
whenever we try to use any platforms, we try to create our

02:10:18.020 --> 02:10:22.000
agents, what we are doing with agents. So fundamentally it's

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:25.400
a LLM, right? Even over here. So when we are talking to a

02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:29.160
cloud day, what we are doing, we are calling LLMs agent will

02:10:29.160 --> 02:10:33.580
do again, what call the LLMs. So the procedure is different,

02:10:33.780 --> 02:10:37.300
right? But fundamentally. If you will see my LLMs is a brain

02:10:37.300 --> 02:10:40.460
over here, the clouded that I'm using. And then in case of a

02:10:40.460 --> 02:10:42.700
agent tick system, for example, I have created agent with a

02:10:42.700 --> 02:10:44.840
Lang chain, Lang graph, Lama indexes, whatever system,

02:10:44.920 --> 02:10:47.380
right? Whatever orchestrated framework or maybe in it in,

02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:51.500
yeah, in it in a, so technically it is accessing the LLMs.

02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:54.540
So it's a brain, right? Which is going to make a decision.

02:10:54.720 --> 02:10:58.460
So it's not different. It's technically same, right? So if

02:10:58.460 --> 02:11:01.900
LLMs can call MCPs, even agents can call MCPs and if you'll

02:11:01.900 --> 02:11:05.520
check your Lang chain, LLMs, they have given you a direct,

02:11:05.640 --> 02:11:08.500
like a, you know, uh, like a function for that. So you can

02:11:08.500 --> 02:11:10.740
create a agent and inside the agent, if you have to call

02:11:10.740 --> 02:11:14.200
MCPs like this one, which I have exposed, call them. Okay.

02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:22.580
Dhruv is saying that can we put same code over a get also

02:11:22.580 --> 02:11:25.660
and so case in a YouTube portfolio to so yeah, you can, you

02:11:25.660 --> 02:11:28.300
can put this code or you can try to like use it anywhere,

02:11:28.540 --> 02:11:31.580
YouTube, LinkedIn, wherever you want. You can just use it. I

02:11:31.580 --> 02:11:34.820
don't have any kind of issues because anyhow in next class

02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:37.240
I'll be using a different code, a different scenario. A

02:11:37.240 --> 02:11:40.420
different like, uh, examples and use cases. I have, I have

02:11:40.420 --> 02:11:43.160
so many such examples and like, you know, I use cases so,

02:11:43.240 --> 02:11:48.020
uh, uh, I don't have any like a kind of, uh, you know, fear

02:11:48.020 --> 02:11:51.920
to like, uh, if my code gets shared with someone, it's fine.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:56.180
It's yours. You can use it. Yeah. You can use it as long as

02:11:56.180 --> 02:11:59.160
it is going to give you a benefit, uh, use it. It's for all

02:11:59.160 --> 02:12:04.240
of you. So do we hide a credential? No need to even hide a

02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:06.880
credential. It's fine. A credential will be deactivated in

02:12:06.880 --> 02:12:07.980
some time. Automatically.

02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:12.040
Okay.

02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:22.600
So please don't put on YouTube otherwise competition will

02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:25.260
increase. You shouldn't think about this. Competition will

02:12:25.260 --> 02:12:29.360
increase. In this, on this planet, there are like a 800,

02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:35.740
800, uh, uh, uh, like a 8 billion people exist, right? 1.5

02:12:35.740 --> 02:12:38.920
billion exist in India itself, right? Do you think that that

02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:41.140
if you are not going to share something with the entire

02:12:41.140 --> 02:12:45.020
world, the world will not be aware about it? Right? So you

02:12:45.020 --> 02:12:47.580
should actually share as much as you can, whether it's an

02:12:47.580 --> 02:12:50.900
opportunity, whether it's a knowledge. So just try to share,

02:12:51.020 --> 02:12:53.320
just try to, you know, distribute as long as possible

02:12:53.320 --> 02:12:56.880
because maybe if, if you are not doing it, but there are

02:12:56.880 --> 02:12:59.580
like a lakhs of people or maybe millions of people who are

02:12:59.580 --> 02:13:02.300
already ahead of you. So if you are not doing it, basically

02:13:02.300 --> 02:13:05.060
you will not be even able to connect with those kinds of

02:13:05.060 --> 02:13:08.440
people. So if you are going to level up yourself, if you are

02:13:08.440 --> 02:13:12.540
going to expose yourself, obviously. Uh. So on that level,

02:13:12.640 --> 02:13:15.940
even similar kind of a people will come into your circle and

02:13:15.940 --> 02:13:18.300
they will be able to kind of, this is how you knew us works.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:23.420
I got up better. Okay. Okay.

02:13:35.050 --> 02:13:39.170
Great. Okay. Fine. Guys, just run it, run it. And then

02:13:39.170 --> 02:13:42.150
maybe, uh, like, you know, uh, if you're facing any kind of

02:13:42.150 --> 02:13:43.210
issues, so maybe two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

02:13:43.210 --> 02:13:43.490
nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23

02:13:43.490 --> 02:13:46.530
guys can sit together. Uh, this is Sunday, right? So two,

02:13:46.570 --> 02:13:48.910
three guys and sit together and then try to like, uh, fix it

02:13:48.910 --> 02:13:51.390
because the only issue that you are going to face is with

02:13:51.390 --> 02:13:53.390
respect to credential. I have already told you to create,

02:13:53.510 --> 02:13:56.710
how to create a credential that is also a standard way. Uh,

02:13:56.890 --> 02:14:00.370
so again, I don't think that any one of us will get an

02:14:00.370 --> 02:14:03.930
issue, but yeah, if someone is facing an issue in a group in

02:14:03.930 --> 02:14:06.870
terms of execution, maybe you guys can sit together over a

02:14:06.870 --> 02:14:09.810
Google meet. Right. Uh, that's the reason. So we have a

02:14:09.810 --> 02:14:14.250
group. Uh. What's a group and, uh, try to, you know, just

02:14:14.250 --> 02:14:17.290
like solve the problem of each other. This is how you will

02:14:17.290 --> 02:14:20.590
learn. Because if you are going to ask me to solve a problem

02:14:20.590 --> 02:14:25.010
like a study, I can do it. See, I will, I can do it for

02:14:25.010 --> 02:14:29.230
everyone. Right. But in that way you will not learn. So just

02:14:29.230 --> 02:14:33.070
try to learn, uh, yeah. What is, what is your question? Go

02:14:33.070 --> 02:14:34.310
ahead with your question.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:43.160
Uh, am I audible? Yeah. You are audible. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, uh,

02:14:43.280 --> 02:14:50.600
as we make apps, uh, we use the cloud and, uh, although I

02:14:50.600 --> 02:14:54.880
asked the question when I saw. But Sir, uh, as we are making

02:14:54.880 --> 02:14:59.680
apps in the left of us, uh, certain эксп fiercy will not

02:14:59.680 --> 02:15:04.020
occur. So ha so let him play with this but no, no it will

02:15:04.020 --> 02:15:07.480
not be the same Looking Genie and I can be the same. It will

02:15:07.480 --> 02:15:10.440
soon make no difference. Now the client what you just said

02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:12.120
is a client since seeing that cloud Kin ihrer Here doesn't

02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:15.480
So, you can create a client using the land chain or using

02:15:15.480 --> 02:15:20.040
its APIs and give your own custom LLM access there. Give

02:15:20.040 --> 02:15:23.720
access to URI or give the OpenAI credentials there or give

02:15:23.720 --> 02:15:27.320
the Gemini there. That's it. Simple. You were saying

02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:31.140
something by doing SSC, right? Yes, it is done by doing SSC.

02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:35.140
If you are deploying, then with that you will be able to

02:15:35.140 --> 02:15:39.280
call. And basically, SSC means that it is also a protocol

02:15:39.280 --> 02:15:41.560
through which we are exposing our system.

02:15:44.420 --> 02:15:49.080
So, SSC is called Server Sent Event. So, basically, if my

02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:53.560
system is hosted on a URL, then we are calling it and giving

02:15:53.560 --> 02:15:57.340
it access through it. That's it. So, just try to expose that

02:15:57.340 --> 02:16:02.220
as SSC and then consume it wherever you feel like. Okay, so,

02:16:02.300 --> 02:16:05.060
for client side, for land chain SSC. For client side,

02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:07.540
because the server side will remain the same. Yes, the

02:16:07.540 --> 02:16:08.680
server side will remain the same. If you are going to the

02:16:08.680 --> 02:16:11.560
land chain as an agent, then you can put an agent in the

02:16:11.560 --> 02:16:15.240
server side as well and call through the agent. That is also

02:16:15.240 --> 02:16:17.860
possible. Okay. Means, technically, there are like multiple

02:16:17.860 --> 02:16:22.880
ways to like, you know, do that. Okay. Sir, one more problem

02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:26.920
that we are facing. We have made it so that we have made

02:16:26.920 --> 02:16:33.020
agents. And for every agent, it is like this. We have given

02:16:33.020 --> 02:16:37.700
different indexes in our vector databases. We have given

02:16:37.700 --> 02:16:46.860
access to that tool. Okay. Now, sometimes, it happens that,

02:16:46.860 --> 02:16:52.160
because every agent has different indexes. So, the client

02:16:52.160 --> 02:16:57.080
sometimes says that this query is common in both places. So,

02:16:57.080 --> 02:17:00.180
the result of this, although it is not relevant. Sometimes,

02:17:00.480 --> 02:17:03.340
it happens that they say that I cannot remove this from our

02:17:03.340 --> 02:17:09.020
common database. Means, there are so many records that I

02:17:09.020 --> 02:17:12.380
cannot say to the team that remove this record or remove

02:17:12.380 --> 02:17:19.160
this one. So, he is expecting that in some queries, it

02:17:19.160 --> 02:17:21.820
should be picked from there, from the common one. And in

02:17:21.820 --> 02:17:24.040
some queries, the actual database should come from there.

02:17:25.640 --> 02:17:29.180
So, now, the LLM, I mean, the agent should be picked from

02:17:29.180 --> 02:17:31.480
there. So, we have given access to two indexes. But again,

02:17:31.580 --> 02:17:36.220
there is some dissatisfaction in this case. That this one

02:17:36.220 --> 02:17:39.180
should come from there. Because they do not understand

02:17:39.180 --> 02:17:42.860
technology. So, this question should come from there. Write

02:17:42.860 --> 02:17:45.760
a generic function. Write only one single function. LLM is

02:17:45.760 --> 02:17:48.700
calling at the end of the day. So, write a generic function

02:17:48.700 --> 02:17:51.980
where you are giving access to both. So, wherever there is

02:17:51.980 --> 02:17:54.380
such a situation, LLM will decide that call this function.

02:17:54.780 --> 02:17:57.520
And that function is technically hitting both. And then it

02:17:57.520 --> 02:17:59.440
is bringing both data. It is merging both. It is analyzing.

02:17:59.540 --> 02:18:01.760
And then finally, it is giving the result. That is possible.

02:18:02.840 --> 02:18:06.140
I mean, should I write some rules? Yes. I mean, write

02:18:06.140 --> 02:18:09.280
another function. Write another tool there, basically. That

02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:11.560
if I have to bring data from both. So, technically, this

02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:14.160
tool should be called. Not the individual one. If you are

02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:15.760
calling the individual now, then the individual should not

02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:18.040
be called. And in that case, that tool will come with both

02:18:18.040 --> 02:18:21.660
data. At the end of the day, I only need correct data by

02:18:21.660 --> 02:18:24.600
combining both. Right. So, that can be done with the help of

02:18:24.600 --> 02:18:28.640
tool itself. You change the tool only there. Right. And sir,

02:18:28.720 --> 02:18:32.940
is this architecture correct? I mean, now there are more

02:18:32.940 --> 02:18:37.920
people in the team who have made an agent

02:18:37.920 --> 02:18:43.140
for every index. Not every index-wise agent should be made.

02:18:43.600 --> 02:18:46.500
Make it task-wise. It will be better. I mean, like that will

02:18:46.500 --> 02:18:48.260
be much more structured.

02:18:50.980 --> 02:18:54.140
Right. Okay. Make it task-wise so that the index will decide

02:18:54.140 --> 02:18:57.920
on its own. The index will call on its own. Okay. So, task

02:18:57.920 --> 02:19:00.140
-wise, I think it is a better approach. As compared to like

02:19:00.140 --> 02:19:05.240
going ahead with the indexes. Okay, sir. I will try this

02:19:05.240 --> 02:19:07.480
one. What you were saying. The client-side one. Take down.

02:19:07.680 --> 02:19:09.440
If anything happens, I will. Sir, there was one more

02:19:09.440 --> 02:19:13.840
request. I had sent it in the group. That such a batch of

02:19:13.840 --> 02:19:18.900
senior architect level. Try it once. Let's see. I mean, it

02:19:18.900 --> 02:19:21.880
depends on the time. Right. It depends on the time. We also

02:19:21.880 --> 02:19:24.840
have limited time. That's why. Let's see. We will do. Yes.

02:19:25.160 --> 02:19:29.300
Yes. Yeah. So, Rakesh, go ahead with your question. Yes.

02:19:31.820 --> 02:19:36.980
Sir, actually, I missed the 15 to 20 minutes class due to

02:19:36.980 --> 02:19:40.600
some technical glitch. So, maybe you have explained these

02:19:40.600 --> 02:19:45.160
things, but I missed something. Can you share your screen

02:19:45.160 --> 02:19:51.740
and share the code where you are just writing the tools?

02:19:52.800 --> 02:19:56.140
Okay. So, writing a tool. So, which tool? Gmail seat or

02:19:56.140 --> 02:19:59.280
anything? Any tools. And go to the if-else condition where

02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:03.300
the LLM is calling exactly. Okay. So, basically, you are

02:20:03.300 --> 02:20:07.500
talking about the server part. Right. Yeah. So, this one. To

02:20:07.500 --> 02:20:13.080
us, sir. Yeah. Any if-else condition. Just suppose we are

02:20:13.080 --> 02:20:15.560
talking about a 233, line number 233.

02:20:19.100 --> 02:20:25.100
So, here, how LLM passing the get underscore seat underscore

02:20:25.100 --> 02:20:30.400
info value, actually. How LLM is passing get underscore seat

02:20:30.400 --> 02:20:33.340
underscore info value. Okay. This is where I think you have

02:20:33.340 --> 02:20:35.540
not missed in a beginning. You have missed something in a

02:20:35.540 --> 02:20:38.440
middle. This is what I told you. Right. So, list tool. So,

02:20:38.540 --> 02:20:40.480
this is the reason. So, we are trying to create a list of

02:20:40.480 --> 02:20:44.000
the tool. So, LLM will not call a tool directly. So, it will

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:47.020
first of all come and check from a list of the tool. And

02:20:47.020 --> 02:20:49.760
this list of the tool we have given over here. Right. So,

02:20:49.780 --> 02:20:51.660
once it will decide that, okay, fine. So, this list of the

02:20:51.660 --> 02:20:55.180
tool should be called. Then it goes here. Then it try to

02:20:55.180 --> 02:20:57.560
check. Okay. Fine. So, which function we have to execute and

02:20:57.560 --> 02:21:00.940
where that tool name is in our if-else condition. This is

02:21:00.940 --> 02:21:03.980
how LLM. So, according. Okay. Okay. Understood, sir. Yes.

02:21:04.100 --> 02:21:07.100
Yeah. I missed in the between. Yeah. Because you have missed

02:21:07.100 --> 02:21:09.200
in between. Because I have explained that in between. Right.

02:21:09.320 --> 02:21:12.440
So, it never calls a tool directly. It is technically check

02:21:12.440 --> 02:21:14.400
from the list that, okay, fine. These are the tool access I

02:21:14.400 --> 02:21:17.420
have. Now, which tool will be suitable. Now, once it will

02:21:17.420 --> 02:21:20.860
decide that, okay, append seat tool is suitable. So,

02:21:20.860 --> 02:21:23.160
technically, we have to call actual function. Right. Actual

02:21:23.160 --> 02:21:25.120
function will be called here. See. This is the actual

02:21:25.120 --> 02:21:27.960
function. Right. So, we are calling it. But, yeah. So, it is

02:21:27.960 --> 02:21:30.840
coming from after like a listing from the tool listing.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:35.240
Okay. So, then my question is arising in the above in the

02:21:35.240 --> 02:21:41.400
tool itself. Okay. So, how the LLM is deciding if suppose we

02:21:41.400 --> 02:21:45.440
have given a description over here. Right. We have already

02:21:45.440 --> 02:21:47.140
given a description. So, it is trying to understand a

02:21:47.140 --> 02:21:48.880
description. That's the reason. So, in a tool, there is a

02:21:48.880 --> 02:21:51.340
provision of giving a description. Everywhere, we have given

02:21:51.340 --> 02:21:54.820
a description. Right. Understood, sir. Understood. Yeah. And

02:21:54.820 --> 02:21:59.220
LLM is very good with the languages. Right. Understood, sir.

02:21:59.300 --> 02:22:02.900
Yeah. One next question, sir. Actually, two to three

02:22:02.900 --> 02:22:06.220
questions. Very small questions, but two to three questions.

02:22:06.620 --> 02:22:12.560
Yeah. So, how if suppose I have created multiple APIs. I

02:22:12.560 --> 02:22:17.500
mean, in a different technologies. Right. So, if I want to

02:22:17.500 --> 02:22:22.700
call that API from this, I mean, LLM. Yeah. Do it. Do it

02:22:22.700 --> 02:22:27.300
then. Okay. Simple. See. API is what? API also you will try

02:22:27.300 --> 02:22:29.620
to bind it. API means what? You will try to call it. You

02:22:29.620 --> 02:22:31.560
will call request. Right. Right. Let's suppose you are using

02:22:31.560 --> 02:22:34.260
Python or maybe Java, maybe C++ or anything. Right. You will

02:22:34.260 --> 02:22:37.160
call request. Request is a function. Right. So, now that

02:22:37.160 --> 02:22:39.820
request you will be calling in similar kind of a functions

02:22:39.820 --> 02:22:42.800
that request.dis and then you will pass the URL means

02:22:42.800 --> 02:22:45.760
technically API URL. Right. Right. You are going to post

02:22:45.760 --> 02:22:48.020
request or maybe get request or put request or delete

02:22:48.020 --> 02:22:50.960
request you are going to do. Yes. Yeah. Yes. So, that will

02:22:50.960 --> 02:22:53.720
come inside the, bind up inside the function. This kind of a

02:22:53.720 --> 02:22:56.880
function. Right. And then if you have to expose that to the

02:22:56.880 --> 02:23:00.060
server as a MCP server. Right. Then what you will do? You

02:23:00.060 --> 02:23:02.220
will follow the exact same procedure. Right. Okay. Within

02:23:02.220 --> 02:23:08.020
the tool we can describe the APIs. Right. So, you will

02:23:08.020 --> 02:23:13.080
describe the basically nature of the tool. Right. And this

02:23:13.080 --> 02:23:15.520
tool. So, whenever system will decide that okay this tool

02:23:15.520 --> 02:23:17.840
should be called it will call technically a function. So,

02:23:17.840 --> 02:23:20.800
that will be fall under this efels efels tool calling

02:23:20.800 --> 02:23:25.760
function. Tool calling function. Right. So, first of all

02:23:25.760 --> 02:23:28.220
listing of the tool and tool calling. So, first of all LM

02:23:28.220 --> 02:23:30.200
has to decide. Right. So, which function I am supposed to

02:23:30.200 --> 02:23:33.020
call. Correct. Yeah. So, API is nothing but function

02:23:33.020 --> 02:23:36.300
execution at the time of even if you are executing some APIs

02:23:36.300 --> 02:23:39.900
you will call request and responses. Right. So, same thing

02:23:39.900 --> 02:23:42.840
nothing nothing different. Because this question I because

02:23:42.840 --> 02:23:47.780
here we have we have done the connectivity with the five

02:23:47.780 --> 02:23:50.980
different different things and the some some technology

02:23:50.980 --> 02:23:54.600
where we cannot directly connect with those. Even we are

02:23:54.600 --> 02:23:56.840
calling a API over here. Right. So, we are calling Gmail API

02:23:56.840 --> 02:23:59.440
suite API we are calling basically calendar API everywhere

02:23:59.440 --> 02:24:04.100
API we are calling. Even now we are calling APIs. I mean

02:24:04.100 --> 02:24:07.780
like it's not a URL. It's basically someone has like you

02:24:07.780 --> 02:24:10.920
know someone has created a beautiful function for me. Right.

02:24:10.980 --> 02:24:13.000
Someone has created basically this kind of a function

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.980
service dot spread set. But in a back end it's just API that

02:24:15.980 --> 02:24:19.000
we are trying. Yeah. Understood. It's a back end. But if if

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:23.040
suppose we have created APIs to. Similarly create create a

02:24:23.040 --> 02:24:25.780
function. Your function will be doing a request. Request to

02:24:25.780 --> 02:24:27.960
the API. So, that particular URL post get request post get

02:24:27.960 --> 02:24:30.680
put whatever request that you are doing. Right. And function

02:24:30.680 --> 02:24:32.600
will return something. So, technically it will become a

02:24:32.600 --> 02:24:35.600
function. Right. Now if it will become a function you have

02:24:35.600 --> 02:24:38.140
to bind it in the similar way to the to your server to your

02:24:38.140 --> 02:24:42.000
MCPs. Okay sir. Okay understood. I will try that one. Yeah.

02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:48.060
And next question is sir like a Cloudy. Cloudy can we use

02:24:48.060 --> 02:24:51.640
this one for a production. Obviously you can try to use it

02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:54.980
for a product. I mean like it's not a matter of using it for

02:24:54.980 --> 02:24:57.860
a production or not. It's your local client. Right. It's

02:24:57.860 --> 02:25:00.140
your local client. So, wherever you need a kind of a system

02:25:00.140 --> 02:25:03.900
where someone can like you know chat. Someone has to like

02:25:03.900 --> 02:25:07.600
get a tool access. In that situation you can try to use it.

02:25:07.660 --> 02:25:12.340
Otherwise create your own interface. Okay. So, if we have a

02:25:12.340 --> 02:25:16.640
chat chat system within our site. Yeah. You can just try to

02:25:16.640 --> 02:25:18.860
do same same thing. Back end is going to be same. MCP is

02:25:18.860 --> 02:25:21.540
going to be same. This is not going to change. Your client

02:25:21.540 --> 02:25:23.960
is going to change and then you have to do a binding with

02:25:23.960 --> 02:25:26.720
that client. The way. We have changed the configuration file

02:25:26.720 --> 02:25:29.700
of your Cloudy and then we have bind it. Similarly you can

02:25:29.700 --> 02:25:32.760
bind it to any other front end or client that you want of

02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:36.820
your choice. So, in that case sir just you have a beautiful

02:25:36.820 --> 02:25:40.560
graph

02:25:40.560 --> 02:25:46.280
and something like a report. So, that is developed by the

02:25:46.280 --> 02:25:51.000
Cloudy or we can. That is basically a property of a Cloudy.

02:25:51.280 --> 02:25:55.160
Cloudy. So, this type of thing. But this report. That it is

02:25:55.160 --> 02:25:58.160
able to give it to me. Right. This kind of a report. This is

02:25:58.160 --> 02:26:00.560
basically coming from a LLM. So, any LLM can give you this

02:26:00.560 --> 02:26:04.400
report. So, how this type of the analysis report or the

02:26:04.400 --> 02:26:10.360
graph things. If we want to. So, again again simple. You

02:26:10.360 --> 02:26:13.180
don't have to do much over here. So, basically even URI will

02:26:13.180 --> 02:26:15.440
be able to give you such kind of a things. You just have to

02:26:15.440 --> 02:26:18.980
like in your UI interface just say that that whenever

02:26:18.980 --> 02:26:21.660
someone is asking for the report. So, just try to you know

02:26:21.660 --> 02:26:24.560
analyze it and maybe just call matrodly pandas or something

02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:28.620
like that. It will plot the graph. Okay. Everything can be

02:26:28.620 --> 02:26:31.260
built. Everything can be built and we like we do that

02:26:31.260 --> 02:26:35.700
actually. Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much sir. Yeah.

02:26:35.960 --> 02:26:39.040
Yeah. Okay. Dhruv go ahead with the question. What is your

02:26:39.040 --> 02:26:45.140
question? Yeah. Hi sir. Yeah. Yeah. This was a really great

02:26:45.140 --> 02:26:48.860
example that today you given and it is really practical

02:26:48.860 --> 02:26:52.740
also. Yeah. So, till now I have got the idea. Basically I

02:26:52.740 --> 02:26:55.720
have got the roadmap. Basically. I have to how I have to

02:26:55.720 --> 02:26:59.360
will where I have to put the database and all. It is about

02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:02.960
again data itself. So, right now the company. So, my purpose

02:27:02.960 --> 02:27:07.360
is simple as of now to build sales and support kind of

02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:10.760
system for my company as you can see as a project and all.

02:27:10.860 --> 02:27:14.080
So, that I am just trying initially instead of going

02:27:14.080 --> 02:27:19.920
anywhere else. Okay. So, right now we are using Joho for all

02:27:19.920 --> 02:27:22.840
the data gathering as a CRM and Joho analytics also. There

02:27:22.840 --> 02:27:25.760
we have so many tables that we have combined from Joho CRM

02:27:25.760 --> 02:27:31.080
to Joho table. There we get so many dashboards. So, now when

02:27:31.080 --> 02:27:34.060
I have to push the data and by the way because we are a

02:27:34.060 --> 02:27:37.380
software company. So, the software that we have implemented

02:27:37.380 --> 02:27:40.740
and that we have you know hosted that we are using AWS,

02:27:41.040 --> 02:27:43.900
MongoDB all those data set we are using. But that we are

02:27:43.900 --> 02:27:49.200
using just for just to deploy our own software that we are

02:27:49.200 --> 02:27:52.120
giving to the client. But as of now because I am from the

02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:54.560
sales domain. So, I do not want to go to my company and

02:27:54.560 --> 02:27:58.200
asking them to do give me all those access. They will feel

02:27:58.200 --> 02:28:01.740
ki bhai tu sales pe karle pehle hai na. So, later on I

02:28:01.740 --> 02:28:04.540
wanted to go when I have a full content and I can show them

02:28:04.540 --> 02:28:07.240
this I can do within a week. I do not need a lot of time.

02:28:07.680 --> 02:28:10.880
Right. So, they won't feel kind of ki I am putting my whole

02:28:10.880 --> 02:28:14.760
energy and whole time in doing these things. Because I have

02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:18.480
to increase the sales part also of the company. But I have

02:28:18.480 --> 02:28:21.320
to make a smarter system for sales and support. So, this is

02:28:21.320 --> 02:28:25.560
like that. That day you did the fine tuning with model. That

02:28:25.560 --> 02:28:29.300
is great for our users. So, even right now we do not have

02:28:29.300 --> 02:28:32.960
kind of WhatsApp kind of URI that you have. Client can go

02:28:32.960 --> 02:28:36.880
and they can ask any query and it can in return give them a

02:28:36.880 --> 02:28:41.680
lot of answers. Which happens a lot. If I give you example

02:28:41.680 --> 02:28:45.620
right now we have more than 1500 groups with client with

02:28:45.620 --> 02:28:48.160
different different clients. So, we are solving a lot of

02:28:48.160 --> 02:28:51.700
queries just only simply WhatsApp. Client ask then our team

02:28:51.700 --> 02:28:54.980
responds. Client does then our team responds. And it is a

02:28:54.980 --> 02:28:57.540
lot of pressure and all those things. But yeah we are not

02:28:57.540 --> 02:29:00.460
doing I think company is not doing because there are so many

02:29:00.460 --> 02:29:04.760
other things. So, the data part now the starting part if I

02:29:04.760 --> 02:29:09.320
have to deploy over MongoDB neon and all so how to how I

02:29:09.320 --> 02:29:13.880
will do and how I will update again and again there in those

02:29:13.880 --> 02:29:17.120
system. Dhruv I am not able to get your question. Your

02:29:17.120 --> 02:29:20.240
question was very lengthy and I think in between. So, you

02:29:20.240 --> 02:29:22.440
have created a lot of deviations. So, just in one single

02:29:22.440 --> 02:29:25.160
line tell me your question. Final question. The data the

02:29:25.160 --> 02:29:30.760
data the data that we have right now over in table format if

02:29:30.760 --> 02:29:39.140
I have to put in a MongoDB and neon. Okay. So, how to. Where

02:29:39.140 --> 02:29:43.180
is your data as of now? Right now the sales the sales data

02:29:43.180 --> 02:29:49.460
it is in it is in Joho analytics. Okay. Fine. Fine. In table

02:29:49.460 --> 02:29:53.780
format. Fine. Got it. So, I have two type of data if I say.

02:29:53.960 --> 02:29:57.200
Okay. Fine. Create a pipeline if you have to migrate it

02:29:57.200 --> 02:30:00.540
otherwise just use a Joho analytics itself. Do they give a I

02:30:00.540 --> 02:30:03.160
never used it basically do they give a API access API

02:30:03.160 --> 02:30:06.720
control. They give yes. Then it is fine why to why to

02:30:06.720 --> 02:30:10.740
transfer anywhere. So, just use it use the same no need to

02:30:10.740 --> 02:30:13.280
transfer anywhere in that situation. Right. Simple write a

02:30:13.280 --> 02:30:15.560
function call the same thing the way you are calling neon

02:30:15.560 --> 02:30:18.960
over here the way you will call any other DB. Okay. So,

02:30:19.280 --> 02:30:22.400
instead of doing anything over there because already we have

02:30:22.400 --> 02:30:25.280
Joho analytics directly I can call the data and I can get.

02:30:25.360 --> 02:30:27.680
Exactly. Yeah. I mean like if they have they have already

02:30:27.680 --> 02:30:30.540
providing you a API access or through a code you will be

02:30:30.540 --> 02:30:32.960
able to access the database then why do migrate just use the

02:30:32.960 --> 02:30:37.840
same thing. Got it. Got it. And the second data would be for

02:30:37.840 --> 02:30:40.920
from the support perspective. So, that is our client data

02:30:40.920 --> 02:30:43.620
that is our software data that might we need to then

02:30:43.620 --> 02:30:47.880
integrate the AWS and MongoDB that we are using for the

02:30:47.880 --> 02:30:50.520
software. It must be storing data somewhere right there must

02:30:50.520 --> 02:30:53.020
be some databases just write one single function the way we

02:30:53.020 --> 02:30:56.640
have written for a sequel and for Mongo first the data. So,

02:30:56.680 --> 02:30:59.180
if something is available in databases then it's very very

02:30:59.180 --> 02:31:01.580
easy it's not a big deal. So, that's the reason I have shown

02:31:01.580 --> 02:31:03.980
you two databases one sequel one no sequel. So, similarly

02:31:03.980 --> 02:31:07.380
write a function and then call the function. Okay. So, even

02:31:07.380 --> 02:31:10.900
in a real time when we so first time we have set up we have

02:31:10.900 --> 02:31:13.800
done all the things now when the data is getting updated

02:31:13.800 --> 02:31:17.220
whether it is data or whether it is our software data right.

02:31:17.360 --> 02:31:20.600
So, it needs update on either on daily basis or weekly or

02:31:20.600 --> 02:31:23.920
monthly. So, that happens through integration on that we

02:31:23.920 --> 02:31:26.960
have to do manually also like or it depends what kind of.

02:31:26.960 --> 02:31:30.440
Data data like data update where like in a database already

02:31:30.440 --> 02:31:34.540
data is coming right on a regular basis. Yes. Yeah. So,

02:31:34.620 --> 02:31:37.480
there is already updated data in that case. So, what what do

02:31:37.480 --> 02:31:38.760
you want to update where you want to update.

02:31:41.700 --> 02:31:44.140
I mean like data is already updated over there right. So,

02:31:44.180 --> 02:31:45.880
then what you will update there is nothing to update

02:31:45.880 --> 02:31:51.480
anywhere. Okay. Okay. And like as of now as a project as the

02:31:51.480 --> 02:31:54.820
initial part to make it happen to make it like you have did

02:31:54.820 --> 02:31:57.980
it over here because even I needed every single day report

02:31:57.980 --> 02:32:01.080
of my team and all. So, initially I can do with this

02:32:01.080 --> 02:32:04.040
CloudAid and I think in coming time after three and four

02:32:04.040 --> 02:32:07.500
weeks once we will be going with some project also end to

02:32:07.500 --> 02:32:11.460
end that time I think I will be able to deploy also and do

02:32:11.460 --> 02:32:15.540
every single thing end to end with my own interface like you

02:32:15.540 --> 02:32:18.160
have did it with Uriel. Yeah. If you are like you know

02:32:18.160 --> 02:32:23.440
building a project with me then for sure yes. Okay. So, just

02:32:23.440 --> 02:32:27.660
till then I just keep the whatever going on in the class I

02:32:27.660 --> 02:32:29.980
think I just keep those things. Just just at least yeah

02:32:29.980 --> 02:32:33.200
practice it just try to use use at least this one this also

02:32:33.200 --> 02:32:36.020
looks beautiful right and impressive. Yeah. Yeah. This is

02:32:36.020 --> 02:32:38.900
this is. Yeah. So, if your manager will see something like

02:32:38.900 --> 02:32:41.680
this then obviously you will get appreciation or maybe

02:32:41.680 --> 02:32:45.900
appraisal before your appraisal cycle. Yes. Yes. Yeah.

02:32:45.980 --> 02:32:49.080
Actually I have to report founders so yeah I have to give

02:32:49.080 --> 02:32:51.660
data but right now just I am giving in unstructured format

02:32:51.660 --> 02:32:54.980
or either screenshot but this is more better yeah if I can.

02:32:55.020 --> 02:32:57.660
Yeah. This looks much much better right so just like in his

02:32:57.660 --> 02:33:00.120
CloudAid integrate in his CloudAid desktop itself integrate

02:33:00.120 --> 02:33:02.740
your founder will wake up every morning and then he can

02:33:02.740 --> 02:33:05.880
check it by himself. Yes. Yes. That what I want that what I

02:33:05.880 --> 02:33:10.380
want. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

02:33:18.540 --> 02:33:22.500
I have actually done whatever you said and I am change the

02:33:22.500 --> 02:33:26.980
API and everything but but it is coming your mails answer

02:33:26.980 --> 02:33:30.180
only if you are giving the. Do a debugging do a debugging on

02:33:30.180 --> 02:33:32.500
your cell. Yeah. Okay. If you are not able to do it then I

02:33:32.500 --> 02:33:35.920
will solve. Okay. Okay I will do that. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

02:33:35.920 --> 02:33:37.220
Okay, Sumit Sahu, what is your question?

02:33:40.820 --> 02:33:44.780
Okay, I think he is off. Fine, so fine guys, hope all of you

02:33:44.780 --> 02:33:49.220
have enjoyed today's class. All of you, I am assuming that

02:33:49.220 --> 02:33:53.580
from my side. So just try to do the implementation, test it,

02:33:53.640 --> 02:33:56.660
create couple of more tool, try to give couple of more tool

02:33:56.660 --> 02:34:00.020
access, try to give, you know, maybe you are using WhatsApp

02:34:00.020 --> 02:34:02.900
or Telegram or maybe Slack or maybe Discord or anything.

02:34:03.120 --> 02:34:06.540
Even try to attach that as a tool. So keep on doing this

02:34:06.540 --> 02:34:09.780
kind of experimentation. Experimentation and yeah, so just

02:34:09.780 --> 02:34:12.980
chat with all of those system from one unified interface. So

02:34:12.980 --> 02:34:17.040
connect all the 100 interface and write that into a resume

02:34:17.040 --> 02:34:21.780
that I have created 177. I mean just a vague number, but

02:34:21.780 --> 02:34:26.080
yeah, 177 MCPs, right? Like I said, for my manager, for my

02:34:26.080 --> 02:34:29.900
director, for everyone. Everyone will feel like amazed and

02:34:29.900 --> 02:34:33.220
then obviously like you have to, you know, market yourself.

02:34:35.300 --> 02:34:38.500
So be active on LinkedIn. Be active on any other platform,

02:34:38.720 --> 02:34:41.520
right? And keep on doing your marketing because at the end

02:34:41.520 --> 02:34:44.700
of the day, your marketing is going to help you out. And

02:34:44.700 --> 02:34:47.360
then only people will be able to help you out. So fine guys,

02:34:47.440 --> 02:34:49.700
with that, thank you so much. Next class is going to be a

02:34:49.700 --> 02:34:53.400
A2A protocol. So agent to agent protocol we are going to

02:34:53.400 --> 02:34:59.440
explore. And yeah, in a practical manner, as always, the way

02:34:59.440 --> 02:35:02.580
we follow. So we will follow the same approach. And after

02:35:02.580 --> 02:35:06.780
that, so the next chapter. Yeah, so with that, thank you so

02:35:06.780 --> 02:35:10.640
