WEBVTT

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.240
okay so hi everyone i think i'm available and visible to all

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:03.560
of you uh so now i believe we can start the class yeah okay

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.800
so someone is saying that uh good morning sir with our

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.140
opening a new feature can you please brief more on this

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:20.320
feature so the opening i i think i have already created a

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.280
youtube video on that part so in hindi and english both uh i

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.760
believe you should you should go through that because uh

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.420
there i have done the comparison i have done the comparison

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:34.760
of like a you know opening a new feature and uh the release

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:39.980
that they have done uh recently so agent kit release uh as

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:44.340
per me it's not at all good not even close to a good by the

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:48.240
way uh yes you can create a agents but they are technically

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.520
moving into a pure agentic direction and they have not

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:56.220
created you know a sufficient number of a node maybe in

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.400
future they will do it uh there is a very high chance

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.760
because obviously it's open so maybe they will try to make

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.480
it better but as of now it's not that good means you will

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.220
not be able to use it in your like you know uh problem

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:16.220
solving basically so if you can't use it then obviously you

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:20.480
you can't you know uh like uh say anything is good in

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:28.290
eight minutes they created an app right sir i mean like just

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:31.870
see uh go and watch that video eight minute video once again

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:37.310
right uh so what kind of a app it was i like what what it

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:41.910
can do so it's not good at all believe me you can't like i

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:45.370
use it even now i can show you that uh how that can be done

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:51.780
but it's of no use so we'll have to like you know give some

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:56.420
time to open ai okay so let's get started guys uh so today

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:59.800
what we are going to do so basically we are going to uh talk

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:04.000
about uh autogen right so i believe we are going to talk

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.920
about uh the n8n and i have given you a task uh last last

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.480
week itself so i have i think given you uh 10 plus tasks and

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.600
so maybe you can try to complete those tasks and obviously

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:18.300
by completing those tasks uh you will be better at n8n n8n

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.600
is one of the best one of the mature tool uh second one is

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.800
you can use maybe a jpr jpr is also good and again jpr is

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.020
providing you a connectivity with everything right just like

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:33.380
n8n but yeah so at the end of the day n8n is like a pretty

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:33.860
much good and i think it's going to be a good idea for you

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.280
to use it in your n8n and plus uh i have seen somewhere like

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.080
uh some post from n8n itself i believe uh they are trying to

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:43.540
bring even a chat mode so basically you will be able to just

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:47.440
give a command uh from a chat and then uh system will be

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.060
able to build a agent for you so they are like uh bringing

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:54.900
that particular feature as well yeah so maybe in the future

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:59.220
so you will be able to see uh again a very very good amazing

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.160
feature from n8n so where you don't have to even go drag and

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:07.560
drop each and everything will be done uh just by like uh you

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:11.740
know uh using a chat uh with respect to n8n there is a very

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.740
high chance i think very soon they are going to release it

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:18.320
right as openai have targeted n8n so obviously uh they will

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:23.240
release this particular feature very very soon anyone who

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:28.060
have tested this uh openai agent kit yeah anyone okay

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:36.850
talent is saying yeah he has used it so anyone who was able

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:45.120
to build like real anyone i don't think so yeah i don't

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.180
think so

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:14.510
good to build a real use case at least uh now i have heard

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:18.790
openai agent builder is n8n killer uh basically there is

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:20.630
something called as pr there is something called as

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:24.170
marketing so basically whatever you have heard about it it's

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:26.230
basically a part of that i have already created a video in

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:28.230
hindi and english so you can go and you can try to check my

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:31.670
videos i have done a very transparent comparison between uh

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:35.450
n8n and this uh agent kit and i have given uh like honest

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:40.030
feedback over there just not like uh by saying something but

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:43.050
yeah by showing something so i've already shown all those

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:47.170
things so it's it's not even close to uh you know people

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:50.650
have just talked about that uh agent kit maybe for one day i

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:54.430
believe 24 hour and after that like uh no one is even

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:58.750
talking about it okay so let me share my screen guys uh

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:02.990
agenda for today's class is going to be basically uh talking

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:08.610
about autogen so autogen is another framework from a

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:12.890
microsoft and we are going to talk about basically a autogen

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:16.210
so autogen also provides you a feature in terms of our ui

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:18.570
interfaces i believe we have already done an installation of

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:23.290
ui interface in my last class itself so to do that you just

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.810
have to write a command pip install autogen studio and it

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:29.410
will be able to install it and then you can launch it as a

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:32.490
ui interface and then you will be able to you know build the

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:35.590
agent and eventually you all will be able to automate the

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:41.170
task again uh if you will ask me about an autogen so autogen

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:45.990
is not i would say it's it's just like using any other

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:48.810
libraries out there so maybe you can try to use a lang chain

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:53.710
lang graph llama indexes or like a crew ai or maybe a

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:57.390
autogen so it's just like that like it is not going to give

00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:00.730
you any kind of a additional advantages by the way

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:03.830
so fortunately what we are固定ed on here is that uh ui

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:03.830
interface we think of agent just has a multi-agent

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:05.370
orchestration framework and nein also oh well it will

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:05.450
actually give you the ability to do multi agent

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:08.330
orchestration framework and again so so the others uh other

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.250
frameworks so if i am going to use maybe a llama indexes or

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:14.750
maybe a length graph or maybe if i'm going to use a crew ai

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:17.770
i will be able to do a multi-agent orchestration and i

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:21.410
believe so far we have talked a lot about agent so now we

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:24.870
are pretty much clear that what is the meaning of a agent a

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:28.630
simple entity which can understand the elements and where i

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:32.330
will be able to attach my uh any kind of our models where i

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.930
will be able to attach a sport清s and other tools where i

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:37.930
will be able to attach our memories so basically this is

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:41.410
something called as agent so agent wise i believe we are

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.890
pretty much clear because since a very very long time we

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:48.690
have been talking about a agent itself right whether it's a

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:51.970
n8n or maybe whether it's a lang chain starting from a lang

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:55.650
chain class itself so we have been talking about a n8n now

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:59.790
so today what i will do so i'll try to show you this autogen

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:03.710
but with respect to an application because we are pretty

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:08.730
much clear with respect to a agentic approach right so agent

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:12.790
is nothing new for any one of us basically so right guys

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:17.510
everyone yeah anyone who thinks that you don't understand an

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:20.850
agent or something i believe we all understands agent and

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:22.550
everything right yeah

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:32.160
okay so basically like a agent is not at all new and we all

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.660
know that what is agent and what what is what it basically

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:41.220
like does right what it basically does so keeping that in

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.700
our mind so i'm not going to talk about like an agent or

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.380
something because i think since last like eight to ten

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.480
classes we are just talking about that uh quickly we can

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.700
jump into a autogen autogen is like i said another library

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:56.140
that's it right another library just like uh any library

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.700
that we have already used lang chain lang graph or maybe a

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:03.840
crew ai so just another library and uh i think we have

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.820
already done the installation of this autogen studio last

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:13.060
week right everyone yeah installation wise i believe we are

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:17.640
good autogen studio installation yes

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:23.910
so we okay fine everyone is saying yes okay so we have

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.530
already done the installation by the way uh with respect to

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:31.150
you know uh like a autogen studio again if i'll talk about

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:35.290
autogen studio the ui interface is not good because if you

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:38.230
will go through that you will be able to find out that uh

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:43.070
there are not much of like a node or you know uh end point

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:46.650
which they have given to us so every time what we have to do

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:50.350
so we have to create everything custom and again somewhere

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:54.030
it is not going to work in terms of creating a complex

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:57.590
workflow right obviously we have to pick and choose the

00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:00.470
approach so where we can go and we can write the code now

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:02.950
this is something that we are going to do uh in this class

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:05.990
we are going to pick and choose an approach where we are

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.550
going to write a code and with the help of code we are going

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:13.210
to automate it because again uh this studio is not that

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:16.750
great uh in in terms of bringing something into a production

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:19.870
plus yeah production wise so again you are going to face

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:23.030
another kind of a hurdle uh in terms of like a

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:26.770
productionizing this autogen studio basically so at the end

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:29.110
of the day you have to go ahead with the coding approach and

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:32.410
this is what we are going to see in my today's class so fine

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:33.870
uh everyone so let's get started so let's get started so

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:38.970
let's get started with the autogen right so autogen is like

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:43.970
i said uh let me do some sort of a search over here so

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:56.080
one is autogen studio and uh one is basically microsoft auto

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:59.920
gen like uh library wise so i can try to use in both the

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.960
mode and this is something that we have already done so we

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.980
have already done the installation of our autogen studio and

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.720
then we have already launched a autogen

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:14.100
studio so let me launch it once again so just open up any

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:19.480
cmd and then this step we have already done

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:33.280
those who have not done that so maybe you can do it now so

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:36.160
you just have to install and then you have to launch it

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:42.500
that's it yeah so i'll just ping you a command guys in your

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:48.840
chat fine so now autogen studio will be live over here and

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:53.060
uh with the help of this ui interface so maybe try to yeah

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:58.210
so maybe with the help of this ui interface i can try to uh

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:01.770
create basically a agent so here technically it's called as

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:05.290
a team right so i can try to build a team i can try to you

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:07.430
know build a different different kind of agent assistant

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:10.830
over here and i can try to you know attach a different

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:14.790
different kind of a tool by the way right so here we have a

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:18.450
team team is nothing but it's a orchestrator by the way and

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:20.730
which is going to invoke a different different different

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:22.950
different kind of a agent and in every agent there is a

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:23.550
different kind of agent and in every agent you will be able

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:27.490
to find out as per the definition of the agent so nothing

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:31.290
has basically changed even over here so you can try to give

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:34.370
an access of lm over here you can try to give an access of a

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:38.090
tool basically a function right so you can try to drop as

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:43.210
many tool as possible to one particular agent simple and

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:46.650
here so inside a particular team so you can try to drag and

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:50.430
drop multiple uh agents basically as you can see over here

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:52.830
right so we can try to drag and drop we can try to go and

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:55.890
create a multiple agent and we can try to attach a multiple

00:21:55.890 --> 00:22:01.070
agent with this one now so uh here i think i have already

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:04.370
given you a brief about this one so basically you can try to

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:09.390
uh like a create a team you can try to create a agents and

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:12.190
you can try to create a tools you can try to attach a model

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:16.250
and all of these some of the sample tools and agents and

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:18.930
teams all those things are given to us right we can try to

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:21.750
use a default one but yeah default one is just for the

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:25.210
experimentation nothing more than that i mean like uh just

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:28.430
for five to ten minute of demo or you can say eight minute

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:33.710
of demo uh right uh this is going to work uh but yeah beyond

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:37.450
this it is not going to work at all uh beyond this you will

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:40.950
have to like you know uh identify your use cases and as per

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:44.650
your use case you have to basically write a code for that

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:48.210
one right you have to write a code for that one uh because

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:51.870
uh it is it is not going to work as you can see right these

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:55.730
are just a more things which is like uh given to all of us

00:22:55.730 --> 00:23:01.290
now so this is okay this is completely fine uh basically so

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:04.850
we can try to create this uh team and we can try to you know

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:07.750
drag and drop and we can try to attach all of these uh

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:12.210
agents and its respective tool uh to any of this team and we

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:15.730
can try to run it we can try to test it right uh we can try

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:19.610
to download even a code if i want and eventually that code

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:23.390
is nothing but uh like a python code basically i can try to

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:26.690
download it and then i can try to even run it uh basically

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:31.810
in my like vscode or anywhere like any in any kind of a code

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:36.490
editor so this is one right this is one that you all will be

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:39.950
able to find out the other approach is a coding approach

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:44.770
right so we can try to start like creating things with just

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:49.790
a coding but nowadays the way this entire agentic things are

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:53.330
moving and again so everyone is trying to give you this open

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:56.950
ai launch right so agent kit builder that has been launched

00:23:56.950 --> 00:24:00.950
by open ai uh so everyone is and again crew ai i have

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:04.330
already shown you a crew a studio right uh we have seen a

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:08.650
n8n and again there is a platform called as jpn so the way

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:13.290
this entire agentic like a world is moving so everyone is

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:17.630
trying to give you not a coding based approach so everyone

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:21.130
is trying to give you a visual approach a visual builder

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:25.090
everyone is trying to give you uh n8n by default it's a

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:28.210
visual one they are trying to add one more layer so that you

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:31.230
know you can just go chat and then things will be built for

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:35.370
you uh if i'll talk about this autogen so yeah visually crew

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:38.690
ai so obviously they have also given you a crew a beta mode

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:42.250
of this uh visual builder and recently i have i have

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:44.850
received some sort of a newsletter i have already subscribed

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:46.830
to their newsletter so i have seen that that they have

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:49.730
released uh some new feature in their visual builder so

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:52.450
where you can just chat and then like many things you will

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:54.310
be able to do and then you do it without even writing a

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:57.070
single line of code or without even doing a drag and drop

00:24:57.070 --> 00:25:00.070
right so now people are even like moving beyond drag and

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:02.850
drop and they are trying to give you a feature so where you

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:06.490
will just like uh you know chat and then one by one one by

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:09.390
one all of these things will be uh built and you just have

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:12.770
to set the parameter for that one so maybe api key and all

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:16.170
the connection keys and auth you just have to uh set it up

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:21.270
so uh yeah uh people are like moving towards a visual

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:23.710
builder and then they will be able to do that but again so

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:27.990
in some of the cases you will have to do a coding uh you

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:31.330
will have to you know uh take care or you have to control

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:34.270
your entire thing so in that case obviously you have to

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:37.230
write a code and then only you will be able to build it for

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:41.850
example so recently uh not recently so my team was doing a

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:45.490
experimentation by the way and as a part of that

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:49.570
experimentation so basically my team has created this uh

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:52.590
whatsapp agent i don't know whether you have tested it or

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:56.170
not so maybe you can go to this number and then you can try

00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:58.910
to test it now yesterday we were talking about this in our

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:03.150
group as well so this is pure agentic one so this one and

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:06.530
this was just experimentation that we were doing right just

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:11.390
uh experimentation so this is not something that i have

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:13.950
released so far made an announcement so we were just doing

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:17.270
experimentation and as a part of this experimentation we

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:20.210
were like trying to understand that okay uh whether we

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:22.710
should go ahead with the you know visual approach whether we

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:23.250
should go ahead with the you know visual approach ahead with

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:25.990
the coding approach and then what will be the limitation

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:29.730
what will be the latency many more things right many more

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:33.050
things so we figured out that that uh in terms of like you

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:37.170
know building something visually right obviously it's easy

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:41.230
right obviously it's easy but again you will be having a

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:46.010
very very less control uh in terms of like optimization

00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:49.710
right in terms of optimization because someone has written

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:52.850
that node and you can't change a code for that particular

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:56.850
node the only thing that you can do is like you know uh like

00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:01.390
uh initiate the connectivity apart from that nothing is

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:04.170
under your control you you can't do it do anything

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:07.430
technically right so if i have to build something like this

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:11.230
one so where i can ask a question that uh you know tell me

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:16.910
about tell me about your own right and where it is supposed

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:20.010
to give me a response in a fraction of second as you can see

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:23.170
it is like it has started typing uh that by the the time I

00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:28.870
have like you know asked some question it is not going to

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:33.650
like you know work well with respect to a visual approach

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:35.930
right with respect to a visual approach and that's that's

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:38.570
the biggest problem right that's the biggest problem. So

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:43.130
here basically we have tried this one the URI AI inside this

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:47.370
WhatsApp because and why agentic is required one more thing

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:50.870
right so here we are not just we have not just integrated

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:54.850
some chat GPT kind of a model yeah that is there so that you

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:56.990
know it will be able to give you and give you all the

00:27:56.990 --> 00:28:02.170
answers but we have integrated a full database right. If you

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:07.350
are going to ask a question that what was a latest batch

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:12.690
launched what was the latest batch launched so obviously it

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:16.490
is supposed to go and check a Euron database and before that

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:20.210
it is supposed to decide right. So as you can see it is

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:22.710
telling me that. Okay the recent batch launch was basically

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:25.890
generative AI certification bootcamp 2.0 that is a recent

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:29.390
launch. So obviously it has to go to my databases first of

00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:32.790
all it has to decide that whether I should go like and query

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:36.490
some LLMs and give an answer or I should go into a database

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:39.830
and then query again database wise so we have so many tables

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.630
we have so many databases and again we have like a multiple

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:47.570
platform. So some time we are trying to store some data on a

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:50.210
Postgres sometime we are trying to store some data on a

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:54.450
MongoDB. Right so and many things right so many things it is

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:57.270
a complex architecture that we have in a back end if I will

00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:59.430
talk about a Euron back end because we have so many products

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:02.610
so it is supposed to decide take a decision so obviously it

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:05.290
is supposed to be agentic so what we have done so we have

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:09.210
created a multiple tools in a back end and then we have

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:12.770
given all the access but the major part which I am just

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:18.130
trying to talk about over here is that latency right. It is

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:22.210
not supposed to you know go and check. Maybe like a 30

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:25.410
second of time or maybe even a 15 second of time it is

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:30.410
supposed to give me a response immediately and that was not

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:35.270
very much like you know convenient in terms of building

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:39.130
something visually right in terms of building something

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:42.030
visually and that was the major problem right that was a

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:44.830
major problem and that is the reason so we have just coded

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:47.890
each and everything and yeah performance is literally very

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:50.790
good maybe you can try to test it right. And many people

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:54.690
have even tested now we are trying to you know attach even a

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:57.570
real time search feature in this one we are trying to even

00:29:57.570 --> 00:30:02.510
you know like attach basically a voice mode input so speech

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:05.310
to text and text to speech mode input also we are trying to

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:08.210
integrate and you can you can just talk to this one in your

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:11.630
own language it is completely fine so even if I am going to

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:16.010
ask the same question maybe in my own language or like it

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:19.450
will be able to understand right. So many things. Many

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:23.490
things is done but yeah just like I am telling you this

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:26.670
story because whenever someone is going to ask you a

00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:29.570
question in an interview that whether you are going to use a

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:33.750
visual builder or you are going to write a code so depends

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:37.370
upon my task let's suppose I am trying to run some sort of a

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:41.670
batch job every day right and I have a time latency is not a

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:44.810
bottleneck in that case obviously I can go ahead with maybe

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:49.190
a visual builder I can rely on a visual builder. Even when I

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:53.530
have to like automate a small processes where time is not a

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:57.370
constraint right the latency is not a constraint obviously I

00:30:57.370 --> 00:31:00.470
can go ahead with the visual builder but wherever I have a

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:03.990
constraint with respect to a latency a speed in terms of

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:07.070
giving output in terms of processing everything then

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:10.390
obviously I will always suggest to go ahead with the code

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:14.230
based approach right again you can you can even like you

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:17.370
know argue with me saying that that. Okay. So if I am going

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:20.950
with a visual builder maybe I can try to increase a size of

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:23.710
the instances means from the machine side from the hardware

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:26.690
side if I am going to maintain and manage this you know the

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:30.250
entire latency yeah you can do that but it will cost you a

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:32.710
lot right maybe your company your manager or your client

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:37.110
will not agree for that one in long term right and the major

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:40.530
part is we all look for the control. So if you are looking

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:43.870
for a control over a latency over the optimization then

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:46.910
coding based approach. Otherwise. Otherwise go ahead with

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:51.730
the visual based approach rest will be your decision at the

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:55.550
end of the day. Fine guys I think this is clear right

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:57.990
because everyone is coming up with the visual builder right

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:01.330
even autogen studio is having a visual builder in it and is

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:03.930
having a visual builder crew AI is having a visual builder

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:10.590
right even like you know this open AI agent kit so they came

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:15.530
up with the visual builder yeah this

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:21.350
doesn't give the real time data like I have. Okay. So what

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:24.130
is the temperature of Bangalore no I told you right so real

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:26.750
time integration real time Google search integration we have

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:29.670
not done in some time I think in one or two days it will be

00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:35.140
like added over there where to get a JSON for this WhatsApp

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:40.220
agent which one this one basically it is something which we

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.660
are creating as a product so it is not a part of your

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:47.520
lecture by the way yeah it is not a part of a lecture I am

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.460
just showing you like this is something that we have built

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:53.340
for you on. So. So it can be built for like you know

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:57.120
anything out there it's not the edit in automation by the

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:01.700
way we are not using anything over here okay now let's move

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:06.000
ahead. So today what we are going to do so we are going to

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.820
see a demo with respect to autogen and like I said so we are

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:13.340
going to use a coding based approach where we are going to

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:16.360
automate a report so as you can see yesterday I was testing

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:20.540
it out and yeah so basically I will be having a data. So

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:23.020
let's suppose I have a sales data and I have a marketing

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:27.400
data which is coming into my system on a regular basis and

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:31.060
my manager asked me and because we all know that that inside

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:35.080
an industry reporting is a crucial part and every team right

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:38.220
whether you are a part of sales team marketing team or even

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:42.120
a tech team so everywhere we used to create a massive

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:45.040
massive report every time we used to create a massive report

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:50.740
by the way now. So. So. So keeping that in a mind so I have

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:54.380
just automated this entire sales and marketing report with

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:58.460
the help of agents. So here what will happen every day at 9

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:00.780
o'clock this is what I have scheduled you can schedule it

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:03.540
for maybe like a four times a day five times a day or maybe

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:06.860
once in a week. So every time at 9 o'clock it is going to

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:10.340
send a report report over my mail I have already done the

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:12.940
real time integration of the mail. So whatever mail you are

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:16.100
going to configure it will send up that particular report to

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:20.480
that particular mail ID. And. So sales revenue by region a

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:24.680
quarterly sales performance and product distribution revenue

00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:28.480
wise and like a marketing performance and then conversion

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.540
marketing and then key highlight. So whatever I have

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:35.360
configured basically it is going to send those detail over a

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:39.460
mail not just over a mail. So I have even configured it for

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:47.390
a telegram. So if I have to show you this part yeah so

00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:59.930
basically I have done an integration with the telegram as

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:02.610
well so as you can see I am getting a report even over a

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:06.310
telegram same report whatever report I am sending the fun

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:10.270
part over here is that that I am not sending this particular

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:14.910
response over a telegram to a bot. So basically I am sending

00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:18.710
to a particular number right or you can say a particular

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:21.790
user. So in telegram you will be able to find out two

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:26.210
different things. So one interacting with the bot and in my

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:29.030
last class in my previous classes so we have interacted with

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:33.150
the bot by the way. But in today's class so what we are

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:36.170
going to do so we are going to send this one to some

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:39.310
numbers. So you will be able to send to any numbers and in

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:41.990
real life obviously if I am sending a report so obviously I

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:44.670
cannot send a report to a bot it will be having no meaning.

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:48.730
So I have to send a report to my manager or to someone so

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:52.970
who will be like having a complete authorization for this

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:56.090
particular report and who can use this report by the way. So

00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:58.890
this is something that we are going to do. With the help of

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:03.790
autogen you can you can try to create this entire report you

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:07.210
can do it all of these things even by using any other

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:10.230
agentic framework that's completely okay right that's

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:13.190
completely okay but yeah so we will try to do it with the

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:17.170
help of agent. So let me go ahead and let me design this

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:19.970
entire flow that what we will be doing.

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:31.230
Hope the idea is clear right everyone yeah that what we are

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:32.650
going to do and

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:47.910
one more thing. So we most of the time we talk about like

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:51.050
agentic and all those things but in real time you will be

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:55.330
able to find out that everywhere agentic is not required. So

00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:58.890
in mostly like a 70 to 80 percent of the cases without even

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:03.490
using agentic I can automate the things and in real time

00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:08.110
basically. So whenever you are trying to pick and choose

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:10.310
that whether I should go ahead with the agentic approach or

00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:13.110
whether I should go ahead with the non agentic approach I

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:16.050
think you should be. We all should take a decision wisely

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:19.250
right everything is not supposed to be like you know agentic

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:22.650
agentic simply means that that wherever I would like to like

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:25.650
you know take a decision I would just wanted to give a

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:28.310
decision-making capability to some LLMs and where I am

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:32.030
interacting with the NLP natural language by the way yeah so

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:34.850
only in that cases we have to like you know introduce a

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:40.130
agentic. So here let me design this part so what we are

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:43.870
going to do so we have two funnels one is basically a

00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:48.910
marketing funnel. And let us suppose we have a sales funnel

00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:52.630
so we have sales funnel yeah

00:37:57.110 --> 00:38:00.690
so we have marketing funnel and we have a sales funnel. Now

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:04.410
what we will try to do so we will try to take a data as of

00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:08.330
now I am trying to keep a data into a JSON file format and I

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:12.970
have basically a thousand record inside this marketing and I

00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:16.090
have a thousand record for a sales but yeah in a real time

00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:18.370
obviously your data will come from the variety of the

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:21.750
sources. Maybe every day you are doing some sort of a sales

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:25.870
team is trying to update those sales into some of the tools

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:29.450
or maybe some of the ERP solution or maybe somewhere right

00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:32.810
or maybe some CRM right or maybe in some lead management

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:36.810
tool so maybe you are trying to store all of these data. If

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:40.150
I am talking about like if I am going to talk about the

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:42.170
small companies so maybe they are storing all those data

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:45.930
into some drive or maybe in some local system. So as of now

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:48.690
I am keeping all of this data in my local system. You can

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:51.510
try to integrate this data with any kind of a DB. I believe

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:54.590
we all know how to integrate with any kind of a data basis.

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:58.970
So we will be having two different different data like I

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:05.650
said so one is marketing one is sales and we are going to

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:11.630
basically pull these data and we are going to basically like

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:15.530
store this entire data set into a chroma DB let's suppose or

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:20.350
you can say we are going to vectorize this data. So in a

00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:24.870
vector database we are going to store all of these data set.

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:42.260
So sales data and this like marketing data so both will go

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:45.320
into some vector databases. I am trying to use a agentic

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.620
approach along with that so I am trying to use even a RAG

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:51.660
approach a retrieval augmented generation kind of approach

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:55.780
so that you know I will be able to build a AI so which will

00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:59.800
be aware about the context right which will be because I am

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:03.020
going to give instruction and like a natural language and it

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:07.120
can go to the RAG database or it can do a RAG and

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.700
technically to do RAG it has to go into a vector databases

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:14.100
and it has to like a fire some sort of a query over there.

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.560
So I am going to dump all of these data into a vector

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:19.160
databases vector database wise I can use any of these

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.660
databases that we have already discussed in a past I am

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:24.860
going to use a chroma DB chroma in a local you can try to

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:27.540
even make it like a global if you want because we all know

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:30.880
that. Chroma DB is having a like you know they are giving

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:35.640
you like a self-hosted basically like a chroma instances so

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:39.800
I will try to like a send this data into a vector DB and to

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:43.120
send this data into a vector DB so obviously I have to use

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:50.020
some of the LLM for a embedding so yes I will be using LLM

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:55.720
for a embedding over here which is going to help me out to

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:59.300
vectorize the entire data set. So this is something which I

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:03.560
will be using with respect to the vector DB. Now once data

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:08.400
is available over here I am going to build a multiple agents

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:12.080
over here I am going to basically build up multiple agents

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:16.000
now what kind of an agent I am going to build so this is

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.480
this is just a data storage now so how my entire system is

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:22.600
going to flow how my entire system is going to work so let's

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:27.660
suppose I am going to ask a question that give me. Give me a

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:31.200
marketing report right for maybe last one month or one day

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:34.460
or one week or something like that all of my data set is

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:37.740
available inside the vector databases let's suppose so

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:40.600
everything everything inside the system is going to start

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:43.360
with the query so let's suppose I am going to ask a query

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:47.540
that here try to give me the report for maybe last couple of

00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:52.000
days okay so what will happen with respect to a query. So

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.960
query will go to a RAG system right it will go through RAG

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:58.680
system and when I say it will go through a RAG system simply

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:03.380
means what so query will try to fire itself on a vector

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:06.560
database and then it is going to do a like a relevant

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:10.520
relevancy search and then it is going to bring all of those

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:13.680
data based on maybe a cosine similarity or maybe some other

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:16.900
approaches but yeah this is what it is going to happen so

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:27.600
query will simply go inside my vector DB. And it is going to

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:31.300
do some sort of a search operation by the way so

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:39.730
query will be fired here it will go to vector databases and

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:43.170
then from vector databases I will be able to fetch basically

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:49.390
a top end record okay fine

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:03.070
I will be able to fetch basically a top end record now once

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:07.530
I will be able to fetch this top end record as per my query

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:12.130
right so then I am going to. Give this entire top end record

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:15.870
to my agents agents which I am going to create with the help

00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:20.350
of autogen yeah so what are the kind of agent I will be

00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:24.250
having so I will be having like a different different kind

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:27.230
of agent the very first agent which I will be having maybe a

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:32.010
data analyst agent so here top end record and it will go to

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:34.070
my agent number one you can say

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:44.480
agent number one and this agent number one is technically a

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:47.700
data analyst agent. So it will go to my agent number one.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.220
And this agent is going to basically do a data analysis

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:56.340
means so whatever data that we have retrieved means top end

00:43:56.340 --> 00:44:00.120
record that we have retrieved so basically based on my

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:02.820
instruction which I have given so it is going to calculate

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:06.200
all that KPIs a key performance indicator because key

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:09.100
performance indicator will be a part of any kind of a report

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:12.640
from a business side so it is going to like a calculate all

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:16.040
the metric says it is going to calculate all. The KPIs. and

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:19.160
it is going to understand the trend over there, it is going

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:22.580
to understand the pattern, it is going to understand who was

00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:26.940
the top performer in terms of marketing and it is going to

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:30.740
technically give me a data driven insights. This is what any

00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:34.080
data analyst does in any companies by the way. So it will

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:38.160
take a top end record and it will go to my agent number one

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:42.740
and once agent number 1 is technically a data analyst agent,

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:46.980
once this agent will be able to analyze a data and analysis

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:52.380
of data wise I have already mentioned. So what and all task

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:55.280
it will do. So analyze

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:07.000
retrieved data, this is a first task, second task may be

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:13.460
calculate the metrics and KPI. Then

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:33.840
may be it is going to do something like identify the trend

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:36.100
in data and

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:49.900
then provide a data driven insights.

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:55.760
So these are the tasks technically this particular agent is

00:45:55.760 --> 00:46:00.240
going to perform for me, agent number 1. All of these tasks

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:03.960
will be done by this particular agent. Agent number

00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:11.610
1 which is nothing but a data analysis agent. Now once agent

00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:14.530
number 1 will be able to finish its job, it is going to

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:16.990
perform all of these operation as per my instruction which I

00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:21.010
am going to feed or I can say I can code inside my like this

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:25.550
one inside my entire system. So then it will go to agent

00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:31.890
number 2. So from here things will flow to agent number 2 as

00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:36.850
I am trying to build a multi agent scenario agent number 2.

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:47.570
Now what agent number 2 will do. So whatever agent number 1

00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:51.650
is able to finish or whatever agent number 1 is able to do

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:56.050
it. So agent number 2 is going to extend that particular

00:46:56.050 --> 00:46:59.230
job. So basically agent number 2 will behave as a report

00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:02.670
writer. So it is able to analyze, it is able to do all the

00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:07.070
KPIs and everything. So here whatever agent number 1 is able

00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:10.370
to accomplish simple it will go inside the agent number 2.

00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:13.550
Just like any. So this is another agentic system or chain

00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:16.490
based agentic system. So one output will go as an input

00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:22.130
inside the another one. And then this particular agent is

00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:26.130
going to perform a different different task. So first of all

00:47:26.130 --> 00:47:27.630
take and

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:37.800
list findings as an input obviously. It is going to

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:48.210
consider. Now after that so create a professional report.

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.380
Structure then

00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:08.720
write a executive

00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:15.030
summary and

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:33.660
then format with clean and clear outcome. And then provide

00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:36.140
some sort of a recommendation if recommendations are

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:42.700
required. Provide recommendation. So this is something.

00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:46.220
Which will be done by my agent number 2 at the end of the

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:46.460
day.

00:48:57.550 --> 00:49:01.230
Agent number 2. So it will be able to create a report

00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:06.450
finally for me based on the agent number 1 finding. And then

00:49:06.450 --> 00:49:11.370
it is going to send this entire findings and whatever

00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:14.890
summary that it has created to my visualization engine

00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:19.730
basically. So it is going to send this entire output. There

00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:21.870
will be agent number 3 or you can say there will be an

00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:25.450
orchestrator agent which is going to manage both of these

00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:27.750
agents. So there is something called as user proxy inside

00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:32.650
autogen. So which actually behaves as a you know or controls

00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:36.470
the agent internally. So now from here my flow will go to

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:40.050
where. So my flow will go to technically a

00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:47.520
visualization engine. Because I'm trying to like you know

00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:51.640
send each and everything not just as a raw data. Yeah. I'm

00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:54.120
just trying to send all of these things as a visualization

00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:57.820
if you will go and check my mail. That I have like a created

00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:00.960
this one. So I'm trying to create a visualization not just

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:04.980
that. So I'm trying to even attach a report in write ups

00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:08.620
right. So that anyone if my manager would like to you know

00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:12.120
see the analysis of my sales report or maybe my marketing

00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:16.380
report right. So he or she will be able to read this entire

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:19.900
report as well which has been actually created by my agent

00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:24.020
as you can see. And yeah. So even executive summary and

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:26.780
recommendation as you can see. Insights are also available.

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:30.160
Insights and trends are also available. So whatever like

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:33.360
things which I have like given to my agent. Agent is just

00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:36.280
trying to perform as it is. So I'm trying to create a

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:38.700
summary. I'm trying to create a visualization not to do a

00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:41.900
visualization. So I'm using a graph library matplotly by the

00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:46.920
way and yeah. So it will send this entire data to the

00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:50.560
visualization engine because I have to basically send this

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:54.120
visualized graph to my manager. That was the requirement.

00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:57.100
Generally. Generally this is what we do in terms of creating

00:50:57.100 --> 00:51:02.100
the reports. So fine from here it will go to the

00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:05.020
visualization engine. It will try to visualize each and

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:08.820
everything and once data will pass through my visualization

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:12.200
engine. So then what we are trying to do. So we are trying

00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:20.700
to send this data in two places. I can send this data to

00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:26.660
multiple places. So one is a mail. And another one is a

00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:32.180
personal telegram. My manager's telegram let's suppose

00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:37.440
personal telegram. I can send it to maybe in other channels

00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:39.900
maybe like let's suppose my manager is asking for a report

00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:43.360
over a slack or maybe over some different system. So I can

00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:48.060
simply send those report anywhere I want. Maybe over a

00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:50.920
WhatsApp if my manager is looking for a report I can send it

00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:52.000
even over there.

00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:59.990
So from visualization engine it will go here and it will go

00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:06.070
technically here simple. So this is overall flow that we are

00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:08.870
going to create. But yeah there will be a lot which is going

00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:13.570
to happen in between all of these processes. Now what we are

00:52:13.570 --> 00:52:17.710
trying to do. So now we are going to take this entire system

00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:21.030
right. We are going to basically take this entire system.

00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:26.590
And. We. Are going to wrap it up with the scheduler. This

00:52:26.590 --> 00:52:29.670
entire system right. And we are going to wrap up this entire

00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:35.110
system with respect to a scheduler. So that every day my

00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:38.570
report will go or my report should you know it should

00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:41.410
generate the entire report as per the data that we are going

00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:45.110
to receive and automatically it should send a report. I am

00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:48.890
not supposed to sit and watch basically right. I am not

00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:51.770
supposed to sit and watch. So basically it's a trigger

00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:55.070
right. We have already created a lot of triggers in case of

00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:58.630
a init end. So same thing we are going to do over here. I'm

00:52:58.630 --> 00:53:01.470
not even supposed to you know go and chat with this system

00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:04.430
every day. Yeah that is the option which I can give to my

00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:07.390
manager that okay if you are looking for more insights more

00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:11.250
data. So take this like a chat system and then maybe you can

00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:14.850
chat. But my manager let's suppose is not interested at all

00:53:14.850 --> 00:53:18.110
in terms of you know chat system. My manager simply said

00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:22.450
that that okay I want this 10 matrixes simple. And this is

00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:23.370
what I am going to do. This is what happens across the

00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:28.410
industry right. So I just want my 10 matrixes and give it to

00:53:28.410 --> 00:53:31.370
me and every stakeholder will be having their own matrixes.

00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:34.230
So a stakeholder will come and say that okay fine so I just

00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:38.030
want these many matrixes. Give it to me and I'm done. If I

00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:40.650
have to give a chat option obviously I can give a chat

00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:42.990
option because I have a data inside the vector DV and

00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:46.930
obviously like I can just attach agents over here which will

00:53:46.930 --> 00:53:49.430
be able to go fetch the data summarize it and then

00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:52.470
eventually it will be able to give. But no. I am not giving

00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:56.750
a chat option in this one although that is the option. So

00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:59.710
here scheduler.

00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:03.230
So basically I am going to wrap up this entire things with

00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:08.050
respect to the scheduler. So that at a particular time every

00:54:08.050 --> 00:54:12.690
day it will try to fire itself and I will be able to get a

00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:16.330
report at 9 o'clock let's suppose in my mail as well as

00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:18.790
inside my telegram. So that if I am going for a meeting I

00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:21.830
will be ready for that. Yeah. So this is the entire flow

00:54:21.830 --> 00:54:24.390
guys. Thank you. So basically we are going to orchestrate

00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:27.890
each and everything under a scheduler finally. And these two

00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:30.670
agents which I was talking about. So this is something that

00:54:30.670 --> 00:54:34.270
we are going to create it with the help of auto gen library.

00:54:34.930 --> 00:54:38.190
Like I said auto gen is not the only library. Maybe you can

00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:40.710
try to use some other libraries and you can try to create

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:46.580
it. It's up to you. Can we create an agent which will give a

00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:49.340
fetch record from Jira and submit the report. Yeah you can

00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:52.360
you can connect with any system even Jira gives you you know

00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:56.260
so creating any connection is nothing. But. You can say a

00:54:56.260 --> 00:55:00.800
glorified HTTPS request simple. So even in any other

00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:04.780
platform. So basically what you do so basically they have

00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:07.480
given you a node and technically what that node is doing

00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:12.940
HTTPS request right. So connecting with any system in this

00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:17.680
entire world is technically a glorified HTTPS request if you

00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:18.880
are doing it in terms of a node.

00:55:21.830 --> 00:55:25.410
Yeah. So any system is literally any system whether it's a

00:55:25.410 --> 00:55:27.770
service now whether it's a GUI or a Jira whether it's your

00:55:27.770 --> 00:55:32.130
slack right you can connect back and forth in two way right

00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:35.210
with every system every system is literally every system

00:55:35.210 --> 00:55:38.490
because they have given wherever they have given you an API

00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:45.930
you can connect it as simple as that. OK so hope this idea

00:55:45.930 --> 00:55:48.150
is clear what we are going to see what we are going to do.

00:55:48.370 --> 00:55:52.670
Yeah so this system this is something that we are going to

00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:58.410
like see it so here I have already created this project. Let

00:55:58.410 --> 00:56:02.290
me like run this project. So I'm just going to like execute

00:56:02.290 --> 00:56:07.590
this project from my command prompt. I'm just like going to

00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:10.910
call now. So now means basically it will send now otherwise

00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:15.930
it will like go for a scheduling and you will be able to and

00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:18.310
I'm logging everything I'm logging everything means I'm

00:56:18.310 --> 00:56:21.950
logging even like what agent is doing how agent is trying to

00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:24.470
make a decision each and everything I'm going to log. But

00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:27.210
I'm just going to run this project and then I. I would like

00:56:27.210 --> 00:56:32.310
to show you then I'll go ahead with the this one I'll just

00:56:32.310 --> 00:56:35.250
go ahead with the code like a description.

00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:47.650
So just wait it generally takes 2 to 3 minute of time to you

00:56:47.650 --> 00:56:50.710
know finalize the entire process because it's a 2000 record

00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:54.210
which I am processing so 1000 from a sales and 1000 from a

00:56:54.210 --> 00:56:55.850
marketing basically.

00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:16.420
Sir could you read out consider we are like fetch data from

00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:19.100
the Atlassian confluence it is a good approach to fetch

00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:23.760
directly. Or do we need to use MCP server. See MCP is

00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:26.960
nothing but again another kind of a protocol right. Just

00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:31.300
like a HTTPS request HTTPS is also like a breast that we try

00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:35.140
to do. So again that is also a one of the protocol which is

00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:38.400
going to provide you a flexibility in terms of exposing your

00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:42.120
entire system to the outer world MCP is just like that. So

00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:44.760
it's not like you should go ahead with MCP because someone

00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:48.800
told you or maybe someone has glorified that. Okay. Go ahead

00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:51.320
with the MCP or everyone is talking about it. I don't think

00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:54.580
that that's a good approach right. Whatever convenient for

00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:58.140
you just go with that yeah obviously with the help of MCP

00:57:58.140 --> 00:58:02.000
you can do it because all I am going to teach you I think by

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:05.540
next week itself we will be having a discussion on MCP and

00:58:05.540 --> 00:58:10.200
you will be able to see that it's not very different right.

00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:13.800
It's not just a protocol we are exposing our own system to

00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:18.160
some other system. That's it. That's it. So now as you can

00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:22.200
see yeah I have received the mail yes see I have received

00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:25.940
the mail based on my data set so it has created a beautiful

00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:30.400
report for me and it has sent me a mail just now. Now it

00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:37.500
will try to send even a report to my telegram right. So yeah

00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:40.760
as you can see I have received a report on my telegram as

00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:44.540
well it's a 9.58 a.m. and all of these reports are available

00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:48.660
in my post. This is a personal DM basically right. So in my

00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:51.760
DM on my number so it is sending me the report. So finally

00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:55.120
this is something that system will do on a daily basis. Now

00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:58.820
whatever kind of a report whatever kind of a matrix is I am

00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:02.600
looking for it will be done by system. So technically it's a

00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:07.240
full scale report automation that I am talking about right.

00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:10.920
A full scale report automation any kind of a report means

00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:14.000
any kind of a report maybe some manager is asking you this

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.600
that matrix. Some other manager is asking you this that

00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:20.540
matrixes that's okay. It's fine as per my like a

00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:25.160
stakeholders I'll try to just like you know give a direction

00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:28.680
to my agents. My agent will do that and then I can go and

00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:31.480
configure that okay send this report to this email id send

00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:34.260
this report to that email id maybe that telegram this

00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:39.520
whatsapp that slack whatever right or maybe a teams. So and

00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:42.940
this is something which we all are using it. So I'm showing

00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:44.780
you with respect to marketing data. Marketing data and sales

00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:49.280
data but this is something which every team are going to do

00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:52.260
because every team needs a report right. This is what we try

00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:56.100
to discuss in a morning call or maybe in a stakeholders call

00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:58.880
right and in every meeting right every day you must be

00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:01.660
having a meetings you will be having a performance report

01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:05.780
even HR right even finance. So every every team even a tech

01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:08.780
team right that okay so how many like a ticket has been

01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:13.280
raised and what was the p1 what was how many p0. How many we

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:17.400
were able to resolve. Or basically how many feature we have

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:20.040
released or we are going to release each and everything we

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:22.820
try to do it right. So basically I have made this entire

01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:27.320
process agentic I'm using autogen library but like I said I

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:33.540
can use any libraries over here to do this agents and you

01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:37.260
know I can do the exact same thing. So it's not going to

01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:40.620
make like a much of differences but yeah as I have to teach

01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:44.040
like autogen in your class. So I have said that okay fine.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:47.920
So let's build this entire application by using a autogen

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:51.880
basically. So now line by line I'm not going to write a code

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:55.940
because it's a very big code base to make it working. So you

01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:59.500
know I had to struggle a lot with respect to technically

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:05.000
like a lot of installation and lot of code. So let's open up

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.100
a vs code and file by will move file by file not line by

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:13.420
line. So here what I will do. I'll just go. I'll try to

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:19.490
create a directory because we have taken a lot of classes

01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:23.550
and I believe we are very much comfortable with the lindy

01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:32.290
codes. So here autogen Microsoft report generator

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:37.940
agent. So this is the name of the folder which I'm going to

01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:45.280
give. Yeah now first of all let's go ahead and let's try to

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:47.000
create a requirements.txt file.

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:58.860
rdquirements.txt and let's try to keep all the requirements

01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:00.440
in one single place.

01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:16.260
So these are library. So I'm going to use basically a

01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:19.820
autogen over here. It's a pyautogen. So pythonic version of

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:22.220
this autogen is simply called as pyautogen which is

01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:26.140
available inside a pypi library. I'm going to use the openai

01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:29.600
basically key over here. You can try to use. URI key as well

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:33.000
as both are completely fine. At the end of the day I need an

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.320
LLM. So I'm just using one over here. And rest of these

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:40.780
libraries are just simple like library that we try to use

01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:44.160
anywhere to build any kind of a system. So this is my

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:49.540
requirement.txt file rdquirements.txt spelling is correct.

01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:56.380
And let me do one thing. So let me try to create a new

01:02:56.380 --> 01:03:00.380
environment over here. So maybe I can try to create conda

01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:03.160
create or I can use even a python to create a new

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:08.580
environment. conda create hyphen n autogen here.

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:35.860
So after creating this one, so maybe I can try to do pip

01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:40.180
install hyphen r requirements.txt.

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:04.000
I'll share the code. Don't worry. So the entire code base

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.460
will be shared with all of you. Just just try to see over

01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:09.920
here, just try to understand the entire flow and then I will

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:13.300
be sharing the entire code base. And you will be able to run

01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:16.580
it just by like changing your credentials. So don't have to

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:19.180
do anything. You just have to like change the credential and

01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:23.620
it will work in your system. And even you can try to bring

01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:27.860
those things to our deployment. And you can try to, you

01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:31.280
know, schedule it like every day nine o'clock or 10 o'clock

01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:35.980
send me this report and bind it with the data. I just failed

01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:39.000
to build an installation for this one matplotlib. Okay.

01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:45.620
We'll try to check. What is the python version? So 3.12.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:49.940
That's okay. Okay. So here we have a requirement.txt file.

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:55.920
And then let's try to create one folder called as data

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:56.280
folder,

01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:02.820
requirement.txt. Let me send you this code.

01:05:06.930 --> 01:05:10.750
Then there is a data folder. Now inside data folder, I'm

01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:14.570
going to keep two files. But in ideal situations, obviously

01:05:14.570 --> 01:05:19.290
you have to basically like, you know, I'm going to create

01:05:19.290 --> 01:05:22.290
connectivity with the databases or from wherever you are

01:05:22.290 --> 01:05:24.290
fetching the data. Maybe you are fetching a data from a

01:05:24.290 --> 01:05:27.970
Jira, maybe from some other system. So we are, you have to

01:05:27.970 --> 01:05:31.610
create the connectivity, which is eventually possible. So

01:05:31.610 --> 01:05:34.530
here we have a marketing data and it's a thousand record. So

01:05:34.530 --> 01:05:36.890
it's a big, big data set, which I'm considering. I'm not

01:05:36.890 --> 01:05:40.250
considering like a, you know, a small data set by the way.

01:05:40.330 --> 01:05:44.230
Right. And again, for a sale. So I have created a thousand

01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:48.210
record data. So, which is again. Again, a big one. So we

01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:51.070
have two data set. Now instead of using this two data set, I

01:05:51.070 --> 01:05:52.810
can try to connect with the two different different

01:05:52.810 --> 01:05:56.630
databases. Maybe any, any databases or maybe any other

01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:59.390
system. So this is the folder where I'm keeping the data.

01:06:00.670 --> 01:06:04.890
Now what we are going to do. So now we are going to

01:06:04.890 --> 01:06:13.650
basically create a file called as maybe like agent.py file.

01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:19.350
Now this is where you have to understand. Okay. It's going

01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:22.630
to

01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:26.970
say, well, let me just create the agent. Let's create a code

01:06:26.970 --> 01:06:29.010
base with this code base. So what do we want to do here? So

01:06:29.010 --> 01:06:33.430
let's say we want to create a new code

01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:35.390
base and I am going to say, you know,

01:06:38.330 --> 01:06:39.670
let's say N Hoch and let's say, let's say a code base and

01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:43.730
let's say a, a nucleic acid case. These two things go

01:06:43.730 --> 01:06:46.790
together. This is perfectly fine. agents and technically

01:06:46.790 --> 01:06:50.670
agent is nothing but entity which will be having LLM access.

01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:54.050
So here first of all a very first function which I have

01:06:54.050 --> 01:06:57.530
created and as you can see this is not a like a fancy

01:06:57.530 --> 01:07:00.410
functions basically. So this is the function which is going

01:07:00.410 --> 01:07:05.390
to take an access of a LLM and LLM wise I am trying to

01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:08.350
provide a GPT-40 mini I can try to provide any other LLM

01:07:08.350 --> 01:07:12.130
that is completely ok and here is my configuration for the

01:07:12.130 --> 01:07:15.750
LLM. So technically this function is going to return the LLM

01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:18.830
configuration and this LLM I will be using inside my agent

01:07:18.830 --> 01:07:22.690
because this is what my agent needs and if you remember even

01:07:22.690 --> 01:07:25.230
from an innate end so whenever we try to create an agent

01:07:25.230 --> 01:07:29.890
node it requires LLMs, it requires memory and it requires a

01:07:29.890 --> 01:07:35.370
tool. Memory and tool is optional but LLM is mandatory right

01:07:35.370 --> 01:07:38.590
because that is a super power of this agents right because

01:07:38.590 --> 01:07:41.890
without LLMs they cannot do anything right tool is fine if

01:07:41.890 --> 01:07:42.670
you are not going to provide LLMs. If you are not going to

01:07:42.670 --> 01:07:46.150
provide a tools it will try to use LLMs over there if you

01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:48.710
are not going to provide a memory again it is completely ok

01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:51.870
but if you are not going to provide LLMs it is not ok. So

01:07:51.870 --> 01:07:56.650
here we are providing the LLM. Now as I have mentioned

01:07:56.650 --> 01:08:02.520
inside my design that I will be having agent first let's

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:05.360
talk about these two agents right these two agents. So I

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:07.940
will be having a first agent and I will be having a second

01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:12.420
agent. So first agent who will behave as a data analyst. So

01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:14.800
this is the function. I have created a very very simple

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:20.220
function and I am saying that system message wise I am

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:22.980
giving instruction that you are a senior data analyst

01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:26.620
specialized in a sales and marketing analytics. So what is

01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:28.660
your responsibility? So your responsibility is to analyze

01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:31.540
sales and marketing data provided to you. So whatever data

01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:34.160
which I am going to fetch from the database or may be from

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:38.620
my vector dv. So analyze those data, identify trend pattern

01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:42.940
and anomalies, calculate a key matrixes and KPIs. Provide a

01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:46.960
data driven insights. Be precise analytical in your finding

01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:51.480
and you receive a context from a RG system containing the

01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:56.780
real sales and marketing data based all your analysis on

01:08:56.780 --> 01:09:01.320
this retrieved context. So this is the simple messages and I

01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:04.020
believe nothing new for us every time whenever we are trying

01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:07.980
to create the agent we try to provide the system message

01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:11.440
that ok this is something that you have to do. You can try

01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:13.940
to elaborate this message if you are not getting a proper

01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:18.340
responses that is completely ok but yeah. Now where my

01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:22.300
autogen will come into a picture. So only this place only

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:26.240
this much of code is required for autogen. Autogen dot

01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:31.080
assistant agent as simple as that. So this is where we are

01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:35.760
using a library. So assistant agent name is what a data

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:40.720
analyst system message is what this message because so this

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:45.100
is the piece of the code which is going to create an agent

01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:50.280
for me. So here agent name I have given yeah here agent

01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:54.240
message I have given and here I am giving a LLM that's it.

01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:57.460
Is it making sense guys how to build an agent inside autogen

01:09:57.460 --> 01:10:01.680
and I think it's it's pretty much easy right for any one of

01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:05.980
us yeah. So it's not a big deal. Same thing we have done in

01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:08.580
crew AI. So what what we were doing. So we were building a

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:12.200
small small team. In terms of crew and at the end of the day

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:16.060
any agent we are going to build it needs a message it needs

01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:20.940
a LLM it needs a tool calling or maybe like you know name or

01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:24.920
something. So it's it's so agentic concept is same

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:27.240
everywhere doesn't matter which framework you are going to

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:30.780
use. I mean like philosophy is not going to change. This is

01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:33.940
what I am trying to tell you. So only one line actually it's

01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:36.900
a one line only right which I have written in three or four

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:39.780
lines but yeah technically it's a one line. Autogen dot

01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:43.640
assistant agent and then my work will be done. Now same

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:46.560
thing if I am going to do it even with respect to a UI

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:51.540
interface where is the autogen UI interface. Yeah. So

01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:55.000
assistant agent right as you can see over here assistant

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.960
agent basically this is a prebuilt agent. I can try to go

01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:02.980
and I can try to create my own new agent as well right. So I

01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:05.880
can go I can create a new team and then you know inside the

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:10.400
team I can try to create the. As many agents as I want. So

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:15.340
just like this right just like this I'm trying to create it

01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:21.500
over here. Yeah so this is the only piece of the code. So

01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:23.840
either I can do it with the help of drag and drop or maybe

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:26.920
with the help of this piece of the code and this is the only

01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:28.960
place where autogen comes into picture. So simplest

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:31.840
implementation I'm trying to show you guys. So this is one

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:36.100
of my like you know agent which I have created analyst

01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:38.980
agent. It is going to return this function. So whenever I am

01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:41.780
going to call this function technically it is returning what

01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:44.620
an agent analyst agent. This is what I am trying to return.

01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:47.980
Then the second agent agent number two as per my diagram

01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:52.600
agent number two. So it will just like take all the data and

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:56.080
then it will try to finalize the report. Now what I have

01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:59.260
written as a system is this one that you are a professional

01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:02.400
report writer. So this is basically my writer agent is

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:04.780
specialized in a business reporting. What is your

01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:06.760
responsibility? So take analytic finding from the

01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:09.200
comprehensive report means whatever my agent number one is

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:12.700
going to give you take that one and a structure report with

01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:15.260
the clear section is to give you somebody key findings. I

01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:18.600
believe this is what it is doing right. So executive summary

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:21.520
key findings everything everything it is trying to do it as

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:25.120
per the instruction. If not I will change my prompt because

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:30.440
we all know that that in case of agent majority of times the

01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:34.240
game is all about prompting. Yeah. So if I have written a

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:38.020
clear instruction. Then my system is going to behave in that

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:40.860
particular manner a structure report with a clear section is

01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:43.560
to give you somebody key finding right in a professional and

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:47.380
a clear and engaging manner provide a actionable

01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:50.300
recommendation format a report properly with the bullet

01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:54.280
points and sections. So okay fine. This is what eventually

01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:57.940
it will do and I believe it is doing it. So when it is like

01:12:57.940 --> 01:13:00.820
you know trying to create this entire report. So yeah bullet

01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:03.640
point comprehensive way. It is trying to like take the

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:08.060
insights. Everything everything as per my mentions as per my

01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:15.140
prompt. It is trying to do it for me. So okay again this is

01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:19.240
my agent number two only one line right. So I have given

01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:23.140
agent name. I have given a system message this one and I

01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:27.380
have given the LLM simple right. So this is going to return

01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:30.940
this function is going to return my writer agent and as you

01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:34.020
can see it is not different right. So. So like I can in this

01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:37.840
way I can create hundreds of agent I want as simple as that.

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:42.040
Then what we are trying to do. So basically we are trying to

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:46.040
create a user proxy agent. Now what this does by the way in

01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:49.120
case of auto gen. So basically they have given you this

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:53.140
function. So which is going to orchestrate the agents means

01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:57.500
I have to call these two like you know agents right. So

01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:00.540
basically how I would like to call which one will be called

01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:03.060
first second and all these things. So basically this is

01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:05.680
going to help me out in terms of doing that orchestration.

01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:10.040
So auto gen dot user proxy agent name I have given user

01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:14.380
proxy human input never basically auto reply consecutive

01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:18.300
auto reply is equal to zero code is false default auto reply

01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:22.220
is equals to null. So this is basically another proxy agent

01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:27.040
which I am going to create example. So this this is my third

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:29.760
agent I told you right when I was trying to create this

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:32.160
diagram technically. So technically we have three agents. So

01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:34.900
one agent which is going to call these two agents right.

01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:38.460
This is something that we have and even if you will try to

01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:42.020
follow along over here. So you can say that this is a proxy

01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:44.080
like that we are trying to create so that you know it will

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:47.580
be able to call my different different agent as per the

01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:54.320
need. So here like what we are doing so we are writing a

01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:57.240
function generate report with the auto gen multi agent. It

01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:00.340
will take a query right. It will take a query. It will take

01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:04.900
like a report type and it is going to give me the number of

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:08.000
result means number of data it is going to fetch. So here if

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.820
report type is sales see everything will work in auto

01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:15.360
trigger mode right. But yeah even in case of auto trigger so

01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:18.100
I have to define each and everything right. So if report

01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:22.000
type is sales right. So what it will do so it will try to

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.860
call basically retrieve sales data. So first of all it will

01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:28.600
retrieve the data right. Technically a context. If report

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:32.340
type is marketing. So it will try to retrieve marketing data

01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:37.820
and if like otherwise it will retrieve the combined data. So

01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:40.100
first of all what this function is trying to do. So

01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:43.940
basically this function is trying to retrieve the data and

01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:47.100
then here. So we are trying to create an object of you can

01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:50.640
say or like a variable of the three agents that we have

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:53.020
already created above. Now this function I will try to

01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:55.720
introduce. I have not like to do this function. So there is

01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:58.640
a different file in which these functions are available. So

01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:03.580
just to retrieve the data. Retrieve the data means this one.

01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:06.920
So you will query it will go to vector database right. So

01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:09.860
this is like for this retrieval and retrieve top end record

01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:16.100
as simple as that. So for this flow we have a function and

01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:19.420
then we have basically an object of or you can say a

01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:24.880
variable of these three agents and then basically we have

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:28.840
given the analysis prompt. So based on the following data

01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:32.100
retrieved from the database. Please analyze and identify key

01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:36.120
insights. So I will send a query. I will send a context

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:41.220
basically query plus context is what rag making sense guys.

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:46.020
Yeah so query plus context. So technically I am using a

01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:49.580
agentic rag. This is what I am trying to show you. So my

01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:53.400
input query and my context context means the output which I

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:56.800
will get from my vector databases as per my query. So these

01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:59.320
two things I am going to send. And please provide key

01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:01.560
metrics. This has numbers notable trend top performance all

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:06.240
those things right. Then what it will do. So it will take a

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:09.560
help of this proxy agent which I have created. I told you

01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:13.460
right. So one agent I am going to use basically a proxy

01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:19.720
agent which is going to call other agent as per the need you

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:23.200
can say right. So I am just trying to say that okay fine. So

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:26.660
user proxy initiate a chat. So I am trying to like you know

01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:32.280
initiate the chat with analyst agent. Right. And here is my

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:36.100
analyst agent. So data analyst agent the very first agent I

01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:39.360
am trying to initiate a chat message. Maximum turn is equal

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:45.060
to one. So once this will be like a done. So what ever in

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:48.140
like you know this analyst is going to give me the final

01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:51.540
like a report. What I am trying to do. So I am just trying

01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:57.000
to create another agent over here right or I am going to

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.320
call the another agent. And here. So here I am trying to

01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:02.840
call a writer. So this agentic call should happen in a

01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:06.020
sequential manner. First this should be called and then this

01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:08.540
should be called. This is what I am trying to do. As simple

01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:10.900
as that with the help of my proxy. So proxy is technically

01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:15.240
helping me out to call any number of agent which I have

01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:18.740
created and in what ever sequence. So maybe I have some

01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:21.120
graph kind of a sequence. Maybe I have some loop kind of a

01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:24.640
sequences. I will be able to create all of those things with

01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:28.800
the help of this one. So here I have basically. Like a

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:31.720
linear one. After one agent we have to call another agent.

01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:35.340
So this is what it will try to do it. And then it is going

01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:38.760
to give me the final report. Now once it is going to give me

01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:43.200
the final report the responsibility of this function will be

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:47.320
done. Yeah. Responsibility of this function will be done. As

01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:50.780
simple as that. So this is what we are doing guys and this

01:18:50.780 --> 01:18:55.600
is technically the whole call you can say. Right. Nothing

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:59.020
much. In terms of code. We are just using a direct library

01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:02.120
as you can see. And we are like you know it's just an

01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:04.500
autogen that we are trying to use directly. And this is how

01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:07.860
simple it is in terms of creating the agent and in terms of

01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:09.440
calling the agent. Making sense.

01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:18.000
Chirag is asking which framework is most popular for a code

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.400
based automation. You can use any of this framework. It's

01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:24.960
completely okay. Right. So you can use any and it's

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:27.920
completely fine. Mostly it depends upon your client and your

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:30.360
company's adoption. So some people are using maybe a

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:33.780
langchain. Langraph. Kind of a framework. If you have a

01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:37.800
Microsoft like affiliated client because Microsoft itself is

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:40.300
a big company and they have a lot of clients and they have a

01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:42.660
lot of product line. So in that case obviously they will not

01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:44.760
recommend your langchain or langraph kind of things. They

01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:49.120
will recommend you go ahead and use autogen. Right. So it's

01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:49.840
just like that.

01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:56.760
And creating agent or anything philosophically it's same.

01:19:56.940 --> 01:20:00.260
Like it's not going to change at all at the end of the day

01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:02.780
whether you are going to use this library or that library.

01:20:05.410 --> 01:20:09.790
Yeah. A lot of code is there but making sense. A lot of code

01:20:09.790 --> 01:20:14.610
but not difficult to understand. Believe me. Not difficult

01:20:14.610 --> 01:20:19.830
to understand and the code base is becoming big maybe just

01:20:19.830 --> 01:20:22.870
because of this prompt because we are using 1010 line just

01:20:22.870 --> 01:20:27.810
to write this kind of a prompt. Do we get any support or

01:20:27.810 --> 01:20:30.830
something like that from the Azure for this? If Azure is

01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:34.370
your client then obviously yeah. Otherwise why anyone will

01:20:34.370 --> 01:20:34.850
support you.

01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:41.780
Okay. So this is done. Right. This is done. Basically. So

01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:45.340
this particular function. So agent creation is done. Now

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:48.640
whatever will happen it will happen around this agents at

01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:51.480
the end of the day. Right. So now what we are going to do.

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:54.280
So maybe we are going to see a function. So where we are

01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:59.240
going to send a data or a store a data into a vector

01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:03.380
databases. Simple. So all the supporting function we have to

01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:06.100
create so because we have to do a lot of tasks. Right. We

01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:09.760
have to like you know fetch read a data after reading a data

01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:13.680
we have to use some LLM and then by using those LLM I have

01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:16.720
to store those data into a vector DB then whenever someone

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:19.820
is going to query it should go to a vector database fetch

01:21:19.820 --> 01:21:24.320
top end record and then pass that as an input to my agent

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:27.480
the agent which I have already created. Now once I will be

01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:30.640
able to get the output from the agent number two I have to

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:34.320
create I have to call basically visualization. Then I have

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:38.320
to send my. Like a visualize report and my text report over

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:43.200
a mail and over a telegram. So lot of supporting code we

01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:48.020
have to write over here for like you know storing a data for

01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:51.780
like doing a query storing it into a vector databases for

01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:56.180
visualizing this data for a mail basically and for a

01:21:56.180 --> 01:21:58.840
telegram. So we have to write all of this supporting code

01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:02.340
around this agent number one and agent number two. So the

01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:04.920
core functionality was only like a two line. Right. So

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:08.560
technically it's a one line autogen dot and then create a

01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:10.880
assistant agent. That's it. That was the only core line.

01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:14.140
Everything is going to happen around this entire workflow

01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:17.560
that we have created. So the very first thing is let's try

01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:22.980
to create maybe a file called as vector db dot pi file. Yeah

01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:26.600
vector db dot pi file. Now what it will do. So basically it

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:28.920
will try to vectorize each and everything and then it is

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:32.940
going to save a data. Where. So I am saving a data into a

01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:36.240
chroma db. You can try to save a data anywhere you want and

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:38.940
chroma db is something that I think we all are familiar

01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:41.240
with. Right. So we have already discussed about the chroma

01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:45.780
db pine cone everything. So yeah. So here is a piece of the

01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:48.860
code. Now what it will do. So it will one by one one by one

01:22:48.860 --> 01:22:52.840
one by one basically like read a data and after reading a

01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:57.120
data. So it is going to basically save a data save a data

01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:58.140
into the chroma db.

01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:05.060
So whenever we are implementing such automation in an

01:23:05.060 --> 01:23:08.100
organization. Do we need to have a LLM model. Always up and

01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:12.660
running. We are looking to use Azure AI search will it be

01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:16.720
costly if I will talk about just this one in terms of

01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:19.940
sending a report. So I am sending a report at nine o'clock.

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:23.700
So my system is not my system will be in a hibernation mode

01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:27.220
or my system will be in a sleep mode. So my LLM. So I don't

01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:30.360
have to keep my you know even LLM instances up and running.

01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:34.140
So maybe my LLM instance will start itself two minute before

01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:37.580
or just like a two second before. We have we have to send

01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:41.660
the reports and once it will create the report all system go

01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:45.740
for a hibernation or maybe all system can go for a sleep. So

01:23:45.740 --> 01:23:49.140
especially for this one we don't need all the system up and

01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:51.760
running it's just a report sending machine right that we are

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:56.320
trying to create. So in this situation no it's not required

01:23:56.320 --> 01:24:02.680
by the way. Yeah. Okay. So basically this is this is a file

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:05.020
that I have written so which is not nothing but which is

01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:09.120
going to like read a data. Yeah. So basically it is going to

01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:14.240
you know store your entire data set into a chroma db. We

01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:17.060
have we have already seen this kind of code so many times

01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:21.840
already. Okay now there is something called as so storage

01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:26.120
part is will be done right. So vector storage part the very

01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:28.440
first part so whether we have a marketing data whether we

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:31.680
have a sales data I will be able to store it into a vector

01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:35.220
db. Now there is something called as visualization because

01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:38.280
we are using it right. Visualization agent. Whatever report

01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:40.740
or whatever data I will get so I have to create a beautiful

01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:45.440
visual beautiful graph I have to create it. So here there is

01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:50.240
a separate file a completely separate file right which you

01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:53.440
will be able to find out so which is going to like take a

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:57.340
sales data and then it is going to basically like create a

01:24:57.340 --> 01:25:01.260
beautiful beautiful graph for all of us. So basically this

01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:03.840
is where this visualization not pie file will come into

01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:07.600
picture. I'll come back once again. Right. The basically

01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:12.380
like this is something which is not complex but yeah we are

01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:15.540
we are doing a lot because we have to create a final

01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:18.600
visualization. So obviously these many number of lines are

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:24.200
technically required. Now so visualization is one thing.

01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:30.960
Then what we have to do so basically we have to have

01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:37.760
a report generation. Let me bring all the file here. Okay.

01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:51.940
Then we should have email sender, telegram file we should

01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:53.220
have, we

01:25:56.190 --> 01:26:02.050
must have an agent saving the conversation and

01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:30.040
then we should have a scheduler.py file. So here the entire

01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:33.060
story is going to start like I said so I am just

01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:37.660
orchestrating my entire things in a scheduler. Right. So the

01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:40.440
entire story is going to start from the scheduler.

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:43.120
Basically. So scheduler is going to initiate each and

01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:47.220
everything. This is my trigger point by the way. I can

01:26:47.220 --> 01:26:50.640
create a chat interface for a trigger point. I can try to

01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:53.980
you know initiate this trigger with respect to my WhatsApp

01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:56.040
message or maybe my telegram message or maybe something

01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:59.520
else. But yeah as of now I am trying to create a trigger

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:02.440
point with respect to a scheduler that okay wake up at nine

01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:06.740
o'clock create a entire report and send those entire reports

01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:09.720
to the respective stakeholder. This is what I'm trying to

01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:14.420
do. As simple as that. Now so my trigger point is going to

01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:17.380
be this one and this is something which is going to call

01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:20.580
everything means literally everything inside your file.

01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:24.380
Yeah. So what it is trying to do so it is trying to call

01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:28.200
generate a sales performance report from where. So basically

01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:32.120
we have a report generator.py file and here we have a

01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:36.200
function so which is going to like you know query basically.

01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:41.500
So for everything. As I have already mentioned so for

01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:45.040
everything we must have a query right. So either we are

01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:47.960
going to send a query via chat or maybe I can try to send a

01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:53.200
query via system. So here as system is working on itself we

01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:57.200
are not doing anything. So I have already written a query

01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:00.740
over here that okay at nine o'clock when my system will wake

01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:04.580
up. So this is the query which I am sending analyze a sales

01:28:04.580 --> 01:28:08.080
performance report. Now once I'm going to you know. Like

01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:12.580
call this analyze the sales performance report it is going

01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:16.020
to build the entire query and then it is going to basically

01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:20.080
call generate report with rag. Yeah. So basically it is

01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:24.520
going to call my rag and here so generate report with

01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:28.180
autogen multi agent. So it is going to call my generate

01:28:28.180 --> 01:28:31.000
report with a multi agent where it is taking a query report

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.500
type and then like it is it is going to follow the entire

01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:37.460
processes whatever processes which I have written. So this

01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:42.440
is what I am trying to do over here. Then generate marketing

01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:45.720
campaign report I am trying to call then quarterly summary.

01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:50.700
So all of these things I am trying to import then once this

01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:53.600
will be done. So I am trying to call basically like a email

01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:58.060
sender visualizer telegram all of these things. So here

01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:04.240
scheduler wise if you will go through this function so

01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:08.540
generate and send a daily report. So this is the flow you

01:29:08.540 --> 01:29:11.500
will be able to find out. So where it is using nothing but

01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:14.560
all the import or you can say all the other things which I

01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:17.620
have written in some other this like some other classes

01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:21.840
basically. So here the whole process will start from here.

01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:24.980
So once my system is going to wake up right. So everything

01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:29.140
is going to start from here. Basically generate a sales

01:29:29.140 --> 01:29:34.260
performance report. So it is like going to call this one

01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:36.700
analyze the sales performance as a query. Yeah. Build a

01:29:36.700 --> 01:29:41.340
query and then start the engine. Now once this is going to

01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:44.840
give you the sales report. So I am trying to save this sales

01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:48.560
report to some file which is nothing but a txt file. Right.

01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:51.500
I am trying to append those reports to a txt file. Then

01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:54.520
generate a marketing campaign report. So my scheduler will

01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:57.180
try to generate the marketing campaign report and return me

01:29:57.180 --> 01:30:01.840
the file. Then generate the combined summary. So this is

01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:05.500
going to execute or call the agents. So which is going to do

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:08.720
this one. This particular pass. Right. And then like

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:11.460
generate all the charts. So basically generate all the

01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:15.040
visualization for me and then send HTML email with the

01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:18.520
chart. So this is going to send the HTML email to me and

01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:21.840
then if success. So it should show you in a console that OK

01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:25.640
email send successfully. And then I'm trying to call send a

01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:29.480
telegram. So it is going to send all the messages over a

01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:34.940
telegram as well if it is configured. Right. So this is our

01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:38.160
flow. Yeah. Part number one, part number two, part number

01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:42.440
three. And then done. Finally send a mail and send a

01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:45.440
telegram. And eventually that is going to call my agents.

01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:50.540
Now here I am trying to write the scheduler. So if you are

01:30:50.540 --> 01:30:54.580
using maybe a cron job so you can like you know do it just

01:30:54.580 --> 01:30:58.100
by you know writing one single line. So here I am writing

01:30:58.100 --> 01:31:02.420
everything in a python. So here is my scheduler. So

01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:06.640
scheduler is nothing but schedule dot every day. At schedule

01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:11.340
time. So whatever time which I am going to pass. Right. And

01:31:11.340 --> 01:31:17.460
then dot do. So do what. So do the above one. This one. Do

01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:22.340
the above one. Yeah. So generate and send a daily report. So

01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:25.460
this is a task which I am trying to define to my scheduler.

01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:28.580
So in python there is a beautiful module called a schedule.

01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:31.360
You will be able to find out and with the help of the

01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:34.960
schedule you will be able to create your own scheduler.

01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:38.240
Yeah. Even a very very easy way and you can assign any task

01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:42.200
to that scheduler. So technically it is going to call run

01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:44.740
that function at that particular point of a time and this is

01:31:44.740 --> 01:31:48.440
just one line of a code. Again not a heavy one. Just this

01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:50.300
line. Rest of these things are just a print statement.

01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:53.860
Right. Nothing much. So this is what I am trying to do.

01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:57.240
Schedule dot every day and schedule time. So whatever

01:31:57.240 --> 01:32:00.920
schedule time that you are going to provide it is going to

01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:05.420
work automatically. So every day maybe I can configure it.

01:32:05.420 --> 01:32:08.760
For every month. Right. So all of these things are basically

01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:15.180
possible. Right. So here I am trying to run it in a infinite

01:32:15.180 --> 01:32:20.260
loop because what I want. So I want this system to be up and

01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:24.400
running so that every day at the schedule time. So whenever

01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:27.860
it will find a schedule time it should send the report.

01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:31.140
Right. It should send the report. So while true. Schedule

01:32:31.140 --> 01:32:34.880
dot run pending and it will like check every minute. That.

01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:37.500
Okay. Fine. So when I have to send the report when I have to

01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:41.340
send a report by the way. So whenever it will be equal to

01:32:41.340 --> 01:32:45.800
this schedule time it will just run it. So this is for a

01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:48.740
scheduling one line of line of a code with the help of

01:32:48.740 --> 01:32:52.680
Python library. And then this is for the running it in an

01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:56.100
infinite loop while true. Right. Infinite loop. That's it.

01:32:56.200 --> 01:32:59.800
This is the like Python code. And then I have written one

01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:04.220
separate code because I had to test it. So I just want it to

01:33:04.220 --> 01:33:08.400
run. Any time I want. Right. So basically I have written one

01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:11.100
separate function. So which is nothing but a run now. But

01:33:11.100 --> 01:33:13.880
this is not the actual. This is just a testing function.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.500
Right. I have written so that I can run it any time. I don't

01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:19.040
have to wait for nine o'clock or any time like you know

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:21.880
which I'm going to schedule. So generator send a daily

01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:24.680
report. So same same function I'm calling same function

01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:28.060
which is written inside the scheduler. So scheduler is my

01:33:28.060 --> 01:33:30.860
entry point by the way. And here I have given the argument

01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:34.780
that if argument length is greater than one. And argument is

01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:38.960
now. So just try to call run now else start the scheduler.

01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:42.740
So technically start the scheduler part this part basically.

01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:49.240
So this is guys this is technically like going to call or

01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:52.900
trigger the entire system that we have. Right. So this is

01:33:52.900 --> 01:33:55.900
something which is going to trigger. And if you're going to

01:33:55.900 --> 01:33:59.660
remove all the print. So again it will be like a very less

01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:02.600
line of a code you will be able to find out. So. So hope the

01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:05.480
scheduling part is fine. And hope we all are able to

01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:10.770
understand that what is my trigger point. Yeah. This

01:34:10.770 --> 01:34:13.310
argument part. So whenever I'm going to execute the code

01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:17.350
right. So basically if I'm going to say that okay fine as an

01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:20.570
argument if I'm going to give now means from a command line.

01:34:20.710 --> 01:34:24.630
So technically it will try to run itself now means it will

01:34:24.630 --> 01:34:28.130
call technically this particular function right. Run now

01:34:28.130 --> 01:34:31.290
function as I have mapped it over here. Otherwise it will

01:34:31.290 --> 01:34:36.980
try to call the scheduler. That's it. So this is just a

01:34:36.980 --> 01:34:41.520
conditional length of the argument is greater than one. And

01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:47.760
this one then just try to call this. That's it. Okay. Run

01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:50.940
now. So this is my trigger point guys. So so far we have

01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:53.140
been doing with respect to chat right. So whatever system

01:34:53.140 --> 01:34:55.480
that we have created so we have interfaced that system with

01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:59.940
the chat. But every system we are not supposed to interface

01:34:59.940 --> 01:35:02.980
with the chat window as we have already seen in case of

01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:05.720
anything. We were using a trigger. So this is my trigger

01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:07.220
right. This is my trigger file by the way. My scheduler is

01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:10.820
my trigger file. Okay. Now let's look into this email one.

01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:15.000
So again I have already taught you even in my past that how

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.480
to send an email with the help of SMTP protocol right

01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:23.200
everyone. I think we have we have written an email sending

01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:25.180
like a python file right even in past.

01:35:31.610 --> 01:35:38.000
Yeah. So same thing I'm trying to use SMTP request right. So

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:42.100
where what you will have to do. So you have to basically go

01:35:42.100 --> 01:35:47.000
to. Go to. Google. Right. You technically have to same

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.440
process I have already taught you in a past. So here you

01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:55.440
have to go and you have to write a gmail app password. It is

01:35:55.440 --> 01:36:02.060
like you have to create your app password by the way. Oh I

01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:06.420
have to pass my password for this gmail. Let me do it.

01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:18.460
So I have not changed this code base by the way. So I'm

01:36:18.460 --> 01:36:21.300
using the exact like same thing which I have used in my

01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:24.640
previous classes. So as we all know that we can come over

01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:27.900
here we can try to give a name of this app and then we can

01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:30.760
try to you know create it and this is going to give me the

01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:33.680
app password. I can activate I can deactivate it. So if I'm

01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:37.080
going to deactivate it even if you have my like this one you

01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:42.280
will not be able to access my mails by the way. So this is

01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:46.700
this is what let me delete it. Yeah. So this is what I we

01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:50.980
have to do to access my gmail. So from any mail to any mail

01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:54.420
I'm going to send the mail. So basically this will be my

01:36:54.420 --> 01:36:57.740
like origin from where I'm creating the app password. My

01:36:57.740 --> 01:37:01.180
destination can be any mail id. Right. My destination can be

01:37:01.180 --> 01:37:06.220
any mail id. Rest is just a story. So basically what I have

01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:10.240
done so I have to send a beautiful beautiful you know mail.

01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:14.300
Technically I have to send this kind of a template. It's not

01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:18.300
just a raw mail. So it's just like a with the help of vibe

01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:21.860
coding. So I have created this entire template. You can try

01:37:21.860 --> 01:37:26.320
to create a template in your own way right. Any any like in

01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:29.780
any way that you want. So it's just a template HTML template

01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:33.400
which has been created and I'm just like feeding my own data

01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:36.780
over here. That's it. Right. Feeding my own data. So this is

01:37:36.780 --> 01:37:39.740
the HTML template which has been created. You can modify

01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:43.560
this template. You can try to mention some other messages.

01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:47.900
That's like completely OK. Yeah. So this is just a HTML.

01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:54.200
Nothing much. Now so this is HTML email template. So just

01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:57.040
for templating and this is for sending the mail inside that

01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:00.880
HTML basically. And I'm using the exact same thing. Right.

01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:07.260
So like SMTP request I'm trying to like send over here and

01:38:07.260 --> 01:38:10.360
like it is it is eventually trying to call all my

01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:15.620
visualization and then sending up a mail to it. So the main

01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:19.700
core functionality of this mail is this much. So where I'm

01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:25.700
trying to like give a Gmail user recipient mail ID subject

01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:30.400
I'm trying to give and then a body. So body is like this

01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:33.980
entire things whatever I'm trying to pass from my HTML I'm

01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:38.020
just like to send those things inside the body. Right. And

01:38:38.020 --> 01:38:41.720
here. So with the help of app password I'm trying to access

01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:45.780
it. That's it. Nothing much. Right. Nothing much in terms of

01:38:45.780 --> 01:38:50.120
sending up email. Now the other component is basically a

01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:53.840
telegram sender. Right. So even over a telegram. So I'm

01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:58.420
trying to send all of these things right now to send any

01:38:58.420 --> 01:39:01.660
kind of messages over a telegram. So you have to do a little

01:39:01.660 --> 01:39:05.920
bit of configuration like I told you. So you can interact

01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:10.960
with your telegram in two way. One way is like, you know, a

01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:15.040
bit by creating a bot. So to create a bot, I can go over

01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:19.100
here. I can try to search basically like a bot father that

01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:21.800
we have already done in our previous classes. So this is the

01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:24.480
approach that we have already seen and I have integrated

01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:28.620
this even with respect to my flight search engine. Last

01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:30.880
class itself. Right. Last Sunday itself. We have already

01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:34.080
used this particular approach. A bot based approach where we

01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:39.200
were like, you know, able to fetch a flight now by this

01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:43.540
approach. Right. So. And then you will be able to basically

01:39:43.540 --> 01:39:50.060
send something to a bot. But yeah, so I don't want to do

01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:53.380
that. Basically I just want to send this message to

01:39:53.380 --> 01:39:57.140
someone's personal message to my mail, to my number

01:39:57.140 --> 01:40:00.680
basically, or maybe to your number or a telegram. So I can't

01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:03.860
use this bot father approach. What I can do, I can try to

01:40:03.860 --> 01:40:07.780
basically like use, I had to use basically a different

01:40:07.780 --> 01:40:10.380
approaches and this is what I'm trying to use over here.

01:40:10.460 --> 01:40:14.040
Right. So I'm trying to create a telegram client. I have

01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:16.980
also done a testing. So maybe I can like, uh, show you that

01:40:16.980 --> 01:40:23.620
testing in somewhere like, uh, some different places. So

01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:29.480
yeah, the code for this telegram is only this much. What is

01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:33.040
required? Let me show it to you. So you need basically app

01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:38.000
ID. You need an API hash. That's it. So if you have an app

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.880
ID and you have an API hash. You will be able to send a

01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:45.520
message to any number as you can see, I have like a given my

01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:48.820
own number. It's my number with my country code, right? And

01:40:48.820 --> 01:40:52.220
this is my message. So you will be able to send it. This two

01:40:52.220 --> 01:40:54.880
things are required now from where you will be able to get

01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:59.980
these two things from here. You can even test it now. Yeah.

01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:03.460
So I'm, I'm just like a spinning of this piece of the code

01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:08.600
and you can test your telegram. So just open up a telegram,

01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:12.540
go to this URL. And once you will go to this URL, it is

01:41:12.540 --> 01:41:16.360
going to like a, ask you to fill a small form. And once you

01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:19.460
are going to fill this small form, it is going to give you

01:41:19.460 --> 01:41:23.040
this kind of a page, this kind of a detail. So basically it

01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:25.900
is going to ask you for app title and short name. Once you

01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:28.660
are going to do that. So it is going to give you the app

01:41:28.660 --> 01:41:32.880
configuration. Yeah. So this is my app configuration by the

01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:35.440
way, from the URL, which I have already shared with you. So

01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:39.880
just go to this URL and fill this like a details. And then

01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:42.640
you will be able to see this particular page. Now don't

01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:45.920
worry. So even if I'm going to share this entire app

01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:48.840
configuration with you, uh, for example, if you have a, my

01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:53.820
app ID, and if you have my API has you still, you won't be

01:41:53.820 --> 01:41:57.000
able to use it. Right. I'll, I'll tell you the reason. So

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.520
that's the reason I'm showing you this part, and this is

01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:02.780
going to be the unique. So only one time system is going to

01:42:02.780 --> 01:42:05.060
create. And whenever you are going to refresh with respect

01:42:05.060 --> 01:42:07.980
to your own telegram, you will be able to see the exact same

01:42:07.980 --> 01:42:10.580
configuration. Yeah. You will be able to see the exact same

01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:13.600
configuration. So just go there and then like, uh, you know,

01:42:13.620 --> 01:42:18.120
uh, try to create your own app ID and your own API has key

01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:23.860
and just use this piece of the code. Yeah. Use this piece of

01:42:23.860 --> 01:42:26.560
the code, change your number. So I have given my own number

01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:29.380
and you can try to like a change this one as well. So this

01:42:29.380 --> 01:42:31.860
is my own name. I'll I'll tell you why I'm keeping this

01:42:31.860 --> 01:42:34.140
particular part, right? This particular session part, but,

01:42:34.180 --> 01:42:36.640
uh, I've just been using a piece of the code now

01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:39.540
installation wise guys. So installation wise, basically you

01:42:39.540 --> 01:42:42.840
have to install a telethon. So there is a Python library,

01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:46.700
uh, for a telegram called as telethon. So this is something

01:42:46.700 --> 01:42:49.900
that you have to install. So just you can take a test it

01:42:49.900 --> 01:42:53.260
separately and test it separately. Yeah. So I have given you

01:42:53.260 --> 01:42:56.420
a piece of the code and, uh, you can, you can just configure

01:42:56.420 --> 01:42:59.120
any number over here. Any number means literally any number

01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:02.760
and from any country, uh, here is my number. You can maybe

01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:05.520
change it with your number or someone else's number. Uh,

01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:09.740
what will happen by the way? Like I said, so even if you

01:43:09.740 --> 01:43:13.160
will be having my app ID, even if you will be having my has,

01:43:13.420 --> 01:43:16.260
which is unique and which is like one time creation, still,

01:43:16.380 --> 01:43:19.400
you will not be able to send it because whenever you are

01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:23.820
sending a message to anyone for the very first time, right?

01:43:24.180 --> 01:43:28.600
It is going to ask for the OTP. It is going to ask for the

01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:31.760
OTP from the verified number only for once, right? And then

01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:35.580
you can see it is going to set this one inside the session.

01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:40.080
So what it will do? It will try to create a local file means

01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:42.500
it's not like every time you have to do, uh, like go with

01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:44.520
the verification. No, only once you have to go with the

01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:48.360
verification. So for one system, right, even if I'm going to

01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:50.560
delete this file, so again I have to go for the re

01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:53.320
verification. So I'm going to delete it by the way now. So

01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:56.160
it is going to create this session. Now what this file does

01:43:56.160 --> 01:44:00.680
by the way, so it is going to like, you know, uh, uh, keep

01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:03.800
your authorization in a, in a particular session so that

01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:07.280
again and again you won't have to go and verify. So even if

01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:09.860
you have my app ID and app has, and let's suppose if you're

01:44:09.860 --> 01:44:13.960
going to execute a code, right, it is going to pop up and it

01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:16.640
will say that, okay, uh, give me a number. So where I'm

01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:19.960
going to send the verification and uh, if you're going to

01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:23.080
give a wrong number, right? Again, it is not going to work

01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:26.400
because it will try to verify with the app ID and app has,

01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:29.400
right? Uh, if you're going to give a correct number, let's

01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:31.580
suppose you have given my number because this is my app ID.

01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:34.420
So I will receive the OTP and unless and until I'm not going

01:44:34.420 --> 01:44:37.180
to share OTP with all of you, uh, you will not be able to do

01:44:37.180 --> 01:44:40.140
anything by the way. So even if this is going to be

01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:43.160
compromised, it's completely fine. Uh, I have to do a OTP

01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:46.660
verification. Once I'm going to establish this session and

01:44:46.660 --> 01:44:49.280
once this session file will be available from next time

01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:52.060
onwards, it will not ask for these things. So even in case

01:44:52.060 --> 01:44:55.360
of scheduler, right? So at least once I have to verify and

01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:59.240
like, uh, you know, feed my OTP and then automatically, uh,

01:44:59.340 --> 01:45:03.120
every day at nine o'clock it will send a report. So let me

01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:06.700
delete this file. Uh, and here. So. So if I'm going to

01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:11.340
execute it, Python tele, ma'am. So see again, it has created

01:45:11.340 --> 01:45:15.000
the session file, right? Please enter your phone. So here

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.060
with the country code, I have to enter my phone number. So

01:45:17.060 --> 01:45:20.260
nine one nine one seven six zero seven double two five one.

01:45:20.620 --> 01:45:24.120
Now once I'm going to do it, it is going to give me the OTP

01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:27.920
over a telegram itself. So my login code is eight eight nine

01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:30.920
one five. So eight eight nine one five. Now it's done,

01:45:31.020 --> 01:45:34.940
right? And uh, then you will be able to see that, that it

01:45:34.940 --> 01:45:37.760
has sent me the, my OTP. Right? This OTP, this is the OTP

01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:40.480
which I have received. Where is my OTP? Yeah. This is the

01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:45.120
OTP which I have received just now 10 45 AM IST. And then

01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:48.420
here is my test mail, right? Whatever I have written. So I'm

01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:51.200
able to receive it only this much. You have to do a con in

01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:54.140
terms of configuration and I can send a message to anyone

01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:56.340
basically. So whatever number which I'm going to feed it

01:45:56.340 --> 01:45:59.580
over here, right? Or maybe I can run it in a loop. Maybe I

01:45:59.580 --> 01:46:02.960
have to send this message to our multiple numbers. Not an

01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:06.120
issue. Keep all those numbers inside the list. Or maybe

01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:09.820
inside a tuples, run the loop, right? Run the loop. Simple.

01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:12.860
And uh, maybe I have to like, uh, write some e-fails

01:46:12.860 --> 01:46:15.340
condition that sent this report to this person, that report

01:46:15.340 --> 01:46:18.980
to that person. I can do everything, right? Everything I can

01:46:18.980 --> 01:46:23.220
do it. So it's not a big deal for me. But yeah, technically

01:46:23.220 --> 01:46:28.060
this is the piece of the code line one, two, three, and then

01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:31.640
four and then done. This is how you will be able to

01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:35.260
communicate with the telegram. Easy peasy manner. So not by

01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:38.060
creating a board or something. Now I can personalize all the

01:46:38.060 --> 01:46:41.860
messages, uh, to a telegram user. Let's suppose if I have 10

01:46:41.860 --> 01:46:45.080
,000 telegram user and if I have to, you know, uh, send all

01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:48.320
the marketing messages to all the telegram user, I can do

01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:50.840
that without like paying anything.

01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:58.240
Making sense. So it's a first time 2FA. Yeah, actually it's

01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:00.840
a 2FA for the very first time. And if I'm going to lead the

01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:03.120
session file, again, I have to go with a two factor

01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:06.820
authentication. See if I'm sending it now, right? It will

01:47:06.820 --> 01:47:09.580
send directly. It will not ask for the authorization. See

01:47:09.580 --> 01:47:12.480
this time it has not asked for the authorization because

01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:15.040
this file was there. This is the session file. It has

01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:17.720
already created. If I'm going to delete it, then it will ask

01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:18.280
for the authorization.

01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:25.960
Fine guys. Yeah. So telegram connection, but not with the

01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:30.960
bot, basically with the, uh, real user, right? So I can, I

01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:33.360
can send it programmatically and it's very easy like things

01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:37.220
to do as you can see over here. So this is what I'm doing

01:47:37.220 --> 01:47:39.960
over here. Telegram client. I'm like trying to give a name

01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:42.320
of the session so that, you know, for the very first time it

01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:44.260
will ask for the authorization from the next time onwards.

01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:47.540
It should not ask me for the authorization as simple as

01:47:47.540 --> 01:47:51.660
that. And then like, uh, uh, whatever I'm sending over the

01:47:51.660 --> 01:47:55.240
mail, I'm like sending over the telegram as well. Like, uh,

01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:58.280
all those like a charts and then those reports and those

01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:01.400
files, that's it. Right. Whatever I want, I can, I can just

01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:08.120
send it. So, um, this is like a telegram communication. Now

01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:13.260
the main file, uh, which I have to give over here is, uh,

01:48:15.730 --> 01:48:19.430
credentials, right? Because without credential, how it will

01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:23.670
work. So I have to give my dot ENV and config file over

01:48:23.670 --> 01:48:29.190
here. So dot ENV and, uh, I'm trying to keep a couple of

01:48:29.190 --> 01:48:33.490
things. So open AI key, I'm trying to keep over here, Gmail

01:48:33.490 --> 01:48:37.370
user means like origin user, uh, Gmail app password. I'm

01:48:37.370 --> 01:48:40.370
trying to keep recipient. Recipient wise, I have given this

01:48:40.370 --> 01:48:44.090
one. I can try to give a list of the recipient, uh, telegram

01:48:44.090 --> 01:48:47.530
app ID, telegram API has and telegram phone number. So

01:48:47.530 --> 01:48:50.350
again, this phone number can be multiple. This recipient

01:48:50.350 --> 01:48:55.010
email ID can be multiple as simple as that. So you have to

01:48:55.010 --> 01:48:57.950
basically change all of these things because I'm going to

01:48:57.950 --> 01:49:02.350
deactivate my app password. Uh, anyhow, you will not be able

01:49:02.350 --> 01:49:06.710
to use my API ID and API has, uh, because you need an OTP

01:49:06.710 --> 01:49:10.390
from my side, right? And then rest, rest is going to work

01:49:10.390 --> 01:49:13.810
even open AI key. So it will be working during this session,

01:49:13.930 --> 01:49:18.010
but yeah, after that I'm going to deactivate it. So this is

01:49:18.010 --> 01:49:20.410
basically like a, this is the only parameter that you have

01:49:20.410 --> 01:49:22.710
to set. Even if you are going to deploy it over a cloud

01:49:22.710 --> 01:49:26.550
platform, right? Uh, maybe like not all the parameter, maybe

01:49:26.550 --> 01:49:29.530
leave this part and leave this part, right? This is the

01:49:29.530 --> 01:49:32.670
parameter you can try to set over a cloud platform. And then

01:49:32.670 --> 01:49:36.690
we are like going to call the config.py file. So we are

01:49:36.690 --> 01:49:41.070
going to read everything. Right? So all this like a things

01:49:41.070 --> 01:49:44.390
and then any file and every file will be able to technically

01:49:44.390 --> 01:49:52.070
use it. So this is the whole and sole story everyone. So

01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:55.270
once I'm going to execute this entire things, it is like a,

01:49:55.270 --> 01:50:00.610
you know, uh, going to, uh, basically like a create, uh, or

01:50:00.610 --> 01:50:02.810
it is, it is going to send a report for me.

01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:10.840
Uh, please show the step from where we can find the API key

01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:14.040
for the telegraph. Uh, basically I have already pinged you

01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:17.660
the link. Let me show you once again. So this is basically a

01:50:17.660 --> 01:50:24.760
link, my.telegram.org apps. Yeah, this one, this is the link

01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:27.140
guys. I've just pinged you what

01:50:30.310 --> 01:50:33.990
to put in URL, nothing just, just like a, uh, just hit this

01:50:33.990 --> 01:50:37.470
URL. It is going to ask for the login by the way. So it will

01:50:37.470 --> 01:50:40.290
ask for your number. And once you are going to log in with

01:50:40.290 --> 01:50:43.550
your number, then it will ask you to, you know, uh, give the

01:50:43.550 --> 01:50:46.590
app ID. Okay. Give the app name. That's it. Then it will

01:50:46.590 --> 01:50:47.830
give you this one.

01:50:52.820 --> 01:50:56.560
So for example, if I'm going to hit this URL, right? So see,

01:50:56.620 --> 01:50:59.140
it is asking me for my phone number. Once I'm going to give

01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:02.660
my phone number, it is like, it will send me my OTP. Once

01:51:02.660 --> 01:51:06.640
I'm going to like, you know, give a OTP, then, uh, it will

01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:10.960
ask me to like give a app name and then the page which I

01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:14.920
have shown you, right? This page. So this page will be

01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:20.740
created for forever. This one. So where you will be able to

01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:24.860
access a telegram programmatically by, by using any program,

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.580
like by using any programming languages, by the way, maybe

01:51:27.580 --> 01:51:30.400
Python, maybe Java or something else, but yeah, you just

01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:32.560
need like these two things in

01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:39.060
the form it is asking for. Okay. In the form, it is asking

01:51:39.060 --> 01:51:42.940
for the URL, uh, just give you your own URL, anything just

01:51:42.940 --> 01:51:46.360
like, uh, ask for the verification authorization, uh, maybe

01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:50.540
give a your own URL. That's fine. So

01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:56.640
you would use a UDAPay place. So usually we, uh, yeah,

01:51:56.700 --> 01:52:00.000
obviously you can use any APIs, uh, at the end of the day,

01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:02.040
you just need a LLM access. That's it.

01:52:06.830 --> 01:52:10.790
Okay. So URL, that's a dummy field by the way. So I mean

01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:13.150
like, uh, basically they are doing a verification so that,

01:52:13.190 --> 01:52:15.890
you know, uh, whenever you will do something wrong or

01:52:15.890 --> 01:52:17.870
whenever someone will start blocking you, let's suppose I

01:52:17.870 --> 01:52:22.070
have five because now in this way I can send this to any

01:52:22.070 --> 01:52:25.510
number, right? So maybe let's suppose I have a 10,000 number

01:52:25.510 --> 01:52:28.950
in my databases, I can send our marketing mail or sales mail

01:52:28.950 --> 01:52:31.190
to any number. Any number without doing any kind of a

01:52:31.190 --> 01:52:34.350
payment or something. Right. Uh, so basically they like, uh,

01:52:34.530 --> 01:52:37.690
do those verifications. So if someone is going to, you know,

01:52:37.690 --> 01:52:41.930
uh, block your number, then, uh, just for the later

01:52:41.930 --> 01:52:46.350
verification, but yeah, you can put any like URL, any dummy

01:52:46.350 --> 01:52:47.910
URL, everything is going to work.

01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:56.340
Okay. Fine. Everyone now. So let me, let me share like, uh,

01:52:56.480 --> 01:53:01.500
you know, this entire code, uh, block the final version of

01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:04.980
this code. Okay. And so that, you know, even you will be

01:53:04.980 --> 01:53:10.240
able to run it now. And even you will be able to, uh, like,

01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:12.600
uh, test it.

01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:23.840
So just a minute. I'm going to upload this one.

01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:58.120
Yeah. The working code with my credential and everything I'm

01:53:58.120 --> 01:54:00.180
going to share with all of you. Okay.

01:54:16.180 --> 01:54:20.440
It's a 22 MB file. So in

01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:31.760
the later stage, uh, same piece of code will be available

01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:35.560
inside your dashboard. So once I'm going to upload. The

01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:35.860
recording.

01:54:49.620 --> 01:54:52.420
Okay. So here's the drive link for now, you can download the

01:54:52.420 --> 01:54:55.560
entire piece of the code. And I have also created a bat file

01:54:55.560 --> 01:54:58.160
just for like a quick check. Uh, if you're using a windows

01:54:58.160 --> 01:55:01.040
machine, right. If you're using a windows machine, so you

01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:03.520
will be able to find out that, uh, I have created basically

01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:08.640
something, uh, like, uh, called as send report now a bat

01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:12.460
file. So basically it will work in a, uh, basically a window

01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:15.360
system. It is not going to work in any other system. So to

01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:17.860
work into any other system. So you have to like execute a

01:55:17.860 --> 01:55:20.360
scheduler. Okay. So basically you can execute a scheduler

01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:23.000
and it is going to work. But yeah, for windows, for my

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.960
testing purposes, I have like, uh, created this. So execute

01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:30.260
this and leave it, or maybe if you have to like, uh, uh, uh,

01:55:30.260 --> 01:55:33.740
treat your own system as a server. So maybe you can just try

01:55:33.740 --> 01:55:36.180
to like, uh, click on this bat. So this bat is nothing but a

01:55:36.180 --> 01:55:39.440
windows file. Eventually it is going to like, uh, call the

01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:40.760
scheduler at the end of the day.

01:55:46.950 --> 01:55:50.350
Those who are not using, uh, like a windows, uh, maybe

01:55:50.350 --> 01:55:52.610
you're using a Mac or some other machine. So maybe you can

01:55:52.610 --> 01:55:56.950
try to call this one, uh, to execute it now and to sedule

01:55:56.950 --> 01:56:02.630
it. So you can try to use this one, two commands. One now

01:56:02.630 --> 01:56:06.010
means it is going to test it now. And then scheduled, uh,

01:56:06.090 --> 01:56:09.270
dot PI means it will send at nine o'clock, whatever time

01:56:09.270 --> 01:56:11.410
that I'm going to configure with.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.940
So execute it guys. And let me know quickly, are you able to

01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:22.600
do it or not, or what kind of issue you are facing?

01:56:47.670 --> 01:56:51.950
So just to test it quickly, uh, just click on like a bad

01:56:51.950 --> 01:56:55.530
file. Okay. Double click on bad file. For example, if I have

01:56:55.530 --> 01:56:58.910
to test it quickly, so send report. Now I'll just click over

01:56:58.910 --> 01:57:02.230
here to technically, it is trying to call my scheduler now.

01:57:02.430 --> 01:57:04.730
So deliver with now parameter and

01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:10.560
inside your configuration file, you will be able to find out

01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:14.120
a timings. So timings, a time schedule, uh, basically, uh,

01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:17.640
so here, uh, the configuration file, which I have already

01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:21.280
discussed with you, this one. So here we are setting up the

01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:25.740
time. So you can try to set any time. You can try to set any

01:57:25.740 --> 01:57:30.120
time. Your, your wish basically. So I'm trying to set my

01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:33.380
like IST time, Asia, Kolkata. You can try to set your timing

01:57:33.380 --> 01:57:36.760
in your own way. It's fine. This, this is the parameter,

01:57:36.900 --> 01:57:38.300
which will go inside my scheduler run.

01:57:44.620 --> 01:57:49.380
So are you able to execute it guys? Send report now. Yeah.

01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:52.680
And maybe double click on start scheduler and scheduler will

01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:55.440
up and running. So as long as your system will be up and

01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:57.520
running, scheduler will up and running. And then whatever,

01:57:57.740 --> 01:58:00.520
when it will reach to the time, it will send a report. It

01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:02.840
means it will process the entire code, whatever you have

01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:05.360
written. And then it will like, you know, send and

01:58:15.540 --> 01:58:19.020
all logs, you will be able to see it here. So when it is

01:58:19.020 --> 01:58:21.280
trying to execute, so which one it is trying to call, which

01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:24.740
agent call, what it is trying to like do after what

01:58:24.740 --> 01:58:26.420
everything you will be able to see it here.

01:58:41.640 --> 01:58:46.100
So anyone who is able to like, uh, you know, uh, executed

01:58:46.100 --> 01:58:48.740
guys, even you have my session file. So telegram session

01:58:48.740 --> 01:58:55.870
file. So I think, uh, it will, it will work. It's failed to

01:58:55.870 --> 01:58:57.010
download. Is it? Yeah.

01:59:03.460 --> 01:59:07.040
So anyone who is able to download maybe because of the API

01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:07.480
key.

01:59:10.280 --> 01:59:12.840
Yes. Yeah. So couple of people are able to download it.

01:59:15.680 --> 01:59:20.380
Why does detected is says maybe because of the API key. So I

01:59:20.380 --> 01:59:22.520
will have to upload inside your dashboard and from

01:59:22.520 --> 01:59:25.580
dashboard, you can download it. Let me upload inside your

01:59:25.580 --> 01:59:29.960
dashboard in a previous lecture itself. Let me upload inside

01:59:29.960 --> 01:59:32.840
your dashboard on your dashboard. So it's less the raw file

01:59:32.840 --> 01:59:38.640
download, right? So gen AI drive. Yeah. Gen AI certification

01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:41.160
bootcamp.

01:59:42.260 --> 01:59:45.840
So in your previous lecture, I'm appending this one, a 5th

01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:49.100
October lecture you have, right? So there itself, I'm going

01:59:49.100 --> 01:59:52.720
to upload a file.

01:59:55.200 --> 01:59:55.760
Okay.

02:00:12.860 --> 02:00:19.680
Okay. Fine guys. So you can go to your, uh, dashboard. Uh,

02:00:19.800 --> 02:00:27.590
you can go inside your batch basically. Not in this one. I

02:00:27.590 --> 02:00:29.050
don't know. I don't have access to it.

02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:37.680
So you're on and then go inside your batch, continue

02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:41.380
learning. And in your previous lecture, 5th October, right

02:00:41.380 --> 02:00:44.220
inside the resource section, you will be able to find out

02:00:44.220 --> 02:00:47.140
this one auto gen report generator. So this is the file

02:00:47.140 --> 02:00:49.360
which I have uploaded. You can try to click and then like

02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:52.040
maybe download it. Yeah. So it's, it's working for me. As

02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:56.480
you can see, downloading is trying to do a file that will,

02:00:56.520 --> 02:00:58.100
that should not give you a virus problem.

02:01:01.540 --> 02:01:05.700
Done everyone. Yeah. So yeah, now it is sending me like, uh,

02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:11.700
it has, it has sent me a beautiful email, I believe. Yeah. I

02:01:11.700 --> 02:01:14.360
have just received the email and

02:01:17.980 --> 02:01:20.780
the only thing which I have to do with this report is I have

02:01:20.780 --> 02:01:23.700
to map it with like a database. That's it. So every day it

02:01:23.700 --> 02:01:26.100
will run the query. It will like find out the, bring the

02:01:26.100 --> 02:01:30.700
data and then rest will be like done automatically. So as

02:01:30.700 --> 02:01:33.220
you can see, I'm able to receive the beautiful, beautiful

02:01:33.220 --> 02:01:36.160
report and that too with the analytics.

02:01:39.700 --> 02:01:44.800
Same issue. What next? Okay. So what next is like a run it,

02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:48.240
send a report now. So this is the bat file which I've given

02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:50.640
to you. If you are using a Windows machine, if you are not

02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:54.020
using a Windows machine, in that case, python scheduler dot

02:01:54.020 --> 02:01:58.800
py now. So this is the, it will, it will run. It will start

02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:01.500
sending the report, but yeah, I'll get the report by the

02:02:01.500 --> 02:02:03.900
way, because that's my like a configuration which is

02:02:03.900 --> 02:02:04.760
available there.

02:02:09.750 --> 02:02:11.770
If it is still showing you have virus detected, then you

02:02:11.770 --> 02:02:14.590
have to like, uh, switch off your, your antivirus. First of

02:02:14.590 --> 02:02:18.330
all, go to your security system security and then switch it

02:02:18.330 --> 02:02:21.050
off. Otherwise it will keep on giving you this issue.

02:02:57.880 --> 02:02:58.640
Done everyone.

02:03:12.900 --> 02:03:17.860
Uh, ran, hope report is going on your telegram, uh, yeah, I

02:03:17.860 --> 02:03:21.140
have received one report. So this is not my execution.

02:03:21.420 --> 02:03:25.460
Someone else has used it. So I got it here. I got it here as

02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:30.160
well. So yes, it's, it's like, uh, coming.

02:03:34.830 --> 02:03:39.510
How to run after import in a VS code. Simple. So inside of

02:03:39.510 --> 02:03:44.910
VS code, now let's suppose this is my code. So basically CLS

02:03:44.910 --> 02:03:50.190
code is python scheduler. And if you have to like, uh,

02:03:50.250 --> 02:03:54.030
schedule it, so just run python scheduler dot py. And if you

02:03:54.030 --> 02:03:57.030
have to test it now, then parameter is now, this is what I

02:03:57.030 --> 02:04:04.390
taught you right here. This part. Yeah. So run now means it

02:04:04.390 --> 02:04:07.350
will try to run now itself. Schedule means it will try to

02:04:07.350 --> 02:04:09.250
schedule it as per the type. I mean, and what does the

02:04:09.250 --> 02:04:11.810
timing, which I have given in my config file, I have given

02:04:11.810 --> 02:04:14.310
the timing. So you do time is basically nine AM IST, Asia,

02:04:14.370 --> 02:04:15.350
Kolkata time zone.

02:04:19.950 --> 02:04:23.090
It is showing schedule is a running. Yeah. So if you have

02:04:23.090 --> 02:04:26.930
like a run it with a schedule dot py, then yeah. If you have

02:04:26.930 --> 02:04:31.130
given a parameter as now, then obviously it will send me a

02:04:31.130 --> 02:04:34.090
report. I will be receiving a report or maybe in some time

02:04:34.090 --> 02:04:41.440
once it will like a complete the execution. Okay. So only

02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:43.760
one person I believe is able to run it. Uh, there are so

02:04:43.760 --> 02:04:46.140
many people. There are so many people here, but I don't know

02:04:46.140 --> 02:04:46.720
what's an issue.

02:04:52.760 --> 02:04:55.080
Still unable to download. Then switch off your security

02:04:55.080 --> 02:04:59.540
simple if you are not able to download. So your basically

02:04:59.540 --> 02:05:06.310
system is preventing this download in a virus scan. No one

02:05:06.310 --> 02:05:08.090
can do anything if you are not able to download it in your

02:05:08.090 --> 02:05:09.930
system, you just have to like switch off the security.

02:05:10.110 --> 02:05:10.450
That's it.

02:05:20.190 --> 02:05:24.690
Okay. So hope this project is super, super amazing for all

02:05:24.690 --> 02:05:28.630
of us. Now you can just use this code base to automate

02:05:28.630 --> 02:05:31.780
whatever you want. You want at least in terms of a reporting

02:05:31.780 --> 02:05:35.080
and then send a report at least to two places, maybe to a

02:05:35.080 --> 02:05:40.100
telegram, maybe to a Gmail, nothing to like a change over

02:05:40.100 --> 02:05:42.620
here. But yeah, so if you would like to change some sort of

02:05:42.620 --> 02:05:45.920
a data set for you, you can go ahead and you can try to

02:05:45.920 --> 02:05:50.280
change the data set. That's it. And everything is going to

02:05:50.280 --> 02:05:53.800
work as per your need. And even you can go for the

02:05:53.800 --> 02:05:56.900
deployment. Anyhow we have a lot of deployment classes going

02:05:56.900 --> 02:05:59.820
forward. So we'll be talking about it. But yeah. So if you

02:05:59.820 --> 02:06:01.880
would like to deploy these things, again, it's a easy piece

02:06:01.880 --> 02:06:03.580
of things like on a render at least.

02:06:09.930 --> 02:06:13.590
Error getting report error code 401. So message incorrect

02:06:13.590 --> 02:06:19.190
API provided, no API is correct. It should work. Just try to

02:06:19.190 --> 02:06:19.770
run it once again.

02:06:22.890 --> 02:06:26.190
What are the things we need to modify? Okay. So you have to

02:06:26.190 --> 02:06:28.750
basically modify only one thing in that case, your email

02:06:28.750 --> 02:06:33.470
sender. So go here, right. And you have to basically like

02:06:33.470 --> 02:06:36.850
figure it out that what is the procedure to send a message

02:06:36.850 --> 02:06:41.070
over Outlook. And just change this. Like a configuration,

02:06:41.330 --> 02:06:46.810
that's it. Only this configuration from this file. If you

02:06:46.810 --> 02:06:49.290
have to send it to a Joho, you can send it to Joho mail as

02:06:49.290 --> 02:06:52.070
well. So you just have to change this configuration. That's

02:06:52.070 --> 02:06:56.810
it. So environment wise, this one, you have to change it.

02:06:56.850 --> 02:07:02.450
That's it. Nothing much. Yes, sir. Learn new things from

02:07:02.450 --> 02:07:05.050
you. Okay. That's great. That was the whole idea. That was

02:07:05.050 --> 02:07:09.130
the whole purpose. So finally, guys, we have seen autogen as

02:07:09.130 --> 02:07:11.690
well. So autogen is not very different. The way we were

02:07:11.690 --> 02:07:16.970
creating an agent by using some other libraries. So autogen

02:07:16.970 --> 02:07:22.010
is also same. Now the question is same. If someone is going

02:07:22.010 --> 02:07:24.830
to ask you that which one you should use, again, that

02:07:24.830 --> 02:07:28.750
doesn't depends upon me. That depends upon my company, my

02:07:28.750 --> 02:07:31.790
manager. So whatever tie up my company has done, so I'll

02:07:31.790 --> 02:07:34.770
just go ahead with that one. Nothing is good. Nothing is

02:07:34.770 --> 02:07:38.170
bad. I can use any of these libraries and I can try to

02:07:38.170 --> 02:07:40.750
create them. So I'll just go ahead with the agents command

02:07:41.990 --> 02:07:48.570
to run the PI file, Python. How do we run a PI file? I mean,

02:07:48.590 --> 02:07:50.830
like after these many classes, don't ask me at least these

02:07:50.830 --> 02:07:54.510
questions, how to run the PI file. I mean, like Python is

02:07:54.510 --> 02:07:55.150
the command, right?

02:08:00.080 --> 02:08:02.240
Okay. So fine.

02:08:09.590 --> 02:08:12.910
Yes. So if you have to test it now, then pythons.py now,

02:08:13.050 --> 02:08:15.470
otherwise, if you have to schedule it for a later, then

02:08:15.470 --> 02:08:17.950
pythons.py. Okay. Right

02:08:20.150 --> 02:08:22.550
now unable to run it, I'll try myself after the class and

02:08:22.550 --> 02:08:26.630
once again visit the recording classes. To run it, I don't

02:08:26.630 --> 02:08:30.970
have to do much. It's like a minimalistic effort you have to

02:08:30.970 --> 02:08:37.710
put to run this entire files. Okay everyone. So hope this

02:08:37.710 --> 02:08:43.250
project is good. Tomorrow mostly I'll be talking about fine

02:08:43.250 --> 02:08:46.270
tuning. So basically we have to discuss about a fine tuning,

02:08:46.370 --> 02:08:50.010
a full fine tuning and then like we have to talk about our

02:08:50.010 --> 02:08:54.110
DPOs. We have to talk about prefet, Laura and Cora. So

02:08:54.110 --> 02:08:57.090
tomorrow that will be something that I'm going to discuss in

02:08:57.090 --> 02:09:01.010
your class and we are going to fine tune a model based on a

02:09:01.010 --> 02:09:03.650
different, different domain. So maybe we'll take some HR

02:09:03.650 --> 02:09:07.130
data. So based on HR data, we'll fine tune the model. Then

02:09:07.130 --> 02:09:10.330
we will take some sales data and based on sales data, we'll

02:09:10.330 --> 02:09:13.450
fine tune some of the models. Then we'll take some finance

02:09:13.450 --> 02:09:16.050
data, let's suppose. And then based on the finance data, we

02:09:16.050 --> 02:09:19.250
are going to fine tune some legal. So we are. So these four

02:09:19.250 --> 02:09:21.630
or five categories I have already defined in terms of doing

02:09:21.630 --> 02:09:26.490
a fine tuning. So all of this fine tuning I will be doing by

02:09:26.490 --> 02:09:31.410
using a different, different approach. And yeah, so we'll be

02:09:31.410 --> 02:09:34.070
able to build a model and then we'll be able to even test

02:09:34.070 --> 02:09:35.750
the model in my tomorrow's class.

02:09:40.580 --> 02:09:43.580
Can you create some workflow in Autogen Visual Studio? Yeah,

02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:48.600
that will be quick. I can do it. I think. Let me go here. I

02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:51.760
mean like if I have to run the, you know, this one, I just

02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:54.860
call. I can do it. I can call like a predefined team. Let me

02:09:54.860 --> 02:10:00.280
delete this part. I'll create a new one. Yeah. So here.

02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:03.720
Okay. Let's, let's talk about this Autogen Studio, right?

02:10:03.820 --> 02:10:07.540
I'll just create like a one small, very small agent, right?

02:10:07.620 --> 02:10:11.700
A very, very small one. So here maybe I can go and I can try

02:10:11.700 --> 02:10:15.080
to create a new team, right? I can try to create a new team

02:10:15.080 --> 02:10:18.240
and I can switch off and I will be able to see a complete

02:10:18.240 --> 02:10:21.340
like a, you know, a JSON file format as well. The way. You

02:10:21.340 --> 02:10:24.100
know. Any time used to give you a JSON in the similar

02:10:24.100 --> 02:10:28.320
manner, even this is giving you, but as it's very new, so

02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:29.840
it's fine now.

02:10:32.030 --> 02:10:35.090
So what we can do, uh, and

02:10:38.260 --> 02:10:41.200
I'm like, I have created just a default team. Now when

02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:43.460
you're going to create a default team, let

02:10:50.020 --> 02:10:51.220
me start from the scratch.

02:11:03.770 --> 02:11:08.550
Yeah. I have received a report. Okay. So let's talk about

02:11:08.550 --> 02:11:11.850
basically like a building this agent inside this Autogen

02:11:11.850 --> 02:11:16.890
Studio. Yeah. So I'll try to click on, uh, basically a team

02:11:16.890 --> 02:11:22.770
builder or maybe, uh, not new session, uh, just to delete

02:11:22.770 --> 02:11:26.090
this session for now. Okay. So I'll try to click on this

02:11:26.090 --> 02:11:29.970
team builder first of all, and I can try to click on new

02:11:29.970 --> 02:11:33.290
team. Yeah. So let's suppose a default team 17 I'm trying to

02:11:33.290 --> 02:11:37.150
create. So by default it is going to give you, uh, like a

02:11:37.150 --> 02:11:40.110
default team. So this is nothing but orchestrator, which is

02:11:40.110 --> 02:11:44.370
going to call my agent. Yeah. That I want by the way. Yeah.

02:11:44.810 --> 02:11:49.050
So here by default, as you can see, it is trying to like,

02:11:49.110 --> 02:11:53.190
uh, you know, uh, attach it, this particular team with the

02:11:53.190 --> 02:11:57.750
assistant agent, by the way, let's suppose I would like to

02:11:57.750 --> 02:12:01.730
attach more agent to this particular team, right? This

02:12:01.730 --> 02:12:05.290
particular team. So what I can do, so I can try to, uh, pick

02:12:05.290 --> 02:12:09.430
and choose a agent from this one. So this particular tab. So

02:12:09.430 --> 02:12:11.790
let's suppose I would like to like, uh, you know, uh, give

02:12:11.790 --> 02:12:16.090
an access off. Bev surfing agent as well. Then I would like

02:12:16.090 --> 02:12:19.510
to give an access of maybe a couple of more agent user proxy

02:12:19.510 --> 02:12:22.150
agent. I believe this is the agent that we have used just

02:12:22.150 --> 02:12:25.790
now, right? User proxy agent, uh, by the way. So which was

02:12:25.790 --> 02:12:28.450
like a calling a different, different, like a tool for me,

02:12:28.510 --> 02:12:33.590
or I can go here inside a gallery and try to create a new

02:12:33.590 --> 02:12:36.870
agent that is also possible. Now how I can create a new

02:12:36.870 --> 02:12:39.550
agent. So for example, if I'm trying to create a telegram

02:12:39.550 --> 02:12:42.770
agent, telegram agent, right? So. So which will try to, you

02:12:42.770 --> 02:12:45.610
know, send a message to a telegram. So I can, I can write a

02:12:45.610 --> 02:12:48.810
description over here. I can try to, you know, uh, give a

02:12:48.810 --> 02:12:52.950
name over here. I can try to configure a model over here,

02:12:52.990 --> 02:12:57.030
right? I can give a system message and then telegram. So

02:12:57.030 --> 02:12:59.230
technically I have to call some functions, right? So which

02:12:59.230 --> 02:13:03.690
will send a, you know, message to a telegram so that I can

02:13:03.690 --> 02:13:07.690
try to add it as a tool. This is the meaning by the way,

02:13:07.750 --> 02:13:10.810
right? This is the meaning of an agent. So agent will be

02:13:10.810 --> 02:13:13.070
having a system. System message agent will be having its own

02:13:13.070 --> 02:13:16.770
description, its own name, and it will be having a tool

02:13:16.770 --> 02:13:20.270
access one, two, or multiple, right? And here, uh, the

02:13:20.270 --> 02:13:23.210
function that you will be able to find out, it's a pure

02:13:23.210 --> 02:13:26.650
Pythonic function guys. The way we write a function, right?

02:13:26.930 --> 02:13:30.410
In Python. So it's actually a Python, like, you know, the

02:13:30.410 --> 02:13:33.030
interface that they have given to you. I'll, I'll show it to

02:13:33.030 --> 02:13:37.050
you just a minute, right? So for example, uh, Bev surf

02:13:37.050 --> 02:13:41.550
agent, uh, here, no tool has been attached. I'll go ahead

02:13:41.550 --> 02:13:43.250
and show it to you. Let's go to tool itself. Let's suppose,

02:13:43.450 --> 02:13:45.790
uh, this is a tool which has been created. I can create a

02:13:45.790 --> 02:13:47.870
multiple tool. I have created so many tools. As you can see

02:13:47.870 --> 02:13:50.590
new tool, new tool, new tool, right? So in my system, I was

02:13:50.590 --> 02:13:53.170
doing a lot of experimentation and while doing this, I have

02:13:53.170 --> 02:13:55.890
created all of these tools. Some of the tool you will be

02:13:55.890 --> 02:13:58.350
able to find out by default. For example, calculated tool,

02:13:58.410 --> 02:14:01.930
tool is what a function, right? You can go and you can try

02:14:01.930 --> 02:14:04.590
to check just a simple plain Pythonic function. Nothing

02:14:04.590 --> 02:14:08.670
much, right? Nothing much. Uh, image generation tool again,

02:14:08.750 --> 02:14:13.030
plain Pythonic function. So. Def generate our images and

02:14:13.030 --> 02:14:15.970
then it is like a going to take some query calling

02:14:15.970 --> 02:14:18.830
particularly the LLM. So this is basically a function which

02:14:18.830 --> 02:14:22.110
is calling LLM, generating the images and then returning you

02:14:22.110 --> 02:14:27.290
the file. Simple, right? So Bing search, nothing again. So

02:14:27.290 --> 02:14:31.490
it is like a trying to call, take all this parameter and

02:14:31.490 --> 02:14:35.630
then it is trying to call up Bing API. That's it. That's it.

02:14:35.690 --> 02:14:39.150
Right? And then it is trying to return. So you can try to

02:14:39.150 --> 02:14:43.610
write any of your. Basically like a Google search tool, same

02:14:43.610 --> 02:14:45.850
thing. So you can come over here, you can check the Python

02:14:45.850 --> 02:14:49.310
code so you can write any Pythonic function. So let's

02:14:49.310 --> 02:14:51.910
suppose I have to send a message to a telegram or maybe I

02:14:51.910 --> 02:14:54.390
have to access some different separate system which is out

02:14:54.390 --> 02:14:57.630
there, which like maybe I have to access my Gmail or

02:14:57.630 --> 02:15:00.790
outlook, maybe my Jira, maybe my Salesforce, maybe some

02:15:00.790 --> 02:15:06.390
databases. It's function that we write, right? So here as a

02:15:06.390 --> 02:15:09.790
tool, we can try to write any kind of a function, Pythonic

02:15:09.790 --> 02:15:13.270
function and we can keep it as a tool. Now where tool will

02:15:13.270 --> 02:15:16.690
be used by the way. So tool will be used inside the agents.

02:15:17.090 --> 02:15:21.110
Yes. Inside the agents. So how to create an agent ad. So by

02:15:21.110 --> 02:15:23.850
default assistant agent is given to you. So what this

02:15:23.850 --> 02:15:26.510
assistant agent is doing? So an agent that provide a

02:15:26.510 --> 02:15:30.710
assistant with the ability to use tool name is given model

02:15:30.710 --> 02:15:34.290
is provided by a system configuration. You are a helpful

02:15:34.290 --> 02:15:37.530
assistant solve tasks carefully when done say terminate.

02:15:37.650 --> 02:15:40.570
Okay. And then there is no tool which has been added. Okay.

02:15:40.590 --> 02:15:43.850
Because in agent tool, memory, all of these things are

02:15:43.850 --> 02:15:47.310
optional. What is mandatory? Mandatory thing is basically

02:15:47.310 --> 02:15:51.890
LLM, right? So here you can see that I can try to add a LLM,

02:15:51.970 --> 02:15:55.410
right? So configure model and then I can try to configure. I

02:15:55.410 --> 02:15:59.050
just have to pass the API key over here now. So model wise

02:15:59.050 --> 02:16:01.730
even they have given you like these many options. You have

02:16:01.730 --> 02:16:04.230
to pass the API key by the way. Yeah. You have to pass or

02:16:04.230 --> 02:16:07.770
you can try to add any other models. Yeah. You can try to

02:16:07.770 --> 02:16:11.930
add any other model over here. That's okay. Fine. So base

02:16:11.930 --> 02:16:14.490
URL timeout, all these things you can try to add. So maybe

02:16:14.490 --> 02:16:19.330
you can try to add basically a UD API over here. It's

02:16:19.330 --> 02:16:22.430
providing LLMs by the way, right? It's providing LLMs. So

02:16:22.430 --> 02:16:25.370
here let me pass my API key. Let me test the model first

02:16:25.370 --> 02:16:28.750
because LLMs should be working even tool, whether tool is

02:16:28.750 --> 02:16:32.810
working or not. But yeah, LLM is supposed to work. So open

02:16:32.810 --> 02:16:39.970
AI, let me test it. Error. You can find. Okay. It's a

02:16:39.970 --> 02:16:43.930
correct API key, I believe I have given, best

02:16:50.710 --> 02:16:57.950
error testing this 401 incorrect API key provided. Okay.

02:16:59.610 --> 02:17:02.430
Incorrect API key. How it could be?

02:17:05.380 --> 02:17:10.620
Let me provide the correct one then. Project.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:21.640
Maybe

02:17:29.510 --> 02:17:34.850
I can go to my open AI account. Open AI API. Key.

02:17:43.580 --> 02:17:47.020
so I just

02:17:57.190 --> 02:18:03.370
created the new one save changes and then test it yeah now

02:18:03.370 --> 02:18:06.830
it's working yeah so API key I have like a given so my model

02:18:06.830 --> 02:18:09.790
is working so technically I am able to call my LLM similarly

02:18:09.790 --> 02:18:12.930
for Mistral for Anthropic it's nothing you just have to

02:18:12.930 --> 02:18:15.150
provide the API key that's it all this configuration they

02:18:15.150 --> 02:18:17.690
have already done so technically to access any kind of a

02:18:17.690 --> 02:18:21.170
model I just need like a URL and I just need maybe like API

02:18:21.170 --> 02:18:24.370
key and all the other parameter so they have already like a

02:18:24.370 --> 02:18:26.790
configured it right they have already configured it they

02:18:26.790 --> 02:18:29.010
have already created the wrapper you can try to check the

02:18:29.010 --> 02:18:32.410
JSON file you will be able to find out the exact same right

02:18:32.410 --> 02:18:35.630
you will be able to find out the exact same so you can just

02:18:35.630 --> 02:18:38.930
feed your API key and then rest is completely fine so model

02:18:38.930 --> 02:18:43.590
is fine now my agent will be using basically a model I have

02:18:43.590 --> 02:18:46.150
to give an access of the model whatever model that we have

02:18:46.150 --> 02:18:50.770
and my agent can use may use a tool and may not use a tool

02:18:50.770 --> 02:18:54.150
that depends right. That depends basically and here is a

02:18:54.150 --> 02:18:57.510
team team is nothing but your workflow yeah your final flow

02:18:57.510 --> 02:19:02.550
basically so here team builder I'll go here and as you can

02:19:02.550 --> 02:19:07.350
see so I have created a team now team is having an access of

02:19:07.350 --> 02:19:12.330
one of the agent right one of the agent now obviously I can

02:19:12.330 --> 02:19:15.450
provide a LLM to this one okay so let me go and let me

02:19:15.450 --> 02:19:18.470
provide the LLM to this one drag

02:19:24.620 --> 02:19:30.720
and drop is little bit tough here. Okay so I have to provide

02:19:30.720 --> 02:19:33.900
the model not an issue so what I will do I'll click on this

02:19:33.900 --> 02:19:38.220
model open a model I'll drag and drop simple now this agent

02:19:38.220 --> 02:19:41.720
is having what this agent is having a model access as you

02:19:41.720 --> 02:19:45.760
can see yeah I can try to maybe like a give a multiple model

02:19:45.760 --> 02:19:49.260
that's completely okay so this agent is having a model

02:19:49.260 --> 02:19:53.480
access now now if I would like to like a give some sort of a

02:19:53.480 --> 02:19:56.420
tool access to this one means a function access to this one.

02:19:56.420 --> 02:20:01.020
So maybe a calculator function access okay so done I would

02:20:01.020 --> 02:20:05.040
like to give a maybe fetch web page option like a tool

02:20:05.040 --> 02:20:10.740
option to this one okay I can I can like do that as well so

02:20:10.740 --> 02:20:14.640
do a Google search so now I you can see that to one single

02:20:14.640 --> 02:20:18.380
agent I'm providing one model and two tools I can provide

02:20:18.380 --> 02:20:21.740
multiple tool as many tool as possible I can try to provide

02:20:21.740 --> 02:20:26.220
it so and again I can I can try to attach a multiple agent.

02:20:26.220 --> 02:20:30.540
So let's suppose in a single team so I have to attach a

02:20:30.540 --> 02:20:35.140
couple of more agents so maybe a bev surfing agent I would

02:20:35.140 --> 02:20:39.520
like to assign so parallel to this you will be able to find

02:20:39.520 --> 02:20:43.860
out that it is having a bev surfing agent now bev surfing

02:20:43.860 --> 02:20:48.980
agent needs what LLM access right LLM access basically so I

02:20:48.980 --> 02:20:52.160
can I can try to provide the LLM access to this one maybe

02:20:52.160 --> 02:20:57.100
means a model access. Okay

02:21:01.290 --> 02:21:05.270
fine so this is how I will be able to create a complete flow

02:21:05.270 --> 02:21:09.290
I can keep on adding more and more and more and more agent

02:21:09.290 --> 02:21:13.210
over here or I can keep on adding more and more tools over

02:21:13.210 --> 02:21:18.270
here and I will be able to basically like a create any kind

02:21:18.270 --> 02:21:24.250
of a system that I want simple yeah. So now once I will be

02:21:24.250 --> 02:21:27.270
able to create it I can click on save so changes will be

02:21:27.270 --> 02:21:30.950
saved over here. Then I can try to click on run. Now they

02:21:30.950 --> 02:21:33.430
have given you a similar kind of interface the kind of

02:21:33.430 --> 02:21:36.830
interface that we have seen recently in a agent kit in

02:21:36.830 --> 02:21:41.250
OpenAI right. So let's suppose if I'm going to say hi right

02:21:41.250 --> 02:21:51.950
so stop reason what is the capital of okay it is not able to

02:21:51.950 --> 02:21:53.410
invoke.

02:22:31.950 --> 02:22:39.710
Here looks fine. This looks fine. This looks fine.

02:22:42.490 --> 02:22:45.430
One error so failed to initiate the component tool cannot be

02:22:45.430 --> 02:22:49.970
used with a workstation check that component can be properly

02:22:49.970 --> 02:22:54.370
given the final okay fine. So it's saying me that tool

02:22:54.370 --> 02:22:57.070
cannot be used and

02:23:01.130 --> 02:23:04.110
the problem that you will be able to find out that it's it's

02:23:04.110 --> 02:23:06.630
very difficult you know with this UI they have not created

02:23:06.630 --> 02:23:10.670
in a way where I can go and I can try to delete

02:23:13.780 --> 02:23:19.220
it so I have to maybe go into a edit mode this one. Then.

02:23:19.340 --> 02:23:23.380
Okay. Then I can just like let me remove this entire thing

02:23:23.380 --> 02:23:28.080
save changes so tool calling I'm not going to give for now

02:23:28.080 --> 02:23:35.870
it was giving me an issue for that maybe I can I'll just

02:23:35.870 --> 02:23:40.950
test this flow so agent and then this one save it and then

02:23:40.950 --> 02:23:48.230
run it run it. So what is the capital of the France yeah so

02:23:48.230 --> 02:23:52.010
now you can see that it has started executing right. It has

02:23:52.010 --> 02:23:54.150
started executing so I have just asked the question what is

02:23:54.150 --> 02:23:57.610
the capital of France so what agent has done so basically it

02:23:57.610 --> 02:24:01.250
has like a called assistant agent the capital of France is

02:24:01.250 --> 02:24:04.910
Paris and then call for the termination and what is the step

02:24:04.910 --> 02:24:07.910
that it has taken internally so the step that it has taken

02:24:07.910 --> 02:24:10.670
internally is basically this this this right the step which

02:24:10.670 --> 02:24:13.970
it has taken internally is technically this this this. So

02:24:13.970 --> 02:24:18.210
this is the entire step it has taken so user message then

02:24:18.210 --> 02:24:21.830
called this particular agent and then ended this one. Now

02:24:21.830 --> 02:24:25.410
this flow is tested what I can do maybe I can try to add a

02:24:25.410 --> 02:24:27.850
couple of more things over here yeah

02:24:38.440 --> 02:24:43.300
so here I can try to add maybe like a tool wise let's add a

02:24:43.300 --> 02:24:47.160
calculator tool let's test it with the calculator tool. So

02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:51.620
yeah calculator tool added save it with tool it's giving an

02:24:51.620 --> 02:24:56.460
error maybe their tool is not configured properly so by the

02:24:56.460 --> 02:24:59.560
time I'm going to attach this calculator tool it's like

02:24:59.560 --> 02:25:07.660
giving me an issue. Okay. So I have to remove let me add

02:25:07.660 --> 02:25:09.380
some delete

02:25:11.490 --> 02:25:12.190
so

02:25:20.990 --> 02:25:27.950
maybe it's not working not because of my fault because of

02:25:27.950 --> 02:25:33.110
their fault by the way because I haven't done anything so

02:25:33.110 --> 02:25:36.430
yeah no with tool so it's giving me an issue so maybe I have

02:25:36.430 --> 02:25:39.730
to remove this tool from here so

02:25:51.250 --> 02:25:59.070
yes we are able to run autogen. Okay. Now what I can do I

02:25:59.070 --> 02:26:02.750
can maybe try to try attaching a multiple agents let me see

02:26:02.750 --> 02:26:08.250
so verification assistant the user proxy agent. Okay so let

02:26:08.250 --> 02:26:16.310
me attach one new agent yeah so basically user proxy means

02:26:16.310 --> 02:26:20.390
an agent that can represent a human user through the input

02:26:20.390 --> 02:26:27.050
function. Maybe I can click on save. Okay. But before that I

02:26:27.050 --> 02:26:35.570
have to remove all the tools from here save changes okay run

02:26:35.570 --> 02:26:41.810
it now I can try to attach maybe a web surfing agent to this

02:26:41.810 --> 02:26:49.800
one so technically now I have three agent I have over here I

02:26:49.800 --> 02:26:56.220
can try to run it and I can try to test it like so it will

02:26:56.220 --> 02:26:59.080
decide like which agent it is supposed to. Okay. Which agent

02:26:59.080 --> 02:27:03.400
it is supposed to call automatically so yeah I have given an

02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:06.340
access of three agents so basically it is trying to use this

02:27:06.340 --> 02:27:10.660
particular agent to make this particular call so this is how

02:27:10.660 --> 02:27:14.040
guys you all will be able to you know drag and drop and then

02:27:14.040 --> 02:27:18.860
you will be able to create this entire like a flow but again

02:27:18.860 --> 02:27:24.820
like I told you it's it's not production ready so you should

02:27:24.820 --> 02:27:28.420
not like use it if you are using it maybe use a code format.

02:27:28.420 --> 02:27:34.520
The way we have used it today but not in this way. Finally

02:27:34.520 --> 02:27:34.760
one

02:27:37.610 --> 02:27:42.650
concluding N8n interface N8n is way beyond basically any

02:27:42.650 --> 02:27:45.530
other system which people have created so far because see

02:27:45.530 --> 02:27:50.650
the reason was very simple N8n is like when they have

02:27:50.650 --> 02:27:53.990
started basically N8n six year or I think five six year back

02:27:53.990 --> 02:27:56.790
at that point of a time we were not even talking about this

02:27:56.790 --> 02:27:59.270
agentic approach no agents was there so they have started

02:27:59.270 --> 02:28:03.010
basically with the base. Where they have started automating

02:28:03.010 --> 02:28:08.110
all the like tools and all the like softwares which was

02:28:08.110 --> 02:28:12.130
available so far right and then when AI came into a picture

02:28:12.130 --> 02:28:15.370
so they have added a node which is nothing but an agentic

02:28:15.370 --> 02:28:18.970
node that we have already used it right and like I said so

02:28:18.970 --> 02:28:22.570
automation is not always about an agentic even till today.

02:28:22.730 --> 02:28:26.770
So we do a 70 80 percent automation and those 70 80 percent

02:28:26.770 --> 02:28:31.010
automations are non agentic. I know every every time I don't

02:28:31.010 --> 02:28:35.170
think that we should like you know call agents yeah it's not

02:28:35.170 --> 02:28:41.230
required and flexibility wise I'm not loving autogen at all

02:28:41.230 --> 02:28:43.990
at least so far whatever development that they have done so

02:28:43.990 --> 02:28:47.810
according to me crew as would go is way better right

02:28:52.460 --> 02:28:56.220
again shall I show you basically this agent kit as well open

02:28:56.220 --> 02:28:59.840
agent kit and what is the flaw in that agent kit shall I

02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:09.650
show you that. Yeah. If you want okay so okay what was my

02:29:09.650 --> 02:29:12.650
official account yeah this was my official account okay so

02:29:12.650 --> 02:29:15.530
let me show you that agent kit as well which and very

02:29:15.530 --> 02:29:18.970
quickly you all will be able to observe that what is the

02:29:18.970 --> 02:29:23.270
actual difference between N8n and you know agent kit so okay

02:29:23.270 --> 02:29:27.890
let me talk about agent kit so here I'll just go agent open

02:29:27.890 --> 02:29:32.970
AI I'll search open AI agent builder which is technically an

02:29:32.970 --> 02:29:33.870
agent kit. So here I'll just go agent open AI I'll search

02:29:33.870 --> 02:29:34.450
open AI agent builder which is technically an agent kit and

02:29:34.450 --> 02:29:39.710
it is going to give me a link for this agent kit not this

02:29:39.710 --> 02:29:43.150
one let me click on this and here open AI agent builder

02:29:43.150 --> 02:29:47.330
simple this this URL you have to go through now

02:29:47.330 --> 02:29:50.570
philosophically it's same philosophically you will not be

02:29:50.570 --> 02:29:53.990
able to find out anything different over here but the

02:29:53.990 --> 02:29:56.030
problem is that that they are just trying to follow the

02:29:56.030 --> 02:29:58.990
agentic approach right that that's a first number problem

02:29:58.990 --> 02:30:02.710
the second number problem is that that. Yeah. So even though

02:30:02.710 --> 02:30:05.770
they are following the agentic approach they have not given

02:30:05.770 --> 02:30:11.330
many options in terms of connecting a node basically and as

02:30:11.330 --> 02:30:15.210
a first principle they are trying to adopt MCPs I'll show

02:30:15.210 --> 02:30:17.830
you that part right because I have spent a lot of time over

02:30:17.830 --> 02:30:20.470
there you can just see like how many test project I have

02:30:20.470 --> 02:30:23.030
created so far so the day they have released it so I have

02:30:23.030 --> 02:30:25.970
spent a lot of time I have like trusted it I have tried it I

02:30:25.970 --> 02:30:29.570
have tried many things by the way to add multiple tools. And

02:30:29.570 --> 02:30:31.690
then like I have created a YouTube channel. I have created a

02:30:31.690 --> 02:30:37.630
YouTube video where you know I have given my opinion so let

02:30:37.630 --> 02:30:40.430
me create one new project for this so let's suppose I am

02:30:40.430 --> 02:30:45.370
creating like a test 56 over here and by default so they are

02:30:45.370 --> 02:30:48.690
giving you some project here as you can see let's suppose I

02:30:48.690 --> 02:30:51.610
am not going to use this they are just a template and these

02:30:51.610 --> 02:30:54.330
are the eight minute project some of the project they have

02:30:54.330 --> 02:30:56.590
shown in the demo and someone was saying in the beginning

02:30:56.590 --> 02:30:59.110
that it was like taking eight minute but in eight minute

02:30:59.110 --> 02:31:02.430
they were not able to achieve anything concrete. By the way

02:31:02.430 --> 02:31:07.170
for example this planning helper if I am going to click on

02:31:07.170 --> 02:31:11.390
that so there is a trigger basically a start right so

02:31:11.390 --> 02:31:13.590
whenever you are going to or let's suppose I will not follow

02:31:13.590 --> 02:31:16.670
this I will create my own flow right I will create my own

02:31:16.670 --> 02:31:18.930
flow so whenever you are going to create your own project

02:31:18.930 --> 02:31:23.250
just click on create by default start node will be there and

02:31:23.250 --> 02:31:28.230
my agent node will be there now so start means what so

02:31:28.230 --> 02:31:31.610
basically like you can try to add a variable. Or you can

02:31:31.610 --> 02:31:34.850
just like try to start with the chat that's a very first

02:31:34.850 --> 02:31:42.790
problem even with respect to this this like this one we are

02:31:42.790 --> 02:31:46.390
able to test it only with chat right I mean like are you

02:31:46.390 --> 02:31:49.090
going to ask everyone to like come on a chat and then like

02:31:49.090 --> 02:31:53.010
only by doing a chat you will be able to invoke an agent in

02:31:53.010 --> 02:31:56.250
all the cases this is this will not be a requirement and the

02:31:56.250 --> 02:31:59.670
problem is that that every time they are giving their own

02:31:59.670 --> 02:32:02.870
chat interface what if if I would like to invoke my agent

02:32:02.870 --> 02:32:05.390
through a whatsapp to a telegram through my gmail right

02:32:05.390 --> 02:32:09.610
maybe through some webhook maybe the webhook of my payment

02:32:09.610 --> 02:32:14.130
gateway right so that's a very very first restriction so you

02:32:14.130 --> 02:32:17.670
will be able to see even inside a autogen for now right that

02:32:17.670 --> 02:32:21.790
you will be able to do it in in this UI mode yeah so in a

02:32:21.790 --> 02:32:24.730
code mode as we have already discussed about the code it's

02:32:24.730 --> 02:32:27.570
under my control so I am able to invoke it with the help of

02:32:27.570 --> 02:32:29.950
my scheduler. Basically scheduler is working as a webhook.

02:32:29.970 --> 02:32:32.170
This is a trigger point for me so where I am scheduling it

02:32:32.170 --> 02:32:35.050
at a particular time so in a code I have a flexibility but

02:32:35.050 --> 02:32:37.850
here the very first problem which I see is like this chat

02:32:37.850 --> 02:32:41.530
interface I don't want it by the way right similar kind of a

02:32:41.530 --> 02:32:44.190
problem you will be able to find out even over here what

02:32:44.190 --> 02:32:47.330
they have done to overcome that problem they have given you

02:32:47.330 --> 02:32:49.790
a chat kit so once I am going to publish it you will be able

02:32:49.790 --> 02:32:52.470
to see a chat kit and you can go and you can try to create

02:32:52.470 --> 02:32:56.170
your own chat interface the way you want but again that is a

02:32:56.170 --> 02:32:59.970
problem I don't want a chat itself let's suppose right. I

02:32:59.970 --> 02:33:02.530
don't want a chat I just wanted to automate some process and

02:33:02.530 --> 02:33:06.770
like automatically system should call or maybe based on some

02:33:06.770 --> 02:33:09.990
event it should get triggered automatically that option is

02:33:09.990 --> 02:33:12.970
missing that's the very first problem second problem is okay

02:33:12.970 --> 02:33:15.990
fine this is a start node then they have given you a simple

02:33:15.990 --> 02:33:19.410
plain agent node and this is basically a plain agent and now

02:33:19.410 --> 02:33:22.310
what is the meaning of agent agent means you can give a name

02:33:22.310 --> 02:33:25.830
so my test agent let's suppose I have given a name and then

02:33:25.830 --> 02:33:28.310
I can give an instruction over here so whatever items which

02:33:28.310 --> 02:33:31.090
I would like to write. Okay. You are assistant agent you are

02:33:31.090 --> 02:33:33.870
a research agent professor agent whatever so I can try to

02:33:33.870 --> 02:33:37.210
write it down over here in this one and then obviously the

02:33:37.210 --> 02:33:41.930
mandatory things for agent is LLM right now again the

02:33:41.930 --> 02:33:44.970
problem that you will be able to see so you will be able to

02:33:44.970 --> 02:33:50.610
access a LLMs only from a GPT right only from a GPT let's

02:33:50.610 --> 02:33:52.990
suppose if you are looking for some LLM outs from outside

02:33:52.990 --> 02:33:56.350
you won't be able to integrate it at least in autogen you

02:33:56.350 --> 02:34:01.630
will be able to see that they have given you. Multi model

02:34:01.630 --> 02:34:04.670
access right so at least like you can you can try to call

02:34:04.670 --> 02:34:09.370
your own model right which is somehow it's fine and in a

02:34:09.370 --> 02:34:12.230
code mode so obviously I can try to call any number of like

02:34:12.230 --> 02:34:15.830
a models but the major problem over here is that that they

02:34:15.830 --> 02:34:18.110
are trying to keep you in their own ecosystem which is bad

02:34:18.110 --> 02:34:21.690
right which is not at all good and not feasible second part

02:34:21.690 --> 02:34:28.910
is so in case of this at least autogen I'm doing all this

02:34:28.910 --> 02:34:31.230
combination of configuration locally and I can so I can try

02:34:31.230 --> 02:34:34.590
to deploy it on my own server in case of n8n again so I can

02:34:34.590 --> 02:34:37.610
try to deploy it on my own server here the problem is that

02:34:37.610 --> 02:34:41.890
data is going to open AI and that's a major concern again

02:34:41.890 --> 02:34:44.870
because many of my client will not even agree that why

02:34:44.870 --> 02:34:47.530
you're sending my data to them right because everyone knows

02:34:47.530 --> 02:34:50.470
that that they can like use my data in the way they want

02:34:50.470 --> 02:34:53.630
basically so it's a very closed system it's not a open

02:34:53.630 --> 02:34:56.050
source that they have created that's a another problem that

02:34:56.050 --> 02:34:59.210
you all will be able to find out right. Okay. If I'm able to

02:34:59.210 --> 02:35:03.470
create an agent and then maybe I'm able to like you know to

02:35:03.470 --> 02:35:07.130
this agent let's suppose if I have to give an access access

02:35:07.130 --> 02:35:11.630
of a tool because agent means what instruction model and

02:35:11.630 --> 02:35:14.510
tool right okay let's click on this plus let's click on this

02:35:14.510 --> 02:35:17.630
tool now tool wise once you are going to click you will be

02:35:17.630 --> 02:35:22.770
able to find out these many options so in case of n8n they

02:35:22.770 --> 02:35:26.430
have given you all the nodes and all those nodes are nothing

02:35:26.430 --> 02:35:31.070
but simple HTTPS request. Right when they have given you

02:35:31.070 --> 02:35:34.350
some gmail send message node to a gmail to telegram or maybe

02:35:34.350 --> 02:35:36.390
to connect with the sales force to connect with the

02:35:36.390 --> 02:35:39.410
databases technically it's nothing but it's a glorified you

02:35:39.410 --> 02:35:43.510
can say HTTPS request but yeah so as a layman user you are

02:35:43.510 --> 02:35:46.950
getting just as a field just you have to fill those APIs and

02:35:46.950 --> 02:35:50.530
then URL and then it works as simple as that right glorified

02:35:50.530 --> 02:35:55.150
you can say HTTPS request but still it's important although

02:35:55.150 --> 02:35:57.910
it's a glorified one but yeah it's important and n8n has

02:35:57.910 --> 02:36:01.330
done that and they have like a 400 500 plus connectors they

02:36:01.330 --> 02:36:03.390
have given to you technically a node they have given to you

02:36:03.390 --> 02:36:07.490
now what they have given to you here just like this one

02:36:07.490 --> 02:36:10.010
client tool mcp file search web search and code interpreter

02:36:10.010 --> 02:36:12.930
now file search web search is just a generic thing right so

02:36:13.530 --> 02:36:16.650
they have they have actually adopted a mcp approach model

02:36:16.650 --> 02:36:19.410
context protocol approach which is again another protocol.

02:36:19.790 --> 02:36:24.330
So once you will click on this mcp so with the help of this

02:36:24.330 --> 02:36:28.230
mcps of gmail mcps of google calendar mcps of this google

02:36:28.230 --> 02:36:33.810
drive. You will be able to connect it again so mcp is new

02:36:33.810 --> 02:36:38.650
that's the first part right many system have not exposed

02:36:38.650 --> 02:36:42.710
their system as a mcp or maybe you have to go and you have

02:36:42.710 --> 02:36:47.350
to write your own mcp expose that as a mcp tool and then you

02:36:47.350 --> 02:36:52.150
will have to consume it right that's again another headache

02:36:52.150 --> 02:36:56.510
just give me a simple authentication login just like in it

02:36:56.510 --> 02:36:59.750
and it's giving you right. And then let me like a connect

02:36:59.750 --> 02:37:03.470
and when I have tested this mcp it's not working by the way

02:37:03.470 --> 02:37:06.710
yeah on that day at least it was not working two days back I

02:37:06.710 --> 02:37:08.910
don't know whether they have fixed this issue or not because

02:37:08.910 --> 02:37:11.610
I have tried connecting my gmail my calendar my drive in a

02:37:11.610 --> 02:37:15.950
mcp by the way yeah and it was not working so their mcp tool

02:37:15.950 --> 02:37:20.350
is not working maybe they have fixed this issue by now I

02:37:20.350 --> 02:37:23.350
don't know you can connect your custom mcps as well so

02:37:23.350 --> 02:37:26.370
simple url let's suppose I am hosting somewhere so url then

02:37:26.370 --> 02:37:29.450
name then description and then api key. Of the mcp and then

02:37:29.450 --> 02:37:31.950
you will be able to connect means when I am going to teach

02:37:31.950 --> 02:37:34.890
you in your class that how to create a mcps so obviously

02:37:34.890 --> 02:37:38.430
after creating a mcps we can expose those mcps right and

02:37:38.430 --> 02:37:42.050
technically you can try to give that url and the

02:37:42.050 --> 02:37:44.530
authentication token and you will be able to consume those

02:37:44.530 --> 02:37:49.110
mcp here itself as simple as that but yeah they are like not

02:37:49.110 --> 02:37:51.150
going in a node based approach they are technically

02:37:51.150 --> 02:37:54.370
following a mcp approach that's their architecture design in

02:37:54.370 --> 02:37:57.830
a back end and with the help of that I will be able to do a

02:37:57.830 --> 02:38:01.470
tool calling. Right I will be able to call the outer world

02:38:01.470 --> 02:38:05.450
by the way so this is again one of the biggest restriction

02:38:05.450 --> 02:38:09.570
because I need an access of as many tools as possible right

02:38:09.570 --> 02:38:15.190
and technically like a basically the kind of a node that any

02:38:15.190 --> 02:38:19.190
time has created so far in last six year if they will start

02:38:19.190 --> 02:38:23.170
creating it it will take time. I think somewhere this was

02:38:23.170 --> 02:38:26.450
the reason they have made a decision that okay let the world

02:38:26.450 --> 02:38:30.670
create their mcps. And let them call it in that way they

02:38:30.670 --> 02:38:32.910
don't have to create the node right they don't have to

02:38:32.910 --> 02:38:36.290
create their own like a you know proprietary node so maybe

02:38:36.290 --> 02:38:40.190
that that's the reason they have added it but again that's

02:38:40.190 --> 02:38:43.870
okay from the company side and obviously that will work not

02:38:43.870 --> 02:38:46.910
maybe now for everything but maybe in the next one year when

02:38:46.910 --> 02:38:50.050
people will start adopting mcps when everyone will start

02:38:50.050 --> 02:38:52.910
exposing everything as mcps yeah at that point of a time

02:38:52.910 --> 02:38:57.290
this will work. But for now. It's okay. It's okay. It's

02:38:57.290 --> 02:38:59.710
okay. It's not convenient for me as a user. So that's again

02:38:59.710 --> 02:39:05.410
a big problem a big problem by the way yeah apart from that

02:39:05.410 --> 02:39:08.390
so nothing much you will be able to find out here so node is

02:39:08.390 --> 02:39:10.510
nothing but just a sticky node and is nothing but like

02:39:10.510 --> 02:39:13.610
termination basically file search is a tool so you can try

02:39:13.610 --> 02:39:17.010
to attach this you know tool to this one and then like you

02:39:17.010 --> 02:39:20.610
can do a file search and again so they have given you a

02:39:20.610 --> 02:39:23.270
vector search as well again there is a problem with the

02:39:23.270 --> 02:39:27.050
vector search everything is inside our open ai. AI right

02:39:27.050 --> 02:39:29.630
everything is inside the open AI so I can show you that part

02:39:29.630 --> 02:39:32.710
so I can click on create I can go over here I can try to

02:39:32.710 --> 02:39:35.990
create a vector restore let's suppose right let's suppose I

02:39:35.990 --> 02:39:38.950
am going to name like a sudhanshu underscore vec yeah

02:39:38.950 --> 02:39:43.070
sudhanshu vec I can try to create over here I just need this

02:39:43.070 --> 02:39:49.810
id and then I can create this sorry yeah so vector restore

02:39:49.810 --> 02:39:52.650
has been created I can upload a file whatever file that I

02:39:52.650 --> 02:39:55.810
want I can just like you know upload it inside this vector

02:39:55.810 --> 02:40:03.470
db sorry add file yeah upload everything now as you can see

02:40:03.470 --> 02:40:06.130
right I am attaching a file and all these files are going

02:40:06.130 --> 02:40:10.290
where in open AI right I have to pay them like I have to pay

02:40:10.290 --> 02:40:15.030
this like pay them for my file and everything and then I

02:40:15.030 --> 02:40:17.950
have to use this id and then I will be able to enter the

02:40:17.950 --> 02:40:21.850
vector id and I will be able to access it right that's again

02:40:21.850 --> 02:40:26.350
a problem for me because like I won't be able to leave my

02:40:26.350 --> 02:40:30.170
open AI environment by the way right so I won't be able to

02:40:30.170 --> 02:40:33.230
use some pinecone or maybe like chroma db or some other

02:40:33.230 --> 02:40:38.130
databases I have to be inside a open AI ecosystem and I have

02:40:38.130 --> 02:40:40.650
to use their storage I have to pay to them and they will be

02:40:40.650 --> 02:40:44.310
having my hold of my data by the way right even as a vector

02:40:44.310 --> 02:40:47.610
database that's bad that's pretty much bad so I should have

02:40:47.610 --> 02:40:50.670
a open access where I can like you know store my data into a

02:40:50.670 --> 02:40:54.910
chroma or maybe into a fasi maybe into a db. pinecone baby

02:40:54.910 --> 02:40:59.550
or any other any other db so that's a big problem because

02:40:59.550 --> 02:41:03.050
obviously if I am building a AI application I will have to

02:41:03.050 --> 02:41:08.490
store my files right somewhere and somewhere open so this is

02:41:08.490 --> 02:41:12.870
again one another problem then logic wise simple e fails

02:41:12.870 --> 02:41:16.190
condition so if this is going to happen then like do this if

02:41:16.190 --> 02:41:19.330
that is going to happen then do this right so this kind of

02:41:19.330 --> 02:41:22.270
option they have given to you so you can you know try to

02:41:22.270 --> 02:41:26.650
attach a new new nodes over there. here but this is the only

02:41:26.650 --> 02:41:29.450
feature guys feature that you are able to see on your left

02:41:29.450 --> 02:41:32.310
hand side that you have apart from that you don't have any

02:41:32.310 --> 02:41:36.430
other feature so far they have basically added a guard rails

02:41:36.430 --> 02:41:39.790
and transform so guard rail is the only new thing you will

02:41:39.790 --> 02:41:42.390
be able to find out here now what is this guard rail so for

02:41:42.390 --> 02:41:45.310
example if i am trying to start the conversation right let

02:41:45.310 --> 02:41:49.690
me delete this node let me delete this one yeah

02:42:00.320 --> 02:42:03.200
so if i am trying to start the conversation right i can try

02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:05.860
to put a guard rail over here that okay so whenever user

02:42:05.860 --> 02:42:09.100
will like you know start the conversation so it should go

02:42:09.100 --> 02:42:11.100
through a guard rail now what this guard rail is doing so

02:42:11.100 --> 02:42:13.660
again they have given you all the configuration option here

02:42:13.660 --> 02:42:16.500
so let's suppose if i am going to like you know switch it on

02:42:16.500 --> 02:42:19.460
now what it will do it will give you two things pass or fail

02:42:19.460 --> 02:42:23.520
so on pass do this fail do this means pass calls a model now

02:42:23.520 --> 02:42:26.640
if i am going to switch it on this one so what it is trying

02:42:26.640 --> 02:42:30.540
to guard rail you can check it here so credit card number so

02:42:30.540 --> 02:42:32.420
you can you can select all these all the entities so person

02:42:32.420 --> 02:42:34.860
name phone number all those things it will not try to send

02:42:34.860 --> 02:42:39.060
further so you can you can select basically so whatever you

02:42:39.060 --> 02:42:41.640
are going to select it will try to guard rail those

02:42:41.640 --> 02:42:44.760
information means it will not even send to the next phase i

02:42:44.760 --> 02:42:48.500
can try to attach these guard rails in any places i want

02:42:48.500 --> 02:42:51.600
right it's just a node right so plug and play node i can i

02:42:51.600 --> 02:42:54.580
can try to attach it anywhere and meaning is very simple

02:42:54.580 --> 02:42:58.620
don't send this information to the next step wherever i am

02:42:58.620 --> 02:43:01.480
going to attach a guard rail i can handle it with you know i

02:43:01.480 --> 02:43:01.480
can handle it with you know i can handle it with you know

02:43:01.480 --> 02:43:04.120
even with the code that's fine moderation wise they have

02:43:04.120 --> 02:43:06.700
given you again inside the guard rail itself feature so

02:43:06.700 --> 02:43:09.440
moderation wise if i would like to prevent some of the

02:43:09.440 --> 02:43:12.560
categories maybe a sexual maybe a hate harassment or these

02:43:12.560 --> 02:43:16.080
kind of a categories i can try to prevent it right so again

02:43:16.080 --> 02:43:18.340
this is the part of the guard rail they have given to you

02:43:18.340 --> 02:43:22.360
you can make it on make it off as per your need a jailbreak

02:43:22.360 --> 02:43:25.320
so basically nothing but injection by the way yeah so

02:43:25.320 --> 02:43:27.580
someone is trying to give a false found or something so

02:43:27.580 --> 02:43:31.140
basically it is going to identify and it will try to like a

02:43:31.140 --> 02:43:33.140
prevent it from happening so this is the kind of a situation

02:43:33.140 --> 02:43:36.280
injection kind of a hallucination so you can try to control

02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:38.360
the hallucination over here so you can try to you know

02:43:38.360 --> 02:43:43.200
adjust this confidence score over here this is how we try to

02:43:43.200 --> 02:43:46.740
control hallucination plus you can try to give your own

02:43:46.740 --> 02:43:52.160
vector store like a data you can pass those data so that it

02:43:52.160 --> 02:43:55.580
will verify yeah it will take a reference so that it will be

02:43:55.580 --> 02:43:58.840
less it will hallucinate but it will less hallucinate so

02:43:58.840 --> 02:44:02.740
this is the only option that you will be able to find out

02:44:02.740 --> 02:44:07.940
which is not that great because anyhow i can implement these

02:44:07.940 --> 02:44:10.800
kind of you know things with the help of e-fails e-fails e

02:44:10.800 --> 02:44:14.700
-fails kind of a things so these are the only information

02:44:14.700 --> 02:44:20.260
guys which is available to you now let's suppose i am

02:44:20.260 --> 02:44:22.940
creating like a new project i

02:44:24.890 --> 02:44:27.770
have some like a planning helper let's suppose right i'll

02:44:27.770 --> 02:44:32.590
click here so this is like a node right as you can see this

02:44:32.590 --> 02:44:36.450
is the agent so i am creating a node now if i have to test

02:44:36.450 --> 02:44:39.690
it so i can click on preview and you will be able to test it

02:44:39.690 --> 02:44:42.850
if you have a verified account organization verified account

02:44:42.850 --> 02:44:45.310
otherwise they will not give you a preview option they will

02:44:45.310 --> 02:44:48.070
just give you the publish option so i can click on preview

02:44:48.070 --> 02:44:53.510
and then i can say like hi and yeah so as you can see it is

02:44:53.510 --> 02:44:56.070
showing you the flow right showing you the flow so whatever

02:44:56.070 --> 02:44:59.190
flow it is going to follow everywhere you will be able to

02:44:59.190 --> 02:45:03.990
see that it is it is like highlighting you know the icon

02:45:03.990 --> 02:45:07.570
what happened dismiss okay

02:45:25.970 --> 02:45:29.290
so what happened file node file search required a vector

02:45:29.290 --> 02:45:37.290
store id okay find file search deleted okay so here if i say

02:45:37.290 --> 02:45:41.670
hi so you will be able to see that this is just a fancier

02:45:41.670 --> 02:45:45.370
stuff right nothing much basically and based on like

02:45:45.370 --> 02:45:48.050
whatever kind of agent that you have created here we are

02:45:48.050 --> 02:45:52.010
like having e-fails so it will try to like work and then it

02:45:52.010 --> 02:45:54.550
will be able to give you this output now this is again the

02:45:54.550 --> 02:45:57.750
problem right so i am able to like you know just chat and

02:45:57.750 --> 02:46:00.130
with the help of this chat i am able to trigger this part

02:46:00.130 --> 02:46:04.970
that's a big problem for me right i should have open access

02:46:04.970 --> 02:46:07.930
to a triggers basically i could have like a triggered it

02:46:07.930 --> 02:46:11.970
with the help of any other system or any other webhooks so

02:46:11.970 --> 02:46:15.510
major problem you will be able to find out now once you are

02:46:15.510 --> 02:46:18.490
able to test this one so you can click on this publish and

02:46:18.490 --> 02:46:20.710
you will not be able to test it you will not be able to do a

02:46:20.710 --> 02:46:24.770
preview once if you don't have a verified account so it just

02:46:24.770 --> 02:46:28.130
works with respect to a verified account if you don't have

02:46:28.130 --> 02:46:32.070
that you it it won't work code wise you can try to download

02:46:32.070 --> 02:46:37.870
this code so same as autogen as autogen right so you can

02:46:37.870 --> 02:46:39.790
download the code and then you can start like you know

02:46:39.790 --> 02:46:43.950
building your own now this is the only way this is the only

02:46:43.950 --> 02:46:47.750
and only way where so this there is a typescript code and

02:46:47.750 --> 02:46:49.770
there is a python code they have given to you so this is the

02:46:49.770 --> 02:46:54.290
only way by which you will be able to control the system,

02:46:54.690 --> 02:47:00.770
but again if I have to deploy their code I will have to put

02:47:00.770 --> 02:47:05.830
a lot of effort, a lot of like version and all those things

02:47:05.830 --> 02:47:10.070
I have to maintain, so that's again a big headache, who will

02:47:10.070 --> 02:47:14.010
do that. Now here so I can try to add a domain, maybe I

02:47:14.010 --> 02:47:17.750
would like to host it on Euron.one, I can try to attach the

02:47:17.750 --> 02:47:22.390
domain and then I will be able to host my entire chat kit by

02:47:22.390 --> 02:47:25.710
which I will be able to communicate with my agent or they

02:47:25.710 --> 02:47:28.290
have given me the workflow id, so with the help of workflow

02:47:28.290 --> 02:47:31.870
id I will be able to attach it and yeah so worsening and all

02:47:31.870 --> 02:47:35.390
those stuff they have given to you. So this is the only

02:47:35.390 --> 02:47:41.170
thing guys, let's suppose I am calling sudh work, click on

02:47:41.170 --> 02:47:44.030
publish, you will be able to get a chat id, workflow id,

02:47:44.270 --> 02:47:50.850
yeah so workflow id and I can try to attach it with the help

02:47:50.850 --> 02:47:52.770
of, and they have given you chat kit. So where you can go.

02:47:52.770 --> 02:47:56.810
You can go and you can create a fancy chat kit the way you

02:47:56.810 --> 02:48:02.330
want, that's it. So what is your feedback, how do you feel,

02:48:04.610 --> 02:48:07.330
can we create a real time use case with the help of this

02:48:07.330 --> 02:48:07.530
one,

02:48:10.770 --> 02:48:13.810
yeah and are we able to see anything new here,

02:48:17.050 --> 02:48:20.770
yeah. I don't think that anything is new, anything new you

02:48:20.770 --> 02:48:23.070
will be able to find out here. Those who know any kind of a

02:48:23.070 --> 02:48:27.670
tool, right, I mean like for them these tools, I mean like

02:48:27.670 --> 02:48:30.690
they will just reject it in first five minutes. They will

02:48:30.690 --> 02:48:35.500
say I am not going to use it. They will say that okay fire

02:48:35.500 --> 02:48:38.280
me from my job, it's completely fine but I am not going to

02:48:38.280 --> 02:48:40.960
use it because the problem is that you don't have

02:48:40.960 --> 02:48:43.360
flexibility, you won't be able to build something real,

02:48:43.500 --> 02:48:47.580
right, you won't be able to automate and basically this drag

02:48:47.580 --> 02:48:51.020
and drop kind of a tool or visual based tool people use to

02:48:51.020 --> 02:48:55.340
create for the ease of use, right, not to add another 10

02:48:55.340 --> 02:49:01.350
problem or 10 headache for an end user, yeah and then like

02:49:01.350 --> 02:49:04.670
when OpenAI has launched it. Entire world has started

02:49:04.670 --> 02:49:07.810
shouting that it's the end of N8N, it's the end of you know

02:49:07.810 --> 02:49:12.970
JPL, it's end of everything, I mean like so far in last

02:49:12.970 --> 02:49:16.370
three year if I remember correctly OpenAI have just released

02:49:16.370 --> 02:49:19.710
a model which was working well and obviously that is the

02:49:19.710 --> 02:49:23.270
only product that they have which works well. Apart from

02:49:23.270 --> 02:49:29.190
like that I don't think any other product even works the way

02:49:29.190 --> 02:49:32.530
it was supposed to be, right, for an end user. Yeah. Then

02:49:32.530 --> 02:49:36.150
the chat model is like the best in the world I would say in

02:49:36.150 --> 02:49:38.610
one of the category. In other category obviously there are

02:49:38.610 --> 02:49:42.010
other models, right, for example like in an image video

02:49:42.010 --> 02:49:45.410
category so VO, I will appreciate VO for that. In code

02:49:45.410 --> 02:49:47.790
generation I will appreciate Sonnet for that, cloud is

02:49:47.790 --> 02:49:48.890
Sonnet from Anthropic.

02:49:51.610 --> 02:49:54.430
So influencer thumbnail after agent will end it, end killer,

02:49:54.550 --> 02:49:57.150
yeah and just go and check their videos, right. They have

02:49:57.150 --> 02:49:59.770
shown you the same thing, right, and then ask them that what

02:49:59.770 --> 02:50:02.870
is the productive thing that you are able to build. Yeah. So

02:50:02.870 --> 02:50:07.210
many people have created those videos in just one day. Even

02:50:07.210 --> 02:50:09.750
I have done that, but yeah, I have done that after doing a

02:50:09.750 --> 02:50:13.330
proper experimentation and if you will watch my video that's

02:50:13.330 --> 02:50:16.270
available in Hindi as well as English, I said the exact same

02:50:16.270 --> 02:50:19.450
thing that it's of no use. You can't go and do the

02:50:19.450 --> 02:50:22.670
comparison with N8n, say that it's a N8n killer. It's

02:50:22.670 --> 02:50:26.310
nowhere even close to N8n, right. Maybe it will take like a

02:50:26.310 --> 02:50:28.010
five, six year, 10 year of time for them.

02:50:33.890 --> 02:50:37.650
Only thing I know OpenAI pays really well.

02:50:40.810 --> 02:50:44.370
Yeah, maybe. I don't know. Obviously it's a big company, big

02:50:44.370 --> 02:50:46.730
funding. So obviously they will pay, but yeah, their chart

02:50:46.730 --> 02:50:50.230
model is good. It's a world class. They are the one who is

02:50:50.230 --> 02:50:52.830
like, you know, setting a trend basically.

02:50:56.810 --> 02:50:59.810
So in the future you will be able to see many more things,

02:50:59.930 --> 02:51:03.690
not just one, such kind of a platform, such kind of a

02:51:03.690 --> 02:51:07.210
framework. But yeah, if I'm a part of industry, so obviously

02:51:07.210 --> 02:51:10.630
immediately I will not shift from one tool to another tool.

02:51:10.790 --> 02:51:13.430
If I'm using some tool, if I'm already using some framework,

02:51:13.590 --> 02:51:16.850
I don't worry, I will keep on using it. So the companies who

02:51:16.850 --> 02:51:18.910
are already using N8n, their workflow is already running,

02:51:19.010 --> 02:51:21.490
they will keep on using it. The company who are using JPR,

02:51:21.650 --> 02:51:26.110
they will keep on using it, right. Overnight no one can

02:51:26.110 --> 02:51:27.230
like, you know, go and change.

02:51:31.670 --> 02:51:35.650
And yeah, very soon we'll see such kind of a tool from so

02:51:35.650 --> 02:51:39.010
many organizations. So be ready for that, but never think

02:51:39.010 --> 02:51:42.870
that one will come and kill everything that existed before.

02:51:44.650 --> 02:51:47.670
When OpenAI have launched this image generation feature, so

02:51:47.670 --> 02:51:50.890
we're going to start saying that Canva will be dead. Yeah.

02:51:51.050 --> 02:51:53.510
Canva, which has been used to create a thumbnail, posters,

02:51:53.710 --> 02:51:57.570
PPTs and slides and everything, Canva is still flourishing,

02:51:57.730 --> 02:52:03.870
right. Even Google have launched VO3, right, still Canva is

02:52:03.870 --> 02:52:08.810
generating a massive revenue. Because if you will go with

02:52:08.810 --> 02:52:12.490
the ease of use, right, Canva provides me a lot of ease of

02:52:12.490 --> 02:52:17.390
use, right. Where VO or like just Gemini, right, Gemini or

02:52:17.390 --> 02:52:22.530
this OpenAI image generation is not giving me that much of

02:52:22.530 --> 02:52:25.110
flexibility. In Canva, I can build a thumbnail in just like

02:52:25.110 --> 02:52:28.130
10 seconds. They have a template. I just have to change the

02:52:28.130 --> 02:52:30.550
words and my pictures, that's it. And then it will be done,

02:52:30.690 --> 02:52:34.630
right. With respect to VO3, with respect to this like OpenAI

02:52:34.630 --> 02:52:38.430
image generation, so I have to write a prompt 10 times, then

02:52:38.430 --> 02:52:42.150
I have to correct it, it will, I have to give my image over

02:52:42.150 --> 02:52:44.870
there, then it will try to, you know, modify my image

02:52:44.870 --> 02:52:47.830
somehow and then it will try to put it in a very, very wrong

02:52:47.830 --> 02:52:52.950
place with the wrong color combination. So even with the

02:52:52.950 --> 02:52:56.910
help of prompt, I can't use it, right. I can't use it. So at

02:52:56.910 --> 02:53:00.110
the end of the day, technology doesn't matter. At the end of

02:53:00.110 --> 02:53:04.770
the day, what I keep on saying is that, that if it is

02:53:04.770 --> 02:53:09.270
solving a problem, if it is like creating an ease of use for

02:53:09.270 --> 02:53:12.690
an end user, then that technology will work, otherwise there

02:53:12.690 --> 02:53:15.430
are so many fancy technologies you will be able to find out

02:53:15.430 --> 02:53:16.950
out there which no one is buying.

02:53:20.310 --> 02:53:23.530
Yeah. So that's it. This is the demo once again for your,

02:53:23.530 --> 02:53:29.710
you know, agentic form. So now we have covered almost all

02:53:29.710 --> 02:53:33.050
the agents, I believe, right. So N8n, so starting from

02:53:33.050 --> 02:53:39.910
Langchain, Langraph, Krew AI, N8n, Autogen, Studio and like

02:53:39.910 --> 02:53:46.210
Code both, and then even OpenAI finally. So nowadays in new

02:53:46.210 --> 02:53:49.490
AI bubble is bursting. What's your thought? See always try

02:53:49.490 --> 02:53:52.230
to focus, I keep on saying that, that try to focus on your

02:53:52.230 --> 02:53:55.770
base. If I am learning RAG, I should understand that what

02:53:55.770 --> 02:53:59.630
the RAG actually is. If I'm learning agents, so agent is a

02:53:59.630 --> 02:54:02.510
philosophy, is a concept, right. So try to be good with that

02:54:02.510 --> 02:54:06.550
concept. Then in a future you will see like there are, there

02:54:06.550 --> 02:54:08.890
will be 10 startups who will try to bring their framework,

02:54:08.970 --> 02:54:13.230
their libraries. You will be able to build it. Like for

02:54:13.230 --> 02:54:16.530
example, drag and drop wise, right. Now even Krew AI is

02:54:16.530 --> 02:54:20.190
going to bring. Microsoft Autogen is going to bring, OpenAI

02:54:20.190 --> 02:54:23.030
is going to bring, but let's suppose if I know something in

02:54:23.030 --> 02:54:26.110
N8n, I will be able to use all of these tools automatically,

02:54:26.430 --> 02:54:30.550
right. Because I understand the philosophy, philosophy of

02:54:30.550 --> 02:54:32.910
agent I understand, philosophy of trigger I understand,

02:54:33.130 --> 02:54:35.530
right. I understand my business. That's the only thing which

02:54:35.530 --> 02:54:38.990
is required. So always try to stick to a base. If you are

02:54:38.990 --> 02:54:42.490
going into a field of data science, always stick to a

02:54:42.490 --> 02:54:44.370
statistics, always stick to a machine learning, deep

02:54:44.370 --> 02:54:46.870
learning, computer vision, all of those concepts, right.

02:54:46.870 --> 02:54:50.030
Then believe me, no one will be able to touch you and you

02:54:50.030 --> 02:54:53.870
will be relevant in a market all the time. If you are just

02:54:53.870 --> 02:54:56.030
like, you know, running after all those frameworks and

02:54:56.030 --> 02:54:58.770
libraries, then believe me after some time you will not be

02:54:58.770 --> 02:55:01.110
relevant because you have just learned up, you know,

02:55:01.530 --> 02:55:07.570
something from 10,000 feet. Can you please brief MCP? MCP I

02:55:07.570 --> 02:55:10.590
will teach you, MCP is also part of your syllabus. So most

02:55:10.590 --> 02:55:13.610
probably next Saturday or Sunday, we will be having MCP

02:55:13.610 --> 02:55:19.710
discussion. Yeah. MCP. I have like a pre-recorded course

02:55:19.710 --> 02:55:22.090
also in MCP. So you can go and check that part if you are,

02:55:22.110 --> 02:55:24.950
if you have urgency, otherwise just wait till next week.

02:55:25.930 --> 02:55:28.590
I'll write a code for MCP. MCP is again, you will find out

02:55:28.590 --> 02:55:32.490
it's nothing, it's just like creating an API. So I'll be

02:55:32.490 --> 02:55:36.410
having a function. I'll try to decorate it with MCP tool.

02:55:36.570 --> 02:55:39.630
That's it. And I'll take just the way I used to expose the

02:55:39.630 --> 02:55:42.510
API. I'll just like say that, okay, fine, now this is the

02:55:42.510 --> 02:55:43.510
MCP tool. That's it.

02:55:48.390 --> 02:55:51.510
Our concept mostly then the project. Yeah, obviously this is

02:55:51.510 --> 02:55:55.530
what like a, you know, every interviews ask concept mostly

02:55:55.530 --> 02:55:57.430
then the project, obviously they will, they will try to

02:55:57.430 --> 02:56:01.370
focus on core part, core philosophical part. Right.

02:56:04.050 --> 02:56:08.730
Okay. So this is it guys from my side, by the way. Yeah. So

02:56:08.730 --> 02:56:11.730
hope all of you have liked this today's session. I believe

02:56:11.730 --> 02:56:15.250
all of you have learned something and if you had any kind of

02:56:15.250 --> 02:56:17.610
a confusion, so I believe I'm able to remove that confusion

02:56:17.610 --> 02:56:21.830
today. Right. So. So I have already given you a task last,

02:56:21.890 --> 02:56:24.990
last week. So please try to complete those tasks by using

02:56:24.990 --> 02:56:27.830
any agentic framework. I don't care. Anything will be best,

02:56:27.910 --> 02:56:30.350
but yeah, you can use any of the agentic framework and then

02:56:30.350 --> 02:56:33.430
try to complete those tasks. Believe me after doing those

02:56:33.430 --> 02:56:36.790
tasks, nothing is required. Plus this project is already

02:56:36.790 --> 02:56:40.090
with you. So yeah. Try to like, you know, create a generator

02:56:40.090 --> 02:56:43.070
report, whatever you want, you can do it. Maybe you can

02:56:43.070 --> 02:56:45.730
replicate a same project by using a land chain land graph,

02:56:45.830 --> 02:56:49.330
some other framework. Simple. Like you just have to change

02:56:49.330 --> 02:56:52.150
the agent part, rest part, rest is like going to be same.

02:56:52.330 --> 02:56:55.110
It's not going to change at all. The only agentic part is

02:56:55.110 --> 02:56:59.750
going to change. That's it. Sir, is Bootcamp 2 the same as

02:56:59.750 --> 02:57:02.730
the current batch? Yes, syllabus is same, but obviously I

02:57:02.730 --> 02:57:07.050
keep on talking about a new, like, you know, examples,

02:57:07.470 --> 02:57:10.390
right? New example, new project. Every time I discuss a new

02:57:10.390 --> 02:57:14.970
things because some

02:57:16.470 --> 02:57:20.770
human is going to deliver things. Right. So obviously we

02:57:20.770 --> 02:57:24.370
always try to adopt new things. I'm not a robot. So I'm not

02:57:24.370 --> 02:57:26.430
going to repeat the exact same lecture, which I'm giving

02:57:26.430 --> 02:57:26.750
now.

02:57:30.670 --> 02:57:33.730
So how you guys build a WhatsApp agent, if you can help us

02:57:33.730 --> 02:57:37.530
to understand at least any places from where, any places

02:57:37.530 --> 02:57:40.990
from where you can learn. I think no, you will not be able

02:57:40.990 --> 02:57:42.750
to find out those tutorials on YouTube or anywhere.

02:57:46.830 --> 02:57:48.750
So yeah, but

02:57:50.760 --> 02:57:53.160
I hope, I think, I think our WhatsApp agent is good. Right.

02:57:53.740 --> 02:57:54.140
Guys.

02:58:03.520 --> 02:58:08.280
But all topic will be covered in that match to, yeah,

02:58:08.340 --> 02:58:11.180
obviously our topic will be covered for syllabus. We'll

02:58:11.180 --> 02:58:12.880
just, we just follow the syllabus simple.

02:58:16.970 --> 02:58:20.390
I had ordered the code, it's working and able to get the

02:58:20.390 --> 02:58:22.970
report in a mail. So yeah, you have to configure your own

02:58:22.970 --> 02:58:26.770
mail ID, right? Plus you have to configure your own app

02:58:26.770 --> 02:58:29.330
password. Then only you will be able to send a mail to

02:58:29.330 --> 02:58:31.070
yourself. Otherwise it will not work.

02:58:35.550 --> 02:58:38.410
Do you use the self hosted LLM for a WhatsApp agent? No. We

02:58:38.410 --> 02:58:41.530
are using like an open AI over there. Basically we have not

02:58:41.530 --> 02:58:46.530
used the self hosted agent, self host LLM wise. We have not

02:58:46.530 --> 02:58:52.350
used basically like our self hosted LLMs. It's an open AI,

02:58:52.530 --> 02:58:55.510
but agent wise, so it's our own custom agent.

02:59:00.410 --> 02:59:03.990
So we have written lots of agents over there, so which can

02:59:03.990 --> 02:59:04.650
take a decision.

02:59:14.600 --> 02:59:18.020
How does the agent talk in such a good Indian desi slang?

02:59:20.420 --> 02:59:24.220
Yeah. So that's again fun part. So we have like a worked a

02:59:24.220 --> 02:59:27.660
lot on that side. Basically we have like a worked a lot on

02:59:27.660 --> 02:59:32.340
tone part and the way it should behave by the way. So if you

02:59:32.340 --> 02:59:36.560
will go and like, you know, talk to our agent in like a fun

02:59:36.560 --> 02:59:42.020
way, it is, it is like, you know, going to a response, give

02:59:42.020 --> 02:59:45.020
you a response in a fun manner. Just as go and chat in your

02:59:45.020 --> 02:59:47.300
language, whatever language that you want, like Tamil,

02:59:47.340 --> 02:59:53.460
Telugu, Spanish, French, like a Bush. If you want, right. So

02:59:53.460 --> 02:59:56.160
in all the languages we are still working on, it was

02:59:56.160 --> 03:00:00.740
actually not a project. So it was basically a fun project

03:00:00.740 --> 03:00:06.060
for me. So one fine night I was just sitting ideal. I was

03:00:06.060 --> 03:00:09.040
not having any kind of a work. So I have started this

03:00:09.040 --> 03:00:12.340
project and then, you know, next day I have involved my

03:00:12.340 --> 03:00:16.520
team. So this is where this project has started, by the way,

03:00:16.560 --> 03:00:18.300
a small one.

03:00:26.050 --> 03:00:29.790
So what do we need? We need to deploy this project. You can,

03:00:29.790 --> 03:00:32.890
you can like use any cloud platform. Maybe render will be

03:00:32.890 --> 03:00:35.770
good because render is free. So you can type deploy on

03:00:35.770 --> 03:00:39.850
render platform and it's also easy. So in render, there is a

03:00:39.850 --> 03:00:42.310
direct option you will be able to find out. So when you

03:00:42.310 --> 03:00:45.290
click on new, it will give you a background run or

03:00:45.290 --> 03:00:48.570
background process run. So just select that part and over

03:00:48.570 --> 03:00:49.850
there you have to deploy this project.

03:00:53.770 --> 03:00:58.090
Can you please push app notification once live class starts?

03:00:58.370 --> 03:01:01.130
I think I'm sending notification in your group. So it's not

03:01:01.130 --> 03:01:04.730
mandatory. It's not required. Yeah. Anyhow, whenever I start

03:01:04.730 --> 03:01:06.870
the class, I just like send it.

03:01:11.670 --> 03:01:14.630
Okay. Fine guys. So that's it from my side for today. Now.

03:01:14.790 --> 03:01:17.850
So if anyone is having any kind of a question, so please

03:01:17.850 --> 03:01:22.610
raise your hand and I'll try to give you an answer. Yeah.

03:01:24.230 --> 03:01:27.670
Okay. So Ramesh, go ahead. Rakesh, after that, you can go.

03:01:29.110 --> 03:01:33.690
Hi Sudhanshu sir, regarding the resume builder, right? So.

03:01:33.690 --> 03:01:38.210
So we tried to expose the resume. So basically it is able to

03:01:38.210 --> 03:01:42.130
grade only one page or two page resume from your API. Yeah.

03:01:42.210 --> 03:01:44.490
Because, because we have, we have given an instruction. So

03:01:44.490 --> 03:01:47.350
at the end of the day, a max to max, it should create a two

03:01:47.350 --> 03:01:50.470
pager resume, not more than two because again, so two pager

03:01:50.470 --> 03:01:54.130
resume is a standard one. You should not like create a 10

03:01:54.130 --> 03:01:57.590
pager resume like a story. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Right. There

03:01:57.590 --> 03:02:00.250
is a best of two way. What we noticed from three resume,

03:02:00.390 --> 03:02:03.810
three type of resume. Hmm. For the tool section, right. For

03:02:03.810 --> 03:02:08.230
the skill wise section, it is not permitted. I think it is a

03:02:08.230 --> 03:02:12.010
tabular permit should be, that should be better for us. No,

03:02:12.130 --> 03:02:14.890
it's basically ATS system, right? So ATS system will do a

03:02:14.890 --> 03:02:17.230
keyword matching. So it will read your, like, it doesn't

03:02:17.230 --> 03:02:19.330
matter whether it's a tabular or whether it's not tabular.

03:02:19.570 --> 03:02:22.390
It should be the structured one. It should be the, like, it

03:02:22.390 --> 03:02:25.650
should have a proper, like a, it should not have a spelling

03:02:25.650 --> 03:02:27.750
mistake. It should not have any kind of a punctuation or

03:02:27.750 --> 03:02:30.050
grammatical mistake. So this is the only thing which

03:02:30.050 --> 03:02:32.150
matters. Tabular or non tabular doesn't matter for any of

03:02:32.150 --> 03:02:35.530
them. It's a code, right? Which is Yeah. Keyword matches

03:02:35.530 --> 03:02:39.030
only, but yeah, for the format wise, then is it possible to

03:02:39.030 --> 03:02:44.030
can, to promote on those? No, basically it's a template that

03:02:44.030 --> 03:02:46.690
we have created. Right. So whatever we are like, you know,

03:02:46.690 --> 03:02:49.670
giving you inside the resume, it's neat and clean format.

03:02:49.950 --> 03:02:53.590
Even if we are giving you basically like, you know, the

03:02:53.590 --> 03:02:56.570
skillset that you have, it's pretty much clean. So that's

03:02:56.570 --> 03:02:58.930
what the whole idea, that was the whole objective behind

03:02:58.930 --> 03:03:03.010
that. Yeah. Yeah. And is there a possibility to increase the

03:03:03.010 --> 03:03:07.030
three pages from the two pages? Maybe for the content? It's

03:03:07.030 --> 03:03:10.670
not required, basically content, even for the content

03:03:10.670 --> 03:03:14.030
purposes, because you are not supposed to submit a storybook

03:03:14.030 --> 03:03:18.690
to your like HR, right? So basically it's a, it's a resume.

03:03:18.850 --> 03:03:20.990
A resume, two pages is more than enough. I mean, like who

03:03:20.990 --> 03:03:25.590
reads even a two pages nowadays? No one. Okay. But it is the

03:03:25.590 --> 03:03:28.290
best way, right? Because generally what I'm doing. No, it's

03:03:28.290 --> 03:03:32.170
not a best way. A two pager is a. Two pages is actually the

03:03:32.170 --> 03:03:34.950
standard approach. Standard way. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That's

03:03:34.950 --> 03:03:39.070
fine. I agree. But what I did, I looked at the job

03:03:39.070 --> 03:03:43.810
description from LinkedIn platform. So then I would try to

03:03:43.810 --> 03:03:49.290
apply the things in our resume API, right? So we expose the

03:03:49.290 --> 03:03:53.790
resume and apply it. It is okay or that is fine? That is

03:03:53.790 --> 03:03:56.990
fine. That is fine. Right. Based on the job description.

03:03:57.390 --> 03:04:01.350
Yeah. Okay. That's fine. Okay. And then one more thing for

03:04:01.350 --> 03:04:04.450
the last use case, right? The agent get to, you are exposing

03:04:04.450 --> 03:04:07.670
on those. So what is this? What is the exact use cases on

03:04:07.670 --> 03:04:11.650
those last flow? I was missing the part, the last flow agent

03:04:11.650 --> 03:04:16.950
get. Sorry, agent? No, no. I think open a agent builder,

03:04:17.030 --> 03:04:19.510
something, no, which one you are showing the last overflow.

03:04:19.890 --> 03:04:23.590
Yeah. So what is the exact use case on those? I mean, like

03:04:23.590 --> 03:04:26.890
even they were not able to understand what was the exact use

03:04:26.890 --> 03:04:29.990
cases. I mean, like they have just given the agent. And then

03:04:29.990 --> 03:04:32.570
they have given the LLM access to the agent, chat with it.

03:04:32.670 --> 03:04:34.870
And then, you know, it will try to give you an answer.

03:04:34.910 --> 03:04:36.970
That's it. That's what the only. That's it. Only per chat

03:04:36.970 --> 03:04:39.650
interaction. No, no, no. I was, I didn't, I was missing the

03:04:39.650 --> 03:04:43.610
part. That's it. So I was not available. Entire world is

03:04:43.610 --> 03:04:47.150
missing that part actually. Not just you. Okay. And just

03:04:47.150 --> 03:04:50.050
creating the video that, okay, it's a killer of like whole

03:04:50.050 --> 03:04:54.530
world. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And then final one more

03:04:54.530 --> 03:04:59.130
question. But for the URI API system, right? We have the one

03:04:59.130 --> 03:05:00.930
line API. So let's say you have 10000 Token per day. Yeah.

03:05:01.130 --> 03:05:06.730
Right. And for the maintenance perspective, do you pay

03:05:06.730 --> 03:05:11.090
anything to the company for the, maybe everyone uses the

03:05:11.090 --> 03:05:14.990
100000 token, right? How are you doing those so much tokens

03:05:14.990 --> 03:05:18.990
for everyone? Because we have a 10 account because at 10, no

03:05:18.990 --> 03:05:23.570
10 into 100000 tokens. Yeah. Agree. Yeah. Right. But how are

03:05:23.570 --> 03:05:25.970
you going to distribute the tokens? So maybe the token

03:05:25.970 --> 03:05:29.350
limit, you can set in the code level. But are you paying for

03:05:29.350 --> 03:05:33.090
every token? for this additional token? Yes, obviously we

03:05:33.090 --> 03:05:37.510
are paying. No, that's why I am asking. You have given so

03:05:37.510 --> 03:05:40.650
much token for every person, right? That's why I am asking.

03:05:40.930 --> 03:05:45.770
Is there any payment? We are paying for that. So we are like

03:05:46.630 --> 03:05:52.150
in a loss because of that one. Okay. Because there are 4 or

03:05:52.150 --> 03:05:55.190
5 models over there. Maybe spew models are the paid model.

03:05:55.710 --> 03:05:58.690
That's why I am asking. Are you paying from your end for all

03:05:58.690 --> 03:06:01.450
the things? Obviously, because for us it's not free, right?

03:06:02.230 --> 03:06:08.910
Yeah, yeah, okay. Okay, thank you. Yeah, okay. Next, Rakesh,

03:06:08.950 --> 03:06:14.090
go ahead. Yeah, hi, sir. First of all, the resume part that

03:06:14.090 --> 03:06:19.690
you have available on your ecosystem. I have got the

03:06:19.690 --> 03:06:24.030
advantage of this one in last week. Actually, one of my

03:06:24.030 --> 03:06:28.070
friends has used this one because his resume is rejected

03:06:28.070 --> 03:06:32.530
from someone from some companies and after that they have

03:06:32.530 --> 03:06:36.270
discussed with me and I have created those resumes in your

03:06:36.270 --> 03:06:41.230
environment and they have selected. Oh, that's amazing. See,

03:06:41.370 --> 03:06:45.910
that's called as product. Right. So it is able to solve the

03:06:45.910 --> 03:06:48.470
real problem in a real way. That's amazing. Maybe you can

03:06:48.470 --> 03:06:50.810
ask at least your friend to write some feedback so that

03:06:50.810 --> 03:06:56.950
other people will start using it. Actually, he is my brother

03:06:56.950 --> 03:07:01.290
in law. Actually, he is my brother in law. Okay, yeah. So

03:07:01.290 --> 03:07:03.470
then you should ask your brother in law. I mean, he can do

03:07:03.470 --> 03:07:06.330
anything, right? He is your brother in law, by the way. Yes,

03:07:06.330 --> 03:07:10.630
yes, sure, sure, sir. I mean, if product is good, if it is

03:07:10.630 --> 03:07:13.090
working, I think we should also promote it. We also promote

03:07:13.090 --> 03:07:17.970
your own. Sure, sir, because his resume is rejected and they

03:07:17.970 --> 03:07:23.990
have asked to just correct your resume as an ITS system and

03:07:23.990 --> 03:07:29.030
we have created that resume in your system and they have

03:07:29.030 --> 03:07:32.290
accepted. That's amazing. I am literally very, very happy.

03:07:32.610 --> 03:07:35.850
Just send me this message on WhatsApp so that I can take a

03:07:35.850 --> 03:07:38.210
screenshot and I will post it on LinkedIn. Sure, sure, sure,

03:07:38.210 --> 03:07:44.210
sir. I will just send this message. Yes, sure. That's

03:07:44.210 --> 03:07:48.830
amazing. Thank you so much for providing this type of

03:07:49.830 --> 03:07:56.170
messages. And the second one, sir, the thing that you have,

03:07:57.430 --> 03:08:02.330
today you have explained how we can deploy this one on our

03:08:02.330 --> 03:08:07.050
on-prem server. Suppose I have an on-prem server and I want

03:08:07.050 --> 03:08:11.050
to deploy this, all the things on our system, on the server.

03:08:11.250 --> 03:08:16.910
So what we need is suppose we have one fresh server with

03:08:16.910 --> 03:08:21.630
Windows only. So basically, see, the thing is that my

03:08:21.630 --> 03:08:26.770
system, the system in which I am executing, so you can say

03:08:26.770 --> 03:08:29.810
that for you it's a server. If I am going to expose my

03:08:29.810 --> 03:08:32.930
system and from somewhere else, from some remote location,

03:08:33.090 --> 03:08:35.690
if you are able to access my system itself, my system will

03:08:35.690 --> 03:08:38.970
become server, right? The same thing happens. So basically

03:08:38.970 --> 03:08:42.590
if you have some server and over there if you have a Windows

03:08:42.590 --> 03:08:45.270
or Linux, it doesn't matter at all, if I am able to access

03:08:45.270 --> 03:08:51.230
it, the way I am executing Python Studio.py. Okay. So first,

03:08:51.450 --> 03:08:54.810
install requirement.txt. So pip install requirement.txt.

03:08:56.250 --> 03:09:02.050
Second step, Python Studio.py. Done. No, but sir, for the

03:09:02.050 --> 03:09:07.110
pip, we need a VS code, right? No, no, why do you need VS

03:09:07.110 --> 03:09:10.950
code? No, no, no, it's not required. Yeah, so basically

03:09:10.950 --> 03:09:14.810
Python is available in your system, right? VS code is just

03:09:14.810 --> 03:09:17.030
one of the interface which is accessible. Understood.

03:09:19.910 --> 03:09:25.250
Internet should be available on that server. Yeah, so if you

03:09:25.250 --> 03:09:28.330
have to expose it, so if you are like installing something,

03:09:28.410 --> 03:09:31.470
obviously internet should be available. Actually, why I am

03:09:31.470 --> 03:09:35.070
asking this question is because in our organization, they

03:09:35.070 --> 03:09:38.390
have stopped all the downloading type of things on the

03:09:38.390 --> 03:09:43.130
server. Only we can deploy that one. But if you want to

03:09:43.130 --> 03:09:47.150
install something, we need to connect with the IT teams.

03:09:48.230 --> 03:09:50.970
Obviously, they have prevented the installation part. That

03:09:50.970 --> 03:09:54.430
happens basically with majority of the company, by the way.

03:09:54.550 --> 03:10:00.050
Okay, so after installation, where we put this code? I mean,

03:10:00.110 --> 03:10:03.850
any server? IIS or Apache or something like that? No, no,

03:10:03.850 --> 03:10:09.110
no, see server is nothing but just a machine and even over

03:10:09.110 --> 03:10:12.750
there you will be having a folder, right? Directory

03:10:12.750 --> 03:10:15.690
location, right? So let's suppose if you have installed a

03:10:15.690 --> 03:10:19.770
Windows OS on top of that or maybe a Linux OS or maybe any

03:10:19.770 --> 03:10:23.170
other OSs, but still it will be having a folder. So the way

03:10:23.170 --> 03:10:26.970
I am keeping my file in a particular folder location, right?

03:10:26.990 --> 03:10:29.910
Okay. And from that folder location, I am trying to run it,

03:10:30.030 --> 03:10:33.470
right? In a similar manner. For example, see, so it will be

03:10:33.470 --> 03:10:36.650
just like, let's suppose I am not using a VSCode. I have all

03:10:36.650 --> 03:10:39.470
the code here, right? I have all the code here. Yeah, in

03:10:39.470 --> 03:10:42.610
this folder. What I will do, I will try to launch CMD from

03:10:42.610 --> 03:10:46.210
here itself. Yeah? Now in my system, this is my CMD, right?

03:10:46.450 --> 03:10:51.810
And from here itself, so Python scheduler.py execute. It

03:10:51.810 --> 03:10:56.690
will work. See? I am not using VSCode or anything. Yeah? So

03:10:56.690 --> 03:10:58.990
see, it is like, it has been scheduled. So scheduler has

03:10:58.990 --> 03:11:02.050
started and it will, key scheduler is running. It will,

03:11:02.110 --> 03:11:05.390
infinitely it will up and running. I haven't used a VSCode.

03:11:05.430 --> 03:11:07.830
I haven't used anything. So at the end of the day, any

03:11:07.830 --> 03:11:10.650
machine is just like this machine, right? And you will be

03:11:10.650 --> 03:11:12.950
having a terminal access. You will be having a CMD access.

03:11:13.210 --> 03:11:15.870
And when I say CMD access, obviously you will be having a

03:11:15.870 --> 03:11:18.410
folder structure, right? If I do DIR over there, that is

03:11:18.410 --> 03:11:21.590
folder structure. So in some folder, I will keep all the

03:11:21.590 --> 03:11:25.110
files, right? And then whatever is my entry point. So for my

03:11:25.110 --> 03:11:27.830
code, for this code at least, what is my entry point? My

03:11:27.830 --> 03:11:31.490
scheduler.py. That is my entry point, right? In some of the

03:11:31.490 --> 03:11:34.110
project, you will create main.py. That will be, entry point

03:11:34.110 --> 03:11:36.990
can be anything that you are going to define, right? So from

03:11:36.990 --> 03:11:40.170
where code will start. Simple. Go to their directory and

03:11:40.170 --> 03:11:42.670
then like I am able to start it from command prompt.

03:11:42.930 --> 03:11:48.210
Understood. I mean, there is no web server is required for

03:11:48.210 --> 03:11:52.490
this one. Directly scheduler executing the code, right?

03:11:52.730 --> 03:11:55.550
Yeah, because this is using my local resources, right? My

03:11:55.550 --> 03:11:57.950
compute it is going to use. CPU and all those files and

03:11:57.950 --> 03:12:00.310
everything, right? So why do I need a web server or

03:12:00.310 --> 03:12:04.630
anything? Okay. One more thing, sir. If you are putting all

03:12:04.630 --> 03:12:08.910
the code as it is, there is any technique to publish the

03:12:08.910 --> 03:12:11.570
code and after that we need to put all the server because

03:12:11.570 --> 03:12:16.090
here we are totally we are putting all the code as it is on

03:12:16.090 --> 03:12:20.650
the server, right? But in the other things, first we need to

03:12:20.650 --> 03:12:24.570
publish the code and then only we can deploy those packages

03:12:24.570 --> 03:12:28.390
on there. So basically we try to keep a code on GitHub and

03:12:28.390 --> 03:12:30.990
then we try to build a pipeline for that. Majority of time,

03:12:31.070 --> 03:12:33.930
majority of platform are going to give you this option. Some

03:12:33.930 --> 03:12:36.090
platform even gives you an option where you will try to wrap

03:12:36.090 --> 03:12:39.270
up the code in the zip file and then just upload the zip

03:12:39.270 --> 03:12:42.370
file. Means technically this process, same process. It will,

03:12:42.450 --> 03:12:45.370
system will unzip it and then whatever entry point code you

03:12:45.370 --> 03:12:47.730
have given, it will try to execute that code. So some

03:12:47.730 --> 03:12:50.690
platform supports even that approach and majority of the

03:12:50.690 --> 03:12:53.750
platform because when we create a project, right? When we

03:12:53.750 --> 03:12:56.390
create any kind of a product, so we keep on doing a check

03:12:56.390 --> 03:12:59.950
-ins, right? Means we keep on updating the code. Now just to

03:12:59.950 --> 03:13:02.910
like maintain that funnel because I will update the code,

03:13:02.970 --> 03:13:06.730
code will go automatically into a GitHub and my server will

03:13:06.730 --> 03:13:09.290
try to update itself automatically if it will see some

03:13:09.290 --> 03:13:11.910
action in a GitHub, that repository which I have bounded. So

03:13:11.910 --> 03:13:15.050
that is the reason this GitHub approach is being used so

03:13:15.050 --> 03:13:17.990
that you know, I will push the code and then like new code

03:13:17.990 --> 03:13:20.430
will go into a production immediately. I don't have to you

03:13:20.430 --> 03:13:24.150
know go drag and drop like replace the code file because in

03:13:24.150 --> 03:13:26.710
this approach, in this approach again and again if I have

03:13:26.710 --> 03:13:29.470
changed some like things in my some of the file, I have to

03:13:29.470 --> 03:13:32.830
come again, I have to replace the files. Yeah, this is where

03:13:32.830 --> 03:13:35.470
GitHub is going to come into picture. So basically GitHub is

03:13:35.470 --> 03:13:38.030
a version control tool by the way, right? So which maintain

03:13:38.030 --> 03:13:40.730
the versions that's nothing much it is doing so that it will

03:13:40.730 --> 03:13:42.970
give you ease of use. You don't have to come delete the file

03:13:42.970 --> 03:13:45.450
and then you know replace the file. You don't have to follow

03:13:45.450 --> 03:13:52.250
this approach. One more thing sir. Have you already taken

03:13:52.250 --> 03:13:56.790
the class for the pipeline? I think in many classes I have

03:13:56.790 --> 03:13:59.950
already discussed like a deployment right at least. CI-CD

03:13:59.950 --> 03:14:03.970
pipeline entire. CI-CD pipeline maybe you can watch like a

03:14:03.970 --> 03:14:07.330
MLOps lectures right. MLOps lectures has been like a

03:14:07.330 --> 03:14:10.890
discussed in a beautiful manner by Bappy. So his lecture

03:14:10.890 --> 03:14:13.430
MLOps by Bhaktiyaramath Bappy. So you can just check that

03:14:13.430 --> 03:14:16.610
one. He is the expert and yeah he has discussed everything

03:14:16.610 --> 03:14:19.510
in a detail. Otherwise you can just wait for your lectures

03:14:19.510 --> 03:14:24.530
in this class itself. Okay sir and can you show me the on

03:14:24.530 --> 03:14:30.130
the your ecosystem where we can give the feedback of your

03:14:30.130 --> 03:14:34.710
resume or any services for any services. Okay. Okay. So

03:14:34.710 --> 03:14:38.910
maybe you can like write here hall of fame we have created.

03:14:39.290 --> 03:14:46.350
So you are on so you are on dot one. Yeah. So this one hall

03:14:46.350 --> 03:14:48.050
of fame. Okay.

03:14:53.170 --> 03:14:57.770
Yeah. Hall of fame. You can go and you can try to add your

03:14:57.770 --> 03:15:01.870
story and yeah so we are like going to publish the story

03:15:01.870 --> 03:15:06.150
here. Okay sir. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks. Yeah.

03:15:06.450 --> 03:15:09.010
So yes guys you can try to write your success stories or

03:15:09.010 --> 03:15:12.850
anything any other stories. Any feedback here itself in a

03:15:12.850 --> 03:15:16.530
hall of fame. Okay. Yeah. Sambit right. Yeah you can share

03:15:16.530 --> 03:15:20.530
with Sambit. In between so I can take some question maybe

03:15:20.530 --> 03:15:24.690
like from Sambit. Very good morning sir. This was very nice

03:15:24.690 --> 03:15:27.930
lecture. So basically the same scenario which we are doing

03:15:27.930 --> 03:15:31.790
in our organization using Pega system. Okay. Using Pega we

03:15:31.790 --> 03:15:36.830
are getting all the data and the dashboards for CTIU reports

03:15:36.830 --> 03:15:42.730
using W. Okay. Okay. Same which you have showed. So this was

03:15:42.730 --> 03:15:46.730
very good. So my question is like I am in telecom domain

03:15:46.730 --> 03:15:50.310
like totally have 13 plus year of experience. So from 5

03:15:50.310 --> 03:15:54.250
years I am in telecom. I am checking in URI as well to get

03:15:54.250 --> 03:15:58.950
the domain knowledge. Okay. It will it gave me few normal

03:15:58.950 --> 03:16:02.050
like videos where I got some like some details not the other

03:16:02.050 --> 03:16:05.550
one. However you know as a big organization we don't work on

03:16:05.550 --> 03:16:09.330
many large different use cases. So I am only in a loyalty

03:16:09.330 --> 03:16:13.510
can say point exchange part. But I am checking in a

03:16:13.510 --> 03:16:17.490
companies like Nokia, Amdocs and all these companies. They

03:16:17.490 --> 03:16:23.030
are actually like expecting a domain knowledge either in BSS

03:16:23.030 --> 03:16:26.930
or OSS. Okay. Operating support services or business support

03:16:26.930 --> 03:16:31.630
services. Right. So challenge with me that although I am

03:16:31.630 --> 03:16:35.650
very much restricted in a specific use case only and I can't

03:16:35.650 --> 03:16:40.390
ask my team also to get me other things because it's very

03:16:40.390 --> 03:16:44.950
big organization. And I am checking on URI and YouTube and

03:16:44.950 --> 03:16:49.270
in Eagle either like Kaggle as well. Okay. In Kaggle also I

03:16:49.270 --> 03:16:54.570
got only use case like customer churn. Most of the use cases

03:16:54.570 --> 03:16:59.990
are of the customer churn. Right. So the challenges is that

03:16:59.990 --> 03:17:02.870
I am not getting the proper domain kind of knowledge which I

03:17:02.870 --> 03:17:06.550
can showcase with this much year of experience. Because I

03:17:06.550 --> 03:17:09.830
can see in Nokia as well they are giving a JD. It's not like

03:17:09.830 --> 03:17:13.490
only a customer churn is the project that you can create. I

03:17:13.490 --> 03:17:18.930
think there can be many things that can be done in your

03:17:18.930 --> 03:17:21.670
domain itself. Maybe you have to change your prompt when you

03:17:21.670 --> 03:17:24.190
are searching for this one because that can be done like

03:17:24.190 --> 03:17:27.590
many projects are possible not just one. Why just customer

03:17:27.590 --> 03:17:31.910
churn? It mainly in like telecom domain is divided into two

03:17:31.910 --> 03:17:34.930
parts. Either business support services or operating support

03:17:34.930 --> 03:17:37.570
services. Yeah. So even in business support services or

03:17:37.570 --> 03:17:39.750
operating support services there can be multiple projects

03:17:39.750 --> 03:17:43.890
that can be done. So like maybe just search on a chat GPT

03:17:44.570 --> 03:17:47.550
means URI or anywhere. It will give you multiple. Just like

03:17:47.550 --> 03:17:51.650
maybe write down that okay fine so for this industry I am

03:17:51.650 --> 03:17:55.410
trying to do a business support services. Now give me 20 use

03:17:55.410 --> 03:17:58.070
cases. It will give you 20 use cases. You can do it now even

03:17:58.070 --> 03:18:04.300
and check. And like to prepare the data I will create some

03:18:04.300 --> 03:18:07.840
like some dummy data and create the project to showcase.

03:18:08.020 --> 03:18:11.180
Yeah basically you can try to create basically data

03:18:11.180 --> 03:18:14.020
accordingly. The use cases that you are trying to solve or

03:18:14.020 --> 03:18:17.200
like in some of the cases data is not even required. If you

03:18:17.200 --> 03:18:19.260
are building a system right then in that case data is not

03:18:19.260 --> 03:18:22.980
required. Right. So you can just design that system

03:18:22.980 --> 03:18:27.940
accordingly. Okay. Any suggestion from your side to get the

03:18:27.940 --> 03:18:32.460
domain specific knowledge I tried with different companies.

03:18:32.460 --> 03:18:35.000
Domain knowledge no one is going to teach you by the way.

03:18:35.040 --> 03:18:37.340
There is no classes which happens for a domain. Domain is

03:18:37.340 --> 03:18:41.000
something that we learn once we are into some project. And

03:18:41.000 --> 03:18:44.240
as a techie I should not worried much about a domain because

03:18:44.240 --> 03:18:47.580
yeah maybe one company is looking for the same domain but if

03:18:47.580 --> 03:18:50.660
you will go on with other company right. If you are going to

03:18:50.660 --> 03:18:53.720
go for an interview for other company. In that case maybe

03:18:53.720 --> 03:18:56.920
they will ask for some other domain right. So generally as a

03:18:56.920 --> 03:19:00.340
techie I should not worried much about a domain. But yeah

03:19:00.340 --> 03:19:04.320
it's good to have as experience is going to increase it's

03:19:04.320 --> 03:19:06.820
good to have a domain expertise. For example I simply say

03:19:06.820 --> 03:19:09.620
that I have a good expertise in terms of a supply chain

03:19:09.620 --> 03:19:12.340
because I have worked a lot in supply chain even safety

03:19:12.340 --> 03:19:14.780
surveillance and security. So I have worked a lot so I can

03:19:14.780 --> 03:19:16.900
say that okay fine so in this domain I have enough

03:19:16.900 --> 03:19:20.340
understanding or enough knowledge. Education so I have

03:19:20.340 --> 03:19:22.820
enough understanding enough knowledge. So two three domain

03:19:22.820 --> 03:19:26.140
is my expertise. Similarly so as you will grow in your life

03:19:26.140 --> 03:19:28.700
so you can try to say that okay fine so I have like worked

03:19:28.700 --> 03:19:32.680
in this domain but I'm not sure I can do anything.

03:19:34.620 --> 03:19:36.800
Understood. I'm sure actually what my thought process was

03:19:36.800 --> 03:19:39.360
because I am already in from last six years in telecom

03:19:39.360 --> 03:19:42.720
domain it will be easier for me to transit immediately in

03:19:42.720 --> 03:19:45.880
telecom then totally switching the domain. That's completely

03:19:45.880 --> 03:19:48.120
okay. Yeah since last six years if you are in telecom domain

03:19:48.120 --> 03:19:51.940
then telecom should be your preferred choice and even other

03:19:51.940 --> 03:19:55.100
parties will give you advantage advantage on telecom part.

03:19:56.380 --> 03:20:00.120
Sure sir. Thank you. Thank you. Can I share my screen? Yeah

03:20:00.120 --> 03:20:02.740
Sambit right. Yeah you can share the screen I think you have

03:20:02.740 --> 03:20:08.720
an access. I think it is disabled. Yeah. Share I am not

03:20:08.720 --> 03:20:09.580
getting a pop-up here.

03:20:15.360 --> 03:20:20.000
Yeah Sambit. Yes it is. Yes it is audible. So it is

03:20:20.000 --> 03:20:23.480
mentioning host disabled participants screen sharing so Is

03:20:23.480 --> 03:20:30.080
it? No no no. So just just share once again try sharing this

03:20:30.080 --> 03:20:34.260
not disabled one participant can share screen at a time.

03:20:34.300 --> 03:20:38.900
Yeah this is enabled. Again now try sharing once again.

03:20:39.660 --> 03:20:42.480
Okay. Yeah now I can share.

03:20:45.310 --> 03:20:49.090
I am not able to see the pop-up. Okay yeah I think it is

03:20:49.090 --> 03:20:53.710
visible. I think my screen is visible. So I try to run

03:20:53.710 --> 03:20:54.390
because I am

03:20:57.350 --> 03:21:00.070
Dependence is error key so I try to run this and I am

03:21:00.070 --> 03:21:03.070
getting this particular error and it is asking like this

03:21:03.070 --> 03:21:07.430
platform openai.account key. Yeah so it is a key issue. I

03:21:07.430 --> 03:21:10.790
have just revoked that key. That is the reason it will not

03:21:10.790 --> 03:21:17.230
work basically. So let me give you some new key for now

03:21:17.230 --> 03:21:21.930
which you can test it at least. I have just revoked it so it

03:21:21.930 --> 03:21:22.670
will not work anyhow.

03:21:25.820 --> 03:21:28.820
And one more thing I was asking like this email

03:21:28.820 --> 03:21:32.020
configuration because I am trying to send it to my own email

03:21:32.020 --> 03:21:36.180
id and also this telegram configuration how to get this API

03:21:36.180 --> 03:21:41.420
hash and API id for telegram. Just a minute. Yeah. First of

03:21:41.420 --> 03:21:46.900
all change this API key I have just like shared in a chat.

03:21:47.120 --> 03:21:50.960
So this is open API key. You can use it for now. In a later

03:21:50.960 --> 03:21:54.020
stage you can replace it with your own because this will be

03:21:54.020 --> 03:21:58.800
disabled. And yeah so coming to a telegram part right. Yes.

03:21:58.880 --> 03:22:05.700
So telegram wise you have to go to basically this URL let me

03:22:05.700 --> 03:22:09.580
share once again I have already shared. So this URL I have

03:22:09.580 --> 03:22:14.640
pinged you in a chat. Go to this URL. Yes. First replace the

03:22:14.640 --> 03:22:18.780
API key. Replace the complete key .env and save it. Control

03:22:18.780 --> 03:22:19.020
S.

03:22:36.010 --> 03:22:39.170
Yeah. Now go to this URL. The URL which I have shared it to

03:22:39.170 --> 03:22:39.330
you.

03:23:12.660 --> 03:23:16.980
Then you can check your telegram app. You must have received

03:23:16.980 --> 03:23:23.670
the message in telegram app not sms. Yes yes. I am asking

03:23:23.670 --> 03:23:27.190
some login code confirmation code. No no so that is

03:23:27.190 --> 03:23:28.870
something that you have received right on a telegram app.

03:23:31.410 --> 03:23:32.030
Yes yes.

03:23:37.620 --> 03:23:40.280
Copy and paste maybe try to open up telegram in a desktop.

03:23:40.420 --> 03:23:41.700
That will be better.

03:23:59.290 --> 03:24:01.270
Incorrect. Just copy and paste that will be better.

03:24:06.140 --> 03:24:11.170
Just login into a telegram. You can go ahead with a telegram

03:24:11.170 --> 03:24:15.710
bev. Yeah bev.telegram.org No no no not this. This is for

03:24:15.710 --> 03:24:17.830
app. Telegram bev not

03:24:20.930 --> 03:24:24.170
apps. Yeah click.

03:24:32.130 --> 03:24:34.330
Okay in between I can take some questions. So Ganesh what is

03:24:34.330 --> 03:24:39.310
your question? Yeah Hello Sudhanshu sir. So I am currently

03:24:39.310 --> 03:24:43.630
working in a fintech. And they are trying to automate the

03:24:43.630 --> 03:24:48.490
automation testing. So what generally happens there are the

03:24:48.490 --> 03:24:54.170
functional steps and they the QA tries to convert those

03:24:54.170 --> 03:24:58.850
functional steps into the java automation tool. So now they

03:24:58.850 --> 03:25:05.890
want to automate this automation testing tool. Earlier some

03:25:05.890 --> 03:25:09.230
people what I have done in my company. So they have tried to

03:25:09.230 --> 03:25:15.930
fine tune the LLM model and they have self hosted that fine

03:25:15.930 --> 03:25:21.250
tuned model and but issues they have faced it is really

03:25:21.250 --> 03:25:27.070
costly for them and as well as even after hosting and doing

03:25:27.070 --> 03:25:33.210
all of that it is not that much of efficient giving that

03:25:33.210 --> 03:25:39.690
kind of expected output. So my question was that what is the

03:25:39.690 --> 03:25:45.010
best approach to implement this. So RAG or the fine tuning

03:25:45.010 --> 03:25:50.630
or any type of the approach. See approach is like there is

03:25:50.630 --> 03:25:53.250
no thumb rule kind of approach. It depends upon like a

03:25:53.250 --> 03:25:56.250
problem that I am solving. Problem in hand right and depends

03:25:56.250 --> 03:26:00.010
upon that I will design the approach. I can't say that use

03:26:00.010 --> 03:26:03.810
this and then like it will work everywhere. So if you can

03:26:03.810 --> 03:26:06.110
define the problem statement correctly then only I can help

03:26:06.110 --> 03:26:10.190
you out. Okay yes. So the problem statement is the same

03:26:10.190 --> 03:26:15.130
only. It is in a on a fintech software there are the

03:26:15.130 --> 03:26:19.850
functional steps and there with the if we give the

03:26:19.850 --> 03:26:25.130
functional steps to the my system then it should be

03:26:25.130 --> 03:26:29.690
automatically able to write the test case for that. So

03:26:29.690 --> 03:26:36.610
that's the use case. Okay okay so I think like it's not a

03:26:36.610 --> 03:26:41.090
RAG kind of a things. It's more like a agentic I would say a

03:26:41.090 --> 03:26:45.710
plain agentic not a RAG one basically. So maybe you can try

03:26:45.710 --> 03:26:48.910
to give a code base access as a RAG and it can take a

03:26:48.910 --> 03:26:51.190
reference and then it will try to write the code. But you

03:26:51.190 --> 03:26:53.770
are saying that it should take a functional right only based

03:26:53.770 --> 03:26:56.590
on the functional it should be able to write the case yeah.

03:26:56.970 --> 03:27:00.850
Yes. Then in that case try to pass all the functional write

03:27:00.850 --> 03:27:03.450
a beautiful glorified prompt saying that that this is my

03:27:03.450 --> 03:27:05.350
functional requirement. I am trying to build this kind of a

03:27:05.350 --> 03:27:09.570
product and yeah so try to do all kind of analysis from your

03:27:09.570 --> 03:27:13.410
end and try to you know go to the Google or internet and try

03:27:13.410 --> 03:27:16.650
to do some sort of a research whatever like things are

03:27:16.650 --> 03:27:19.070
available with respect to this similar kind of a use case is

03:27:19.070 --> 03:27:23.050
not the exact one and give me all kind of edge case and test

03:27:23.050 --> 03:27:30.290
cases for me. Okay actually they having a lots of already

03:27:31.090 --> 03:27:35.410
training data no it's not required in that case like

03:27:35.410 --> 03:27:38.130
training data is like not required. So if you are able to

03:27:38.130 --> 03:27:41.790
define a functional cases in a very much well manner right

03:27:41.790 --> 03:27:43.890
then why you are training the model why you are fine tuning

03:27:43.890 --> 03:27:49.210
just to do this actually it's over it's over engineering I

03:27:49.210 --> 03:27:52.090
believe people are doing in your organization then okay okay

03:27:52.090 --> 03:27:57.110
so it is like the fintech product okay so maybe internet not

03:27:57.110 --> 03:28:02.250
able to know pressing any particular key button to process

03:28:02.250 --> 03:28:07.290
the payment or getting some if they want to validate so it

03:28:07.290 --> 03:28:13.090
is under our fintech product only so internet not able to

03:28:13.090 --> 03:28:17.350
understand the functional steps of our product right so

03:28:17.350 --> 03:28:29.090
that's why that's the case so how can we implement it so how

03:28:29.090 --> 03:28:33.850
you can implement I mean like similar manner see I think

03:28:33.850 --> 03:28:38.090
like case is missing here this I am able to find out if you

03:28:38.090 --> 03:28:41.810
are going to define it right in a proper way then step by

03:28:41.810 --> 03:28:45.950
step just break it down and then try to implement it based

03:28:45.950 --> 03:28:50.790
on your understanding and knowledge of tech okay okay so

03:28:50.790 --> 03:28:57.310
approach wise yeah approach just define if you are looking

03:28:57.310 --> 03:28:59.370
for an approach from my side then give me the complete

03:28:59.370 --> 03:29:01.230
problem statement I will give you the approach exact

03:29:01.230 --> 03:29:06.210
approach okay okay yeah simple if you are giving me a

03:29:06.210 --> 03:29:09.830
complete cases then I will give you a approach which you can

03:29:09.830 --> 03:29:15.870
use it fine yeah sure sure yeah Sambit just use this app id

03:29:15.870 --> 03:29:18.510
and app has basically this is the app id and app has is

03:29:18.510 --> 03:29:20.130
available to you so use it okay

03:29:28.510 --> 03:29:32.550
so yeah Sambit is the only person who is left fine I think I

03:29:32.550 --> 03:29:36.750
am not able to see your screen Sambit yeah I think that was

03:29:36.750 --> 03:29:40.090
the API issue was there with how you have shared to do that

03:29:40.690 --> 03:29:45.910
okay I will fix it from my API API I have already shared

03:29:45.910 --> 03:29:50.610
with you and then this one has basically for telegram okay

03:29:50.610 --> 03:29:55.330
now it should work right yeah so please test it yeah this

03:29:55.330 --> 03:29:58.050
API id is there and API has so these two things if you have

03:29:58.050 --> 03:30:01.130
to you have to replace it and then everything will work yeah

03:30:01.130 --> 03:30:03.570
along with this you have to even replace your Google app id

03:30:04.830 --> 03:30:08.210
Google app id Gmail Gmail app id yeah Gmail app id you have

03:30:08.210 --> 03:30:11.830
