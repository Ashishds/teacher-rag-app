WEBVTT

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.360
Okay, so good morning everyone. So I think I'm audible and

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.340
visible to all of you, right? Yeah, so I believe I'm audible

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.580
and visible, clearly. So we are going to start in a couple

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.140
of minutes. So let's other join and then we are going to

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.760
start. Almost all of us have joined, but yeah, so just wait

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.040
for a couple of more minutes.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.070
Good morning, good morning, good morning. Someone is saying

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.670
happy friendship day. So is it a friendship day today? I

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.550
don't know, like I was not aware about it.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.090
Someone is saying voice is low, is it? I don't think that my

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.810
voice is low. I think it's loud and clear. It's Gen AI day

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.710
today. No, we have already started Gen AI day yesterday

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.010
itself. So yesterday was a Gen AI day.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.770
Okay, so just we'll wait for it's 9.03 AM. So we'll wait for

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.490
two more minutes. Yeah, and after two more minutes, so we

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.900
are going to start.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.450
In between, I can have my tea. So

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.130
yes, good morning. Good morning, everyone. Good morning,

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.090
Milind, Amit, Somesh, Rajwal, everyone.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.970
I'm also from Jamshedpur and we met in a Budhgarhi cross on

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.230
Cell Petrol pump. Okay, Aman, thank you. So I stay nearby. I

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.810
think we had a discussion about that.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.360
Good morning, good morning, everyone. Good morning, Praveen,

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.660
Alex, Essa, Rajiv.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.680
Aheed, any plan visiting Delhi?

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.370
I keep on visiting Delhi, by the way. So it's like I do a

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.490
very frequent travel to Delhi, Noida.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.780
Meetup in Bangalore? Yeah, this will be good. In Bangalore,

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.920
I can do a, we were like doing a lot of hackathons and a lot

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.040
of big meetups in Bangalore. So I can, I can plan because

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.900
Bangalore is a place where I stay. So it's very convenient

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.980
for me. To organize such things.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.980
Manish is saying, what, what you're saying, Manish? Since I

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.200
joined from USA, due to time concern, I was not able to join

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.660
a study class. Not an issue. It's fine. So I have already

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.280
uploaded the recording.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.140
Okay, so can you plan this in Prayagrahas? So see, so once

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.300
you say yes, right, so you keep on getting a demand that,

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.580
okay, do this, do that everywhere. But yeah, practically,

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.600
it's not possible. By the way, Prayagrahas is a place where

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:49.020
my in-laws, it belongs to my wife's hometown. So, okay,

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.940
fine, guys. So let's get started. Good morning everyone.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.480
Once again, I think it's 9 0 5 and we all have joined a

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.480
class now. So yesterday, the way we have connected the

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.900
entire class. So in the exact same manner, we are going to

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.120
conduct a class. So first of all, I'm going to like take a

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.380
lecture. I'm going to discuss a topics, which I have to

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.620
discuss for today. And then, so obviously if you have any

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.040
kind of a problem or if you would like to discuss any kind

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.880
of a doubt. So, one by one, I'm going to unmute and then we

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.540
will be discussing a doubts. And if you have to share your

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.860
screen, right? So for example, if I'm doing some sort of a

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.660
setup and maybe some of you are facing some sort of an issue

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.460
in your system, you are not able to do a setup. So

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.880
obviously, you can share your screen. We have that option as

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.620
well. Not just an audio option, but yeah, the screen sharing

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.920
option as well over a zoom. And I have an option from my

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.240
side that I can control even your screen. So I can from here

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.820
itself. So I can try to like do something in your screen

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.560
that is also possible case by case basis, right? So if you

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.420
are facing an issue and this is how we are going to conduct

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.580
a classes, I believe I have already set the agenda or I have

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.740
already said that how classes is going to happen in my

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.960
studies induction session itself, right? And study session

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.200
was live on YouTube. But yeah, so from today onwards, it's

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.120
not going to be live on YouTube. It is going to be here

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.040
itself and we are going to do all kind of a discussion now.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.900
Now, those who have joined today because there are some

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.900
people who are not able to join us today. So maybe like you

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.020
are not aware about the things that we have done. So let me

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.700
just do a recap of each and everything that we have

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.300
discussed in my studies class. Just a quick recap, I would

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.960
say. So I believe my screen is visible to all of you now.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:44.490
So let's go to your own dashboard. And those who have. So

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.030
let's suppose this is your bootcamp class. So just go over

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.410
here inside continue learning and you will be able to find

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.510
out a live lecture. So this is a link, by the way. So with

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.590
the help of this link, you will be able to join your live

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.910
classes. I believe you all have joined it with the help of

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.370
this particular link. And I'm going to activate this

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.810
particular link right before the class means again, one

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.410
minute or maybe 30 seconds before link will be activated

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.590
automatically for that particular day. And you all will be

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:13.650
able to join. So you will be able to join the classes.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.790
Simple. So like there is no rocket science in this one.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.690
Second thing is that that yesterday we have conducted a

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.610
lecture, right? Yesterday it was induction session. So I

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.550
talked about a complete your own ecosystem. So what we have

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.050
and what we don't have each and everything we have discussed

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.590
one by one, one by one. So starting from our home screen or

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:38.250
maybe roadmap or your own plus URI APIs, just a brief

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.730
introduction. So I haven't gone into a depth of anything,

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:45.470
but yeah. So introduction about the. we have done and that

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.430
induction session is already available. Like I said

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.990
yesterday, and I'll keep on saying that it takes some time

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.830
for us to upload a recording, most probably two to three

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:58.070
hour of time, right? Because for four hour of recording,

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:02.490
zoom takes around three to four hour to convert that video

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:05.490
into MP4 and once that will be converted, it will be

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:08.930
uploaded. So obviously those who will not be able to join a

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:12.090
particular class, you will have to wait maybe for like a

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:15.090
two, three hour so that we can upload and yesterday we did

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.710
the same thing and we will keep on doing the exact same

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.170
thing in each and every classes. It is not going to change

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:25.430
at all, right? So those who have missed, I will not say that

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:28.170
go through all four hour. If you have time, yes, you can go

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:32.730
through it, but maybe just like go ahead and just get a

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:35.530
glimpse of this entire thing that we have discussed. Fine.

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:38.230
Can we get an email with the class joining link for every

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:41.510
classes? No, I don't think that email is required. We are

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:43.810
already a part of a group, right? That's the reasons I have

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:45.770
created a WhatsApp group. WhatsApp is pretty much

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:49.990
convenient. No one checks our email nowadays. So can we get

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.870
an email? Can we get a notification? I'll notify you inside

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:57.150
your WhatsApp group itself, right? Because WhatsApp, I

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.990
always feel like it's very handy. It's very convenient for

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:03.490
me to answer any kind of a question. And yeah, so we all are

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:06.710
available anyhow on WhatsApp. WhatsApp is a universal tool

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:10.530
now. Okay. And those who are not able to get a WhatsApp

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.450
link. It's also updated in a very first video itself. So

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.350
click on the resources. You will be able to get a WhatsApp

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.710
link for your batch. For every batches, we have a different,

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.230
different WhatsApp group. This is a WhatsApp group dedicated

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:27.010
just for your batch means just for your batch. Yeah. I'm

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.710
getting an email meeting link because you have signed up in

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:33.790
a Zoom and in a Zoom. So we have switched that option that

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:36.610
whenever you are going to sign up, so you will, Zoom will

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:41.790
notify you automatically. Yeah. Yeah. It makes our bond

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:45.490
stronger as well. Exactly. Yes. Yeah. So WhatsApp, it's like

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:49.170
a pretty much okay with all of us, I believe. And we are not

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:52.050
going to face any kind of problem even after completion of

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.830
the classes, even after completion of the classes, we will

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.270
be connected for a very, very long time because at the end

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:00.290
of the day, we have to help each other. We have to like

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.330
provide an opportunity or share an opportunity with each and

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.590
everyone. And that's the reason. So I have just created a

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:08.910
WhatsApp group and yes, we are controlling. So I don't

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.750
worry. We'll not allow anyone. Any kind of unnecessary

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:15.090
discussion inside the WhatsApp group, but yeah, so you are

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:17.290
free to discuss anything. We are not like controlling

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:21.130
anything on a discussion side. So just feel free to discuss

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:25.750
anything necessary one. Yeah. So necessary one. Okay. So

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:29.390
this is all about my studies discussion guys. Now let's try

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.830
to set an agenda for today's discussion. So what we are

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:34.530
going to discuss today. So first of all, I'll be talking

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:37.910
about our system setup because we have to start our

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:43.050
syllabus. Right? So let me show you our syllabus. I believe

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.850
a study you have already gone through it, but maybe not in

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:49.790
depth. So today, first of all, we are going to do a system

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:53.190
set up a bare minimum system set up. We are going to do in

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:57.310
today's class, then I'll be talking about a couple of

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:02.230
things. Not much, uh, basically from a generative AI

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:06.350
perspective and then a plate form that we are going to cover

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.150
that we are going to discuss. From a generative AI

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:13.710
perspective. So that, so that from next weekend onwards next

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:17.270
Saturday, right? So we have a class same time. So from next

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:21.130
weekend onwards, we can start learning an API first,

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:24.690
technically I'm going to teach you a fast API. So how you

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:28.230
will be able to write a simple Python code, how you will be

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:32.010
able to expose that Python code to the entire world with the

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:34.810
help of fast API, or maybe with the help of flask. So. So

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:38.110
both are basically a framework to create an API inside a

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:43.690
Python along with that. So here inside a URI API. So we have

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:46.430
a multiple code basis, right? We have a multiple code basis

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:49.890
for a Lang chain, for a Lang graph, for Lama indexes, for

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:55.110
init and for autogen. So how I will be able to use that part

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:59.130
means from next week onwards, we will get completely into a

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:02.870
practical, but by taking a baby step, because we, I know

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:05.270
that, that many of us are not aware. Okay. About the API

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:08.690
concept, right? And everywhere, whenever you are going to

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:12.630
create an application, it will be required. So believe me,

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:16.070
even if you just know like a, what is a variable into a

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:19.310
Python, I'm going to teach you an API in such a way that you

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:22.450
will be able to create it. You will be able to expose it. So

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.890
I'm not expecting you to like, you know, be an expert in, in

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:28.330
a Python and it's not that tough. So that's the reason I'm

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.490
telling you that even if you know how to declare a variable

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:34.610
into a Python, only that part, right? Forget about. Oops

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:37.630
concept or maybe exception handling concept or file handling

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:40.710
concept, all of those things. Just if you know that, okay,

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:43.450
how to declare a variable into a Python, I'm going to teach

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:46.310
you that. Okay. How to create your own API. And it's that

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:49.010
simple actually. Right. It's that simple. So it's, it's a

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:52.570
very logical thing, uh, that we all are going to do it. So

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:56.150
fine. So we start guys are practical, uh, in a group, I can

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:59.270
see some message, but yeah, fine. My team is handling it. So

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:04.620
they will handle. So sir, tomorrow class didn't do it. We

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:05.840
can start from today. Okay.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.940
So you can go through a recording and then obviously you can

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:20.000
start. Yeah. Fine. Uh, so URI API is built on fast API

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.560
unknown. So our entire backend for URI API is basically for

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:27.960
this one is written in node.js basically not on a fast API.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:33.000
We are not using a Python as a backend for this one. Uh, we

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.800
are using node. Our entire stack is on a merm basically.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:36.560
Okay.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:43.690
So, uh, in a group, I can see a lot of discussion going on.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:48.770
Is it necessary? Uh, yes. Live link is not coming up after

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:54.150
login, like people are able to join. Yeah. Maybe some, some

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:56.590
people are facing an issue because maybe they are new to a

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:59.770
platform. It happens for a couple of initial classes, but,

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:04.050
uh, yeah. So fine. Let's get started guys. Everyone. So just

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:06.530
try to open up a system. Yesterday. We had a lot of

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:09.930
discussion. So, uh, let me tell you one thing very clearly,

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:14.690
uh, anything or any system, uh, which is equivalent to I

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:19.010
five, right? I five is going to work. So I five is one of

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:23.030
the minimalistic kind of a system that you need, even for

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:25.910
your day to day personal work, whatever work that you do.

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:29.230
And even for learning this entire things, because going

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:33.530
forward, we have to introduce a cloud platform. So the

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:36.030
reason is very simple. So let's suppose I'm talking about a

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:39.030
fine tuning, right? A model. Fine tuning. Uh, it doesn't

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:42.710
matter how good my system is. So beyond a certain capacity

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:46.490
or beyond a certain models, I will not be able to a fine

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:50.230
tuning in my local system. So I'm going to show you, I'm

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:53.250
going to teach you that how you will be able to do a setup

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:56.050
of GPU. There are so many vendors out there. For example, a

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:59.130
paper space is one of the vendor, uh, which we use

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.390
frequently. So basically like I'm going to teach you that

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:06.130
how you will be able to do us GPU setup over those cloud

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:09.070
platforms. And then how you will be able to do a training

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:12.530
setup so that you will be able to like do a fine tuning with

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:16.590
respect to a model depends upon the use cases. Maybe a LoRa,

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:19.930
maybe a Cora, maybe a SLM, maybe a quantization. These are

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:23.150
the fancy words for you. I know, but yeah, so eventually you

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:28.250
will be aware about that one. Uh, so there will be not much

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:31.630
of system dependencies. You will be able to find out in

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:35.790
terms of a compute, but yeah, so if your system is having a

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:40.010
higher configuration, um, it will not give you a problem as

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:44.090
simple as that, right? So first of all, guys, what we have

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:50.130
to do, uh, in my today's class. So let me write down the

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:55.770
agenda that what we are going to do. So agenda number one, a

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:59.390
very first thing that we are going to cover is a system

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:01.250
setup, system

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:07.920
setup. Agenda number two that I'm going to cover. A major

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.880
framework, framework

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:18.380
intro, just intro. So I'm not going to go in depth because

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:21.060
for going into a depth, it's already a part of your

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:24.240
syllabus. So I'm just going to introduce a major framework

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:28.140
and I'm going to tell you a reason that, okay, so this

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.400
framework, we are going to use it for this particular reason

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.440
or that particular reason so that you will be aware about

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.680
these framework, at least with respect to a name. So I'm not

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.640
expecting that, uh, you should like, uh, get a mastery with

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.360
respect to those framework in today's class. But no, I'm

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.600
just, I'm just expecting you that you should remember the

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:50.520
name, only a name. That's it. Nothing more than a name at

00:16:50.520 --> 00:17:01.200
all. And then, uh, like a third one. So URI API a use. So

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.660
how I will be able to hit a URI system after doing a system

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.820
setup. So this is something which I'm going to discuss in my

00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:11.200
today's class. I'm assuming that, uh, all of you are ready.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.300
Are you ready with your system? So if not, please take your

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.140
time to do three minute time, uh, those who have joined

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:19.140
through a mobile devices. So please make sure that going

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.020
forward, uh, join through your system, join through your

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:25.820
laptop and, uh, whatever I'm going to do. So parallelly, you

00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:28.880
will be able to do it. I will keep on pasting a link and

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.240
code each and everything in your chat box itself, uh, in a

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.620
real time so that I'll do it in my system. You will do it in

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:41.040
your system. Yeah. Fine guys, everyone. Can you please

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:45.280
summarize? How? When AI apps are built? I think it's not a

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.400
matter of summary, uh, by the way, because yesterday we had

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.140
a lot of discussions and I simply said that, see, there is

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.020
not one simple logic, one single thumb rule that you can

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:57.220
apply all across the application, right? So it's, it's a

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:59.920
matter of practice. It's a matter of building something. And

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.660
that is the reason we have the entire batch. Yeah.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.820
Everything works for now. Sorry. Okay. So fine. First of

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:11.380
all, we have to do a system set up now. So we can write a

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.920
Python. We can write a Python code in our local system and

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:18.100
we can try to write a Python code maybe in some ID which is

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:22.680
available even online, uh, apart from that. So nowadays

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:27.380
there are some IDs which is available in a market basically,

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.860
which is going to help you out in terms of writing a code.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.960
And uh, I believe we all have heard about a vibe coding, V I

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:40.340
B vibe coding. So where you just give a prompt. Yeah. Yeah.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.680
Where you just start writing a code. So I will try to

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.740
introduce you with respect to vibe coding as a tool at

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.900
least, right? A tool at least that, okay. So this tools that

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.600
you can try to use and then you will be able to do a vibe

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.980
coding. So it is going to build a simple POC for you or

00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:00.820
simple small MVPs for you. It will be able to build it. So

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.880
this is where this entire system setup will come into a

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.460
picture plus how you can do a local complete system setup.

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:11.640
So first thing guys, first thing, uh, okay. So here we have

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.980
a system setup. So here, uh, you just go to Google and try

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:18.820
to search for a Python. So as we are going to write a code

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:21.120
in a Python and we are going to use a Python programming

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:24.580
language. So those who have not done a setup, so just try to

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.700
write Python download. So once you are going to write a

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:31.200
Python download, you will be able to see a link called as

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.940
python.org, which is our official link by the way. Yeah. And

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:39.860
uh, here, so this python.org, let me ping you this one.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.820
Fine. So in this python.org, you will be able to see, I have

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.800
already pinged you a link inside your chat, so you can check

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:51.520
that out. So here you will be able to see a download option

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:55.400
for a windows, for a Linux, for a Mac machine. So for all of

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.600
these machines, download option is already available now. So

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:03.520
by default, you will be able to see a latest version 3.13, I

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:07.960
generally recommend people to go ahead with 3.10 version

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:11.620
because 3.10 is compatible with most all of your devices.

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:16.040
Most of the libraries or the frameworks that you are going

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:21.020
to use inside a class or even inside the industry. So 3.13

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:25.300
is not that compatible and 3.14, they have just pre

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:28.180
-released, so it's not stable at all. So I'll always

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:32.700
recommend to go ahead with 3.10, but it's completely fine.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.200
It's completely fine if you are clicking over here and then

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:40.520
you are downloading 3.13 for now. Because in later stage,

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.040
I'm going to even show you that doesn't matter what is a

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.920
base Python environment you have, you will be able to create

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:51.100
a multiple environment. There is something called as a

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:55.160
concept of virtual environment that we do, that we try to

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.320
create with respect to a Python. So it's completely fine.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:02.320
It's completely fine. So just go ahead and download this

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.440
Python, whatever you see as a latest version, download it.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:09.180
So once you will be able to download it. It's available,

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.740
like I said, so it's available for all the machines, whether

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:14.620
it's a Windows, Linux or Mac on the same location, right? So

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:17.000
just select your machine and then you will be able to

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.100
download. Now once you are able to download it, it's a very

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.560
small file. So quickly you will be able to download it. So

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:26.700
again, just click over here and then click, click, click,

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:30.620
just like you do an installation for any other things inside

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:34.720
your system. So you will be able to do an installation, just

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.640
make sure that while doing an installation, check this

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:41.840
option, add Python exe to path. If you are not doing it,

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.260
then in a later stage, you will have to do it manually. So

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.740
you have to like add this particular path in a system

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:50.820
variable and especially for a Windows machine. For a Linux

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:52.940
machine, for a Mac machine, you are not going to face such

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:55.640
kind of an issue. But yeah, for a Windows machine, so you

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.360
will have to either check this option if you are not

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.840
checking this option. So in that case, like I said, manually

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.280
you will have to go and edit your system environment

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:08.800
variable. So first guys. Python installation. I know many of

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.840
you have already done that, right? Again, so those who have

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.680
gone through my Python lecture, which I have already

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.740
uploaded, even over there. So I have shown you the same

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.880
thing that, okay, fine. So go and install the Python, then

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.860
go and install VS code, all sort of things. Is it done guys?

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:25.240
Yeah. It's a very small file. So quickly, I think within 30

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.180
seconds of time, you all will be able to do an installation.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.660
Now once you are able to do an installation, so how you are

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:36.740
going to check that whether it has been installed or not. So

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:41.660
to do it, right? To do it, open up your command prompt CMD,

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:45.440
right? Open up your command prompt or maybe a power cell and

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:51.380
then simply type Python space hyphen hyphen V E R S I O N

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:55.540
version. So Python space hyphen hyphen version, hit enter.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:58.720
And if you are able to see some version, it doesn't matter

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.820
like you are able to see the same version or some different

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:03.260
version, but yeah, if you are able to see this particular

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:06.480
version. It simply means that that your system is able to

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:10.740
find out Python, yes, your system is able to find out

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:13.820
basically a Python. So are you able to see a Python version

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:17.920
guys? Just open up your command prompt and type this one. So

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.460
let me ping you this inside your chat, yeah, Python version.

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:24.860
So I have already pinged you the command, fine. So this is

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:27.920
the only requirement that we have beyond that we will be

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:32.540
able to do all kind of a configuration. Not showing in Mac.

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:36.600
Okay. So which one, this command, it is not showing in a

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:36.780
Mac.

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:50.580
Yeah. So try with this Python 3 then in the back, especially

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:53.400
in Mac, in windows, it will show by the way, fine.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:01.100
And yes, we have an amazing, like a fellow learners who will

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.600
be able to help you out. So that's a, that's very engaging

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:08.040
things and I can see like people have started replying even

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:13.060
for me. So that, that shows the enthusiasm. Fine. Okay. So

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:15.200
that's the reason we have a group event. So even if you are

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.040
going to face some sort of issue. After a class, so

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.960
obviously we have so many people out there, right? They will

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:23.060
be able to help you out. And believe me, I have seen a group

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:26.840
and I have a lot of such kind of a groups. So we're even

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:30.260
after a two switch or three switch or three transition,

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.640
people are helping each other, right? Even after like a

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.140
three year, four year, I completed total setup. That's

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:39.720
great. Okay. That's great. So fine. This is the Python setup

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.040
that we have to do. So step number one, we have to basically

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:46.200
do a Python setup. Now inside the same Python setup. In the

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:50.160
same system setup, we need a IDE. Again those who are not

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:53.800
aware about it. So we need a place, we need a software or

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.600
you can say we need a tool where we can go and we can write

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.440
a code by the way. So that is something called as IDE

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:04.440
integrated development environment, right? My favorite one

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:08.980
is a VS code. Now someone likes some like a Python kind of

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:12.660
ID. Someone likes some different IDs. I like a VS code.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:16.860
Again IDE wise all are good. All are like equally good, I

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:21.000
would say. So VS code is very much convenient one in terms

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.060
of its UI interface, in terms of managing a code, in terms

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:28.860
of executing it, in terms of like, you know, adding up

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.740
plugins with respect to a VS code and that's the reason. So

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:37.160
I like VS code and I believe like me, I'm not alone over

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:41.400
here. So the entire world loves VS code, I would say, yes.

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:46.140
So I love VS code as simple as that. Now, so VS code is

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:50.540
what? VS code is basically a IDE, yes, IDE, integrated

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:53.400
development environment. So where you will be able to

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.560
execute a code in any languages, any languages, literally

00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:01.120
any languages, not by default, obviously. So just now we

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.680
have installed Python. So now we can try to configure a VS

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.740
code inside our system. So let's go ahead again to the

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:13.140
Google and search over here, VS code download. Yeah. VS code

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:16.520
download and it's available for all machines, Mac, Linux,

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.260
Windows, all three. So you are not supposed to worry about

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:22.960
anything. So this is the official, right, this is the

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:27.620
official like link I have already pasted inside your group.

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.920
Yeah. So don't worry. You don't have to do a Google search

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.740
even. I have already pinned you the link over here. So just

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:36.140
go over there, go to this link, the link which I have

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:38.800
already pinned you inside your chat box. Yeah. And hope all

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.100
of you are able to open up.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:49.160
Yeah. Okay, fine. So now if I have a Windows machine, I'll

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.080
click here. If I have a Linux machine, so based on the

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.120
Debian or maybe RPM, so I'll try to click here. And if I

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.800
have a Mac machine, I'll try to click here. As simple as

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:02.740
that, very easy installation again. So no hustle, no

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:05.900
struggle. So just try to click and as you can see, the time

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.840
I have clicked, it has started downloading, right. It has

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:12.860
started downloading. It's a 106 MB of file I can see. So it

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:15.840
may vary system to system. System to system is Mac, Linux

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:20.620
and Windows. Yeah. So just try to download it. So as you can

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:24.980
see, I have downloaded fine. Now after downloading these

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:31.680
files, let me keep into a list view. Yeah. So once I am able

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:35.740
to download this file, this particular VS code, again, what

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:42.760
you have to do, so click, let me close my open session of

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:48.770
the VS code. Yeah. So click and then I agree, accept the

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:54.090
agreement. Next, create a desktop icon, add to path. So by

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:57.030
default here, it's checked, add to path is required for

00:27:57.030 --> 00:28:00.050
Windows, right. And sometime what will happen is that, that

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:02.590
you'll have to restart your system sometime, not all the

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:07.310
time, but yeah. So next and then click on this install. So

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:09.750
automatically it will be able to install each and everything

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:12.350
inside your system. A very, very easy installation, only

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:13.010
two, three clicks.

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:28.530
Yeah. So are you able to do an installation guys and click

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:32.370
on finish? Yes. Click on just finish. So it will be able to

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:36.590
do an installation. Let me close my existing session and let

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:39.210
me open up once again in front of all of you for the first

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:43.190
time. Yeah. So once you will be able to do an installation,

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:47.130
so here, if you are using a Windows, then you can come over

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:49.510
here, you can try to search for it. If you're using a Mac

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:51.770
machine or command, then you can search inside your search

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:56.270
bar or terminal. Right. So just try to search for a VS and

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:59.190
automatically it will be able to like open up a visual

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:05.130
studio code. This is one of the open source IDE. You all

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:08.790
will be able to find out. So where you can build any kind of

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:12.230
a project means literally any kind of a project which exists

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:19.680
in this entire world as simple as that. Yeah. Can you repeat

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.820
the path selection? So don't have to do anything with

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:25.300
respect to path selection. Just check that box. So that is

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:30.080
more than enough. VS code already, how to check the path is

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.280
added or not. So if it is working, then path is added, you

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.480
don't have to do anything. Yeah. By default it will be able

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:40.260
to select. Fine. Okay. So a VS code I'm able to open up and

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:42.980
I'm assuming that most of us are able to open up. Right

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:46.380
guys, everyone. Can I get yes in a group? And if you are

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.560
facing any issues, so you can let me know if you're not able

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:52.420
to see something like this kind of a screen. So almost

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:56.900
everyone is yes. No issue. Okay. Fine. Fine. Fine. Mac

00:29:56.900 --> 00:30:02.720
issue. Okay. So I don't think that a VS code gives much of

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.040
issue in a Mac. It just drag and drop inside the folder.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:11.560
Right. With respect to a Mac. Yeah. But yeah, if you have a

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.860
very, very old one, then, uh, it, it gives an issue, but

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:19.300
it's easy to fix. I believe, but the gypsum and GPT and GPT

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:23.220
drag and drop it simple. Yeah. All good in Mac. Fine. Yeah.

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:27.840
So we'll try later. Now we can give, try, you can try it

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.320
even now. It's fine. Like it will not take more than 500 a

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:34.600
time. Uh, yeah. So fine. A VS code installed. Now VS code

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:38.300
will be a place where we will be writing a code. We will be

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:41.880
writing a code almost like a 90% of the time we will be

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.400
building all this project. We will be doing a lot of like

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:49.360
experimentation over here now inside of VS code, right

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:53.720
inside of VS code. Yeah. Uh, in progress VS code, sir. Okay.

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:56.640
So I'm giving you two minutes of time. So it's 9 0 31,

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.800
right? So I'm giving you a time of two minutes. Uh, those

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.480
who are not able to do it, please do it quickly. Uh, you

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.100
don't have to do anything by the way. Let me ping you a link

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:08.360
once again. So just go to this link. Yeah. Just go to this

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.720
link. Download, click, click, click, install. That's it.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.300
Yeah. Nothing much. And then launch it. Launch VS code.

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.080
Yeah. So I'm giving you two more minutes of time guys.

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:37.590
Uh, Hanrava is saying what? Path variable is equal to

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:39.930
significance variable. Python environment compiled default

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:40.810
path. Yes.

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:01.380
Okay. So once you are able to install a VS code and once you

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:04.160
are able to see this one, right? Once you are able to see

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:08.160
this one, then you have to do couple of more steps so that

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.840
my system will be full proof and it will be ready. Yeah. So

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:15.400
when you are going to open up a VS code guys, yeah, whenever

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.540
you are going to open up a VS code, so you will be able to

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:23.800
see this particular option inside a VS code. So there is an

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:27.520
option called as extension option. This one, the marked one,

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.600
the highlighted one I'm talking about, right? So you must be

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.840
able to see this particular option. So this is something

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.620
called as extension. So with the help of this, you will be

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:39.160
able to install any kind of a extension. Extension simply

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:43.120
means that additional capability. Yeah. So VS code is a open

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:47.940
source, basically IDEs created by Microsoft. So major

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:50.820
contributor was Microsoft and then in a later stage, so they

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:54.360
have made it open source and entire world is using this VS

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:58.380
code for writing a code. And even people are able to modify

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:01.660
this entire VS code and they have launched their own labs.

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:05.160
They have launched their own IDs with their own version. So

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:08.240
here you will be able to find out an option of an extension.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:12.100
So we have to use this option and we have to install a

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:16.500
couple of extension over here. So let's try to install those

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:19.980
extension in this particular place. So you can try to click.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.760
And then. You can open up this extension by clicking it, or

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:27.400
you can try to use a shortcut command for that one. So

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:30.660
control shift X. So if I'm going to close it, let's suppose,

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:34.600
yeah, I'm going to close it control shift X and it is going

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.880
to open up the extension. Now once you are able to open up

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:41.160
the extension, try to search for a python first of all,

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:44.160
simple search for the python. And if you are connected with

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:47.780
the internet, you will be able to see a python over here.

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:52.240
Simple. And then. Then you will be able to see a python by

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:55.800
Microsoft. So again, you can even try to publish your own

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:59.020
such kind of extension. I have published a lot of my

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:04.400
extension on my own. So again, so I think I have not taught

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.780
in any classes that how to build this kind of extension. But

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:09.640
yeah, so I have already published it a lot of extension. So

00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:13.680
it's possible for even you to build a extension for your own

00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:16.940
purposes, wrap it up and then publish it inside the store so

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:19.160
that other people will be able to use it. Similarly.

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.260
Similarly, so many people have already published these

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:24.540
extensions. So this is from official Microsoft itself.

00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:29.100
Search for a python over here and then you will be able to

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:32.920
see an install option. So I am looking at uninstall option.

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:36.320
The reason is very simple. I have already installed but you

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.680
will be able to see an install option. Most of you I would

00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:42.520
say like those who have not installed. So just try to click

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.980
and automatically within a fraction of second it will be

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:50.240
able to install it. Yeah. So control shift X in a Mac, it

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.320
will be command shift X. So alternative for a control is

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:59.200
technically a command. Yes. Yeah. How to build an extension?

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.600
One video required. Yeah. I have already created one video

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.720
on this one. Not one video. I think multiple video I have

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:08.180
done on this one. How to create a SDK basically or for pypy.

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:11.400
Maybe sometime I will do it for extension as well. It's easy

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.560
actually. It's easy to publish.

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:19.370
Okay. So this is the python extension guys. Again, I'm

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:22.330
repeating the step as you are new to a VS code, right? So

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:25.270
once you are going to open up a VS code, like I said, you

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:27.430
will be able to see an option and we are going to use this

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:30.510
option so many times. So not just for today, even going

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:32.990
forward. So I'm going to use this particular option. So this

00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:35.290
is the option that you will be able to find out called as

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:38.470
extension. Now what it does. So basically there are so many

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:41.930
tools, there are so many plugins people have created maybe

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:45.270
for a code completion, maybe for a compilation, maybe for

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:48.650
debugging the entire code basis, maybe for like a, you know,

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:51.890
showing you the code as a graph basically. So that logically

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:54.410
you will be able to connect. So these are the additional

00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:56.510
capabilities, right? These are the additional capabilities

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:59.750
that people or some organization keep on creating, keep on

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:02.550
doing it. And there are like millions, I'll not say

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:05.350
thousands by the way. So there are millions of such kind of

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:08.850
an extension people have created. Even you can create it and

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:11.890
push it to the store so that people will be able to download

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:15.090
and people will be able to use it. So if that extension is

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:19.750
that useful. So. So here just go to the extension tab and

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:24.850
then just click. So you can use a command shift X if you're

00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:28.030
using a Mac and if you're using a windows control shift X or

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:32.170
just use a mouse click simple and search for a python. Then

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:35.110
you will be able to find out a python officially from a

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:38.590
microsoft.com yeah microsoft.com. So just install it. It

00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:41.650
will be done. So this is one of the installation by the way

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:44.810
you have to do. Yeah. And then the second installation.

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:48.790
Second installation is. This is a jupyter notebook. So J U P

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:52.570
Y T E R jupyter and then N O T B double okay. So jupyter

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:55.450
notebook is something that you have to search again inside

00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:58.770
extension. I've just pinged you inside a chat. So jupyter

00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:02.070
notebook is something that you have to search and again here

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:06.450
you will be able to see a jupyter by microsoft official one

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:10.290
yeah jupyter by microsoft. So again you have to just click

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:17.460
and it will be able to install it. Fine guys. Yeah. Yeah. So

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:20.040
the extension, I mean like there is nothing called as like a

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:22.700
list which works for the gen AI. It's like general purpose

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:25.240
extension people have created and as and when we'll move

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:26.900
inside the class, I'll keep on teaching you.

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:33.170
Fine. Okay. So two extension. One is a python extension you

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:36.270
have to install and one is a jupyter notebook extension you

00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:40.750
will have to install right now. So once you will be done

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:44.730
with these two installation, so your vs code is

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:48.070
approximately ready at least for now. I would say at least

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:51.130
for now. For today it's ready. It's ready. So now in this

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:54.810
jupyter notebook, uh, first of all you go to file. Yeah. So

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:57.630
how do we create a project by the way? So what we do, so we

00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:01.850
go to a file, we go to open folder option. Yeah. So there is

00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:04.330
a folder option which is given to you. So we go to open

00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:08.570
folder option and then from here you can choose any of your

00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:11.850
drive, right? Any of your drive or you can try to create

00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:14.450
maybe a new folder. So I'll be creating a new folder. For

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:18.430
example, my batch is gen AI, right? Gen AI. Uh, let's

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:21.490
suppose a certification bootcamp. So gen AI certification is

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:24.970
a new folder I have created and then I'll try to select so

00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:28.470
that all of these code will be available inside this

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:31.110
particular folder, gen AI certification that I have created.

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:34.130
So again, I'm going to repeat, go to file, right? Go to

00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:37.930
file. Step number one, step number two, open folder and then

00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:40.530
create a new folder. Let's suppose I'm going to create gen

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:43.530
AI test folder, select it, select this particular folder.

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:47.710
Now. Whatever code you are going to write, it will be

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:50.670
available inside this particular folder. You can even right

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:53.910
click, you can try to copy the path, right? You can copy the

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:56.930
path. You can even click on this find folder and you can,

00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:59.770
uh, like if you would like to like know that, okay, at which

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:03.470
location this file is in my system. So I right click in this

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:09.570
space, copy the path and then I can try to go here and here

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:12.950
is a path, right? D drive gen AI test. Simple. It's very

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:16.350
simple, very convenient. So here, uh, just, just, you have

00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:19.530
to like do a couple of clicks. You will be comfortable. So

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:22.130
it's not that tough. Those who are new to a VS code, let me

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:25.350
tell you, it's not that tough at all. It's very, very easy.

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:27.770
So you just have to do a couple of clicks here and there,

00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:31.490
which we all are doing. So by today, today's end itself, you

00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:35.510
will be comfortable with a VS code. So here is a folder I

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:38.930
have created and now in this particular folder, so I can

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:41.510
write any kind of a code. I can try to create a folder

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:43.850
inside a folder. I can do technically anything and

00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:47.090
everything that I want as simple as that. So here, let's

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:50.210
suppose, uh, I have to create a file. So where I can execute

00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:54.690
my code, right? Click once again and then new file, yeah,

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:59.090
new file. And here, so I can try to create my file with any

00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:02.370
name that I want, but extension should be intact. For

00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:05.830
example, so here, let's suppose if I'm creating a test,

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:09.230
right? Test. And let's suppose if I have to create a Jupiter

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:12.130
notebook, kind of a file, a Jupiter notebook extension that

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:15.590
we have installed just now, right? So I'll give a file name

00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:21.030
dot I'll give I P Y N B. So I Python Jupiter notebook. This

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:25.690
is what it means by the way. So file name dot I P Y N B all

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:29.250
the time hit enter. Now you will be able to see a Jupiter

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:32.370
notebook kind of a system, right? Where you can try to write

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:36.390
a code and you can do whatever you want. But so let's

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:39.090
suppose, and this, this is possible, right? This is possible

00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:42.310
because of this extension. So. This extension that we have

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:44.870
installed, right? Jupiter notebook extension that we have

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:47.950
installed. It's possible because of this extension. So I

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:52.270
will be able to execute a Jupiter notebook inside my system

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:56.030
now sometimes. So why do you put a notebook is important to

00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:59.250
why Jupiter notebook is a required reason is very simple. So

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:02.870
sometime line by line will write a code, we'll try to like

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:05.510
a, see the explanation of a code. We'll do a lot of

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:08.990
experimentation. This is a place where Jupiter notebook is

00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:12.650
required. But, but, but. When it comes to building an

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:15.470
application, right? When it comes to a building an

00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:18.410
application, when it comes to modular coding, like a

00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:21.650
standard approach that we try to follow at that point of

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:24.430
time, it's not a Jupiter notebook. It will be a multiple

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:27.530
folders, multiple structures. And then inside that there

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:31.050
will be a multiple modules, technically a dot Python file.

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:34.350
I'm talking about a dot PI file I'm talking about, right? So

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:37.130
we'll do a lot of experimentation over there. I'm going to

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:40.610
use a Jupiter notebook. And then. Obviously. This is a dot

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:43.530
PI file. I'm going to use making sense guys, I had a version

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:46.730
3.0. Yeah. So let's not fight on version side of it. Any

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:49.250
version is fine for now, because anyhow, I'm going to teach

00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:51.870
you how to create a virtual environment. So over there

00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:56.130
again, I can control any versions fine. So what is the

00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:58.110
difference between an IPNV and a PI file? So basically both

00:41:58.110 --> 00:42:00.750
are different file structure, IPNV simply means that it is

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:03.850
going to open up in this tab format where in a tab, you can

00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:06.550
write a code, but yeah, you can, you can't do a modular

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:09.530
coding over here. Dot PI file means folder inside the

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:11.870
folder. And you will be able to do a modular coding and

00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:15.630
eventually we have to leave a Jupiter notebook. Technically.

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:19.230
I used to say that Jupiter notebook is for a beginner or

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:22.530
like, let's suppose I'm teaching you a Lang chain, Lang

00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:25.310
graph, something like that, right? So initially I will try

00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:27.610
to start with the Jupiter notebook. But eventually when I

00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:30.150
will teach you that how to use those things and build and

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:33.450
project a build application, um, at that point of time, I

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:36.570
can't use a Jupiter notebook. Right? When I say that, okay,

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:38.830
let's go and deploy this project again. At that point. At

00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:40.970
that point of time, I will not be using a Jupiter notebook.

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:44.110
I will be using a complete full formatted modular coding

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:46.970
structure, right? Which will be required as simple as that.

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:51.250
Yeah. Please show me again how to open up a Jupiter

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:54.330
notebook. It's nothing basically, right? Get a new file,

00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:57.290
right? Give a file name, for example, test one, and then

00:42:57.290 --> 00:43:02.770
your extension should be dot IPYNB, IPYNB, IPython Jupiter

00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:06.730
notebook, simple. So your extension should be IPYNB. And

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:12.130
then bingo. Done. Yeah. So here in this way, so just look at

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:15.710
my extension. It should be exact same file name could be

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:18.010
anything. It's fine. Test one. I have given test. I have

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:20.550
given. You can give your name. You can give my name. That's

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:23.910
completely fine. Extension should not change. IPYNB should

00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:26.270
not change because this is how system will be able to

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:28.490
understand that it's a Jupiter notebook that I'm talking

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:32.310
about, by the way. Yeah. Now. So, uh, here, when you are

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:35.370
going to call a Jupiter notebook by default, it will not be

00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:37.670
able to execute anything. So let's suppose if I'm writing

00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:40.950
one plus one. Yeah. And if I'm going to execute it, how to

00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:44.730
execute. So I can try to click on run or I can use a sift

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:48.130
enter. Shorthand is basically, I can even click here to run

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:51.010
the cell, execute the cell. So as you can see this, my, my

00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:56.370
mouse cursor, right? So just look at my, let me, uh, use

00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:03.930
my, yeah. So I think you are able to see my mouse cursor

00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:08.430
with a red dot, right? Red dot. So this is a place where you

00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:11.210
can try to click and you will be able to execute it. And

00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:12.650
when you are executing. When you are executing for the first

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:16.910
time. So as of now, this is technically, this is technically

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:22.510
just a file. So it is not having a Python access. See, uh, I

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:25.250
have told you in the beginning itself, right? That I can try

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:28.930
to use a VS code to write a Java code to write a C plus plus

00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:32.450
code to write a Java script code means language is not a

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:36.370
barrier. Uh, if you remember in a beginning itself, what we

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:39.930
have done, so we have technically installed Python. Yeah. In

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:45.090
our system. VS code will be able to use it. VS code will be

00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:48.970
able to invoke it because now Python is available, a core

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:52.930
library, which is required to execute any of my Python code.

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:55.410
It's already available. And then we have done the

00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:58.850
installation of VS code. So technically VS code is using a

00:44:58.850 --> 00:45:01.750
Python that you have already installed. Similarly you can

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:04.930
install a Java SDK and then you will be able to write a code

00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:08.790
in Java as simple as that. Now here. So once you are going

00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:11.530
to click on execute. Yeah. You will not be able to execute

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:16.030
it because, because you have to attach, attach what? So you

00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:19.190
have to attach your installation. What installation?

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:21.330
Obviously Python installation. You have to attach, right?

00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:24.870
You have done the Python installation. So here you have to

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:28.710
select a Python environment. So click over here and then you

00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:31.690
will be able to see some base environment in your system. So

00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:34.750
I'm able to see multiple environments, right? So let's

00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:37.090
suppose you are able to see this kind of environment, Python

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:41.550
3.12 or maybe Python 3.13, 3.10. Whatever. This is called as

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:45.610
base environment. Take it, right? Take it. Now you will be

00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:49.930
able to execute it in my system required. And if it is going

00:45:49.930 --> 00:45:52.590
to give you some pop up for installing a kernel, just click

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:55.430
yes. Just say yes. It will be able to install the ipynb

00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:58.050
kernel for this Jupyter notebook for this particular

00:45:58.050 --> 00:46:01.370
environment. So again going to repeat guys, again going to

00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:05.070
repeat. So see you have to, as of now I can see like a

00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:08.790
Python 3.12, right? Python 3.12. And I have attached with

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:12.410
respect to a test one Jupyter notebook. Now again on a test,

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:14.810
every time you have to do it. So every time whenever you are

00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:18.290
going to create a new Jupyter notebook, it is going to ask

00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:20.850
you to do the same thing. So let's suppose test. I have not

00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:24.510
attached any kind of a kernel. Kernel means executor, like

00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:28.370
basically a thing or system which will be able to understand

00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:31.790
my Python code. So here I can try to click on select kernel.

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:35.950
Simple, right? Yeah. And by default I have used it recently.

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:39.110
So it is showing me. If I click on select another kernel, a

00:46:39.110 --> 00:46:43.190
Python environment I have to select, right? And here in my

00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:46.610
system, you will be able to see hundreds of environment. But

00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:49.370
if your system is new, you will not be able to see all the

00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:52.430
hundreds of environment. You will be able to see just the

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:55.050
installation that you have done as of now, right? And the

00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:57.170
installation which has been attached to your path system

00:46:57.170 --> 00:47:00.810
variable. So just click select and it will be able to like

00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:04.290
take that particular environment. Very simple. Now, if I'm

00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:06.730
going to write a code, for example, one plus one. If I'm

00:47:06.730 --> 00:47:09.830
writing. Then if I'm hitting shift enter or control enter,

00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:12.990
or if I'm going to click over here, click over here, you can

00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:16.770
see it is able to execute and I'm able to see the output.

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:19.430
And if you're able to see the output, it simply means that

00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:22.310
my Jupyter notebook is up and running. It's working. I don't

00:47:22.310 --> 00:47:24.610
have to worry about anything. Now I can, I'm good to write

00:47:24.610 --> 00:47:30.490
any kind of a code. Yeah. Yeah. So you, you will face some

00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:33.550
issues with respect to a clicks. Believe me, with respect to

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:37.810
like selecting a kernels. I don't think that. Yeah. I don't

00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:41.610
think that anyone is going to face an issue once you will be

00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:47.450
able to like connected. Yes. Now, shorthand. So here there

00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:50.570
is a like a click, right? A shorthand for this one is

00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:55.650
control shift and here P. Yeah. P. So you can try to, so it

00:47:55.650 --> 00:47:58.190
will try to open up a search bar. Basically those who are

00:47:58.190 --> 00:48:01.310
using Mac, it will be command shift P. So again, when I say

00:48:01.310 --> 00:48:05.230
control Mac, people just change to command. Yeah. Change to

00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:07.110
command keyboard. Because there is no control in a Mac

00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:11.410
system. So control shift P, shorthand basically. So one

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:14.210
option is click and then select, right? Other option is

00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:18.630
control shift P and then here. So you can go, you can try to

00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:21.810
go and type Python and then you can try to use a select

00:48:21.810 --> 00:48:25.390
interpreter. Yeah. Select interpreter. Same place you will

00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:28.110
be able to land. So control shift P, select interpreter,

00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:31.150
same place. And shorthand is going to work for all the

00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:33.850
machines. As simple as that. Making sense guys? To all of

00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:37.390
us. Yes. So are we able to attach a kernels? Because if

00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:40.510
kernel is not attached, you will not be able to execute any

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:44.810
code, means literally any code in Python. Simple. Can you

00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:47.270
provide the steps for default Python environment selection?

00:48:47.650 --> 00:48:52.170
Simple. Control shift P, right? Type Python. It will show

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:54.490
you all the list of environment. Python environment. It will

00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:59.010
show you all the list. Yeah. Karthik and everyone. So are we

00:48:59.010 --> 00:49:02.670
able to do it guys? Yes. Everyone. It is. It is not tough,

00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:05.610
but I know like for the very first time when you see the

00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:07.990
system, right? Because this is something that you will be

00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:11.530
doing daily, maybe once in every hour, once in every half an

00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:15.210
hour you will be doing. But yeah, I know that initially when

00:49:15.210 --> 00:49:18.410
we are very new to these things, we face some sort of

00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:21.530
issues. Yeah. And those who will be facing these issues even

00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:24.450
after a class, feel free to share your screen. I'll look

00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:26.790
into your screen. I'll fix it. It's not a big one. I know.

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:30.670
But yeah, I'll fix it. After the class. Right. In our doubt

00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:32.810
link session. That's the reason. So we have a doubt

00:49:32.810 --> 00:49:36.650
clearing. Yeah. It is not taking environment. Sometime you

00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:39.150
will have to like a close it, open up once again. Sometime

00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:42.770
you have to even restart or maybe just go ahead with this.

00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:46.430
If it is showing you environment in CMD, right? It will be

00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:50.350
like giving you environment. That's the reason why I've just

00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:53.130
asked you, asked everyone that go ahead and check inside the

00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:55.650
command prompt. And there is a possibility that environment

00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:58.210
is not added. Then manually you have to go to your

00:49:58.210 --> 00:50:00.910
environment variable. And then you have to add it because

00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:04.350
that's the only issue. Apart from that, no one is going to

00:50:04.350 --> 00:50:06.770
face, believe me, any other issues with respect to this

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:09.390
setup. And this is just one time for the very first time.

00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:13.890
Yeah. So hope we are able to make our Jupyter notebook up

00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:17.550
and running inside this one. Now another kind of a file, a

00:50:17.550 --> 00:50:20.610
Pythonic file you can create over here. So just a right

00:50:20.610 --> 00:50:26.110
click new file. And here I'm going to write test2.py. .py.

00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:30.790
.only py. And here. So again, you will be able to write a

00:50:30.790 --> 00:50:33.570
code. Yeah. Again, you will be able to write a code. So for

00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:38.390
example, I'm writing print. My name is

00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:47.170
Sudhanshu Kumar. Yeah. So this is again another file where

00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:50.330
I'm able to, where I will be able to write the code and I

00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:54.370
will be able to execute even this particular one .py file.

00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:58.550
So this is another extension .py. Majority of times you will

00:50:58.550 --> 00:51:01.470
be able to see me or you will be able to find out. That I'm

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:05.050
creating .py file in terms of creating a project in terms of

00:51:05.050 --> 00:51:08.090
creating the full flage application. So which you can push

00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:11.010
it into a production system. I will not be pushing a Jupyter

00:51:11.010 --> 00:51:14.730
notebook by the way. Yeah. Like I said, it's good to like,

00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:17.830
you know, break down the code into a line by line steps and

00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:22.490
execute it and like see the explanation, but not good for

00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:25.370
like a modular coding. Yeah. That's the reason. So I keep on

00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:28.310
saying it's for a beginner. So as a beginner, we can use it.

00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:31.230
But yeah. There is also a provision where you can try to

00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:34.150
productionize the entire Jupyter notebook in a database, for

00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:36.290
example. So they provide you a Jupyter notebook. You can try

00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:38.290
to productionize the entire Jupyter notebook that is also

00:51:38.290 --> 00:51:44.010
possible. So I'm not denying even that possibility. Okay. So

00:51:44.010 --> 00:51:47.950
here, if I have to execute .py file, simple right click, and

00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:52.270
then I can try to execute or run in Python, the option that

00:51:52.270 --> 00:51:55.430
you will be able to see, otherwise you will be able to see

00:51:55.430 --> 00:52:02.300
where is my dot. Yeah. So otherwise you will be able to see

00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:05.800
even this option. So you have to like click right as you can

00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:08.820
see my arrow, arrow marks. So you can try to click over here

00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:13.640
and then you will be able to use this option as simple as

00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:17.140
that. Let me remove my arrow. Yeah. So just follow my mouse

00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:21.620
pointer. So here click and then run Python file. So once you

00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:25.200
are going to call click run Python file, whatever I have

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:28.960
written over here, I'm able to see it right in my output. My

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:31.660
name is Anshul. This is something which I have written. And

00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:35.880
yeah, same thing I'm able to print it. So both of my like a

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:39.920
way of executing a code is working. My IP file, my Jupyter

00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:44.460
file is working and my .py file is also working. Both of

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:48.780
this in my local system. Fine guys, everyone are we able to

00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:54.700
execute it, both the files. It means we are able to do a

00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:55.220
system setup.

00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:07.200
Show me .py file. It's nothing by the way. Okay. So right

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:12.140
click new file test to extension. Just give an extension.

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:15.680
Just a matter of extension, by the way. So .py file, right?

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:20.560
And now here I'll go, I'll write something that this is my

00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:27.460
second gen AI class. Yeah. Control S, save it. And then I

00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:31.760
have to execute this entire file. So I'll go here, follow my

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:36.700
mouse cursor. So I'll go here, run Python file. Yeah. Run

00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:41.970
Python file. And I will be able to see the output. Simple.

00:53:42.310 --> 00:53:47.550
Nothing. It's nothing actually. Yeah. So both the mode is

00:53:47.550 --> 00:53:52.330
ready in my local system now. So this is not the only option

00:53:52.330 --> 00:53:55.390
which is available to me by the way. So I have other options

00:53:55.390 --> 00:53:59.030
which is available to me. For example, I can go to Google

00:53:59.030 --> 00:54:04.990
once again and I can try to search for a collab, G-O-O-G-L

00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:09.010
-E, C-O-L-A-B, Google collab. So basically Google collab. Is

00:54:09.010 --> 00:54:12.930
a notebook kind of a structure which you will be able to get

00:54:12.930 --> 00:54:17.470
from a Google itself. Yeah. Google itself. Let me ping you

00:54:17.470 --> 00:54:20.190
this one inside your chat. So yeah, I have already pinged

00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:24.770
you. So here you can come and you can try to create a

00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:29.190
notebook, only notebook, not I-P-Y, not .py file basically,

00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:31.770
only a Jupyter notebook you will be able to create over

00:54:31.770 --> 00:54:34.310
here. So let's suppose if I'm going to click on new

00:54:34.310 --> 00:54:38.210
notebook, fine, new notebook. So again, if you are using. If

00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:41.990
you are using this one, then there is almost no load on your

00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:44.970
system because everything will be like executed inside a

00:54:44.970 --> 00:54:47.350
browser, right? Everything will be executed inside the

00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:51.550
browser. So even over here you can do one plus one and then

00:54:51.550 --> 00:54:54.570
you are going, you can try to execute it. Now, once you will

00:54:54.570 --> 00:54:58.230
try to hit execute, it will show you like a dot, dot, dot

00:54:58.230 --> 00:55:02.910
here. Just follow my mouse cursor, the red dot, right? So it

00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:05.950
is going to allocate our resources. So it is going to

00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:08.690
provide you a shared resource by the way. You will be able

00:55:08.690 --> 00:55:12.390
to see those resources over here that it has provided you a

00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:18.290
12.7 GB of a RAM and then 107 GB of a hard disk, a shared

00:55:18.290 --> 00:55:20.970
one by the way, not a dedicated one. So they are providing

00:55:20.970 --> 00:55:24.990
you and you will be able to write a code. You will be able

00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:29.830
to execute a code even over here inside a Google collab. You

00:55:29.830 --> 00:55:33.170
can even download this code, right? So you can try to

00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:36.310
download this code as a Jupyter notebook file, I-P-Y, I-N-B

00:55:36.310 --> 00:55:40.210
file and then you can try to open up in any other places in

00:55:40.210 --> 00:55:44.150
your VS code again. So many beginners, right? Many

00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:48.330
beginners. So let's suppose we have created our file and

00:55:48.330 --> 00:55:51.470
let's suppose I'm going to download this file, IP only file.

00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:53.490
So this is something which I have downloaded where I have

00:55:53.490 --> 00:55:57.570
one plus one, right? So many people initially have seen that

00:55:57.570 --> 00:56:01.050
they will try to open up this file directly. For example, if

00:56:01.050 --> 00:56:04.830
you are going to open up this file, where is my open option?

00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:10.390
Yeah. So if I'm going not in here. So let me open up this

00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:15.190
file inside a text or something, choose another app. So many

00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:18.290
people by default, they will try to open up their file

00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:22.510
inside a notebook kind of a structure, right? And when you

00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:26.690
try to open up on an I-P-Y specially into a notebook kind of

00:56:26.690 --> 00:56:29.850
a structure, it will show you some format like this. And

00:56:29.850 --> 00:56:32.950
people say that I am not able to open up the file. Yes, you

00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:35.510
will not be able to open up the file. file, you will not be

00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:39.710
able to see the content if you are not opening up your IP

00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:44.450
YNB file in a IP YNB compatible environment as simple as

00:56:44.450 --> 00:56:47.710
that if you are going to open it up into some notebook, it

00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:50.310
is going to show you those kind of a result a kind of a JSON

00:56:50.310 --> 00:56:53.410
format it is going to show it to you which you will not be

00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:56.730
able to understand. So this is the issue a common issue

00:56:56.730 --> 00:57:00.090
which some of you are going to face initially couple of

00:57:00.090 --> 00:57:02.430
times but after that you will be able to understand that

00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:05.050
okay fine this is not an issue actually I have to open up

00:57:05.050 --> 00:57:09.650
into a VS code or a place a reader where it will be able to

00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:13.270
understand this file extension .py file you can open up into

00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:17.170
a jupyter notebook or sorry .py file you can open it up into

00:57:17.170 --> 00:57:19.950
a text editor that is completely fine it is not going to

00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:22.790
change but yeah there is a issue you are going to face with

00:57:22.790 --> 00:57:27.650
respect to IP YNB if you are beginner a simple step is open

00:57:27.650 --> 00:57:35.070
it up into a VS code not into a text editor. Yes. Okay. Next

00:57:35.070 --> 00:57:37.570
question is it is asking for a python interpreter some

00:57:37.570 --> 00:57:41.250
Sumsri is saying so yeah click and then select the python

00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:44.710
interpreter it will show you the drop down right always

00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:51.160
used a collab generative AI work without a GPU see

00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:54.360
generative AI work doesn't requires a GPU unless and until

00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:57.160
you are not doing a model training and then inferencing

00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:02.640
right it is a myth that generative AI requires like a GPU

00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:05.740
all the time. Because all the time you will not like you

00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:07.620
know end up doing a fine tuning of the model

00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:15.900
yes so okay so here is a collab another place where you will

00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:19.960
be able to execute your code and if you are not able to do a

00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:22.880
configuration because here you are not supposed to do any

00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:25.100
kind of installation by default installation and everything

00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:27.260
is done you don't have to go ahead with the python

00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:30.100
installation just come over here and then start writing a

00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:34.060
code and it will be able to execute your code. As simple as

00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:38.700
that now like a Google collab so Google collab is not just

00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:42.140
one system I can go over here and I can try to search for a

00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:47.120
Jupyter notebook online yeah just go to Google you will be

00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:50.280
able to see a 10 other options so where you can go and you

00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:53.840
can try to like you know good bad that's a different story

00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:57.360
right that's a different story but you will be able to see a

00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:01.340
10 different online options so where you can go and you can

00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:05.260
try to you know. Execute a code so those options are

00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:08.740
available a collab is one of the best one because it gives

00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:12.540
you more resources so that you can execute a bit of heavy

00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:15.980
code as well yeah this is where collab comes into a picture

00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:19.560
you have a it's from a Google itself right it's from a

00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:22.340
Google so they give you a lot of options but this is not the

00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:27.140
only option even in a online mode where you don't want to do

00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:30.840
any kind of installation in your local system we have an

00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:34.480
option we have lot. Of many options even in a online mode

00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:37.920
and that too free all of these are technically free to all

00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:40.920
of us and for the infinite time they are not going to charge

00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:44.660
you Google collab sometime back they have I think two or

00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:47.220
three years back they have released a option called as pro

00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:50.180
option Google collab pro there where they were charging like

00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:55.140
a $10 per month but I don't think that they have like a that

00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:58.380
option even now because in India I'm not able to see it and

00:59:58.380 --> 01:00:01.560
even back then when I have checked so it was available in

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:05.500
USA. And some other reasons but not in India where they give

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:08.160
they were giving you like a more resources more resources

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:11.120
means this one this RAM and hard disk they were giving you

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:15.060
more resources and but I don't know whether they are giving

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:20.980
it now or not I haven't checked yeah Kegel notebook yes

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:23.440
there are tens of other places there are so many other

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:25.640
places at the end of the day I have to write my code I have

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:28.600
to build my project that's it so doesn't matter whether I'm

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:34.120
doing it here or somewhere else. A baseline is completion of

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:37.200
the task is something which matters in future do we need a

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:45.720
TPU on collab no not like a TPU on collab yeah okay so using

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:48.780
a cursor ID for everything I hope it's fine okay coming to

01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:52.340
that point as well so fine guys so VS code set up in local

01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:56.620
we are able to do it right and then Google collab now so in

01:00:56.620 --> 01:01:00.440
a VS code and inside a Google collab you will have to go and

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:03.500
write a code and then there is an extension. You can try to

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:08.580
install where it will help you out in terms of code

01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:12.580
completion and we are living in a world of AI right era of

01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:15.920
core AI and we are trying to learn generative AI so

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:19.740
technically we are even trying to learn a AI itself right so

01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:24.200
obviously if we are not going to use an AI while learning

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:29.180
right while learning or while building a project so I think

01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:34.220
then what is what is the use of. Learning an AI right what

01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:37.860
is the use of learning an AI so obviously we have to build

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:41.760
bigger see AI is going to help you out always in terms of

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:45.600
building up bigger things right bigger things so obviously

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:51.200
we all have to use I believe my yeah so I am visible so

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:55.680
basically we have to use a AI even in a day-to-day basis

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:59.780
while building a things right while building a things and

01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:04.660
this is where. Live coding comes into a picture so where you

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:09.100
are not supposed to write many line of a code a system will

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:12.540
do it with the help of prom we all know that right that okay

01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:15.000
I can give a command and then chat GPT will be able to write

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.660
a like a code for me I believe we all have tried that part

01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:23.160
chat GPT or maybe a like a cloud a or maybe pop xlity or

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:27.620
Gemini there are tons of other platform and we have a URI so

01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:30.580
guys have you tried URI yesterday yeah. This is your

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:33.660
experience by the way those who are new those who are old I

01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:36.480
know like they are comfortable with URI but have you tried

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:41.900
URI yeah so maybe after one year pop xlity has given a free

01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:45.840
access to all the Airtel user in India right maybe after one

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:49.560
year they are going to charge you but this will be available

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.760
with a Hiron plus subscription or your course subscription

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:55.100
failing I don't think so it's going to fail so upload option

01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:58.340
was failing no maybe only for one people maybe you can try

01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:01.220
now that it should not fail yeah obviously you can't upload

01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:04.120
like a we have put up some of the limit over there so if

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:06.720
your file size is very very big gb of tv file then it will

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:11.800
not work yeah are we wrapping for today not at all one more

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:16.840
hour to go with my lecture and then loud clearing image gen

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:19.120
is not working image gen will work if you will select the

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:22.140
image option in a bottom image options you have to select it

01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:24.100
again for a web search real-time web search you have to

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:26.620
select the web search option but yeah I would love to hear

01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:30.360
your feedback and thoughts on that one you are not able to

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:34.020
upload the small file then we will check so we will check

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:37.960
the option but yes it should work it's one of the stable

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:41.300
system that we have and it should work all the time day and

01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:45.080
night 24 by 7 and if we are facing any issues obviously

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:48.280
every system will be having some minor issues we will try to

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:53.320
fix it in no time working not working file size 20 MB please

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:57.580
fix we will see how much I think 5 MB team has allowed maybe

01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:03.480
we can increase the limit. Yeah I was able to upload the

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:06.440
images it will work guys anyhow it will work yeah fine so

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:09.980
what what I was trying to say is that that we are living in

01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:13.800
an era of we are living in a age of AI so obviously even

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:18.480
while doing a coding we have to use a AI now this is where a

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:23.420
vive coding comes into a picture I believe some of you must

01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:27.720
have heard about a vive coding those who are not aware about

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:32.400
a vive coding let's do it and let's test it. So see vive

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.980
coding simply means that that you will write some prompt

01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:38.700
maybe I have to build a small project right maybe I'll show

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:41.420
you I'll show you now itself so maybe I have to build a

01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:46.740
small project and I want an assistance from a system from a

01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:49.820
AI that okay let's build a small project from me from the

01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:52.960
scratch right maybe for a UI for a front-end back-end all

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:57.220
those things maybe I have an existing project right I have

01:04:57.220 --> 01:05:00.780
some project on a github and or maybe somewhere else.

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:05.520
Somewhere in my local and I want a AI to explain me that

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:08.920
project or like create a readme file create a complete

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:12.960
project documentation maybe a PRD maybe HLD maybe LLD for me

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:18.840
right so now at least we are living in an era where AI will

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:23.440
be able to do some of these tasks easily yeah some of these

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:27.060
tasks easily now you must be having a curiosity or you must

01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:29.480
be having question in your mind that okay so if AI is able

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:32.340
to write all the code then do we need a developer do we need

01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:36.840
a people yes we do need even after hundreds of years and

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:39.640
believe me doesn't matter what people are saying but yeah so

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:43.280
you can go and like a talk to those people who are actually

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:46.840
building I have seen like a you know on a social media

01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:51.300
people are talking a lot about these things but when I check

01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:53.980
their background and when I like a check like what they have

01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:56.920
built so far I was not able to find out for majority of

01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:58.900
people and those who are building they are busy with

01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:01.140
building so they are not saying anything on social media. So

01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:04.680
all those buzz has been created by a majority of the people

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:06.740
I'm not saying everyone is fake but yeah the majority of the

01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:09.760
people who have not built even a single thing they just have

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:13.960
only one skill and that skill is to you know speak something

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:17.340
in a polished way so that people will believe and this is

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:19.900
the reality of the social media and it's nothing new right

01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:23.220
we are not kid we all understand that part but yeah believe

01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:26.120
me developer will be required architect will be required

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:29.220
solution designer will be required even after hundreds of

01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:30.780
year because if you will see the line of the social media it

01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:32.340
will be like this. Over the last three decade right last

01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:37.420
1990s then 2000 and after 2010 and almost the fourth decade

01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:40.820
we are into right we are into 2025 so almost into a fourth

01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:44.400
decade since IT revolution a major IT revolution there was

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:47.740
IT even in 80s but yeah it was very less it was in a very

01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:52.160
very initial stage so we are almost in a fourth decade and

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:55.300
you must have seen our if you will go and do a google search

01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:59.200
or maybe you must have seen the movies that things are

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:04.580
evolving right. So the things that we are able to use it

01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:08.420
easily nowadays, just example like mobile phone, it was,

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:11.960
people was not able to even able to imagine it in 1990s,

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:15.100
right, we were literally, so we are basically 90s born,

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:19.620
right, so we were literally had to go to a PCO booth and

01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:22.720
then from there we have to like give a call and it's not

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:26.160
like even landline was common in all the household, at least

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:29.000
in my house there was no landline, so we had to go to a PCO

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.540
and then from there we have to like give a call to someone

01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:34.140
and per minute we have to pay like a heavy amount, so we

01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:36.540
were able to talk only for one or two minute that how are

01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:38.980
you and then like people say I am good and then it's done.

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:43.180
So things has evolved a lot, right, things has evolved a lot

01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:46.840
and similarly we have ended up generating a new problem,

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:49.460
whether it's an environmental problem or whether it's a

01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:53.000
problem in a society or whether we are like planning to

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.140
like, you know, establish a colonies on a Mars or maybe on a

01:07:57.140 --> 01:08:02.540
moon. So our problem has even changed a lot, right, a lot

01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:07.040
and even we are able to do a lot of evolution. So it's not

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:10.660
like and this is something that has been done by a human and

01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:16.460
see AI, right, so AI always works based on the thought I am

01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:20.060
going to give till certain extent. It will not be able to

01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:21.960
think that okay, fine, this is required, that is required,

01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:25.160
let's do this, let's do that in majority of the cases and

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:28.960
even going forward. So as we will keep on evolving, we will

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:32.100
keep on generating a new, new, new, new problem. So in one

01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:34.460
single sort, AI will not be able to solve it. That's the

01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:38.240
first part. Second part is that that you will not be able to

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:41.180
build a AI, right, you will never be able to build a AI,

01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:48.580
basically, which can develop an end to end system with every

01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:51.400
kind of security, every kind of feature, every kind of

01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:54.140
facilities that we are looking for. The reason is very

01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:57.000
simple. AI just understands. It understands a pattern,

01:08:57.180 --> 01:09:00.680
whatever pattern it has learned with the data that we fed

01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:04.520
into the AI system, it is able to generate, right, it is

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:06.580
able to generate, that's the reason. So we say it's a

01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:09.580
generative AI generates, right, but generates based on what

01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:13.240
whatever pattern that we have fed, yeah, whatever, yes, till

01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:15.880
certain extent, it will be able to understand even a new

01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:18.620
pattern, but on an accuracy side, we have a doubt. So again,

01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:21.100
same goes with the vibe coding that with the vibe coding,

01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:24.360
because we are using it, my entire team is using it. So

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:27.540
obviously, it is. It is a able to enhance our capabilities,

01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:32.780
even like when we were writing a code before AI era, two and

01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:35.540
a half year back. So it's not like we were not building a

01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:37.500
system, we were building a system, a lot of system we have

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:40.660
built. And even at that point of time, it's not like we were

01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:43.280
writing a code from the scratch. No, we were reusing our own

01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:46.060
code basis, we were like, looking into someone's GitHub

01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:49.140
repository, we were looking into a stack overflow, and we

01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:51.840
were writing a code, we were developing a system. Now, the

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:54.160
only matter of fact is that, that I have a smart,

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:57.500
intelligent AI. I have a smart AI. Basically, assistant I'm

01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:01.120
able to get with the help of AI, right, which is going to

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:06.300
obviously like enhance my frequency, I would say, and which

01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:08.420
is going to give me additional power additional

01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:12.420
capabilities, where instead of 10 developer, maybe if you

01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:15.500
are one very, very good developer, very good one, again,

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:19.040
very good one, not average one. So very good developer, yes,

01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:22.580
instead of 10 people, you alone, you will be able to build

01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:25.500
some product. Yeah. And not a complete product, I would say,

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:28.680
which can go for the scale and, you know, which can do

01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:31.340
everything. But yeah, at least till MVPs, it's very, very

01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:34.100
easy now. And this is what we have seen in last three

01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:37.980
decades, right? Things are becoming easier. So I have given

01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:41.000
the example of mobile phone and the connectivity, right? So

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.980
yeah, connectivity was difficult, now it's very easy.

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.760
Similarly, writing a code was difficult, now it's getting

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:49.840
easy, easier, easier and easier, right? But yeah, we are

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:55.250
falling into a new problem statements as well. So basically,

01:10:55.470 --> 01:10:59.850
here, we have a IDE, I hope all of you are able to

01:10:59.850 --> 01:11:03.090
understand the context of AI, what I'm talking about. So

01:11:03.090 --> 01:11:07.990
here, in terms of AI, so I can try to use something called

01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:11.450
as VIVE coding. And there are multiple tools which is

01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:14.710
available in a market now. One of the famous one is cursor,

01:11:14.890 --> 01:11:18.350
I'm not promoting cursor, by the way. But yeah, so CUR, SOR,

01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:22.930
just try to search for a cursor. One of... Even recently,

01:11:23.150 --> 01:11:28.490
Google has announced Google like Fire, Google Firebox, I

01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:31.150
think, I'm not able to... Fire, sorry, Fire, no, not

01:11:31.150 --> 01:11:34.570
Firecrawl, Firebox, will have announced, not able to recall

01:11:34.570 --> 01:11:37.490
the exact name, but yes, in from Google, you will be able to

01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:41.070
find out but yeah, cursor is Firebase, yes, got it. There is

01:11:41.070 --> 01:11:43.210
Firecrawl, there is a Firebase, yeah, it's a Firebase,

01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:48.370
basically. So here, you will be able to find out a cursor,

01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:51.350
one of the most popular one. The most popular one. The

01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:53.950
second most popular which I see in a market is called as

01:11:53.950 --> 01:11:57.790
WindSurf, W-I-N-D, S-U-R-F, WindSurf, which is a direct

01:11:57.790 --> 01:12:01.530
competitor of this one. Now both of these guys have done

01:12:01.530 --> 01:12:04.850
what? So the VS code that you have installed today, right, a

01:12:04.850 --> 01:12:07.930
VS code, on top of it, they have built their own wrapper,

01:12:08.150 --> 01:12:10.810
they have built their own agents, basically. They have

01:12:10.810 --> 01:12:15.530
attached AI models, for example, a GPT model, Gemini model,

01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:19.390
Cloudy model, Sonnet, they have applied over there. So

01:12:19.390 --> 01:12:22.450
that... Just with the help of your command, it will be able

01:12:22.450 --> 01:12:25.450
to generate a code for you, which I'll show you right now,

01:12:25.530 --> 01:12:28.590
yeah, which I'll show you right now. Plus, cursor is giving

01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:31.730
you, even WindSurf is giving you some free tier, so you can

01:12:31.730 --> 01:12:34.550
do a experimentation. So do a very simple thing, guys,

01:12:34.590 --> 01:12:38.490
download, yeah, download for Windows. If I'm using a Windows

01:12:38.490 --> 01:12:41.190
machine, if you're using a Mac machine, it is going to give

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:44.190
you an option for a Mac as well as for a Linux. So it's

01:12:44.190 --> 01:12:47.410
available for all the machines. So just download it. And

01:12:47.410 --> 01:12:50.530
again, installation is very quick. I have already opened up

01:12:50.530 --> 01:12:54.630
my cursor, let me close it, yeah. So just execute.

01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:00.380
So cursor is already available in my system, by the way,

01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:03.800
yeah, accept the agreement, next, next, next and done. Let

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:08.220
me ping you the link, by the way, guys, for a cursor. So

01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:13.620
this is a cursor, open up, download and install. Now this

01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:17.740
cursor is going to help you out directly without even like

01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:21.680
asking URI or ChatGPT or Gemini. The cursor is going to help

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:25.460
you out directly to, you know, write a code in terms of what

01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:29.380
coding these are paid ones. Everyone is a paid one, they are

01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:34.770
giving you some free tiers. Basically, a company laptop will

01:13:34.770 --> 01:13:37.710
not allow. So if you are using company laptop, so you have

01:13:37.710 --> 01:13:41.110
to ask for a permission from your admin. I'm not saying that

01:13:41.110 --> 01:13:44.890
it's for everyone, those who are blocked basically, because

01:13:44.890 --> 01:13:47.090
majority of the company gives you a laptop and they blocked

01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:49.690
the additional installation. And if you are looking for some

01:13:49.690 --> 01:13:51.610
additional installation, you have to like install, you know

01:13:51.610 --> 01:13:54.810
go with the admin permission so you can you should go and

01:13:54.810 --> 01:13:58.770
ask your admin if you would like to use it otherwise use the

01:13:58.770 --> 01:14:00.330
existing one fine

01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:06.340
guys yes okay.

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:12.160
So GitHub there are so many options nowadays again for a

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:14.600
cursor and windsurf right so there are like 10 other option

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:19.580
which is available but again products are if half cooked or

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:23.220
half baked so in that case you will feel frustrated in terms

01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:25.520
of using it right we

01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:31.940
will use another lapid then yes yeah because otherwise you

01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:34.120
can go to go and check with your admin majority of times

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:36.760
your admin will allow so they would not be having any kind

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.740
of issue because you are not installing anything suspicious

01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:45.000
it is a ID just an additional ID yeah. Colab could we use

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.800
you can use anything that you want but yeah so you like

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:51.300
depends upon your convenience my personal choice I am

01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:53.900
talking about over here. Your personal choice could be

01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:56.420
different but yeah try this out maybe your personal choice

01:14:56.420 --> 01:15:02.200
will change simple yeah. Now so cursor download it install

01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:06.700
it just like a VS code a no hustle kind of a system again so

01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:10.840
where you will not find any issues. Now again open up CURSOR

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:13.980
search for the cursor so maybe in your Mac system or Linux

01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:17.980
or maybe into your windows search for the cursor. Now I will

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:21.140
show you a vive coding a flavor of vive coding we will do a

01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:24.980
lot it is just my first class right technical class we are

01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:28.080
going through so you will be able to find out let me close

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:32.720
my existing like a project so and let me open up a fresh

01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:35.080
folder over here so you will be able to find out this

01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:39.260
interface which is similar which is similar to the VS code

01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:43.480
that you have installed because technically cursor is a VS

01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:47.640
code right VS code like I said it is a open source project

01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:52.180
by Microsoft and many people so even if you have seen in my

01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:56.060
previous company so we have created a lab a complete lab so

01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:58.500
where you don't have to do any kind of installation in a

01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:02.140
local machine you just have to click lab will spin and then

01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:05.100
you will be able to write a full-fledged code now I am not

01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:07.260
saying that just like a Jupyter notebook kind of no full

01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:10.040
-scale code the way you are writing it over here so even we

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:13.360
have done the same thing back then I think two and half year

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:16.480
back I have built that project and I have launched it in my

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:19.620
previous company and people have literally loved it right

01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:23.500
literally they have loved it. Okay. I don't know Neuralab

01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:26.700
exactly so people who are coming from the past they remember

01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:30.900
that right so we have built it so we have even modified the

01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:33.880
VS code because VS code is open source project so everyone

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:37.900
even windsurf right the another one which I told you so even

01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:40.000
if you will go through a windsurf, windsurf is doing the

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.560
same thing like they are modifying the same VS code right so

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:47.840
no one go and build like a things from the scratch they just

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:50.980
like use the VS code. And then obviously lot of agents lot

01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:53.000
of wrapper. They have built it on their own that's the

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.880
reason it's working in that way right okay so here open up a

01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:00.760
cursor guys now I will go to file same as VS code right open

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:04.820
folder and then let's suppose I am going to create a test

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:09.840
VIB test five yeah so let's do a test five coding so created

01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:14.340
a test five folder select a folder and as of now there is

01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:17.220
nothing right there is nothing there is nothing in this one

01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:22.100
and on your right hand side yeah on your right hand side you

01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:26.560
will be able to see let me show you that so on your right

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:29.800
hand side you will be able to see this new chat option if

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:32.740
you are not able to see it click click this this pan just

01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:36.560
follow my mouse cursor red dot yeah red dot it's easy peasy

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:39.920
kind of a thing so click click so you will be able to see a

01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:44.900
new chat option yeah new chat option and here so you will be

01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:48.260
able to see a agent ask background all those things here.

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:51.460
You will be able to see all the models if you are going to

01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:54.540
click on auto by default I believe when you install it will

01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:58.000
be on auto by default yeah auto means model selection it

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.780
will do automatically if you are going to like you know hide

01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:04.360
it then it will show you the model it is using so it is

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:07.840
using basically cloud SONET 3.5 O3 Gemini GP this this this

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:14.120
and you can add your own model as well for example so they

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:16.540
are let's suppose that charging you right obviously after

01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:20.100
certain limit they are going to charge you right they are

01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:23.000
going to ask for $20 and maybe like their max plan is I

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:28.160
think for $100 I believe so here you can try to add even URI

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:31.460
API key but yeah URI API key we are giving you 1 lakh per

01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:35.240
day so it will be exhausted very soon within 5-10 minutes it

01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:38.900
will be exhausted if you are generating a code but there is

01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:42.340
a possibility that you can even give an access so

01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:45.940
technically see this is the IDE it will be having a AI model

01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:49.740
access right so as you can see it is having a cloud A3 cloud

01:18:49.740 --> 01:18:55.060
A4 SONET 3.5. SONET 3.5 SONET O3 Gemini GPT 4.1 4.0 now if

01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:58.440
you will go and check right if you will go and check Euron

01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:02.180
so even inside a Euron inside a URI you have those model

01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:05.840
access right and for the same model we have given you API so

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:09.840
see 4.0 mini 4.1 you have an access actually right you have

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:12.960
an access and even inside the API if you will go and check

01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:16.600
so we have given you those access so I have label models let

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:19.840
me let me let me go to introduction and then open AI. These

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:23.560
model access you have with the API right so it is possible

01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:26.620
and cursor is giving you an option where you can try to

01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:29.600
attach your own model maybe an open source model which you

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:32.180
are running in a local or maybe you are running on a cloud

01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:38.500
so it is possible to attach like a URI API over here so that

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:42.060
you don't have to go and give like a $20 by the way yeah but

01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:46.660
again 1 lakh is a daily limit that we have given to you so

01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:49.720
it will not be like a possible. It is possible to build an

01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:54.240
entire project out of it because API comes with the cost and

01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:58.400
we are giving you 365 lakh for an entire year right because

01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:02.780
whatever you buy from Euron you are having like a 365 days

01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:06.640
of access so it's a 365 lakh so it is already costing us a

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:10.680
bomb right we are planning to bring some like a plan I don't

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:14.020
know whether I will launch that or not where on paper use

01:20:14.020 --> 01:20:16.660
basis if someone is looking for additional API they can go

01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:20.800
ahead and like use it. But yeah I am just thinking on that

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:23.900
like a pricing model basically because I don't want to you

01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:27.760
know go high on my course prices so Euron plus prices

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:31.320
basically so that's the reason and API is technically giving

01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:36.820
us a lot of cost so here right this is basically a chat

01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:40.100
prompt or chat window so where you can write something and

01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:44.060
it is going to take a help of those AI model that you see in

01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:46.240
the market right that you see in a market that you see

01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:48.580
inside the URI. Because at the end of the day this is the

01:20:48.580 --> 01:20:51.800
browser this needs an access of the model and cursor never

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:57.060
ever they have trained or released their own model they are

01:20:57.060 --> 01:21:00.380
using all the model from outside same goes with the windsurf

01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:04.260
they have not created their own model and same goes with

01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:07.140
even Euron we have never created we never claimed that we

01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:09.540
have fine tuned or we have created any model no we are

01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:13.580
giving you access of those world class model this is what we

01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:19.660
say yeah this is what we say. Those companies won't restrict

01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:23.220
you sir which company no we are paying right obviously which

01:21:23.220 --> 01:21:25.800
company is going to restrict me because proprietary model

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:28.580
wise I am using a open AI model I am paying for that right

01:21:28.580 --> 01:21:32.280
we are paying for API basically so why they will like

01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:35.880
restrict me and then like a whatever model which is a open

01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:38.780
source model so we have hosted it on our platform on our

01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:42.040
GPUs right we are doing inferencing from there so who will

01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:44.940
restrict me and what is the reason behind that nothing

01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:45.260
right.

01:21:52.920 --> 01:22:01.000
Yep. Okay so now right now let's talk about this cursor so

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.520
basically like I said so this cursor is again a vs code that

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:08.540
you have already installed install now new update fine and

01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:11.680
it is going to help you out in terms of doing a vive coding

01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:16.280
so let's do one vive coding so let's suppose I am like a

01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:19.880
person who is not aware about a coding at all means

01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:23.420
literally I am zero I am absolute zero in coding. I don't

01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:27.400
understand coding right and still I will be able to build

01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:30.880
not a big one I would say but a very very small project yeah

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:34.260
so any idea guys you can give so what kind of a project a

01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:38.680
small one just give me the small small idea a random one

01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:42.840
I'll show you the power of vibe coding by the calculator is

01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:45.900
like everyone does that I can I can even ask Yuri and it

01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:49.580
will be done react app to do app okay email generation

01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:52.900
stopwatch tiktok tiktok is also good. Okay. It's a small

01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:55.380
game. Give me give me something something unique something

01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:59.300
unique neural language to sequel that is also like a very

01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:04.300
easy Facebook app yeah UI wise is medical chat but again a

01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:08.000
stock price prediction a scam email travel planner

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.340
application okay people now they are giving like diet plan

01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:15.820
face recognition your own platform no your own platform like

01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:18.640
see the very big one it will not be able to generate anyhow

01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:19.800
right.

01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:28.670
Price. Price. Price. Price. Price. Price.

01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:40.140
Phoodo greed. prevents suffering

01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:40.280
from jaundice rampant anxiety from shock from panic angles

01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:45.660
constant anxiety. Oh. okay uh okay cursory high plate form

01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:50.100
convert image to pdf to validate data into excel seat quiz

01:23:50.100 --> 01:23:55.000
app rip audio to text blog ipl match ticket booking okay

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:01.220
let's uh uh build ipl match uh ticket booking yeah let's

01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:03.720
shall we do it or shall we take something else

01:24:07.630 --> 01:24:10.570
ssc exam okay

01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:18.300
so basically here i'm see i'm completely blank i'm going

01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:20.600
after your suggestion so whatever suggestion that you have

01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:24.300
given insta boost poster weather prediction ticker booking

01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:28.840
system uh team meeting summarizer okay no i'm i would like

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:32.500
to like build something with the ui and back and both yeah

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:36.600
document version converter we can practically test also yeah

01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:40.300
practically we can test everything by the way okay so let's

01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:45.560
go ahead and let's try to like uh uh build one project you

01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:45.760
can go ahead and uh let's try to like uh build one project

01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:46.600
you can go ahead and let's go ahead and can build on your

01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:50.580
own thoughts right but let me like uh and let's imagine that

01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:53.120
i'm not going to write even a single line of a code here not

01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:55.420
even a single line of a code even if it is going to give me

01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:59.700
an error i'll just try to ask an id to solve that error and

01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:03.840
do the iterations for me and build a best project for me

01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:09.860
yeah so i am planning to build planning to build or one more

01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:13.920
approach which which i used to follow right so the approach

01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:16.400
which i used to follow is that that let's suppose i'm going

01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:19.760
to yuri yeah i'm going to yuri i have selected maybe any

01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:23.540
model maybe even gemini i can try to select gemini 1.5 pro

01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:26.480
so i am planning

01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:38.740
to planning to build a ipl ticket booking system uh write

01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:47.680
all the basic initial features for me and along with this

01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:48.860
give

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:57.800
me a complete system design

01:26:00.430 --> 01:26:13.190
and its relevant component for uh me and use a tech stack

01:26:13.190 --> 01:26:22.650
mon or maybe i'll say like a python for backend and then use

01:26:22.650 --> 01:26:23.250
any

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:31.880
for front end okay so basically uh i've written something

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:34.760
right so just a rough note i have written and just i'm

01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:37.960
asking a gemini 2.5 pro that okay so just give me a rough

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:42.500
idea and give me all the features around this entire things

01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:46.420
this is this is what i have asked and uh let's see so gemini

01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:50.540
pro should give me some idea and i will be using that idea

01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:51.800
yeah

01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:00.980
so it has started giving me as you can see like some ideas

01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:03.960
with respect to my MVPs that okay you should have this

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:07.360
feature that feature and like I said let's imagine that I'm

01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:12.080
new right I'm completely new to a system which I'm trying to

01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:14.840
build and I literally have no idea that what kind of a

01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:18.180
feature I should do what feature I should not do and people

01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:21.680
have given me many like options right many options many

01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:24.840
platforms to build so first of all will be the ideation

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:27.940
phase so where I would like to understand that if I'm trying

01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:31.000
to build and this is how every project moves if I'll talk

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.380
about the POC and MVPs that okay so I'll try to do a

01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:37.020
investigation now investigation is pretty much easy now

01:27:37.020 --> 01:27:40.660
right so previously we do like a lot of like a competitor

01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:43.500
comparison as well that how their platform looks like what

01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:46.600
they are providing what they are not providing but now we

01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:49.540
have a AI and even inside AI itself we can do those

01:27:49.540 --> 01:27:51.840
comparisons so I've just asked that okay fine so I'm trying

01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:55.020
to build an IPL ticket booking system now for this MVPs they

01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:58.200
give me something so a user facing feature will be match.

01:27:59.220 --> 01:28:01.940
Match listing and filtering interactive stadium seat map is

01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:05.800
seat selection and booking booking time user authentication

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:09.660
secure payment e-ticket generation notification right admin

01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:12.020
facing so there will be a user facing admin facing from

01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:13.900
where you will be able to control everything so this should

01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:16.120
be the feature initially I should give inside the admin

01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:19.680
facing this is the system design architecture so there will

01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:22.100
be an entry point web browser there will be entry point from

01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:25.960
mobile app and maybe a API through API all will go inside a

01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:29.000
CDN so which will distribute my entire traffic. Basically it

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
will go inside CDN. It will go inside the API gateway and

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.400
then there will be a multiple service I can create so user

01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:36.060
service match service booking service payment service

01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:38.880
notification service right and everyone is going to hit

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:43.680
eventually a sequel. Now I understand these things by the

01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:47.060
way I understand this terminology but maybe many of us won't

01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:50.280
understand right won't understand that's again fine right

01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:54.580
that's again fine so here right so here it has given me a

01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:57.840
skeleton now what I do right in terms of doing a vibe

01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:01.160
coding. I will just copy the user interfacing part let's not

01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:04.320
build the admin part as of now I will just copy it I will

01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:07.660
just paste it here it has generated the complete plan copy

01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:10.220
and paste I don't know what I am pasting by the way I have

01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:13.460
just copy and paste it let me keep it in auto mode yeah copy

01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:18.220
and paste it now click and now see the magic a vibe coding

01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:24.070
simple so go to AI generate the entire plan bugging if you

01:29:24.070 --> 01:29:27.450
think that something is missing re prompt it and ask the

01:29:27.450 --> 01:29:29.470
correct question that okay fine. So do this. Let's do that

01:29:29.470 --> 01:29:33.070
for me maybe this is missing and it will start doing it now

01:29:33.070 --> 01:29:36.790
once your plan is ready once you know that what you have to

01:29:36.790 --> 01:29:39.630
create on a user side on admin side and operation side

01:29:39.630 --> 01:29:43.390
everything right once your plan is ready and just in one

01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:45.790
prompt right just in my very first prompt I have not even

01:29:45.790 --> 01:29:48.730
done the second prompt simple I have not even done the

01:29:48.730 --> 01:29:51.450
second prompt maybe a second third I can I can I can refine

01:29:51.450 --> 01:29:54.850
a lot right same thing I will be able to refine the lot so

01:29:54.850 --> 01:29:59.910
go to URI give your prompt and check now as you can see it

01:29:59.910 --> 01:30:03.350
has started creating a project for me I can even tell this

01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:06.290
that okay use this technology stack and it will be using

01:30:06.290 --> 01:30:11.700
only that technology stack it is it is using basically like

01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:14.880
a mon stack right and most of us don't even understand

01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:16.040
please

01:30:18.090 --> 01:30:21.530
show the prompt in URI which prompt go ahead and give your

01:30:21.530 --> 01:30:26.530
own prompt right I think why do you need my prompt simple

01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:33.900
I have given some some rough prompt with lot of spelling

01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:36.700
mistake and lines and like I don't know about the grammar.

01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:39.900
So. So there must be a lot of grammatical mistake we have AI

01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:43.360
so it is able to understand everything and then like it is

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:46.100
able to do it I can I can even share this entire page with

01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:49.000
you let me share this entire same page right you can you can

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.060
like a check this out this URI page so inside a URI we have

01:30:53.060 --> 01:30:57.680
a share option so I don't have to you know copy paste it you

01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:00.740
can you can see in the exact same manner the manner I am

01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:02.940
able to see it inside URI okay

01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:09.360
so let's go back to the cursor it's working for me. It's

01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:13.940
like writing a code a lot of code it is trying to write so

01:31:19.630 --> 01:31:22.410
it will take time maybe like 15-20 minutes of time sometimes

01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:25.110
sometimes it takes even a for a small project I would say

01:31:25.110 --> 01:31:28.650
sometime for me from my personal experience it takes even a

01:31:28.650 --> 01:31:31.710
hour maybe sometime two hour of time because it will give

01:31:31.710 --> 01:31:34.430
you a bug maybe it has created something which you don't

01:31:34.430 --> 01:31:36.730
want so you have to like go ahead and you have to like write

01:31:36.730 --> 01:31:39.590
a prompt again you have to do a lot of iterations sometime

01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:42.150
you have to go into a code and say that okay fine change

01:31:42.150 --> 01:31:46.450
this line. And this is where developer is required and I'm

01:31:46.450 --> 01:31:49.130
talking about just this kind of a small project right see

01:31:49.130 --> 01:31:52.130
I'm trying to show you a vibe coding so that you will be

01:31:52.130 --> 01:31:54.730
able to understand that what AI can do and then what will be

01:31:54.730 --> 01:31:57.410
my responsibility so it's not like AI will be able to do

01:31:57.410 --> 01:32:00.990
everything so if I'll be having a bug obviously I have to

01:32:00.990 --> 01:32:04.170
understand the code so my yesterday someone was asking me a

01:32:04.170 --> 01:32:07.510
question that we are into a generative era right so do we

01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:09.950
need to learn like a statistics and you know machine

01:32:09.950 --> 01:32:12.510
learning algorithms those probabilities probabilistic based

01:32:12.510 --> 01:32:16.090
algorithms. My answer will be always yes even after 10 year

01:32:16.090 --> 01:32:20.130
that you should whatever we are able to build today whether

01:32:20.130 --> 01:32:23.530
it's a spaceship or whether it's like anything rocket it's

01:32:23.530 --> 01:32:27.630
on a basic principle right and you have to even computer so

01:32:27.630 --> 01:32:30.850
because of that computer exists so you and anyone who is

01:32:30.850 --> 01:32:33.710
starting obviously you have to learn otherwise you will not

01:32:33.710 --> 01:32:34.350
be able to build.

01:32:42.110 --> 01:32:44.130
What is the main difference between copilot and cursor

01:32:44.130 --> 01:32:48.810
technically like cursor is a full scale agentic based

01:32:48.810 --> 01:32:51.710
system. So where they invoke a lot of agent they try to

01:32:51.710 --> 01:32:54.170
maintain a lot of context they can understand the long like

01:32:54.170 --> 01:32:58.870
a long-term memory and they have given you this cloud s own

01:32:58.870 --> 01:33:03.090
it access which is one of the model which like generates a

01:33:03.090 --> 01:33:05.870
huge amount of the code in one single prompt means context

01:33:05.870 --> 01:33:09.130
length is bigger basically that's a difference human

01:33:11.530 --> 01:33:14.510
will be tested AI will be delivered on lighter note not like

01:33:14.510 --> 01:33:16.290
that I don't agree with that statement

01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:24.340
how we have integrated cursor with vs. No. Cursor has given

01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:26.680
you the ID so we have not integrated it we have just

01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:31.800
downloaded the cursor from cursor.com you were saying try

01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:36.800
the prompt in vs copilot asking for copilot login okay so

01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:38.560
then login UI

01:33:40.610 --> 01:33:43.350
is same yeah because they have used like even for windsurf

01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:45.750
if you are going to use a windsurf right UI is going to be

01:33:45.750 --> 01:33:49.150
same even this firebase if you are going to use so okay

01:33:49.150 --> 01:33:52.190
let's let's this AI generate my code I'll keep it in my

01:33:52.190 --> 01:33:55.490
different screen and let me talk about because that will

01:33:55.490 --> 01:33:58.730
take time. Like I said. 15-20 minute time if I would have

01:33:58.730 --> 01:34:01.390
given a calculator app kind of application it would have

01:34:01.390 --> 01:34:04.750
done that by now in 30 second but yeah so I have given some

01:34:04.750 --> 01:34:08.010
complex application so it will take some time still it's

01:34:08.010 --> 01:34:10.910
working for me it's generating a code there is something

01:34:10.910 --> 01:34:15.710
called as firebase so even they have used this vs code but

01:34:15.710 --> 01:34:19.330
yeah in a browser so recently recently means I think three

01:34:19.330 --> 01:34:24.230
four week back right so Google had released this like a

01:34:24.230 --> 01:34:27.950
firebase studio which works. Inside a browser and if you

01:34:27.950 --> 01:34:30.990
will see the interface it's a vs code interface itself so

01:34:30.990 --> 01:34:34.390
you can go to firebase and you can try this out and you can

01:34:34.390 --> 01:34:37.190
like give a prompt and from the prompt it will start

01:34:37.190 --> 01:34:46.510
generating for example build a modern calculator app for me

01:34:46.510 --> 01:34:54.670
with an amazing UI interface a colorful one. Colorful one

01:34:54.670 --> 01:35:03.130
with a. Theme of Netflix fine it will it will also work I

01:35:03.130 --> 01:35:06.350
can select the technology from here so like I said Google

01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:10.470
firebase studio and basically it's you can invoke it inside

01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:13.210
a browser itself so there is no installation no download is

01:35:13.210 --> 01:35:17.290
required it's it's working and here is my cursor see how

01:35:17.290 --> 01:35:22.530
hard it is working for me very very hard right writing a lot

01:35:22.530 --> 01:35:26.550
of code for me. My cursor is still working. It is creating a

01:35:26.550 --> 01:35:29.430
code. It is creating like a one by one everything and again

01:35:29.430 --> 01:35:31.610
so firebase studio so

01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:41.760
just just imagine where we have like a moved now and I'm

01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:44.280
just trying to show you that flavor that where we have moved

01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:47.860
now and just imagine if I'm going to open up one single file

01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:51.320
right if I'm going to open up one single file you will be

01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:53.840
amazed that okay if I'm going to ask some human being to

01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:56.720
write the same thing right the basic one the template one

01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:00.340
the skeleton one you can say how much time it will take and

01:36:00.340 --> 01:36:08.180
for AI see. Yeah. So my AI assistant is working and I don't

01:36:08.180 --> 01:36:14.060
even understand the code. You are really a hardcore coder

01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:20.100
with prompt yeah anyone can become now so see it was never

01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:24.260
about a coding I would say see it's it was even like a five

01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:27.780
year back ten year back right it was always about a product

01:36:27.780 --> 01:36:32.160
the mindset and the business use cases the user problem you

01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:36.600
were able to solve as simple as that. So it was relevant

01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:39.660
five year ten year twenty year back and it is relevant even

01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:44.720
now tech was just a substitute tech was just a bridge which

01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:49.120
was trying to give a user and a business a convenient a lot

01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:51.960
of convenient this is where only text comes into a picture

01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:56.500
but it was always about the idea a thought process and a

01:36:56.500 --> 01:37:01.860
problem and people who who will be able to like you know

01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:04.820
generate idea. They will be able to solve a new problem. Of

01:37:04.820 --> 01:37:09.120
a modern age believe me they will always be relevant. They

01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:11.180
will always be learn this literally they will always be

01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:12.760
relevant but

01:37:19.350 --> 01:37:22.590
still we have a coding interview. Yeah. But I think almost

01:37:22.590 --> 01:37:25.750
all the big companies right even meta if you go and check

01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:28.890
the news so Facebook kind of a company they are allowing you

01:37:28.890 --> 01:37:32.410
to use AI you know you know interview directly so AI based

01:37:32.410 --> 01:37:35.470
this kind of ID right because they wanted to understand your

01:37:35.470 --> 01:37:37.830
approach your thought processing for example someone has

01:37:37.830 --> 01:37:40.710
asked me that generate IPL ticker booking. So obviously I

01:37:40.710 --> 01:37:43.630
have just given this prompt to my AI and then it has given

01:37:43.630 --> 01:37:46.190
the skeleton I will again chat I will try to ask for the

01:37:46.190 --> 01:37:48.870
edge cases I will try to ask for the security measures I'll

01:37:48.870 --> 01:37:51.190
be looking for all this tool now based on my experience

01:37:51.190 --> 01:37:53.990
right that I have seen that with the other tool so I will be

01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:56.210
doing the same thing over there. So this is where now

01:37:56.210 --> 01:37:59.910
companies are looking for a plus if AI has generated a code

01:37:59.910 --> 01:38:02.490
right and if someone is going to ask me a question that

01:38:02.490 --> 01:38:05.210
explain me this piece of code the selected one right I

01:38:05.210 --> 01:38:09.710
should be in a position to explain this one immediately. So.

01:38:09.810 --> 01:38:11.290
Yeah. If someone is writing a code that's completely fine

01:38:11.290 --> 01:38:14.010
right but if someone is going to ask me to execute and

01:38:14.010 --> 01:38:18.050
explain me this code right or maybe add some feature maybe a

01:38:18.050 --> 01:38:21.710
small feature into this one as a developer I am I am

01:38:21.710 --> 01:38:24.310
supposed to do it if I'm not able to do it then there is no

01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:27.610
use of using an AI simple okay

01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:43.940
still working let me check my fire base okay what happened

01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:46.960
to my fire base studio it is not working okay

01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:54.720
so fire base studio is taking a lot of time so bad is your

01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:59.120
experience by the way. And my cursor is like working very

01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:01.500
hard so good user experience files

01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:10.180
are automatically created yeah I can just ask a question

01:39:10.180 --> 01:39:13.140
that okay fine so try to do a modular keep it modular and

01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:15.680
like keep all the files separate it will be created

01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:19.580
automatically even for the python even it will be able to do

01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:22.780
a execution it will be able to test it by the way so that is

01:39:22.780 --> 01:39:24.440
also possible please

01:39:28.860 --> 01:39:32.280
run the execution do I need to run the execution because

01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:37.180
it's showing me this flashy things. Which. Needs. To be.

01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:45.200
Like I know sorted okay so let me rename I never I don't use

01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:48.340
firebase frequently so not frequently I would say I never

01:39:48.340 --> 01:39:50.920
used to create any project because a cursor is more than

01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:54.420
enough for me and you just need one AI so I

01:39:59.180 --> 01:40:03.100
don't know what it is trying to create but yeah build a

01:40:03.100 --> 01:40:12.180
modern age with an amazing UI which fails. Calculator. I

01:40:12.180 --> 01:40:12.180
don't know.

01:40:20.170 --> 01:40:27.130
Yeah it will do it started creating my calculator the

01:40:27.130 --> 01:40:31.250
firebase studio yeah prototype the app can

01:40:38.930 --> 01:40:42.210
you ping the firebase studio yeah I can do it here is the

01:40:42.210 --> 01:40:50.520
one yeah so this firebase is working and hopefully my keep

01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:55.520
all okay so all is done okay fine complete the I will match

01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:58.340
okay. So now as you can see that it is able to build the

01:40:58.340 --> 01:41:01.320
entire system and core feature implemented match listing and

01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:04.400
filtering interactive stadium setup map seat selection and

01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:06.980
booking book timer 10 minute countdown use authentication

01:41:06.980 --> 01:41:09.660
profile this this this this this so all of this technical

01:41:09.660 --> 01:41:13.440
stack front end wise it has selected next js react and type

01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:17.360
script for styling for like a UI so it has selected a

01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:20.560
television CSS for database postgres and prism ORM

01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:23.840
authentication wise next js auth payment system wise stripe

01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:26.820
it is using I can ask them to like integrate a PayPal it

01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:30.640
will do it UPI it will do it like a rosal pay it will do it

01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:33.100
real time socket IO it is using for the real time

01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:35.860
communication email handle wise so node mail it is using QR

01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:39.160
code wise QR code library now database schema wise it has

01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:42.480
created already now sample data it has already put the

01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:46.540
sample data right now I have to do what so I have to

01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:49.160
basically it has given me a setup it has just basically

01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:52.560
given me a command by which I will be able to execute it and

01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:55.300
the fun part is I have not written even a single line of a

01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:59.620
code throughout this entire things right now so set up a

01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:04.080
database I will just ask so do one thing do one thing for me

01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:10.660
execute execute test and debug for me so I am very lazy

01:42:10.660 --> 01:42:14.840
person by the way I don't want to like you know even execute

01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:20.800
or run one single command not even a MPM command so I will

01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:21.660
just ask my AI

01:42:27.260 --> 01:42:31.060
firebase creator calculator yeah it will create. It is still

01:42:31.060 --> 01:42:33.620
creating for me I don't know why it is taking so much of

01:42:33.620 --> 01:42:36.340
time but yeah stand

01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:46.200
up the start kardo sir arey kya kya start karein pahle ek

01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:47.600
start jo ki hai wo chala le

01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:01.980
sir there are much of noise about the AGI could you please

01:43:01.980 --> 01:43:04.980
tell me about it so its full form is artificial general

01:43:04.980 --> 01:43:08.080
intelligence when I was trying to like understand it right

01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:11.520
so the only thing which I was able to understand that okay

01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:14.000
people are trying to attach some sort of a you know a

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.700
wrapper on top of this one so that they can control it they

01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:20.180
can put like a guardrail over there they can give more

01:43:20.180 --> 01:43:24.260
control to a human being because there are a bunch of a

01:43:24.260 --> 01:43:29.260
group of people you can say so who are afraid that going

01:43:29.260 --> 01:43:33.340
forward so AI should not take over a human being so this is

01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:37.480
where this whole concept of AGI is coming into a picture for

01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:40.360
now maybe that definition will change in the future would

01:43:43.590 --> 01:43:47.070
it really impact the employment see this code if you are

01:43:47.070 --> 01:43:49.850
going to ask a developer to write so maybe you need a two

01:43:49.850 --> 01:43:52.330
three people. And you have to give at least three to four

01:43:52.330 --> 01:43:55.030
week of time at least to create this boilerplate right I'm

01:43:55.030 --> 01:43:58.270
not saying like a fuller scale obviously to make it fuller

01:43:58.270 --> 01:44:01.550
scale to add a lot of things on top of this one you need a

01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:06.730
real developer right but at least for see auth system again

01:44:06.730 --> 01:44:09.630
common everywhere all those like elements common everywhere

01:44:09.630 --> 01:44:13.830
chat system common everywhere right so yeah you can do it

01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:16.770
yeah you can do it easily right and now it is testing my

01:44:16.770 --> 01:44:20.650
things I have just given one bad command do one thing. Okay.

01:44:20.670 --> 01:44:23.570
For me execute test and debug for me so it is it is like a

01:44:23.570 --> 01:44:27.910
executing running installing so see npm install it is doing

01:44:27.910 --> 01:44:31.170
installation automatically I am not even like trying to

01:44:31.170 --> 01:44:33.630
install this one yeah

01:44:36.410 --> 01:44:39.210
git per push kaise kare nothing so simple open up your

01:44:39.210 --> 01:44:44.410
terminal so see this entire cursor id is your vs code so

01:44:44.410 --> 01:44:48.550
click over here new terminal now from this new terminal type

01:44:48.550 --> 01:44:51.830
git init and then create a repository push it I will show

01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:55.310
you that just wait. For like two minute it will take like a

01:44:55.310 --> 01:44:58.410
30 second of time for me to push on a github repository just

01:44:58.410 --> 01:45:02.850
30 second so once will be test like code it is like running

01:45:02.850 --> 01:45:06.490
the code and fixing the bug as you can see see everything

01:45:06.490 --> 01:45:09.470
has been done by itself I just wanted to see the final

01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:10.890
flavor for

01:45:15.980 --> 01:45:19.900
using a cursor do we need to login yeah I think after some

01:45:19.900 --> 01:45:23.320
time right you will end up exhausting your free quota then

01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:25.740
they will ask you for a login and then they will ask you for

01:45:25.740 --> 01:45:26.500
a payment as well.

01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:34.840
CICD pipeline. We can do everything just imagination is the

01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:37.900
limit believe me in the age of AI and hope all of you are

01:45:37.900 --> 01:45:43.700
able to those who have not seen that right so you will feel

01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:45.500
amazed believe me you will feel amazed and that is the

01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:48.340
reason why I am showing you that what AI can do so that

01:45:48.340 --> 01:45:52.320
going forward when we learn our mind should be very much

01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:57.140
aligned that let us build a big thing do not stick ourselves

01:45:57.140 --> 01:46:00.240
towards just a small learning have

01:46:04.820 --> 01:46:08.220
you used a cloud a code I mean like it is not a cloud a code

01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:11.780
I have used so many times like yeah it depends what

01:46:11.780 --> 01:46:14.220
application I am looking into you

01:46:19.790 --> 01:46:22.550
said I am that kind of a lazy person who cannot run the code

01:46:22.550 --> 01:46:28.630
even I mean like I am just behaving I said that I am

01:46:28.630 --> 01:46:32.130
behaving like a lazy person as of now yeah so that I can

01:46:32.130 --> 01:46:35.430
show you that what AI can do I do not want to like run my

01:46:35.430 --> 01:46:38.930
code even so I just asked my AI that okay do it for me and

01:46:38.930 --> 01:46:43.110
and so I am just trying to show you the capability of AI so

01:46:43.110 --> 01:46:46.650
vibe coding right I have already mentioned see now it is

01:46:46.650 --> 01:46:49.230
starting the database creating the existing data creating a

01:46:49.230 --> 01:46:52.530
team it has you know tested each and everything it has

01:46:52.530 --> 01:46:56.690
basically like fixed all the bugs because yes there was a

01:46:56.690 --> 01:46:59.830
bug and I can see in a log that it was trying to fix all of

01:46:59.830 --> 01:47:02.510
those bugs so I can see over here that it was trying to fix

01:47:02.510 --> 01:47:07.170
all of these bugs and now it is starting so starting a

01:47:07.170 --> 01:47:11.070
database seeding now so excellent. Now let me start the

01:47:11.070 --> 01:47:13.650
development server okay amazing so now it is starting the

01:47:13.650 --> 01:47:15.390
development server for me we

01:47:22.010 --> 01:47:24.690
recently had a scenario of a replate that had a concern of

01:47:24.690 --> 01:47:26.890
production and dev environment so what is your opinion where

01:47:26.890 --> 01:47:29.770
the company see this is the reason you need a developer

01:47:29.770 --> 01:47:33.770
blindly whatever code it has created you cannot trust right

01:47:33.770 --> 01:47:38.090
you should not expose your vulnerable part maybe a port or

01:47:38.090 --> 01:47:44.110
any like any credentials which may give an access to some

01:47:44.110 --> 01:47:47.250
XYG system to enter in your system. So this is where you

01:47:47.250 --> 01:47:50.090
need a real developer that is the reason I am saying vibe

01:47:50.090 --> 01:47:53.470
coding is just behaving like your helper your assistant

01:47:53.470 --> 01:47:59.030
right you need a real developer a good one actually a better

01:47:59.030 --> 01:48:01.770
than before kind of a developer you need and

01:48:05.290 --> 01:48:09.210
I think debuggers are more required not debuggers even a

01:48:09.210 --> 01:48:14.330
person who can you see I always see whenever we build even a

01:48:14.330 --> 01:48:16.970
real time application right 80 percent of the time most of

01:48:16.970 --> 01:48:19.030
the time most of the project 80 percent time go in a

01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:22.450
debugging. So that is a real skill and basically if you are

01:48:22.450 --> 01:48:24.590
able to debug anything it simply means that you understand

01:48:24.590 --> 01:48:29.650
the whole code base right let me check the server is running

01:48:29.650 --> 01:48:34.090
using a power cell invoke request okay so at 3000 port

01:48:34.090 --> 01:48:36.510
localhost let me check and

01:48:39.330 --> 01:48:42.970
see guys what we are able to build with the help of vibe

01:48:42.970 --> 01:48:46.870
coding I think it looks amazing right yes

01:48:50.060 --> 01:48:53.580
time rate to build 2 hour to build see these are the memes

01:48:53.580 --> 01:48:56.060
these are the things that we used to get on a social media

01:48:56.060 --> 01:48:58.060
which we should not believe that is the reason I keep on

01:48:58.060 --> 01:49:00.300
saying that there are so many people who try to give a Gyan

01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:03.200
over a social media and most of the people have not even

01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:06.480
tried building anything right not even a simple application

01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:10.120
and they are giving a so it is not like a thumb rule that

01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:14.000
say once and then apply everywhere no not at all development

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:18.740
does not works in that way yeah. So see and if I am going to

01:49:18.740 --> 01:49:22.300
ask that and see I have taken a random project right random

01:49:22.300 --> 01:49:25.640
project. I went to AI. I have asked for all the requirement

01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:29.000
I was not aware about a requirement what I should like a

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.520
build basically in as a IPL ticker booking system so AI has

01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:34.500
given me requirement I have just copy and pasted those

01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:37.820
requirement asked waited for some time asked it to do a

01:49:37.820 --> 01:49:40.340
debugging and testing and installation and everything right

01:49:40.340 --> 01:49:44.800
and finally we are able to get something like this and see

01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:48.640
IPL ticker booking and here all this feature are available

01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:51.680
to me right all this feature I can I can book a seat slot

01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:57.300
buys. Mumbai Indians versus Chennai Super King I am able to

01:49:57.300 --> 01:50:00.180
like see it I can apply a filter I can search based on the

01:50:00.180 --> 01:50:03.340
teams right so Rajasthan Royals Punjab Kings and all those

01:50:03.340 --> 01:50:05.840
things venue wise I can try to like select over here Mohan

01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:08.420
Bagan great range I can try to filter out right there are

01:50:08.420 --> 01:50:11.640
some bugs obviously I can ask that to like you know show me

01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:14.120
all of these things without even highlighting in a drop down

01:50:14.120 --> 01:50:17.220
and it will be able to do it yeah it will be able to

01:50:17.220 --> 01:50:20.460
technically do it for me right

01:50:24.810 --> 01:50:28.990
yeah. So this is the power of IPL. This is the power of AI

01:50:28.990 --> 01:50:33.470
again so sign up wise which is very common across all the

01:50:33.470 --> 01:50:36.250
platform right whatever platform you are going to create so

01:50:36.250 --> 01:50:39.210
it is able to create the entire sign up it will be able to

01:50:39.210 --> 01:50:42.050
attach to my DB and then finally I will test it I will try

01:50:42.050 --> 01:50:44.570
to add see this is the basic feature that it has built it's

01:50:44.570 --> 01:50:47.070
not a very advanced feature right in a real time when you

01:50:47.070 --> 01:50:49.870
will go there are a lot of edge cases which comes into a

01:50:49.870 --> 01:50:52.830
picture so as a business stakeholder I am supposed to aware

01:50:52.830 --> 01:50:57.250
about those edge cases believe me right this is a very very

01:50:57.250 --> 01:51:00.930
very very. Real a basic one I would say it's not at all a

01:51:00.930 --> 01:51:08.070
advanced one yeah not at all advanced one and believe me in

01:51:08.070 --> 01:51:10.530
a real time so this is where a real developer a real

01:51:10.530 --> 01:51:14.030
architect a real people comes into a picture and I keep on

01:51:14.030 --> 01:51:17.090
saying that although we are able to generate this which is a

01:51:17.090 --> 01:51:19.150
boiler plate code I still say that this is just a boiler

01:51:19.150 --> 01:51:23.950
plate code right developers a good one not a beginner one

01:51:23.950 --> 01:51:26.630
and that's the reason so people have stopped hiding someone

01:51:26.630 --> 01:51:29.890
who say that I know this language I know that language. No

01:51:29.890 --> 01:51:34.390
that part is gone now right and if company is hiding maybe

01:51:34.390 --> 01:51:38.170
in a very near future within six month of time that will be

01:51:38.170 --> 01:51:42.530
gone so you should know that okay how I can use 10 different

01:51:42.530 --> 01:51:45.650
different tools I understand the code right 10 different

01:51:45.650 --> 01:51:48.590
different tools I can build faster I can explain faster I

01:51:48.590 --> 01:51:52.610
can debug faster right I can move faster time has gone where

01:51:52.610 --> 01:51:55.350
you go to the company for an interview and say that I am a

01:51:55.350 --> 01:51:58.510
person who is very good with the learning right I am a quick

01:51:58.510 --> 01:52:01.870
learner. No one is going to buy that line now believe me no

01:52:01.870 --> 01:52:03.930
one is going to buy that line that I am a good learner

01:52:03.930 --> 01:52:06.930
because a definition of learning itself has changed the

01:52:06.930 --> 01:52:09.690
learning which was taking maybe a one year of time and the

01:52:09.690 --> 01:52:12.390
same thing I will be able to learn maybe just in a month of

01:52:12.390 --> 01:52:13.670
time yes

01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:20.480
yeah so I will keep on showing you but yeah so this is my

01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:23.920
example of a vive coding and you can use cursor you can use

01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:27.620
windsurf and let me check my fire okay so it has it has done

01:52:27.620 --> 01:52:31.460
something firebase studio yeah so it has done something.

01:52:31.460 --> 01:52:34.620
Something like is it a modern calculator I don't know like

01:52:34.620 --> 01:52:39.400
okay calculator age inside so maybe I have to give a prompt

01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:45.440
more prompt but yeah so this one is like you know is able to

01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:47.680
build each and everything for me and it looks amazing looks

01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:50.540
amazing in a first place I can try to like a host it I can

01:52:50.540 --> 01:52:52.960
try to test it I can even ask that okay add this feature add

01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:56.960
that feature and it will be able to do it. So just use a

01:52:56.960 --> 01:53:00.080
cursor build a couple of things right with a cursor break

01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:03.440
couple of things. Maybe in Python or maybe in Java maybe in

01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:07.540
C C++ whatever language whatever language whatever framework

01:53:07.540 --> 01:53:12.160
whatever databases right that you would like to use use it

01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:16.600
and for idea generation use AI for like just like me like

01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:22.460
URI or maybe chat GPT yeah okay so hope all of you are

01:53:22.460 --> 01:53:26.420
enjoying this class guys everyone yeah if I can get some

01:53:26.420 --> 01:53:30.520
like something some comment yes. So believe me my classes

01:53:30.520 --> 01:53:33.800
are not going to be boring. That I can that I can assure and

01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:36.080
I will get to know a lot of things on every level.

01:53:39.090 --> 01:53:41.850
The idea generation part is amazing yeah this is the place

01:53:41.850 --> 01:53:45.150
we start by the way. See if you are going to like give this

01:53:45.150 --> 01:53:48.430
kind of a prompt to your this one right maybe it will not be

01:53:48.430 --> 01:53:51.650
able to respond back. So idea generation and again we just a

01:53:51.650 --> 01:53:55.350
first like a hand idea it's like we have to do a lot of

01:53:55.350 --> 01:53:58.770
iterations lot of edge cases sir

01:54:02.700 --> 01:54:06.880
we learn gen AI or use this tool we learn actually gen AI.

01:54:07.860 --> 01:54:12.020
This tool is just like a helper like I said even before this

01:54:12.020 --> 01:54:14.680
we had a github repository a lot of github repository and

01:54:14.680 --> 01:54:17.480
even before that we had a stack overflow right where we code

01:54:17.480 --> 01:54:23.240
and then we go to check go and check sir after two hour give

01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:25.500
a break you can take a break it's fine I'll do a doubt

01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:31.220
clearing in between a great learning and giving a taste of

01:54:31.220 --> 01:54:34.360
the power of AI yeah this is just our day day one I would

01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:38.580
say yesterday was day zero so long way to go long way to go.

01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:39.800
You are going to spend a lot of time. You are going to spend

01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:44.340
a lot of time with me so obviously you will see a lot of

01:54:44.340 --> 01:54:46.900
things and even I will learn a lot of things from you guys

01:54:46.900 --> 01:54:50.840
can we use cloud I will use everything don't worry so just a

01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:53.180
matter of time as we will progress I will use everything

01:54:53.180 --> 01:54:55.480
means at the end of the day we have to create a full scale

01:54:55.480 --> 01:55:00.520
application so we will do it. So fine guys hope we are good

01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:03.640
with respect to our local system setup so we are able to do

01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:07.440
a local system setup we also know that okay on a cloud so

01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:11.600
Google collab we can write a code we also know that we can

01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:14.520
do a while coding with a cursor with the windsurf or maybe

01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:17.700
with the fire base studio and I have already shown you the

01:55:17.700 --> 01:55:22.100
flavor of a while coding what technically or what actually

01:55:22.100 --> 01:55:25.840
while coding is just one application I have shown it to you

01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:31.840
so I believe we are good for today's class and topic wise we

01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:36.600
are able to cover only this part only part number one. So

01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:41.900
major framework intro. URI API. Now once our system setup is

01:55:41.900 --> 01:55:45.220
ready right then only I can show you how we can use a URI

01:55:45.220 --> 01:55:50.060
API or other major framework for example a llama index a

01:55:50.060 --> 01:55:56.740
lang chain a auto gen a n8n because sample integration we

01:55:56.740 --> 01:55:59.820
have given to you but I have to show you a smaller small use

01:55:59.820 --> 01:56:02.360
cases and applications so that you will be able to

01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:04.620
understand that what is the actual meaning of an agent when

01:56:04.620 --> 01:56:07.720
I say agent right what is the meaning of it we will create

01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:09.400
it and then we will understand. What is the meaning of a

01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:11.880
tool what is the meaning of a memory system what is the

01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:14.600
meaning of RIG all of these things so in my upcoming class

01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:18.440
this is going to be the agenda the first one I am going to

01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:21.580
cover is a URI API ecosystem that how you can use a URI API

01:56:21.580 --> 01:56:25.540
by the way and then I will be covering a major framework

01:56:25.540 --> 01:56:28.600
introduction and that frameworks are basically these

01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:32.440
framework lang chain crew AI auto gen llama index lang

01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:35.600
graph. So I will give you intro first because if you will go

01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:38.500
through a syllabus everything we have to discuss in detail.

01:56:38.620 --> 01:56:41.280
Detail means literally like a lot of details we have to

01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:46.620
discuss so intro first and then we will so once my intro

01:56:46.620 --> 01:56:50.840
will be done let me go to a syllabus once again. So now let

01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:55.200
me tell you where we are so basically we are here even now

01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:58.060
right even now we have not even covered this one we are

01:56:58.060 --> 01:57:01.340
trying to cover this particular portion and we are yet to

01:57:01.340 --> 01:57:05.560
cover this particular portion as well right so maybe it will

01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:08.660
take next Saturday class for me. So I will cover this

01:57:08.660 --> 01:57:11.700
particular portion then I will gradually move into this one

01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:14.100
and the next one the next one give

01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:21.780
me some homework I will not give you homework now homework

01:57:21.780 --> 01:57:24.980
will come when I will start discussing a framework yeah as

01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:28.320
of now it's fine just chill enjoy don't take much of

01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:32.780
pressure don't get afraid of AI it's fine enjoy your life

01:57:34.930 --> 01:57:39.970
regarding python basic how many lecture we should see so we

01:57:39.970 --> 01:57:43.450
have already uploaded try to go till at least oops

01:57:43.450 --> 01:57:47.510
programming. Okay. Oops I have uploaded right okay only till

01:57:47.510 --> 01:57:54.330
oops means means means 30 31st lecture yeah just just try to

01:57:54.330 --> 01:57:56.010
cover till that part I

01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:02.560
want to build a portfolio page using a vibe code yeah you

01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:06.280
can do it now itself within like next five minutes next

01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:08.880
weekend we have a rakshabandhan yeah we do have a

01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:14.220
rakshabandhan but I am not going to give a leave to any one

01:58:14.220 --> 01:58:19.580
of you basically for a rakshabandhan because I think like we

01:58:19.580 --> 01:58:22.820
can we can manage right. So we can because even my sister

01:58:22.820 --> 01:58:26.760
will be here so I already told them that please try to come

01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:29.980
here after one o'clock so that my class will be over and I

01:58:29.980 --> 01:58:34.060
think we have a time till two o'clock muhurat bais so till

01:58:34.060 --> 01:58:37.760
two o'clock you can like celebrate rakshabandhan as per the

01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:42.480
calendar so we are not cancelling the class we have we have

01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:46.080
a class when

01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:52.110
course will complete. Course three four month. Okay. From

01:58:52.110 --> 01:58:54.050
today's class I felt that should I not waste my time

01:58:54.050 --> 01:58:57.830
learning a language nowadays. Yeah see learn fast this is

01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:59.890
something which has changed last two and half year right

01:58:59.890 --> 01:59:02.750
learn fast you should not like you know estimate that I will

01:59:02.750 --> 01:59:05.930
learn in one year or six month and then I will do this then

01:59:05.930 --> 01:59:10.470
no that time has literally gone things have literally

01:59:10.470 --> 01:59:14.710
changed so you have to adopt the modernization you have to

01:59:14.710 --> 01:59:18.890
adopt a new things right and because once you will start

01:59:18.890 --> 01:59:23.210
moving fast right. You will realize that okay we have to

01:59:23.210 --> 01:59:26.550
build a lot right we have to build a lot a lot of idea there

01:59:26.550 --> 01:59:28.450
are a lot of thoughts you will be able to get but yeah if

01:59:28.450 --> 01:59:33.870
you move slow obviously it will take time. Yeah so let me

01:59:33.870 --> 01:59:38.610
close each and everything guys now so those who is not

01:59:38.610 --> 01:59:40.950
having a doubt I'm done with my today's class by the way

01:59:40.950 --> 01:59:44.070
yeah so those who is not having any kind of a doubt they can

01:59:44.070 --> 01:59:47.790
drop off those who have any kind of a question for me like

01:59:47.790 --> 01:59:50.570
those who would like to discuss anything with me. So let me

01:59:50.570 --> 01:59:54.290
lower all the hands you can raise your hand so you will be

01:59:54.290 --> 01:59:57.270
able to see a raise hand option so raise your hand I think

01:59:57.270 --> 01:59:59.890
we have done that drill yesterday so we are going to follow

01:59:59.890 --> 02:00:03.170
the same drill today one by one I'm going to unmute and then

02:00:03.170 --> 02:00:07.330
ask the question I'll try to answer yeah so fine go ahead

02:00:07.330 --> 02:00:11.530
with Armaan first Armaan then Ganesh then Sai then Jubair

02:00:11.530 --> 02:00:16.250
then Ramesh then Somesh and then Anil yeah go ahead please

02:00:16.250 --> 02:00:19.710
one by one. Hello sir Armaan this side. Yeah hi Armaan. Hi

02:00:19.710 --> 02:00:22.090
Armaan. Go ahead please. I'm audible. Yeah you are audible

02:00:22.090 --> 02:00:25.830
yes yes. So now in the course you said at one point we have

02:00:25.830 --> 02:00:28.770
to learn statistics deep learning and machine learning so

02:00:28.770 --> 02:00:32.410
we're taking this JNI course at the what time will be

02:00:32.410 --> 02:00:37.030
requiring that we have to learn all this MLDL concepts. See

02:00:37.030 --> 02:00:40.750
timing I think see I can give you a rough estimation but at

02:00:40.750 --> 02:00:44.730
the end of the day it's your time so you have to spend. No

02:00:44.730 --> 02:00:48.590
sir at which particular point of time we have to learn that

02:00:48.590 --> 02:00:51.710
concept. For this for this course yeah by taking this course

02:00:51.710 --> 02:00:56.890
by taking this course and then it's not required actually as

02:00:56.890 --> 02:01:00.050
per as per this course syllabus it's not required right but

02:01:00.050 --> 02:01:02.670
yeah so let's suppose if you would like to like understand

02:01:02.670 --> 02:01:06.650
the entire data science stack with a generative AI right

02:01:06.650 --> 02:01:10.610
then obviously like MLDL so starting from like python then

02:01:10.610 --> 02:01:12.810
stats then machine learning then deep learning then computer

02:01:12.810 --> 02:01:15.970
vision then NLP so you have to follow that sequence. Now

02:01:15.970 --> 02:01:18.810
that will give you a complete hundred percent. Understanding

02:01:18.810 --> 02:01:21.710
a practical knowledge theoretical knowledge algorithmic

02:01:21.710 --> 02:01:25.330
knowledge mathematical knowledge about the entire data

02:01:25.330 --> 02:01:29.670
science stack so you can go in that way but for this one

02:01:29.670 --> 02:01:32.030
it's not required for this one machine learning is not a

02:01:32.030 --> 02:01:34.470
prerequisite deep learning is not a prerequisite NLP is not

02:01:34.470 --> 02:01:37.150
a prerequisite I have just kept only one prerequisite and

02:01:37.150 --> 02:01:42.210
that is basic of python for this one. Okay so my next

02:01:42.210 --> 02:01:45.410
question is like as you said you are coming from different

02:01:45.410 --> 02:01:48.590
different backgrounds and at a particular point you require.

02:01:48.590 --> 02:01:52.150
To learn different tech stacks so what what was your

02:01:52.150 --> 02:01:54.990
approach like for example you are new to any technology you

02:01:54.990 --> 02:01:57.650
don't know anything about that so how would you start from

02:01:57.650 --> 02:02:01.890
that see I am a age of AI see not an age of AC it's it's my

02:02:01.890 --> 02:02:05.970
habit I would say since a childhood right I was not a kind

02:02:05.970 --> 02:02:09.470
of a student who will go to school and like go to college

02:02:09.470 --> 02:02:12.970
and then take a note of it and then you know obey each and

02:02:12.970 --> 02:02:15.410
everything which teacher used to say I was a kind of a

02:02:15.410 --> 02:02:18.470
student that if a school has prescribed ncrt. There was a.

02:02:18.590 --> 02:02:21.010
Like a books published by Bharti Bhavan and student friends

02:02:21.010 --> 02:02:24.030
I used to read those books so I was kind of a like a

02:02:24.030 --> 02:02:28.290
explorer and self-learner since a beginning I was not a very

02:02:28.290 --> 02:02:32.010
disciplined student in terms of you know going to a school

02:02:32.010 --> 02:02:36.470
doing all the homework attending all those exam but yeah I

02:02:36.470 --> 02:02:40.430
do a lot of like so simple thing which I used to say since

02:02:40.430 --> 02:02:43.570
many many years that before started before you start

02:02:43.570 --> 02:02:46.610
learning anything first you should learn how to sit on your

02:02:46.610 --> 02:02:50.170
chair for a very very long time. Right because that's a

02:02:50.170 --> 02:02:53.050
problem with major of us majority of us we are not able to

02:02:53.050 --> 02:02:55.150
sit on the same chair on the same position for a very very

02:02:55.150 --> 02:02:59.150
long time right and everything requires a dedication effort

02:02:59.150 --> 02:03:04.010
uninterrupted dedication nowadays in a age of like a social

02:03:04.010 --> 02:03:06.850
media so where we have a distraction every second every

02:03:06.850 --> 02:03:09.210
second someone is pinging me some notification we are going

02:03:09.210 --> 02:03:13.930
to get someone is sending me a real so first remove the

02:03:13.930 --> 02:03:17.350
distraction because that's a biggest time killer and a

02:03:17.350 --> 02:03:21.690
context switcher. Right. Without even realizing second thing

02:03:21.690 --> 02:03:24.910
is learn how to sit on a chair for the very very long time

02:03:24.910 --> 02:03:27.850
because when you will sit you will do some work a real one

02:03:27.850 --> 02:03:31.830
right that will solve all the problem then then this the

02:03:31.830 --> 02:03:34.530
question will be gone that how to learn a new things you

02:03:34.530 --> 02:03:37.890
will be able to learn the new things. But sir everything has

02:03:37.890 --> 02:03:41.990
many many concepts so for what a person's approach will be.

02:03:42.030 --> 02:03:43.970
It's not like there are many many concepts believe me it

02:03:43.970 --> 02:03:46.310
looks like people have given a lot of terms people have

02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:49.010
given a lot of like you know. So for example I'll tell you

02:03:49.010 --> 02:03:53.290
so in your syllabus I have mentioned Lama, Langchain, Lama

02:03:53.290 --> 02:03:57.910
index, Langraph, Enate and Autogen right, Kru AI. The

02:03:57.910 --> 02:04:00.170
baseline concept when you will understand which I'm going to

02:04:00.170 --> 02:04:03.150
explain you the baseline concept is every framework is

02:04:03.150 --> 02:04:05.650
helping you out in terms of building an agent attaching a

02:04:05.650 --> 02:04:09.530
tools to it adding a memories to it right and solving and

02:04:09.530 --> 02:04:13.170
doing some sort of automation. Apart from that those five

02:04:13.170 --> 02:04:15.670
framework it looks different because it has been released by

02:04:15.670 --> 02:04:18.690
a different company. And it works in a little bit different

02:04:18.690 --> 02:04:22.530
way code wise at least right but under the hood it is doing

02:04:22.530 --> 02:04:25.510
approximately a same thing. So you have to understand the

02:04:25.510 --> 02:04:28.470
base. Now once you understand the base you will be able to

02:04:28.470 --> 02:04:31.730
understand all of those four five or even in future if five

02:04:31.730 --> 02:04:34.450
company will come and they will launch for example like a

02:04:34.450 --> 02:04:38.690
five new tools you will be able to understand cloud let's

02:04:38.690 --> 02:04:41.390
suppose right look into your GCP look into your Azure look

02:04:41.390 --> 02:04:44.910
into AWS it looks like GCP is different Azure is different

02:04:44.910 --> 02:04:48.250
and then it was different technically for me it's not right

02:04:48.250 --> 02:04:51.430
whatever fundamentals they have implemented in AWS same is

02:04:51.430 --> 02:04:54.110
available in Azure same is available in GCP with a different

02:04:54.110 --> 02:04:57.730
name problem solved right. Now coming to a programming

02:04:57.730 --> 02:05:01.330
language right we say that okay Python is simple or Java is

02:05:01.330 --> 02:05:05.330
tough or C++ is tougher or all those things right under the

02:05:05.330 --> 02:05:08.870
hood if I know one programming language if I know how it

02:05:08.870 --> 02:05:12.050
works right if I know like a looping concept if else kind of

02:05:12.050 --> 02:05:15.030
a concept. Approximately. Approximately all of those

02:05:15.030 --> 02:05:17.850
programming languages are doing the same thing obviously

02:05:17.850 --> 02:05:21.250
syntaxes are different right. So it looks like we are living

02:05:21.250 --> 02:05:24.350
in a world where we have too many options right but when you

02:05:24.350 --> 02:05:28.110
are going to club it and think from a 10,000 feet like then

02:05:28.110 --> 02:05:31.330
you will be able to find out that it's not too much it's

02:05:31.330 --> 02:05:34.250
like I have never cleared my basic I was just running after

02:05:34.250 --> 02:05:37.270
a small small things right all those new things I was just

02:05:37.270 --> 02:05:39.870
chasing those like things and that is the reason I was not

02:05:39.870 --> 02:05:42.790
able to build the base and that that's the reason even a

02:05:42.790 --> 02:05:44.210
study. Today I have mentioned and even today I have

02:05:44.210 --> 02:05:48.450
mentioned multiple times that base is required because that

02:05:48.450 --> 02:05:51.410
is going to help you out to adopt a new things and this is

02:05:51.410 --> 02:05:54.510
what I have done in my last like 11 of career and even

02:05:54.510 --> 02:05:57.150
before base yeah.

02:05:59.120 --> 02:06:02.180
So so you have to give a time see at least once in your

02:06:02.180 --> 02:06:05.100
lifetime you have to give a time to build your complete base

02:06:05.100 --> 02:06:07.880
maybe it will take six months of time maybe it will take one

02:06:07.880 --> 02:06:10.320
year of time for you. Depends upon your caliber because

02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:12.740
every human being will be having a different kind of a

02:06:12.740 --> 02:06:16.980
capacity. Thought process. Learning journey. But yes if you

02:06:16.980 --> 02:06:21.140
are able to do it for a entire life you will enjoy and we

02:06:21.140 --> 02:06:25.760
have seen that kind of people and they literally like and if

02:06:25.760 --> 02:06:28.460
you are going to talk to all of those people almost everyone

02:06:28.460 --> 02:06:32.760
will say the same thing. So clear the base and then go for

02:06:32.760 --> 02:06:35.700
the journey. It looks like there are too many things because

02:06:35.700 --> 02:06:39.100
now we are living in a world of social media so anyone is

02:06:39.100 --> 02:06:41.320
creating even a simple application they are going for the

02:06:41.320 --> 02:06:44.060
marketing and then like we all are able to get those

02:06:44.060 --> 02:06:47.060
buzzwords. Right. And especially in a world of AI every day

02:06:47.060 --> 02:06:50.020
new model every day new framework every day new startup but

02:06:50.020 --> 02:06:53.220
under the hood most of them are doing the exact same thing

02:06:53.220 --> 02:06:56.080
under the hood most of them there are only four to five

02:06:56.080 --> 02:06:59.080
companies who have created a stable model right which I can

02:06:59.080 --> 02:07:01.500
actually use but you will go to hugging face there are

02:07:01.500 --> 02:07:03.540
millions of all people have published I'm talking about LLM

02:07:03.540 --> 02:07:06.960
only LLM not any other model in any other category not a

02:07:06.960 --> 02:07:09.520
vision model not text to speech or not like any other model

02:07:09.520 --> 02:07:11.780
just LLMs right. There are millions of model which is

02:07:11.780 --> 02:07:15.220
available but only four to five. Which I'm using which

02:07:15.220 --> 02:07:18.280
cursor you have seen is using which windows of is using and

02:07:18.280 --> 02:07:20.600
with the entire world is eventually using so it's not too

02:07:20.600 --> 02:07:23.740
much it looks like too much right but actually it's not

02:07:23.740 --> 02:07:28.440
answer one last question like I want our elaboration on that

02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:32.640
point like in this age how you should learn fast so can you

02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:35.060
show a practical approach to learn fast like related to

02:07:35.060 --> 02:07:37.660
anything program join join my class I'll help you how to

02:07:37.660 --> 02:07:41.140
learn faster yeah. Okay Krishna you said learn fast. Yeah.

02:07:41.380 --> 02:07:44.520
Thank you. I was just saying get a blue screen expect

02:07:44.520 --> 02:07:47.760
comfortable gaming chair ah no I don't like gaming chair my

02:07:47.760 --> 02:07:50.220
office chair is way more comfortable than your gaming chair

02:07:50.220 --> 02:07:52.860
I had I have that actually I had two gaming chair but yeah I

02:07:52.860 --> 02:07:56.100
don't like it Krishna just on a fun note yeah Ganesh please

02:07:56.100 --> 02:08:01.680
go ahead with the question. Yeah hello sir. So URI URI API

02:08:01.680 --> 02:08:06.260
that you use URI API it we cannot use in our organization

02:08:06.260 --> 02:08:09.320
right so what is the alternative for it. You can you can use

02:08:09.320 --> 02:08:11.900
in your organization URI API why you can't use URI API in

02:08:11.900 --> 02:08:17.200
your organization. It's not your own house. No basically URI

02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:20.140
API we have two kind of a model one is a proprietary model

02:08:20.140 --> 02:08:22.880
which people have not made as open source and some of them

02:08:22.880 --> 02:08:25.220
are open source model open source model we are hosting at

02:08:25.220 --> 02:08:28.340
the end of the day API wise you just need a model calling

02:08:28.340 --> 02:08:32.100
right you should not worry about like from where it is get

02:08:32.100 --> 02:08:35.440
coming from basically you are getting all those

02:08:35.440 --> 02:08:39.000
international grade model a best of best model out of those

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:42.060
10 million which exist in the world. And URI API this is

02:08:42.060 --> 02:08:44.440
where URI API comes into picture so use it wherever you want

02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:49.760
for the application simple. Other questions like cursors

02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:53.360
that we download using the cursors we are generating the

02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:58.800
code how it's integrated with Vs like how it's generating in

02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:03.260
Vs. So basically they have okay so basically in cursor what

02:09:03.260 --> 02:09:05.940
they have done and even you can do it so basically they have

02:09:05.940 --> 02:09:09.120
developed their own extension so cursor this interface that

02:09:09.120 --> 02:09:11.620
you are able to see right. So this is their own extension

02:09:11.620 --> 02:09:14.080
that they have created and inside that so they are giving

02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:18.000
this agent control a lot of agent agent who will be able to

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:21.020
summarize the task agent who will be able to invoke your

02:09:21.020 --> 02:09:23.640
entire directory the agent who will be able to invoke the

02:09:23.640 --> 02:09:26.920
terminal agent which will be able to remember all of the

02:09:26.920 --> 02:09:30.260
memories agent will be able to basically call all the

02:09:30.260 --> 02:09:33.620
fallbacks or which will be able to like you know test a

02:09:33.620 --> 02:09:36.060
debug and then it will be able to do the fixes. So there are

02:09:36.060 --> 02:09:39.120
multiple agent system as you can see over here right it's a

02:09:39.120 --> 02:09:41.360
multi agent system that they have created inside this

02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:44.880
interface and they have integrated with the Vs code and now

02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:47.060
they are claiming it as a cursor and still they are

02:09:47.060 --> 02:09:49.580
developing it they have like done a very good job by the

02:09:49.580 --> 02:09:53.300
way. So basically it's a agentic a different agent calling

02:09:53.300 --> 02:09:57.180
that they are doing is they have written on their own. Okay

02:09:57.180 --> 02:10:02.500
so the URI API that we can design and we can give the

02:10:02.500 --> 02:10:06.120
command to cursor cursor will generate the code that is the

02:10:06.120 --> 02:10:09.680
flow right. URI API you can design. No. It's already

02:10:09.680 --> 02:10:14.330
designed right it's already in production you don't have to

02:10:14.330 --> 02:10:16.410
do anything just download the cursor give a prompt it will

02:10:16.410 --> 02:10:20.490
start generating. And then in later stage once you will

02:10:20.490 --> 02:10:23.190
exhaust your entire like a quota a free quota then they will

02:10:23.190 --> 02:10:27.310
ask you for the payment but yeah so here if you will go and

02:10:27.310 --> 02:10:30.250
check sorry so here if you will go and check so they are

02:10:30.250 --> 02:10:33.810
giving you an option to even add your own models. So own

02:10:33.810 --> 02:10:38.070
model means API key that is the meaning of the model okay

02:10:38.070 --> 02:10:43.270
yeah so is there any like a cloud based this cursor where we

02:10:43.270 --> 02:10:46.870
can like for one hour or one day we can use. No there is no

02:10:46.870 --> 02:10:49.310
cloud based cursor even windsurf is not a cloud based

02:10:49.310 --> 02:10:52.450
firebase is a cloud based so I have shown you the firebase

02:10:52.450 --> 02:10:54.970
right firebase studio so firebase studio is basically a

02:10:54.970 --> 02:10:58.710
cloud based but not cursor not windsurf okay yeah thank you

02:10:58.710 --> 02:11:01.330
sir yeah can we use URI API key in a cursor yes you can use

02:11:01.330 --> 02:11:04.290
it so the cursor is giving you an option for like you know

02:11:04.290 --> 02:11:08.470
external API calling so that is pretty much feasible. Okay.

02:11:08.470 --> 02:11:11.690
Next one is Ram Ramesh Kumar yes please go ahead yeah

02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:16.600
go ahead go ahead guys ask your question. Jubair please go

02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:20.860
ahead with your question. Hi Rami are you am I audible yes

02:11:20.860 --> 02:11:24.200
yeah Jubair you are audible yes thank you for a chance to

02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:28.060
the talk this is my first time okay you were not able to

02:11:28.060 --> 02:11:32.580
join us today yeah I did a study about this talk to you the

02:11:32.580 --> 02:11:36.020
first time okay okay fine got it yeah it's a great chance

02:11:36.020 --> 02:11:40.700
for to talk to you. Okay. I'm fresh up the about. Okay. I'm

02:11:40.700 --> 02:11:44.460
fresh up the about the generative AI my question is if I

02:11:44.460 --> 02:11:49.240
learn the generative AI so what about the job and if not a

02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:54.140
job can I make like any kind of application or is the better

02:11:54.140 --> 02:11:58.140
for me I have a previous experience of the Java there's to

02:11:58.140 --> 02:12:03.600
be suggestion about it. Okay okay so see a job wise if I'll

02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:06.400
say so there are enough job right I'll not never say that

02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:10.200
and job is increasing yes there was some adjustment which

02:12:10.200 --> 02:12:13.740
industry. Okay. Is going on and you must have seen in a news

02:12:13.740 --> 02:12:16.240
that people are doing this hiding and fighting all those

02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:19.980
games and again this is nothing new sometimes so people used

02:12:19.980 --> 02:12:23.740
to like a hype it more and more but if you will look into

02:12:23.740 --> 02:12:27.380
the positive side a real positive side I will say that

02:12:27.380 --> 02:12:31.940
people have started hiding and believe me next six months or

02:12:31.940 --> 02:12:36.160
in a year of time. So once this entire resuffle will be done

02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:40.060
because again that resuffling is important. Okay. Because if

02:12:40.060 --> 02:12:43.220
a company is having so many people and if they're not

02:12:43.220 --> 02:12:45.560
productive if they're not able to work if they're not able

02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:48.200
to adopt a new culture what company will do obviously

02:12:48.200 --> 02:12:50.500
company has to take the action after some point of a time

02:12:50.500 --> 02:12:53.560
and this is the action like a series of things which the

02:12:53.560 --> 02:12:57.480
company is trying to take a second expect is that that yes

02:12:57.480 --> 02:13:02.880
everyone is trying to build their own strong AI portfolio

02:13:02.880 --> 02:13:06.180
maybe in a product maybe for a client and because of that

02:13:06.180 --> 02:13:08.540
everyone is hiding this hiding is going on since last four

02:13:08.540 --> 02:13:12.420
to five years. Yes it's a different story that generative AI

02:13:12.420 --> 02:13:15.220
exists just two and a half year back so it has started but

02:13:15.220 --> 02:13:17.100
yeah AI was there we were using machine learning deep

02:13:17.100 --> 02:13:20.920
learning all those things so hiding will increase even more

02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:24.640
in this era gen AI era and you can just observe the market

02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:28.100
it's increasing now so that's the first part job is there

02:13:28.100 --> 02:13:30.740
second part as you have asked that can you build something

02:13:30.740 --> 02:13:32.880
so yeah as you have mentioned that you are coming from Java

02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:35.580
background and you have some tech background you can build

02:13:35.580 --> 02:13:38.860
it but for that you need a problem statement. So if you have

02:13:38.860 --> 02:13:41.340
any kind of problem statement start building it because now

02:13:41.340 --> 02:13:45.720
building at least I would say MVP and I'm not saying that

02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:51.520
full scale things but building MVP is way more easier than

02:13:51.520 --> 02:13:57.140
before only MVP minimum viable product only right not like a

02:13:57.140 --> 02:13:59.840
complete full scale system which can take a load of anything

02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:02.440
and where you can integrate like a thousand people for that

02:14:02.440 --> 02:14:07.440
you need a real real developer still it's required so hope

02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:10.680
I'm able to answer your question Jubeer. Yeah yeah this

02:14:10.680 --> 02:14:15.280
pretty much I get it thank you yeah that that's my concern

02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:19.620
if at least if I don't like hit the job or something else at

02:14:19.620 --> 02:14:23.240
least make something and like make some freelancing or at

02:14:23.240 --> 02:14:26.640
least one satisfaction that's I want yeah exactly see I

02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:30.260
suggest everyone right not from today today's age of AI but

02:14:30.260 --> 02:14:33.720
I'm teaching since last eight year I believe so since eight

02:14:33.720 --> 02:14:38.240
year I simply say to everyone that you are not in control.

02:14:38.260 --> 02:14:39.800
You are not in college you are not preparing for the exam

02:14:39.800 --> 02:14:42.680
you are not supposed to go and like a get some sort of a

02:14:42.680 --> 02:14:47.000
marks you are going to appear for a real interview so when

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:51.660
there was no AI no age of AI I would say even at that point

02:14:51.660 --> 02:14:55.280
of time I kept on saying people that build something right

02:14:55.280 --> 02:14:58.940
because you will be able to create a more value you will be

02:14:58.940 --> 02:15:02.480
more valuable in a market as compared to anyone else in a

02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:08.240
market so it was a fact 10 year back and it is a fact. Okay.

02:15:08.260 --> 02:15:12.300
Right so if you are building believe me your level of

02:15:12.300 --> 02:15:16.440
experience the kind of a value that you will be able to get

02:15:16.440 --> 02:15:20.120
in a market when you showcase your product will be on a

02:15:20.120 --> 02:15:23.060
different label and yes if you are able to build something

02:15:23.060 --> 02:15:27.040
which is going to push you as an entrepreneur right where

02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:29.520
you are able to generate a revenue nothing can be better

02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:33.580
than that believe me nothing that will give you the ultimate

02:15:33.580 --> 02:15:37.460
level of satisfaction right but to reach out to that level.

02:15:38.260 --> 02:15:40.680
You have to work on a disciplined manner I am not saying

02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:43.840
that like 18 hour a day or 20 hour a day no discipline

02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:47.300
matter maybe just one hour two hour but for a very long time

02:15:47.820 --> 02:15:51.140
that will yield the result long term investment right we all

02:15:51.140 --> 02:15:54.700
talk about the long term investment in a finance so this is

02:15:54.700 --> 02:15:58.800
this works exactly in the same manner discipline consistency

02:15:59.480 --> 02:16:03.500
and long term. Yeah I am appreciating I see you are very

02:16:03.500 --> 02:16:06.920
very like what is the hard worker or whatever you can do. I

02:16:06.920 --> 02:16:09.460
am very happy to like complete four hours this is the

02:16:09.460 --> 02:16:13.340
unbelievable thing 14 hour is not like I used to give a

02:16:13.340 --> 02:16:17.600
lecture for 14 hour a day wow I can't believe it so four is

02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:20.940
nothing I can continuously speak for like next like 11 12

02:16:20.940 --> 02:16:24.840
hours without stopping and that's one thing also make me

02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:28.360
motivated I can do at least four to four hour everyone can

02:16:28.360 --> 02:16:30.840
do everyone can do believe me everyone can do it looks

02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:34.300
painful on day one day two right see I always keep on saying

02:16:34.300 --> 02:16:37.880
that there is a zero to one journey. And zero to one journey

02:16:37.880 --> 02:16:42.100
is going to be a tough right for everyone zero to one it

02:16:42.100 --> 02:16:44.480
doesn't matter what you do what you're going to start or

02:16:44.480 --> 02:16:47.100
what you're trying to learn one to ten journey will be

02:16:47.100 --> 02:16:52.900
smooth and ten and above you will flourish so but yes you

02:16:52.900 --> 02:16:56.560
have to like ten and above to go to ten and above you have

02:16:56.560 --> 02:17:00.300
to start from zero to one okay thank you thank you that's

02:17:00.300 --> 02:17:06.320
nice. Shudhanshu. Yes Ramesh please go ahead. Shudhanshu I

02:17:06.320 --> 02:17:07.760
have a question. I have some couple of doubts from the

02:17:07.760 --> 02:17:10.840
cursor right you have given the multiple option cursor

02:17:10.840 --> 02:17:14.300
windsurf or something so can I use in my office environment

02:17:14.300 --> 02:17:17.800
is there any restriction. I think nowadays almost everyone

02:17:17.800 --> 02:17:22.960
is even my wife is working right see like sees a proper

02:17:22.960 --> 02:17:26.760
coder and like a developer so basically like their company

02:17:26.760 --> 02:17:30.000
has allowed and I have spoken to many of my friend in a

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.820
recent days who is working with some of the companies and

02:17:32.820 --> 02:17:38.160
nowadays everyone is allowed to like install and build. So

02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:40.980
yes it is no no do we need to ask any special permission

02:17:40.980 --> 02:17:45.820
before using the that that I can't do that you will have to

02:17:45.820 --> 02:17:49.180
like ask and talk to your maybe admin who used to like

02:17:49.180 --> 02:17:52.120
manage the installation and everything so that I can't say

02:17:52.120 --> 02:17:55.940
even yeah even if per euro as well no euro chat as well can

02:17:55.940 --> 02:18:00.880
I use no for you it's a it's a right it's a web based

02:18:00.880 --> 02:18:05.120
basically yes can I use. So you can use URI anywhere you

02:18:05.120 --> 02:18:09.520
don't need any installation right. Okay okay then next thing

02:18:09.520 --> 02:18:12.500
for that right which you have three tools right which one

02:18:12.500 --> 02:18:15.720
can we go ahead with that because instead of avoiding the

02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:19.500
multiple things. No I will yeah simple I will suggest go

02:18:19.500 --> 02:18:23.520
with cursor cursor right yes for now for now go with cursor

02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:26.420
simple right because I know there are like so many tools so

02:18:26.420 --> 02:18:30.700
many distraction everything right just with cursor simple as

02:18:30.700 --> 02:18:34.580
of now. Yeah with cursor also it has given multiple models

02:18:34.580 --> 02:18:38.660
right it's everything connecting web model or URI API can we

02:18:38.660 --> 02:18:40.700
connect with the URI system. You can connect with the URI

02:18:40.700 --> 02:18:43.840
API as well so they give you like over here basically like

02:18:43.840 --> 02:18:47.780
you can try to pass your own API key and then they're giving

02:18:47.780 --> 02:18:50.100
you one option to like you know connect with your open AI

02:18:50.100 --> 02:18:52.720
API and they're giving you another option so where you will

02:18:52.720 --> 02:18:56.220
be able to connect your own any custom API right and then

02:18:56.220 --> 02:18:59.040
you can like try to attach it so in both the way it works

02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:03.860
actually but it will work best I would say right so you can

02:19:03.860 --> 02:19:06.500
you can override the open AI end point. So let's suppose

02:19:06.500 --> 02:19:09.460
this is the end point that I have I can do what so I can try

02:19:09.460 --> 02:19:12.300
to give my own end point for a chat completion a URI end

02:19:12.300 --> 02:19:15.500
point basically see at the end of the day this requires only

02:19:15.500 --> 02:19:19.880
an end point and here if you will come let me show it to you

02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:23.100
so you know you're on if you are going to come so we have

02:19:23.100 --> 02:19:28.240
exposed already URI API and then we have an end point and

02:19:28.240 --> 02:19:30.840
here is a chat completion end point which we have given to

02:19:30.840 --> 02:19:33.580
you so you can try to use this looks like you're not sharing

02:19:33.580 --> 02:19:35.620
oh is it okay okay.

02:19:43.060 --> 02:19:46.120
So basically like there is a in a cursor when you will come

02:19:46.120 --> 02:19:49.320
so let me close all of these things so let's suppose you are

02:19:49.320 --> 02:19:53.040
here and if you will come over here so you will be able to

02:19:53.040 --> 02:19:57.320
find out that it is giving you to option to add a model add

02:19:57.320 --> 02:20:00.500
model means let's suppose I can host a model in my local

02:20:00.500 --> 02:20:04.040
night in my local proper local no cloud right and then I can

02:20:04.040 --> 02:20:07.200
try to give an access to this one. Or let's suppose I have a

02:20:07.200 --> 02:20:11.520
URI API so I can do one thing so I can try to even give a

02:20:11.520 --> 02:20:16.360
end point over here with a URI API so if local host then

02:20:16.360 --> 02:20:21.500
local host otherwise URI API end point I can copy from here

02:20:21.500 --> 02:20:31.300
and then I can try to sorry cursor so entropic key overwrite

02:20:31.300 --> 02:20:35.720
the base URL yeah so I can even give this kind of a like a

02:20:35.720 --> 02:20:39.200
chat completion API over here API access or streaming API

02:20:39.200 --> 02:20:43.080
access and it will be able to use it. So all this option

02:20:43.080 --> 02:20:47.260
they have already like made it open for all of us so I can

02:20:47.260 --> 02:20:50.780
try to give an API at the end of the day it requires a AI

02:20:50.780 --> 02:20:54.500
access that's it cursor is a tool cursor is a interface it

02:20:54.500 --> 02:20:58.300
requires a AI access if you are able to give it it will work

02:20:58.300 --> 02:21:02.320
otherwise just go with the paid version of cursor so it is

02:21:02.320 --> 02:21:04.660
it is giving you a free tier I think it is giving you enough

02:21:04.660 --> 02:21:07.180
number of free tier for testing and building at least a

02:21:07.180 --> 02:21:08.920
small team. So it is a small application but beyond that

02:21:08.920 --> 02:21:11.940
obviously it will be looking for like your paid access.

02:21:13.940 --> 02:21:17.100
Where is the cursor setting option which one did you click

02:21:17.100 --> 02:21:19.720
for the cursor setting. Basically close close this one now

02:21:19.720 --> 02:21:26.880
follow along with my mouse so here this option right yes

02:21:26.880 --> 02:21:30.120
yeah by default you will be able to see auto by default when

02:21:30.120 --> 02:21:33.000
you will install right let's suppose I am clicking on auto I

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.900
am trying to switch off this auto switch off this auto now

02:21:35.900 --> 02:21:40.840
add model option. Got it got it got it but auto means which

02:21:40.840 --> 02:21:44.480
model is selecting it's a pre model or no so by default if

02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:46.080
you are if you are going ahead with the auto right so

02:21:46.080 --> 02:21:48.940
majority of times it is going to select a cloud day but

02:21:48.940 --> 02:21:52.160
let's suppose if I am switching off auto so I can try to

02:21:52.160 --> 02:21:56.520
select only GPT 4.0 so now it will be like GPT 4.0 let's

02:21:56.520 --> 02:21:58.700
suppose if I have added some of my custom model for example

02:21:58.700 --> 02:22:01.300
I have added this test right test is my basically it's not a

02:22:01.300 --> 02:22:03.980
default one you will not be able to see it in your cursor so

02:22:03.980 --> 02:22:06.600
test is basically a my model which I have attached from my

02:22:06.600 --> 02:22:10.020
side. Yeah. Custom model basically so I can select this one

02:22:10.020 --> 02:22:13.680
so now it will use a test model or if I am going to keep it

02:22:13.680 --> 02:22:17.900
on auto then it will be like in auto stage. Yeah but while I

02:22:17.900 --> 02:22:20.420
was trying with the cloudy at all it's not working on my

02:22:20.420 --> 02:22:23.960
machine it's a paid model right. Cloud day is not a free

02:22:23.960 --> 02:22:26.660
model cloud day is the most expensive model actually cloud

02:22:26.660 --> 02:22:29.300
day for sonet right it's not of like a free one just keep it

02:22:29.300 --> 02:22:33.600
auto as of now. Auto as of now okay fine and my next

02:22:33.600 --> 02:22:36.880
question is that right we have built the APS system how are

02:22:36.880 --> 02:22:38.040
we integrating it. How are we integrating with the server

02:22:38.040 --> 02:22:42.600
and generate no attach the github and upload into the server

02:22:42.600 --> 02:22:48.780
deployment deploy into the server. Which one you built no no

02:22:48.780 --> 02:22:52.200
actually which one you built the API right right can how can

02:22:52.200 --> 02:22:56.360
we integrate with the server real time server. Okay will so

02:22:56.360 --> 02:23:00.780
already API endpoint we have given to you a code example we

02:23:00.780 --> 02:23:03.580
have given to you now so let's suppose if you have to use

02:23:03.580 --> 02:23:06.260
this open AI model or any model right any model basically

02:23:06.260 --> 02:23:10.720
right. Any model with any framework so in the next class as

02:23:10.720 --> 02:23:14.060
per your syllabus I'm going to teach you that how you will

02:23:14.060 --> 02:23:17.640
be able to use an API if I have to show you an example now

02:23:17.640 --> 02:23:20.960
so maybe I can copy just this piece of a code where you can

02:23:20.960 --> 02:23:24.080
try to write your prompt and then I'll come to this one let

02:23:24.080 --> 02:23:27.360
me let me show you a quick demo a very very quick demo this

02:23:27.360 --> 02:23:30.800
is my API endpoint right this is my API endpoint now here I

02:23:30.800 --> 02:23:34.220
have to pass my key so what I will do I'll just try to go

02:23:34.220 --> 02:23:38.400
here API key. And I'll try to. Click on create API key give

02:23:38.400 --> 02:23:42.220
any name it will be able to create my API key this is my

02:23:42.220 --> 02:23:46.180
code just for a chat completion we have a API endpoint for

02:23:46.180 --> 02:23:48.600
email I'll show you image generation as well just wait now

02:23:48.600 --> 02:23:51.600
itself. So I have just replaced with my URI API key as you

02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:53.840
can see right those static static I have replaced by URI API

02:23:53.840 --> 02:23:57.240
key and this is my prompt write a poem about the artificial

02:23:57.240 --> 02:24:01.380
intelligence and this is the model ID. So we have given you

02:24:01.380 --> 02:24:05.380
25 model of access so you can just change this ID and you

02:24:05.380 --> 02:24:08.140
have to basically like do a prompt whatever you are looking

02:24:08.140 --> 02:24:13.120
for and execute now see see the magic so it is so now I'm

02:24:13.120 --> 02:24:16.080
able to get the result right so it is it is able to

02:24:16.080 --> 02:24:19.060
basically write a poem for me let's suppose if I would like

02:24:19.060 --> 02:24:21.460
to generate an image right if I have to generate the image

02:24:21.460 --> 02:24:28.000
by the way so AI framework not AI framework code exam AI

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:32.880
available model end points yeah so let's suppose if I would

02:24:32.880 --> 02:24:36.000
like to generate the image so here is again the end point

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:39.460
that we have given to you so this is the curl endpoint curl

02:24:39.460 --> 02:24:42.480
command we have given to you I can quickly convert that into

02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:48.100
a python based let me convert it python code for this yeah

02:24:48.100 --> 02:24:52.440
so again the same see only two three things are required one

02:24:52.440 --> 02:24:56.280
is this endpoint this URL so this URL is nothing but a URL

02:24:56.280 --> 02:24:59.440
which is allowing you to reach out to my system a your own

02:24:59.440 --> 02:25:02.340
system because we are hosting our entire server somewhere

02:25:02.340 --> 02:25:06.000
right so for any even you are using an API. API from like a

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:10.180
chat GPT or open AI or Google or anywhere in this entire

02:25:10.180 --> 02:25:12.120
world doesn't matter whether you are using this API or

02:25:12.120 --> 02:25:16.160
someone else's API so there will be a endpoint endpoint

02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:18.740
means it will help you out to reach out to that system now

02:25:18.740 --> 02:25:22.020
inside that system what you are trying to access so let's

02:25:22.020 --> 02:25:24.320
suppose inside that system this model is running so I would

02:25:24.320 --> 02:25:27.640
like to access this model right with this input right and

02:25:27.640 --> 02:25:31.560
then token is nothing but authorization so like a password

02:25:31.560 --> 02:25:35.320
right so don't worry I know many people don't understand the

02:25:35.320 --> 02:25:38.820
fundamentals of API so that's the reason there will be a

02:25:38.820 --> 02:25:43.360
proper class on that where we will create our own API by

02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:47.640
using like a small small like a code pieces and after that I

02:25:47.640 --> 02:25:51.800
am going to show you how to use the API okay okay sure just

02:25:51.800 --> 02:25:55.060
I wanted to you have built the system but we didn't deploy

02:25:55.060 --> 02:25:57.200
anything into the server that's why you want to crack check

02:25:57.200 --> 02:26:01.080
it yeah IPL booking system yeah so see let's suppose like a

02:26:01.080 --> 02:26:03.520
image generation right so I have to basically generate the

02:26:03.520 --> 02:26:08.020
image I will like to use the same thing. URI token that I

02:26:08.020 --> 02:26:12.020
have already created right replacing my API token and a

02:26:12.020 --> 02:26:16.880
beautiful sunset over the mountain let me ask one thing give

02:26:16.880 --> 02:26:25.000
me a image of Newton holding wine in hand

02:26:29.590 --> 02:26:32.630
okay it will generate the image for me yeah so it's

02:26:32.630 --> 02:26:34.670
executing and it will be able to generate the image for me

02:26:34.670 --> 02:26:37.950
so I will teach you this one I know like this company. And

02:26:37.950 --> 02:26:41.570
many of us many of us technically don't even know that what

02:26:41.570 --> 02:26:45.150
is API how we will be able to create it for here we have

02:26:45.150 --> 02:26:47.670
created the API right API endpoint but how this will be

02:26:47.670 --> 02:26:50.770
created when I say that this is my API endpoint now you have

02:26:50.770 --> 02:26:54.250
written some xyg function how you can do it yeah how you can

02:26:54.250 --> 02:26:56.730
attach the authorization for that API so that without

02:26:56.730 --> 02:26:59.390
password no one will be able to log in into or no one will

02:26:59.390 --> 02:27:01.890
be able to hit your system so all of these things I am going

02:27:01.890 --> 02:27:04.610
to cover I am going to teach because without this you will

02:27:04.610 --> 02:27:07.390
never be able to build even a smallest of the product which

02:27:07.390 --> 02:27:10.570
is a very small product which works in a real time okay sir

02:27:10.570 --> 02:27:13.450
on the final one more question as part of the syllabus do we

02:27:13.450 --> 02:27:18.970
cover the deployment activities yes a lot a lot a lot okay

02:27:18.970 --> 02:27:25.770
yeah sure thank you sir I have a question just wait I will

02:27:25.770 --> 02:27:29.570
call out the name yeah Sai please go ahead sir I have couple

02:27:29.570 --> 02:27:33.410
of questions sir first question is when you have created

02:27:33.410 --> 02:27:37.430
that IPL IPL thingy so I have a question sir I have a

02:27:37.430 --> 02:27:37.770
question sir when you have created that IPL IPL thingy so is

02:27:37.770 --> 02:27:40.650
that like how is it able to figure out that okay these are

02:27:40.650 --> 02:27:44.230
the teams this is the stadiums in which it is games are

02:27:44.230 --> 02:27:47.130
happening all that is because of the pre-training of that

02:27:47.130 --> 02:27:49.850
model no no it's not because of the pre-training of the

02:27:49.850 --> 02:27:52.350
model I have given the proper context first of all so that's

02:27:52.350 --> 02:27:55.070
the reason I have generated the context and then basically

02:27:55.070 --> 02:27:58.610
it will be able to understand it will try to break it down

02:27:58.610 --> 02:28:02.530
all of those context which I have given to a cursor in a

02:28:02.530 --> 02:28:05.110
small small small small model this is where this agent comes

02:28:05.110 --> 02:28:06.350
into picture right.

02:28:11.170 --> 02:28:17.830
So it will be able to break it down line by line line by

02:28:17.830 --> 02:28:21.350
line and then it will start working on it this is like rag

02:28:21.350 --> 02:28:25.290
isn't it sorry it is this is like rag like where you are

02:28:25.290 --> 02:28:28.230
it's it's not rag actually rag is different conceptually rag

02:28:28.230 --> 02:28:30.290
is different this is just a context I'm giving to agent

02:28:30.290 --> 02:28:35.310
that's it okay okay okay so that is one question second

02:28:35.310 --> 02:28:39.810
question sir URI is a template. Like URI is an API as the

02:28:39.810 --> 02:28:43.910
name suggests but how is it different from an AI agent like

02:28:43.910 --> 02:28:48.270
so URI you see agent agent is something which will be able

02:28:48.270 --> 02:28:52.290
to do a end-to-end task and basically agent requires an

02:28:52.290 --> 02:28:56.990
access of those API those models so URI is not an agent URI

02:28:56.990 --> 02:29:00.370
is basically a middleware so which is going to help you out

02:29:00.370 --> 02:29:03.070
to give you an access for example I've generated this image

02:29:03.070 --> 02:29:08.050
right. So just by calling what image API. I was. By Newton I

02:29:08.050 --> 02:29:12.410
think image like a spelling was different so that's the

02:29:12.410 --> 02:29:17.290
reason in E W T O N. So with the help of this API right and

02:29:17.290 --> 02:29:20.270
endpoint I'm able to generate this images I'm able to write

02:29:20.270 --> 02:29:23.610
a basically a poem over here in the circuit over with the

02:29:23.610 --> 02:29:26.710
luminous grace all those things and again I'm able to see

02:29:26.710 --> 02:29:29.430
generate the image right image of Newton a beautiful one is

02:29:29.430 --> 02:29:33.890
the quality one immediately so basically this is giving you

02:29:33.890 --> 02:29:37.110
an access URI is giving an access to all of those model.

02:29:37.110 --> 02:29:42.610
Which is by default required for these agents we are talking

02:29:42.610 --> 02:29:45.130
about agents over here right I'll explain you what is the

02:29:45.130 --> 02:29:47.150
actually agent is because we are going to create a lot of

02:29:47.150 --> 02:29:49.650
agent on my own every one of us we are going to create the

02:29:49.650 --> 02:29:52.670
agent not just one or two throughout the entire session more

02:29:52.670 --> 02:29:55.350
than hundreds of agent we are going to create but agent is

02:29:55.350 --> 02:29:58.450
nothing but a program right a piece of the code let's try to

02:29:58.450 --> 02:30:02.090
think in this way a piece of the code which is going to take

02:30:02.090 --> 02:30:06.870
a access of an AI and whatever you have written for the

02:30:06.870 --> 02:30:09.830
agent. That okay fine so you are the agent which will try to

02:30:09.830 --> 02:30:14.170
break down the entire input into a multiple part into a

02:30:14.170 --> 02:30:16.550
multiple context and then you will do the research agent

02:30:16.550 --> 02:30:19.230
will do that if you are going to ask the agent that okay

02:30:19.230 --> 02:30:22.070
book a schedule whenever someone is going to enter some time

02:30:22.070 --> 02:30:24.510
so book a meeting for me so agent will book a meeting

02:30:24.510 --> 02:30:27.130
automatically so agent is nothing but a piece of a code

02:30:27.130 --> 02:30:30.650
which will be able to do a task the way function was doing

02:30:30.650 --> 02:30:33.730
it before our automation was doing it before at the end of

02:30:33.730 --> 02:30:38.050
the day agent requires a LLM access. Because LLM is only

02:30:38.050 --> 02:30:41.250
going to give a capability to the entire knowledge base plus

02:30:41.250 --> 02:30:45.630
understand anything in a natural language because you as a

02:30:45.630 --> 02:30:47.310
human are going to give an input as a natural language. I

02:30:47.310 --> 02:30:50.830
have given my entire input as a natural language right yes

02:30:50.830 --> 02:30:54.610
so this is just wait for some time I think it's too early

02:30:54.610 --> 02:30:58.150
many of us are confused between the agents going forward you

02:30:58.150 --> 02:31:00.670
will be able to create such kind of agent on your own very

02:31:00.670 --> 02:31:06.930
soon got it sir and last question sir. Like in previously in

02:31:06.930 --> 02:31:08.490
the last session. Last few years we have learnt about

02:31:08.490 --> 02:31:14.010
transformers and encoder decoder systems and all but do you

02:31:14.010 --> 02:31:17.510
think sir all that learning will become obsolete because. No

02:31:17.510 --> 02:31:21.590
not at all not at all never never I would say and those

02:31:21.590 --> 02:31:24.470
learnings are still relevant it will be relevant even after

02:31:24.470 --> 02:31:28.570
a 10 20 year or maybe a 100 year right because we are able

02:31:28.570 --> 02:31:34.190
to speak as we learn a lot and as we like grow older and

02:31:34.190 --> 02:31:38.350
older so obviously we get a maturity. And we will be able to

02:31:38.350 --> 02:31:41.790
phrase a lot more good sentences humorous one I would say

02:31:41.790 --> 02:31:47.730
but still the base is ABCD. Got it. It will be there it will

02:31:47.730 --> 02:31:50.130
be there means literally it will be there to understand our

02:31:50.130 --> 02:31:52.690
mathematics obviously you have to know the counting from 0

02:31:52.690 --> 02:31:57.230
to 9 right 0 to 9 numbers that's the base so it's not going

02:31:57.230 --> 02:31:59.390
anywhere literally it's not going anywhere even in a physics

02:31:59.390 --> 02:32:01.890
right we are like I have given you example study that we are

02:32:01.890 --> 02:32:05.590
able to build a like a SIP we are able to build a big big

02:32:05.590 --> 02:32:08.850
infrastructure. Yes sir. plane kind of a things and even

02:32:08.850 --> 02:32:11.970
like international space kind of a things but basic physics

02:32:11.970 --> 02:32:15.070
a projectile escape velocity all those things are still

02:32:15.070 --> 02:32:21.310
required right so it will be relevant all the time yeah go

02:32:21.310 --> 02:32:26.850
ahead I have one question if we learn this generative AI

02:32:26.850 --> 02:32:30.390
about it and like what type of job opportunity will be open

02:32:30.390 --> 02:32:35.290
in industry as it is job opportunities always available it's

02:32:35.290 --> 02:32:37.430
even available now my student is getting place for my

02:32:37.430 --> 02:32:40.350
previous batches for my current batches so opportunity will

02:32:40.350 --> 02:32:43.610
be there it just depends upon you how capable you are

02:32:44.990 --> 02:32:50.550
actually as I am currently learning about the testing domain

02:32:50.550 --> 02:32:54.790
so like what will be testing is not having any future and

02:32:54.790 --> 02:32:59.870
opportunity ok sir hi sir this is Bharat Vaj yeah Bharat Vaj

02:32:59.870 --> 02:33:04.290
please go ahead sorry I have been like yeah it has been like

02:33:04.290 --> 02:33:06.530
couple of years back when you were teaching in Iron I joined

02:33:06.530 --> 02:33:09.490
the batch but then I was unable to complete after the python

02:33:09.490 --> 02:33:13.350
due to all these things so from there I know you your

02:33:13.350 --> 02:33:16.410
teaching and just wanted to like there is an immediately

02:33:16.410 --> 02:33:19.630
when I saw you launched it without any hesitation I just

02:33:19.630 --> 02:33:22.570
joined the batch thank you yeah so like my doubt is like

02:33:22.570 --> 02:33:25.970
since we are into Jene you know like how relevant is about

02:33:25.970 --> 02:33:29.330
to have the background of ML concepts and is it something

02:33:29.330 --> 02:33:33.350
like it will not create a hurdle for you I would say right

02:33:33.350 --> 02:33:37.290
but like I have mentioned that in industry many thing will

02:33:37.290 --> 02:33:41.030
keep on coming it's not going to stop now and not even maybe

02:33:41.030 --> 02:33:45.350
after like a couple of years it is going to stop and if you

02:33:45.350 --> 02:33:48.430
don't want to take a burden of those new things which is

02:33:48.430 --> 02:33:52.650
coming into a market now to eliminate those things or those

02:33:52.650 --> 02:33:57.450
like I would say events in a future I always suggest that

02:33:57.450 --> 02:34:02.390
build a fundamentals but yeah if you would like to join our

02:34:02.390 --> 02:34:05.410
industry just a Jenea industry I think this is more than

02:34:05.410 --> 02:34:09.430
enough for now but if you have to remove a bottleneck for

02:34:09.430 --> 02:34:12.810
the future then take your time spend some time with those

02:34:12.810 --> 02:34:18.610
basic fundamentals and then like a move ahead okay so and

02:34:18.610 --> 02:34:21.830
what will be the role of job like Jenea developers is it

02:34:21.830 --> 02:34:24.450
like do we need to know the UI and the backend things it's

02:34:24.450 --> 02:34:27.570
not the developer I would say so people are hiring on a lead

02:34:27.570 --> 02:34:30.370
position on a manager position on a director position so

02:34:30.370 --> 02:34:33.350
it's the same lineage we used to follow that we are

02:34:33.350 --> 02:34:36.310
following in any other like a domain any other technology so

02:34:36.310 --> 02:34:39.790
lineage wise it's not like a jet AI developer yes there is a

02:34:39.790 --> 02:34:41.650
developer there is a lead there is a manager there is a

02:34:41.650 --> 02:34:46.670
architect there is a director now so everyone the way we

02:34:46.670 --> 02:34:49.290
were doing a task now we are doing it with the help of this

02:34:49.290 --> 02:34:51.650
generative AI framework we are trying to solve the problem

02:34:51.650 --> 02:34:53.590
with the help of generative AI problem that's it that's

02:34:53.590 --> 02:34:55.410
that's the only thing which has changed with a new

02:34:55.410 --> 02:34:59.050
technology layer apart from that nothing has changed so like

02:34:59.050 --> 02:35:02.510
what the role will be called us or is it like it's a

02:35:02.510 --> 02:35:04.550
generative AI lead generative AI engineer generative AI

02:35:04.550 --> 02:35:07.310
manager generative AI architect generative AI director okay

02:35:07.310 --> 02:35:10.350
so like if you're migrating to like I mean currently I'm

02:35:10.350 --> 02:35:12.910
working in the Kubernetes part so if I wanted to migrate

02:35:12.910 --> 02:35:16.970
like to the data science domain like using this generative

02:35:16.970 --> 02:35:20.390
AI things whatever learning so like like do we need to know

02:35:20.390 --> 02:35:22.850
the background of UI and back-end background back-end

02:35:22.850 --> 02:35:25.730
development things back-end development I think you should

02:35:25.730 --> 02:35:29.230
know a little bit because back-end will be required UI will

02:35:29.230 --> 02:35:33.450
not be required because now if you give a Figma or like a

02:35:33.450 --> 02:35:36.830
Adobe Illustrator feed so it will be able to generate most

02:35:36.830 --> 02:35:39.870
of the time in a very very accurate way which will be

02:35:39.870 --> 02:35:43.630
dynamic towards all the screens so back-end but back-end is

02:35:43.630 --> 02:35:46.890
main okay so like once this course is completed we'll be

02:35:46.890 --> 02:35:50.630
able to like obviously yes yeah yeah yeah and what about the

02:35:50.630 --> 02:35:53.890
system design concepts like do we need oh that will be

02:35:53.890 --> 02:35:56.790
required if you are going to apply for a product based

02:35:56.790 --> 02:35:59.550
companies then system design and DSA both will come together

02:35:59.550 --> 02:36:01.950
doesn't matter for which role you are going to apply whether

02:36:01.950 --> 02:36:04.430
it's a gen AI or even a front-end developer role but yeah

02:36:04.430 --> 02:36:08.230
they have like a filtration criteria but nowadays even like

02:36:08.230 --> 02:36:10.650
they are changing their approach I have seen couple of

02:36:10.650 --> 02:36:13.470
company not all have changed the approach still most of the

02:36:13.470 --> 02:36:15.730
company has the same approach but yeah nowadays they are

02:36:15.730 --> 02:36:19.090
allowing you to you know use a vibe coding and they will be

02:36:19.090 --> 02:36:24.010
looking for the explanation from your side yeah thank you

02:36:24.010 --> 02:36:27.970
yeah thanks Madhav please go ahead hello sir good morning

02:36:27.970 --> 02:36:31.250
yeah good morning sir actually I have two questions one

02:36:31.250 --> 02:36:35.990
first question is I am using i3 laptop with the ssd ram and

02:36:35.990 --> 02:36:41.490
with fgb ram and ssd hard disk so I want to know do I need a

02:36:41.490 --> 02:36:46.470
this what is called graphics card installed my laptop or do

02:36:46.470 --> 02:36:49.210
I need to first of all I think in i3 you will not be able to

02:36:49.210 --> 02:36:51.810
integrate it the configuration that you said so graphics you

02:36:51.810 --> 02:36:54.550
will not be able to add it second of all it's not required

02:36:54.550 --> 02:36:57.950
we have a cloud platform and as long as you can use that

02:36:57.950 --> 02:37:02.630
same laptop use it once it will not support you or it will

02:37:02.630 --> 02:37:04.910
give you a problem then obviously you'll have to like avoid

02:37:04.910 --> 02:37:04.910
it because it will not support you or it will give you a

02:37:04.910 --> 02:37:05.370
problem then obviously you'll have to like a upgrade your

02:37:05.370 --> 02:37:07.810
yourself simple as of now I definitely

02:37:10.210 --> 02:37:13.570
as of now as of now don't go for a buy unless you are able

02:37:13.570 --> 02:37:16.850
to use it comfortably that laptop the same one right use it

02:37:16.850 --> 02:37:20.550
don't invest anywhere once it will not work it will like to

02:37:20.550 --> 02:37:25.070
stop working or executing your code then move ahead yeah but

02:37:25.070 --> 02:37:28.770
not now not immediately okay okay sir second question can we

02:37:28.770 --> 02:37:31.990
have some kind of a deligatory class on the station in which

02:37:31.990 --> 02:37:34.930
you can guide us about the new business opportunities like

02:37:34.930 --> 02:37:35.570
orange may fury например in their company coming in general

02:37:35.570 --> 02:37:41.090
not as a not as a part of this so this this class so i do

02:37:41.090 --> 02:37:43.790
take a lot of sessions on entrepreneurship right i do take a

02:37:43.790 --> 02:37:46.510
lot of session on a product building but this is not a part

02:37:46.510 --> 02:37:49.450
of your class lecture so i'll not say yes to this one uh

02:37:49.450 --> 02:37:53.590
because if i'll say yes then i have to fulfill it oh no i'm

02:37:53.590 --> 02:38:03.710
not saying in this class you will

02:38:03.710 --> 02:38:07.430
get to know uh you will get to know but yeah i don't believe

02:38:07.430 --> 02:38:09.850
in those kind of a gyan in general because there are so many

02:38:09.850 --> 02:38:13.570
out people out there who used to give it uh if i used to

02:38:13.570 --> 02:38:16.090
come with those things then i'll come with a practical stuff

02:38:16.090 --> 02:38:18.770
that okay this is something which is going to happen and i

02:38:18.770 --> 02:38:24.050
show it thank you sir yeah okay so just build build believe

02:38:24.050 --> 02:38:28.010
me the only way or the only escape route is to build nothing

02:38:28.010 --> 02:38:31.390
else okay next is pushkar please go ahead yeah

02:38:33.380 --> 02:38:39.840
pushkar so for genuine

02:38:39.840 --> 02:38:44.080
interviews like a deal concept harinian bird and transformer

02:38:44.080 --> 02:38:49.020
architecture that are required in general in general there

02:38:49.020 --> 02:38:52.660
is a chance if they have mentioned that into a jd right

02:38:52.660 --> 02:38:56.460
there is a chance that they are going to ask about it and if

02:38:56.460 --> 02:38:58.320
you have a your own plus access i have already explained

02:38:58.320 --> 02:39:00.840
everything starting from a theory and practical everything

02:39:00.840 --> 02:39:05.990
so it's better to have it if you don't have it so it's not

02:39:05.990 --> 02:39:10.330
monetary but yeah there is a chance coming into company okay

02:39:10.330 --> 02:39:15.730
so in the role of jni i am is there any use of deal concept

02:39:15.730 --> 02:39:19.870
regarding the rnn if you if you'll see the all of this model

02:39:19.870 --> 02:39:22.250
right the transformer the model that we are going to fine

02:39:22.250 --> 02:39:27.710
-tune uh the base is basically a neural network which is

02:39:27.710 --> 02:39:31.050
coming from the starting of deep learning and then the core

02:39:31.050 --> 02:39:34.030
fundamentals of these models are coming from a transformer

02:39:34.030 --> 02:39:37.130
which is a part of your research paper called as attention

02:39:37.130 --> 02:39:41.550
is all you need where you have encoder decoder layers and

02:39:41.550 --> 02:39:45.870
eventually that is a part of your NLP. My question is just

02:39:45.870 --> 02:39:49.870
like DL concept regarding the RNN are required in the job

02:39:49.870 --> 02:39:55.670
development like that. That I can't say it depends company

02:39:55.670 --> 02:39:58.110
to company interview to interview if someone is taking an

02:39:58.110 --> 02:40:00.830
interview just on a framework just on a because they will

02:40:00.830 --> 02:40:02.990
mention it they will mention it. So that's the reason it's

02:40:02.990 --> 02:40:07.810
good to have the entire fundamentals revised at least. Okay.

02:40:07.930 --> 02:40:14.050
Sir is it good that I completely over the CNN focusing on

02:40:14.050 --> 02:40:18.250
only RNN concept like that. That's fine. CNN basically works

02:40:18.250 --> 02:40:21.790
with respect to our vision. So that's completely fine. Okay.

02:40:23.050 --> 02:40:26.130
That's it. But good to have. Right. If you're looking for

02:40:26.130 --> 02:40:29.370
like a broader picture then good. Okay. Next one is Asish.

02:40:29.410 --> 02:40:29.730
Go ahead.

02:40:32.630 --> 02:40:37.170
Yeah. Go ahead. Sir, you just denied one diet that don't

02:40:37.170 --> 02:40:40.950
learn testing. But as a tester, I'm having six years of

02:40:40.950 --> 02:40:44.970
experience into this industry. So like if I'm learning this

02:40:44.970 --> 02:40:48.730
NIA, so within how many days we have to, you know, set up

02:40:48.730 --> 02:40:51.990
like you know, mindset within these days we will do complete

02:40:51.990 --> 02:40:56.090
transition or else as we could do. Max to max six months.

02:40:56.230 --> 02:41:03.250
Not more than that. Six months is more than enough. Okay,

02:41:03.290 --> 02:41:05.550
sir. Like, you know, within six months that we will have

02:41:05.550 --> 02:41:09.250
self-confidence like, you know, we can do work in this You

02:41:09.250 --> 02:41:12.870
will be you will be having confidence or not. That's a

02:41:12.870 --> 02:41:14.910
different story. That's a different question because that

02:41:14.910 --> 02:41:17.410
depends upon your effort that you are going to put up. I

02:41:17.410 --> 02:41:19.930
can't say that. Okay, fine. So just by watching my lectures

02:41:19.930 --> 02:41:23.230
or anyone's else lecture, you will be having that

02:41:23.230 --> 02:41:27.530
confidence, right? So that depends on your work. But yes, if

02:41:27.530 --> 02:41:31.650
anyone is putting up a genuine effort in a regular mode,

02:41:31.830 --> 02:41:35.890
then in six months it is practically possible. Not

02:41:35.890 --> 02:41:39.650
overnight. But yes, in six months if someone is not putting

02:41:39.650 --> 02:41:43.030
up a genuine effort consistently, then even six years is

02:41:43.030 --> 02:41:47.570
less. Okay, that's all like, you know, that there is a river

02:41:47.570 --> 02:41:50.510
with us each and every like things we'll reach out to him

02:41:50.510 --> 02:41:54.230
for that. But sir, again, also this question is same for who

02:41:54.230 --> 02:41:57.130
are doing automation, testing and testing. in manual in

02:41:57.130 --> 02:41:59.710
automation testing also this this thing is going to happen

02:41:59.710 --> 02:42:04.910
for them sorry can you please repeat once again so sir for

02:42:04.910 --> 02:42:08.050
those who are doing like automation testing and testing they

02:42:08.050 --> 02:42:12.590
have to also like you know whatever you suggested testing is

02:42:12.590 --> 02:42:15.330
gone testing automation testing a manual tester was gone

02:42:15.330 --> 02:42:17.850
five years back i believe yes there are some company who is

02:42:17.850 --> 02:42:21.570
hiring i know right but still it's gone and automation

02:42:21.570 --> 02:42:27.370
testing is also like on a verge of uh we can say extinction

02:42:27.370 --> 02:42:31.870
so it it will be gone like see as of now people are looking

02:42:31.870 --> 02:42:34.390
for someone who can build the entire system end-to-end test

02:42:34.390 --> 02:42:37.150
the entire system end-to-end write all the edge cases with

02:42:37.150 --> 02:42:41.350
the help of ai right and uh in industry i have seen that

02:42:41.350 --> 02:42:45.030
kind of people and yes that kind of people does exist now uh

02:42:45.030 --> 02:42:51.210
so testing is not a job okay so thank you for uh like for

02:42:51.210 --> 02:42:53.350
your suggestion sir we will reach out to each and everything

02:42:53.350 --> 02:42:57.170
we'll try to do complete within six months that i have tried

02:42:57.170 --> 02:43:01.710
yeah yeah yeah yeah uh sadiq is saying you are tolling at us

02:43:01.710 --> 02:43:05.470
see i'm talking about the reality uh maybe many of you will

02:43:05.470 --> 02:43:10.330
not agree with me uh for now but wait for one year you all

02:43:10.330 --> 02:43:16.490
will agree so i have a question sudhanshu yeah venkat please

02:43:16.490 --> 02:43:21.510
go ahead yeah uh i recently come across one term uh it says

02:43:21.510 --> 02:43:27.910
as ai journalist journalist I don't understand i just

02:43:27.910 --> 02:43:31.230
attended their demo session and I understand like no coding

02:43:31.230 --> 02:43:34.610
required just with the vibe coding tools and no further less

02:43:34.610 --> 02:43:38.530
Again not not true what exactly that yeah i have given the

02:43:38.530 --> 02:43:44.570
reason right so not exactly true what is that's the next you

02:43:44.570 --> 02:43:47.690
know they they claim that you know in the next decade would

02:43:47.690 --> 02:43:52.110
be with only the ai journalist and what exactly is that when

02:43:52.110 --> 02:43:54.570
I try to ask them they're going to want the AI journalist in

02:43:54.570 --> 02:43:58.810
terms of you are talking about the digital medium a print

02:43:58.810 --> 02:44:01.890
basically or you are talking about someone who delivers the

02:44:01.890 --> 02:44:06.950
news so which which mode you are talking about see multiple

02:44:07.410 --> 02:44:10.510
way to consume the news right so we read out the like

02:44:10.510 --> 02:44:13.890
headlines on our mobile devices or any other devices that is

02:44:13.890 --> 02:44:15.850
one way of consuming a news the other way of consuming a

02:44:15.850 --> 02:44:18.350
news is that someone is delivering it so which way you are

02:44:18.350 --> 02:44:21.630
talking about yeah the mustafa just mentioned that it's a

02:44:21.630 --> 02:44:25.570
journalist not not journalist like journalism okay so

02:44:25.570 --> 02:44:28.830
journalism like if i'll talk about a print so maybe even now

02:44:28.830 --> 02:44:32.630
most of the like lines or rephrases has been written by ai

02:44:32.630 --> 02:44:35.250
but yeah there is a human journalist who is giving a feed

02:44:35.250 --> 02:44:37.310
who is giving an input because they are capturing ground

02:44:37.310 --> 02:44:40.950
report right and without ground report what ai will do how

02:44:40.950 --> 02:44:43.790
we will be able to get the feed uh if i'll talk about maybe

02:44:43.790 --> 02:44:48.470
a real human delivering a news uh so yes people have tried a

02:44:48.470 --> 02:44:52.350
lots of ai anchors and i'm talking sorry to disturb you sir

02:44:52.350 --> 02:44:57.690
uh not journalism generalist ai generalist okay generalist

02:44:57.690 --> 02:45:02.710
means g e n e right yes sir exactly okay fine got it so i

02:45:02.710 --> 02:45:05.090
was talking about news anchor generalist right ai journalist

02:45:05.090 --> 02:45:09.810
see people have given a name called as vibe coding then this

02:45:09.810 --> 02:45:15.310
ai journalist then some like a new term you will be able to

02:45:15.310 --> 02:45:20.630
get tomorrow don't fall after those terms right so it's fine

02:45:20.630 --> 02:45:23.830
what is the meaning of ai journalist means anyone can like

02:45:23.830 --> 02:45:26.290
one single human will be able to do everything how it is

02:45:26.290 --> 02:45:30.130
possible right i i let's suppose i have a capability of ai

02:45:30.130 --> 02:45:32.470
but let's suppose i'm not a domain expert let's suppose i'm

02:45:32.470 --> 02:45:34.610
working into logistic i'm working into supply chain maybe

02:45:34.610 --> 02:45:37.750
i'm working into finance right i have to understand my

02:45:37.750 --> 02:45:39.630
customer i have to understand my ecosystem i have to

02:45:39.630 --> 02:45:41.210
understand the problem which i'm solving i have to

02:45:41.210 --> 02:45:45.850
understand my existing system right how i can generalize

02:45:45.850 --> 02:45:50.050
each and everything so uh yes influencers will be a

02:45:50.050 --> 02:45:56.070
generalist gen generalist right but uh in practical i don't

02:45:56.070 --> 02:46:00.750
think so you can't be expert in physics chemistry

02:46:00.750 --> 02:46:06.510
mathematics all the time right an aryan historian right yeah

02:46:06.510 --> 02:46:09.190
so same goes with ai there is nothing called as like a

02:46:09.190 --> 02:46:11.130
journalist yeah there will be some people who will give like

02:46:11.130 --> 02:46:13.470
uh some thoughts that okay this is how you can become but

02:46:13.470 --> 02:46:17.350
yeah i don't think like uh it's going anywhere closer to a

02:46:17.350 --> 02:46:25.890
reality and nowadays like there will be many problems we

02:46:25.890 --> 02:46:26.490
will be able to solve uh right so so on which are legal is

02:46:26.490 --> 02:46:27.190
how do you know there are different types what you know

02:46:27.190 --> 02:46:33.330
permitting what you know how to do that and then when do you

02:46:33.330 --> 02:46:33.750
develop for more people to use that right therefore the

02:46:33.750 --> 02:46:40.110
solution to the problem is okay there will be yes five years

02:46:40.110 --> 02:46:40.790
time anything or no hey it can happen in a week just just by

02:46:40.790 --> 02:46:44.550
d Ск do you think like a a person who is not an investor

02:46:44.550 --> 02:46:49.150
like actually i can get it it never happens like i'm

02:46:49.150 --> 02:46:50.090
sorry and we're just all about the internal question like

02:46:50.090 --> 02:46:53.530
everything and I will be available personally for you 24 by

02:46:53.530 --> 02:46:58.610
7 even in my sleep you can call me with that with that kind

02:46:58.610 --> 02:47:05.130
of money right sir so so I'm literally serious I'm literally

02:47:05.130 --> 02:47:09.490
serious about those three lakh rupees yeah I would I would I

02:47:09.490 --> 02:47:15.490
would love to charge yes sir only three lakh don't do it

02:47:15.490 --> 02:47:19.310
don't do it please don't do it yeah there are I know there

02:47:19.310 --> 02:47:21.730
are people who is trying to fool who is trying to create a

02:47:21.730 --> 02:47:26.350
FOMO out of you and they are like charging two lakhs three

02:47:26.350 --> 02:47:28.510
lakh and ultimately what they are teaching I'm like

02:47:28.510 --> 02:47:32.490
prompting okay I mean like who teaches a prompting it's a

02:47:32.490 --> 02:47:36.170
domain that we learn it's a like a product that we learn and

02:47:36.170 --> 02:47:38.670
vibe coding see I have taught you vibe coding today right

02:47:38.670 --> 02:47:40.550
and today itself we are able to create a beautiful website

02:47:40.550 --> 02:47:48.750
right a working one so this this is how easy it was I don't

02:47:48.750 --> 02:47:50.990
know like see we are living into that problem with the

02:47:50.990 --> 02:47:53.770
market is that we are living into influencer market there

02:47:53.770 --> 02:47:57.830
are a genuine people who never exaggerate a things but the

02:47:57.830 --> 02:48:00.350
problem with those people are you will never see those

02:48:00.350 --> 02:48:03.110
people on those platform because they will never go by viral

02:48:03.110 --> 02:48:05.450
they will never go viral believe me right people are not

02:48:05.450 --> 02:48:08.590
going to give a like thumbs up or share to them and there

02:48:08.590 --> 02:48:11.630
are people who will try to create unnecessary hype who will

02:48:11.630 --> 02:48:15.170
try to you know discover a new terms when they don't even

02:48:15.170 --> 02:48:17.690
know like what is the actual meaning of those terms but yeah

02:48:17.690 --> 02:48:19.150
they are just trying to go out and exaggerate and they are

02:48:19.170 --> 02:48:22.410
exaggerating and they have a big distribution and there will

02:48:22.410 --> 02:48:25.310
be again like a millions of people who will follow them who

02:48:25.310 --> 02:48:27.910
will like them and who will eventually pay them and then

02:48:27.910 --> 02:48:31.090
they will realize so basically you are paying three lakh to

02:48:31.090 --> 02:48:37.850
realize that you should not do it just to realize yeah

02:48:39.610 --> 02:48:44.630
why don't you start a college student easily pay eight lakh

02:48:44.630 --> 02:48:48.390
for just the see that is again justified see degree is

02:48:48.390 --> 02:48:51.090
something which is a culture right you'll. You go to a

02:48:51.090 --> 02:48:55.370
college then you will be a part of culture you build your

02:48:55.370 --> 02:49:00.190
own circle you spend four year I know curriculums are not up

02:49:00.190 --> 02:49:03.050
to mark it's a rote learning that we try to do in a college

02:49:03.050 --> 02:49:06.850
even in a school because from a government side this was

02:49:06.850 --> 02:49:10.390
something which should have been rectified a decade back

02:49:10.390 --> 02:49:15.670
it's not been done but still college holds a value holds a

02:49:15.670 --> 02:49:19.890
power right maybe very soon they will change a curriculum

02:49:19.890 --> 02:49:23.370
and which is. Pretty much required that they will change all

02:49:23.370 --> 02:49:25.890
the teachers they will try to modernize their entire

02:49:25.890 --> 02:49:28.670
infrastructure with some colleagues are able to do it

02:49:28.670 --> 02:49:31.070
majority I would say ninety nine percent they are not able

02:49:31.070 --> 02:49:34.870
to do it maybe we'll have to wait for one decade more but

02:49:34.870 --> 02:49:37.670
it's a culture for that you pay right it's a hostel you go

02:49:37.670 --> 02:49:40.790
there you pay it's an infrastructure you go there you pay in

02:49:40.790 --> 02:49:43.370
a digital learning if someone is teaching you how to do a

02:49:43.370 --> 02:49:45.470
vibe coding and you are paying three lakh four lakh rupees

02:49:45.470 --> 02:49:50.690
that doesn't make sense to me at least. Yeah. And that too

02:49:50.690 --> 02:49:52.550
they will give you even they are going to give you some

02:49:52.550 --> 02:49:55.810
certificate you can't go and get a job on that certificate

02:49:55.810 --> 02:49:58.990
but if college is giving you a certificate someone will

02:49:58.990 --> 02:50:02.490
validate that OK fine you have done a proper graduation so

02:50:02.490 --> 02:50:06.650
value wise value proportion is different in that eight lakh

02:50:06.650 --> 02:50:11.190
and then in other like three four like whatever it is. How

02:50:11.190 --> 02:50:14.590
do we spend time for the January daily forty five minute one

02:50:14.590 --> 02:50:18.370
hour is more than enough but yeah discipline. OK next one is

02:50:18.370 --> 02:50:23.150
Akhtar. Please go ahead with the question yeah actually I'm

02:50:23.150 --> 02:50:28.410
a RPA developer so I'm working from last three to four years

02:50:28.410 --> 02:50:33.790
in RPA so my question is that if I'm learning JNI then how

02:50:33.790 --> 02:50:38.990
can I utilize in RPA and if not let's let's let's learn then

02:50:38.990 --> 02:50:42.570
we'll figure it out yeah I'm damn sure that I will show you

02:50:42.570 --> 02:50:46.230
how to figure it out yeah if if it is not applicable in RPA

02:50:46.230 --> 02:50:51.450
then can I get job in JNI. Yeah. You will get a benefit of

02:50:51.450 --> 02:50:54.310
RPA I'll tell you I'll show you even right you will be able

02:50:54.310 --> 02:50:57.610
to actually get a benefit of RPA means your past plus JNI

02:50:57.610 --> 02:51:01.250
both because both are like pretty much I will say a little

02:51:01.250 --> 02:51:04.450
bit of like a correlation you will be able to find out OK

02:51:05.760 --> 02:51:11.320
and like especially in JNI can we get job without knowing a

02:51:11.320 --> 02:51:15.340
minute exactly yeah that opportunity is available but I

02:51:15.340 --> 02:51:18.640
always suggest that try to plan that in next one year. I

02:51:18.640 --> 02:51:20.780
will be aware of machine learning deep learning computer

02:51:20.780 --> 02:51:24.800
vision and NLP at least this four stack with algorithm and a

02:51:24.800 --> 02:51:27.900
practical for next one year you should target that's advice

02:51:27.900 --> 02:51:30.340
to every one of you everyone is literally every one of you

02:51:30.340 --> 02:51:35.640
yeah in next one year not now but you will be able to get

02:51:35.640 --> 02:51:38.360
opportunity but in next one year to get a better and better

02:51:38.360 --> 02:51:45.960
one sure OK yeah Mustafa please go ahead hi sir so basically

02:51:45.960 --> 02:51:50.000
my question is related to most of the you know career

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:53.460
opportunities nothing specific to this class that we are

02:51:53.460 --> 02:51:57.180
having so hope you are liking it liking the class yeah sir

02:51:57.180 --> 02:52:01.320
absolutely in fact I just wanted to you know catch up I mean

02:52:01.320 --> 02:52:04.400
do more but then I understand that we have a lot of variety

02:52:04.400 --> 02:52:07.460
of students so you have to take everyone it's it's fine see

02:52:07.460 --> 02:52:09.800
I will focus on every one of you I don't have any issue this

02:52:09.800 --> 02:52:13.480
is what I do so yeah feel free to like raise your question

02:52:13.480 --> 02:52:17.800
concern anything sure so basically you know I will give you

02:52:17.800 --> 02:52:19.600
a context about what you are talking about myself I work as

02:52:19.600 --> 02:52:23.660
a solutions engineer one of the AI based startup so it's

02:52:23.660 --> 02:52:27.100
just in a very short thing as you say no testing is going so

02:52:27.100 --> 02:52:31.500
our product itself is a you know agentic QA software that

02:52:31.500 --> 02:52:34.920
automatically understand creates test cases and you know

02:52:34.920 --> 02:52:37.600
create test data and even executes it you can integrate with

02:52:37.600 --> 02:52:41.020
CI CD so as a solutions engineer my role is somewhat in

02:52:41.020 --> 02:52:44.820
between business and technology I personally like technology

02:52:44.820 --> 02:52:49.780
so that's the reason I have taken your course but then what

02:52:49.780 --> 02:52:53.240
I think whatever I'm experiencing because we have developers

02:52:53.240 --> 02:52:56.020
I talk to them every day is that even though they are

02:52:56.020 --> 02:52:59.740
working on AI so one of the data scientists he has joined

02:52:59.740 --> 02:53:02.220
our organization couple of years back and but he is right

02:53:02.220 --> 02:53:05.780
now doing a core development of software development now

02:53:05.780 --> 02:53:08.980
other than integrating with RLMs and prompts and other

02:53:08.980 --> 02:53:11.860
agentic flows he is actually writing back-end codes as well

02:53:11.860 --> 02:53:15.100
with python so my concern is that I am not a from a computer

02:53:15.100 --> 02:53:17.000
science background I'm from a mechanical engineering

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:17.940
background I'm from a software engineering background but I

02:53:17.940 --> 02:53:21.020
entered into the software industry with the help of testing

02:53:21.020 --> 02:53:23.920
so I did testing for some time and then I moved to solutions

02:53:23.920 --> 02:53:27.320
engineer so I have three four years experience that's it but

02:53:27.320 --> 02:53:31.700
software development is like like very you know a different

02:53:31.700 --> 02:53:36.580
phase for me altogether having DSA and a system design and

02:53:36.580 --> 02:53:40.700
so on and so forth so what I want to ask from you is even if

02:53:40.700 --> 02:53:43.860
I learn these what you're telling me it's more like a

02:53:43.860 --> 02:53:47.120
implementation or straight-up implementation of LLM. and

02:53:47.120 --> 02:53:51.620
other AI based tools but in industry I think people would

02:53:51.620 --> 02:53:53.980
definitely require us to have code software development

02:53:53.980 --> 02:53:58.560
skills as well right okay I think I think we misunderstand

02:53:58.560 --> 02:54:01.620
the software development see software development today we

02:54:01.620 --> 02:54:05.060
have done one beside right so where you can go you can check

02:54:05.060 --> 02:54:07.480
the tickets and you can check the slots and you can try to

02:54:07.480 --> 02:54:10.440
book this entire IPL tickets this is called a software

02:54:10.440 --> 02:54:12.920
development right so where there will be front end there

02:54:12.920 --> 02:54:16.020
will be back end there will be a middleware right and then

02:54:16.020 --> 02:54:18.820
once you will club and combine each and everything hosted on

02:54:18.820 --> 02:54:20.760
a production on a scale that is called a software

02:54:20.760 --> 02:54:26.040
development simple right now so yes people get scared by

02:54:26.040 --> 02:54:29.720
system design and DSA now let me tell you one thing see in a

02:54:29.720 --> 02:54:33.000
system design let's suppose I am going to understand like a

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.560
client server client server architecture or maybe I am going

02:54:35.560 --> 02:54:37.620
to talk about a cap theorem consistency availability and

02:54:37.620 --> 02:54:41.300
partition tolerance right those or maybe I am going to talk

02:54:41.300 --> 02:54:45.540
about the distributed system. So those things will not come

02:54:45.540 --> 02:54:47.060
into a picture and never come into the picture. Whatever

02:54:47.060 --> 02:54:50.380
comes into a picture from a day zero right and obviously

02:54:50.380 --> 02:54:52.980
there will be an architect in your team so who must be aware

02:54:52.980 --> 02:54:55.640
about all of these things may be based on his experience his

02:54:55.640 --> 02:54:59.620
or her experience or maybe based on the exploration so it's

02:54:59.620 --> 02:55:03.580
not like from a day zero you need all of those knowledge yes

02:55:03.580 --> 02:55:07.240
in product development company why they try to focus on that

02:55:07.240 --> 02:55:10.180
part and it's a cult that people are following since a

02:55:10.180 --> 02:55:14.440
couple of like a decade which is changing now but yes it's a

02:55:14.440 --> 02:55:17.780
trend that everyone is like trying to focus. Because they

02:55:17.780 --> 02:55:21.400
try to apply a filtration criteria see you are not going to

02:55:21.400 --> 02:55:25.000
like use a Dijkstra algorithm Kruskal algorithm BFS DFS or

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:28.360
Red Black tree right directly in any product obviously there

02:55:28.360 --> 02:55:30.620
is a use case of all of these things we have been using it

02:55:30.620 --> 02:55:33.520
in a multiple cases but it's a filtration criteria it's more

02:55:33.520 --> 02:55:36.760
like a filtration criteria on a day zero that people are

02:55:36.760 --> 02:55:40.320
people try to apply so that I will hire only this category

02:55:40.320 --> 02:55:44.000
of the people at this mindset of the people who are more

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:46.680
logical. Because the thing that that if you can solve a

02:55:46.680 --> 02:55:50.780
problem. A DSA technically a mathematical problem or

02:55:50.780 --> 02:55:55.180
something like that you are more filtered candidate you are

02:55:55.180 --> 02:55:58.660
more intelligent as compared to someone else even someone

02:55:58.660 --> 02:56:01.540
else that I am trying to say they are doing a software

02:56:01.540 --> 02:56:04.840
development the one who is like in a Google or Facebook they

02:56:04.840 --> 02:56:07.980
are also doing a software development right but yes label is

02:56:07.980 --> 02:56:10.060
different obviously the software which Google Facebook and

02:56:10.060 --> 02:56:12.020
all these companies used to build is different and the

02:56:12.020 --> 02:56:14.520
software that we are building is different but yes both

02:56:14.520 --> 02:56:17.480
coexist both coexisted systematically. These last multiple

02:56:17.480 --> 02:56:20.420
decades and both will coexist even for a next generation see

02:56:20.420 --> 02:56:23.180
there are people who have who is building cursor right the

02:56:23.180 --> 02:56:26.800
cursor where like we are able to create a software right and

02:56:26.800 --> 02:56:28.640
still there are some people who is trying to create a

02:56:28.640 --> 02:56:31.140
portfolio beside or maybe they are trying to solve some of

02:56:31.140 --> 02:56:34.200
the payment gateway problem or something like that yeah so

02:56:34.200 --> 02:56:37.340
both kind of a people see the people who are building a

02:56:37.340 --> 02:56:41.380
cursor right obviously like they know a lot they have a lot

02:56:41.380 --> 02:56:43.740
of experience they are way more intelligent they have solved

02:56:43.740 --> 02:56:45.720
so many problems then only they are able to reach out even

02:56:45.720 --> 02:56:49.800
they are human yeah. So both kind of a people have existed

02:56:49.800 --> 02:56:55.000
till now and it will be relevant even in a future now you

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:59.060
have to decide as an individual that what I want for my life

02:56:59.060 --> 02:57:04.520
in next one year in next five years okay and then try to

02:57:04.520 --> 02:57:07.300
pursue right don't see someone and say that okay fine so he

02:57:07.300 --> 02:57:10.420
said this no everyone is having its own journey as simple as

02:57:10.420 --> 02:57:13.000
that so let's suppose you are targeting that okay in next

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:17.480
six month JNI let's do it right in next one year. So you are

02:57:17.480 --> 02:57:17.480
targeting that okay fine I will build four to five all the

02:57:17.480 --> 02:57:20.540
stack and again I am not saying that keep on learning no not

02:57:20.540 --> 02:57:23.620
at all make it make it as a part of your life right daily

02:57:23.620 --> 02:57:26.260
one hour daily one and a half hour simple and believe me it

02:57:26.260 --> 02:57:28.880
will be done in a more comfortable way right you don't have

02:57:28.880 --> 02:57:31.440
to even like you will not feel like learning something right

02:57:31.440 --> 02:57:33.620
you will literally enjoy in that way if you are going yeah

02:57:33.620 --> 02:57:35.680
if you are sitting for 10 hour and say I am learning then

02:57:35.680 --> 02:57:38.920
you are learning otherwise make it like reading a books

02:57:38.920 --> 02:57:43.880
reading a book good philosophy book you can say so next year

02:57:43.880 --> 02:57:47.320
maybe target that okay fine. I will build 4 to 5 a good

02:57:47.320 --> 02:57:51.280
standard product right maybe I will build a streaming system

02:57:51.280 --> 02:57:54.040
which is again one of the complex system right maybe I will

02:57:54.040 --> 02:57:56.840
try to build one of the betting system right maybe I will

02:57:56.840 --> 02:57:59.540
try to build one of the games basically with a lot of so

02:57:59.540 --> 02:58:03.080
many rules so try to build such kind of a system one by one

02:58:03.080 --> 02:58:05.660
with the help of AI with the help of copy paste of code no

02:58:05.660 --> 02:58:08.820
one cares no one cares literally right so try to build it

02:58:08.820 --> 02:58:11.080
and then you will get more and more experience so this is

02:58:11.080 --> 02:58:14.460
how we all used to evolve in our career. This is what we all

02:58:14.460 --> 02:58:17.660
have evolved it and person who is working in a Google so

02:58:17.660 --> 02:58:22.080
when that person has born and brought up basically it's not

02:58:22.080 --> 02:58:24.300
like he was aware about or she was aware about DSA and

02:58:24.300 --> 02:58:27.720
system design or something like that right it just see

02:58:27.720 --> 02:58:30.620
majority of things that we are discussing even now right

02:58:30.620 --> 02:58:33.340
majority of things is been created as a hype by a

02:58:33.340 --> 02:58:40.140
influencer. Yeah sir one more last question is so now that

02:58:40.140 --> 02:58:44.520
we are learning it I want to tell about myself I cannot talk

02:58:44.520 --> 02:58:47.760
about others but I am personally interested and I follow

02:58:47.760 --> 02:58:51.280
news and AI and also it's sort of you know maybe I have a

02:58:51.280 --> 02:58:55.400
shiny object syndrome but then I want a clear vision in

02:58:55.400 --> 02:58:58.820
terms of AI maybe there are so many different work you know

02:58:58.820 --> 02:59:03.880
designations roles and so on if I don't have a specific goal

02:59:03.880 --> 02:59:08.640
I think I might stray away or I might spend time in some

02:59:08.640 --> 02:59:12.400
other task which might not be really efficient in my goal so

02:59:12.400 --> 02:59:15.060
to finalize that goal. I want to know how many types of

02:59:15.060 --> 02:59:19.540
roles are there in AI and maybe not immediately right now

02:59:19.540 --> 02:59:21.720
you don't need to answer but somewhere in the down the line.

02:59:21.800 --> 02:59:24.080
No no I can answer now itself so you can just go and join as

02:59:24.080 --> 02:59:26.700
a GNI engineer you can join as a ML engineer you can join as

02:59:26.700 --> 02:59:29.840
a DL engineer you can join as a vision engineer you can join

02:59:29.840 --> 02:59:32.900
as a core NLP engineer you can join as a research engineer

02:59:32.900 --> 02:59:36.920
you can join as a mathematician you can join as a data

02:59:36.920 --> 02:59:41.700
scientist on a junior senior managerial lead director and

02:59:41.700 --> 02:59:45.880
architect level. A follow-up question on that is don't you

02:59:45.880 --> 02:59:48.460
think that people who are hiring for these roles would

02:59:48.460 --> 02:59:51.720
prefer somebody having a computer science background or STA

02:59:51.720 --> 02:59:55.120
background. Not at all in IT industry itself 95% people are

02:59:55.120 --> 02:59:58.840
from non-computer science background. Yeah that is true but

02:59:58.840 --> 02:59:59.700
they are all in testing.

03:00:02.640 --> 03:00:07.900
Who told you they are in testing? Just go and talk around

03:00:07.900 --> 03:00:10.600
people who are actually developing the product majority of

03:00:10.600 --> 03:00:13.080
them are coming from like a ECU. ECU background, triple E

03:00:13.080 --> 03:00:14.680
background or some other background civil background

03:00:14.680 --> 03:00:17.440
mechanical background right and those civil guys are writing

03:00:17.440 --> 03:00:19.960
better code than the computer guy the person who is coming

03:00:19.960 --> 03:00:23.240
from the computer and background okay so it's it's not about

03:00:23.240 --> 03:00:26.320
like a background I would say because whatever you know

03:00:26.320 --> 03:00:29.120
especially I'll say in an Indian education system till

03:00:29.120 --> 03:00:32.880
graduation so whatever we learn it's a total piece of shit

03:00:32.880 --> 03:00:36.620
it's a total wastage of time whatever we learn right so till

03:00:36.620 --> 03:00:38.600
10th and 12th so we try to learn like a math physics

03:00:38.600 --> 03:00:41.440
chemistry geography biology all of those things I never was

03:00:41.440 --> 03:00:44.680
able to understand why right and then like we used to like a

03:00:44.680 --> 03:00:47.260
come to a graduation where we learn a 48 paper six into

03:00:47.260 --> 03:00:51.300
eight right eight semester six paper per semester and apart

03:00:51.300 --> 03:00:53.200
from that practical so I have not added the practical side

03:00:53.200 --> 03:00:57.040
of it and 48 papers and do you remember any law from

03:00:57.040 --> 03:01:01.060
thermodynamics? I just remember the name of the

03:01:01.060 --> 03:01:05.260
thermodynamics. Just the name right yeah do you remember

03:01:05.260 --> 03:01:09.520
which book you have followed in thermodynamics? No I just

03:01:09.520 --> 03:01:11.980
remember let us see what's in those books. Exactly. Exactly.

03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:14.260
We all have gone to thermodynamics in our first semester

03:01:14.260 --> 03:01:17.200
doesn't matter which branch we were into. Two semesters.

03:01:18.080 --> 03:01:20.800
Exactly right that's the problem with the education system

03:01:20.800 --> 03:01:25.200
so we used to invest energy and time in some like a in some

03:01:25.200 --> 03:01:28.680
of these things a majority of time right time where we as a

03:01:28.680 --> 03:01:32.120
human being are very very energetic a person in the age of

03:01:32.120 --> 03:01:35.760
20 22 24 are very very energetic and you can't expect the

03:01:35.760 --> 03:01:39.680
same kind of energy from a 40 year old right yeah they feel

03:01:39.680 --> 03:01:42.800
burnt out. But yeah so when we were like too much energetic

03:01:42.800 --> 03:01:46.060
at that point of time we were exploring 48 different

03:01:46.060 --> 03:01:49.960
different subject and today when you come to this year and

03:01:49.960 --> 03:01:52.540
out of the college you realize that I don't even remember

03:01:52.540 --> 03:01:55.440
the name of the books and not even a single formula. Do you

03:01:55.440 --> 03:02:00.280
remember Archimedes principle a buoyancy principle? Buoyancy

03:02:00.280 --> 03:02:05.820
yes I remember. What was that? So the amount of volume

03:02:05.820 --> 03:02:09.380
displaced by an object inside a waterway is equal to the

03:02:09.380 --> 03:02:10.340
four sixth principle. So what is the number of times that

03:02:10.340 --> 03:02:14.180
you have experienced by against the gravity? I guess it's

03:02:14.180 --> 03:02:19.620
like. Only 90% correct. Only 90% correct. There are 10%

03:02:19.620 --> 03:02:22.780
mistake. Right. So see that is that is the reality of the

03:02:22.780 --> 03:02:27.260
education system we are living into. Right. And so I will

03:02:27.260 --> 03:02:30.260
say it's not about the background of the branch. It's all

03:02:30.260 --> 03:02:34.040
about that when you have started because majority of people

03:02:34.040 --> 03:02:36.280
who are writing a code right they have started writing a

03:02:36.280 --> 03:02:38.960
code at least in Indian culture right not in a US not in a

03:02:38.960 --> 03:02:40.460
UK culture. Because there they are writing a code since

03:02:40.460 --> 03:02:43.640
childhood. Especially in Indian culture we have started

03:02:43.640 --> 03:02:46.660
writing a code a real one after our graduation and maybe

03:02:46.660 --> 03:02:49.500
after graduation even after like two three year after that.

03:02:49.840 --> 03:02:53.080
Exactly. Right. That's a big problem. That's a big problem.

03:02:53.160 --> 03:02:57.080
But yeah we can't solve it as an individual. But yeah that

03:02:57.080 --> 03:02:59.140
problem exists and this is not the same culture that we

03:02:59.140 --> 03:03:04.300
follow outside. Yeah that's it sir I think. But I would

03:03:04.300 --> 03:03:06.960
suggest that if here and there you can add some more

03:03:06.960 --> 03:03:09.940
practical insights about your. Maybe students who have

03:03:09.940 --> 03:03:14.400
already gotten out from your own something from some

03:03:14.400 --> 03:03:18.360
industry level experience that what they have felt or what

03:03:18.360 --> 03:03:21.800
they have experienced I think that might add more knowledge

03:03:21.800 --> 03:03:24.260
because we are having very. I think there are enough people

03:03:24.260 --> 03:03:28.600
in your group so you can chat to them and. Yeah. That's the

03:03:28.600 --> 03:03:31.380
reason we have a WhatsApp group right. Sure. Definitely. And

03:03:31.380 --> 03:03:34.620
hope all of you are enjoying this conversation guys. Believe

03:03:34.620 --> 03:03:38.640
me in all the doubt you all will enjoy. Yeah. It will be

03:03:38.640 --> 03:03:42.180
fun. It will be like a mind relaxing for all of you. And yes

03:03:42.180 --> 03:03:44.440
it will be like look like a podcast for you. So every day a

03:03:44.440 --> 03:03:47.440
Saturday Sunday podcast after two hour but after my lecture

03:03:47.440 --> 03:03:51.440
I'll never do this kind of podcast during my lecture. Never

03:03:51.440 --> 03:03:52.180
means literally never.

03:03:55.100 --> 03:03:59.140
Okay. So Mace please go ahead with your question. After that

03:03:59.140 --> 03:04:03.900
Aakash or someone who was. Aswini. Yeah. Aswini can go. Are

03:04:03.900 --> 03:04:06.260
you able to hear me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I can. I can hear you

03:04:06.260 --> 03:04:09.480
so much. Thank you. So I have a couple of questions. So

03:04:09.480 --> 03:04:15.140
basically the one I guess this on the class itself it was

03:04:15.140 --> 03:04:20.360
going pretty far. So so when you generated the code in the

03:04:20.360 --> 03:04:27.780
cursor and how you ran it in the Firebase to display as a

03:04:27.780 --> 03:04:31.360
web page. Can you. No. I never run. I never ran that in

03:04:31.360 --> 03:04:35.920
Firebase actually. So basically see when I have executed in

03:04:35.920 --> 03:04:40.060
cursor so it is giving me a end point my local host right.

03:04:40.200 --> 03:04:43.240
Firebase was online right. See at the end of the day I have

03:04:43.240 --> 03:04:46.440
just asked it to execute it and show me the final give me

03:04:46.440 --> 03:04:48.960
the final port. So basically it has given you my local host

03:04:48.960 --> 03:04:51.860
3000 as you can see it's still it's running. So this is my

03:04:51.860 --> 03:04:54.980
local host not a Firebase not a global system. Right. See

03:04:54.980 --> 03:05:00.300
I'm running in my local this one. Okay. Okay. So after after

03:05:00.300 --> 03:05:03.880
the code got generated you have asked. Yeah. I have asked to

03:05:03.880 --> 03:05:06.300
like a test it. I have asked to test it debug it and then

03:05:06.300 --> 03:05:09.700
like a deploy like a launch it basically. So it has launched

03:05:09.700 --> 03:05:13.400
npm run launch command is simple it was a npm run and npm

03:05:13.400 --> 03:05:17.080
build. So it has launched it on 3000 port simple. Okay.

03:05:17.180 --> 03:05:20.140
Okay. We'll do it. We'll do it in a class so many times. But

03:05:20.140 --> 03:05:23.180
I know these things are like pretty much new for most of us

03:05:23.180 --> 03:05:25.920
but yeah we'll do it. We'll do a lot. And in in this cursor

03:05:25.920 --> 03:05:30.200
like initially as per the initial prompt you have given like

03:05:30.200 --> 03:05:33.900
you want to change it. You want to generate the whole code

03:05:33.900 --> 03:05:36.720
in a python language and everything but it still gave you in

03:05:36.720 --> 03:05:41.400
a node js format. So. No I so I have I have done that over

03:05:41.400 --> 03:05:44.020
there. So when I was generating the entire prompt right. So

03:05:44.020 --> 03:05:46.380
at that point of time. So see if if you will observe my

03:05:46.380 --> 03:05:49.020
prompt over here I have not even mentioned my technology

03:05:49.020 --> 03:05:52.580
stack. So by default it has selected a mono stack. Okay. So

03:05:52.580 --> 03:05:55.440
I have done that when I was chatting with a URI not here not

03:05:55.440 --> 03:05:58.360
so nowhere I have mentioned the technology stack by the way

03:05:58.360 --> 03:06:01.100
if I would have mentioned that that use python for a back

03:06:01.100 --> 03:06:03.360
end use this particular databases and use this this this

03:06:03.360 --> 03:06:08.160
then it would have selected only that one. Okay. Okay. Got

03:06:08.160 --> 03:06:13.880
it. Got it. And one basic question. See when we are using vs

03:06:13.880 --> 03:06:19.060
code or the cursor. So while typing in the prompt you can

03:06:19.060 --> 03:06:23.080
see there is a model and the agent the configure mode. Okay.

03:06:23.420 --> 03:06:26.740
Because yesterday someone asked me the question what is the

03:06:26.740 --> 03:06:29.160
basically difference between the ask agent and the model.

03:06:29.260 --> 03:06:33.280
Because. When when we are normally asking any question and

03:06:33.280 --> 03:06:36.640
we have to particularly select if if there is suppose there

03:06:36.640 --> 03:06:40.720
is no auto mode or something we have to select a model. So.

03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:43.440
But still it will call the agent see even in auto mode

03:06:43.440 --> 03:06:47.800
agents are nothing but a piece of program right. So for

03:06:47.800 --> 03:06:51.680
example if I will go here and let's suppose if I am going to

03:06:51.680 --> 03:06:56.320
write one like a piece of the code for example that def.

03:06:59.960 --> 03:07:04.910
Elaborate elaborate kind of a function so where it is going

03:07:04.910 --> 03:07:11.130
to take my like a text as a input and then here so it should

03:07:11.130 --> 03:07:16.110
take maybe like a something let me convert this one itself.

03:07:16.590 --> 03:07:20.490
So let's suppose this is a generic completion right. So I'll

03:07:20.490 --> 03:07:26.940
copy the same code. I'll just change it. Change it. And.

03:07:27.060 --> 03:07:27.620
Here.

03:07:33.650 --> 03:07:41.420
Elaborate. And then here. So give me a related

03:07:44.010 --> 03:07:48.650
prompt for all the input input

03:07:50.350 --> 03:07:58.650
and then the input is going to be text. I'm going to convert

03:07:58.650 --> 03:08:04.750
that into a text txt text and formatted string over here. OK

03:08:04.750 --> 03:08:07.110
it will be able to see I have just changed this function so

03:08:07.110 --> 03:08:10.190
I'm just trying to give like I've made it as an input. And

03:08:10.190 --> 03:08:13.450
then I'm saying that that I'm giving a prompt that OK so

03:08:13.450 --> 03:08:15.990
give me a liberated prompt for all the input means whatever

03:08:15.990 --> 03:08:18.870
input I'm going to give it will hit my model night it will

03:08:18.870 --> 03:08:21.230
hit my model basically so which is technically hitting my

03:08:21.230 --> 03:08:24.510
like this particular model GPT four dot one nano model and

03:08:24.510 --> 03:08:27.110
it is going to give me the elaborate response. So this is a

03:08:27.110 --> 03:08:29.170
function I have created. Now let me call this function

03:08:29.170 --> 03:08:35.570
elaborate and then here so I'm going to like maybe I'm going

03:08:35.570 --> 03:08:37.970
to provide this

03:08:40.340 --> 03:08:43.560
one. Let's suppose. Right. This one I'm going to provide. So

03:08:43.560 --> 03:08:46.460
it's a multi line. So let me change it to the multi line.

03:08:47.340 --> 03:08:50.560
Yeah. So I'm going to call this one with this input. Same

03:08:50.560 --> 03:08:52.580
thing we have given inside the cursor. And here is a

03:08:52.580 --> 03:08:54.800
command. Now this command will go into that. This is this

03:08:54.800 --> 03:08:59.360
will go into the elements basically now. So it will do what.

03:08:59.560 --> 03:09:03.360
So technically it will try to elaborate this entire input

03:09:03.360 --> 03:09:06.700
point. Now what is my model. My model is this one. What is

03:09:06.700 --> 03:09:10.240
my agent. So you can say that that this function is behaving

03:09:10.240 --> 03:09:13.380
like an agent. So I have written this function for a

03:09:13.380 --> 03:09:18.280
specific purpose. Ready my point. So inside a cursor when I

03:09:18.280 --> 03:09:20.380
say there is an agent. So there are multiple agent system

03:09:20.380 --> 03:09:22.920
they are using it. So some agent which will do a research

03:09:22.920 --> 03:09:25.420
some agent which will do a search some agent which will try

03:09:25.420 --> 03:09:28.360
to invoke your basically a terminal some agent which will

03:09:28.360 --> 03:09:31.780
try to test your code it will try to fix or it will try to

03:09:31.780 --> 03:09:33.660
generate the next version of the code a fixed code

03:09:33.660 --> 03:09:37.280
elaborated one. So some agent which will try to elaborate

03:09:37.280 --> 03:09:40.460
the input that you have given the way like a combination of

03:09:40.460 --> 03:09:44.200
the model and the agent. So basically agent will not be able

03:09:44.200 --> 03:09:48.480
to work without our LLM access. So that's the reason we say

03:09:48.480 --> 03:09:51.320
agent TKI system right and even in our classes. So we are

03:09:51.320 --> 03:09:53.820
going to talk about Langchain Lama indexes. Eventually what

03:09:53.820 --> 03:09:57.300
we'll do we'll create a multiple agents right and those

03:09:57.300 --> 03:10:00.280
agents will be having an access of API through API key they

03:10:00.280 --> 03:10:02.640
will be able to access a different different kind of a model

03:10:02.640 --> 03:10:07.580
right. Same like this one see I have used a model. So model

03:10:07.580 --> 03:10:10.860
is one part. Model is basically a LLM. Which understands the

03:10:10.860 --> 03:10:13.060
entire world and it understands your natural language as

03:10:13.060 --> 03:10:16.140
well. So whatever like an English text or any language you

03:10:16.140 --> 03:10:18.960
are going to write down now agent is nothing but I have just

03:10:18.960 --> 03:10:23.260
configured this one for a specific task that it will do what

03:10:23.260 --> 03:10:27.080
it will always elaborate yes if I'm going to say do

03:10:27.080 --> 03:10:29.540
something different maybe do a real time search whatever

03:10:29.540 --> 03:10:33.220
input I'm going to give you I'll just say that that do

03:10:33.220 --> 03:10:36.640
always a real time research. Now this agent if this kind of

03:10:36.640 --> 03:10:38.820
agent I can say that okay fine so create this kind of an

03:10:38.820 --> 03:10:44.040
image for me. This flavor so agents are eventually a kind of

03:10:44.040 --> 03:10:46.180
a function as of now just try to understand when we'll

03:10:46.180 --> 03:10:49.640
create we'll get more into depth. So agent is a kind of just

03:10:49.640 --> 03:10:53.260
a system so you should do something on their own going

03:10:53.260 --> 03:10:55.380
forward I'll try to even add couple of more things with

03:10:55.380 --> 03:10:57.840
respect to agent that agents can take a decision

03:10:57.840 --> 03:11:00.760
automatically as of now it's a very linear decision only one

03:11:00.760 --> 03:11:03.200
kind of a things it has to do right but let's suppose I have

03:11:03.200 --> 03:11:05.060
to do multiple things an agent is supposed to decide

03:11:05.060 --> 03:11:07.420
automatically that out of this 10 things what I am supposed

03:11:07.420 --> 03:11:11.580
to do okay so agent will be able to do. That as well which

03:11:11.580 --> 03:11:14.860
I'll add but as of now just try to understand that it's just

03:11:14.860 --> 03:11:17.820
a function which is trying to invoke your models simple so

03:11:17.820 --> 03:11:23.240
cursor is doing the exact same thing. And thanks for that

03:11:23.240 --> 03:11:30.620
one final question so see when the cursor is generating such

03:11:30.620 --> 03:11:35.160
a huge code base okay so it is a developer responsibility to

03:11:35.160 --> 03:11:38.100
go through all the security checks because anyway it will be

03:11:38.100 --> 03:11:40.920
doing. But suppose your company is. The government might be

03:11:40.920 --> 03:11:45.340
different so for any case of hallucination or some details

03:11:45.340 --> 03:11:48.540
you need to check from our end or that also can be given in

03:11:48.540 --> 03:11:51.620
the prompt. You can try to give anything in a prompt

03:11:51.620 --> 03:11:55.060
whatever comes in your mind but yes you have to follow all

03:11:55.060 --> 03:11:58.880
the SOPs or all the standard approach that your company is

03:11:58.880 --> 03:12:01.700
going to define or that your client is looking for always.

03:12:02.240 --> 03:12:05.700
So you can do it with the help of prompt or maybe you can do

03:12:05.700 --> 03:12:08.420
it manually but you'll have to do it and we have as far as

03:12:08.420 --> 03:12:10.900
prompting is concerned. So you can give a prompt. Basically.

03:12:12.060 --> 03:12:18.300
Okay. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Yes. So next

03:12:18.300 --> 03:12:23.750
one is a Sweeney. Please go to the question. Hello. Yes.

03:12:23.770 --> 03:12:27.370
Really. Hi sir. Good morning. Yeah. Good morning. I have

03:12:27.370 --> 03:12:31.490
some question on rags or just I'm building one. I'm working

03:12:31.490 --> 03:12:35.110
on problem statement and in the rag. I just want to know

03:12:35.110 --> 03:12:38.490
that embedding while doing the embedding for vector

03:12:38.490 --> 03:12:41.970
database. Is it important to choose some. I'm working on

03:12:41.970 --> 03:12:42.410
problem statement and in the rag. You can go with a model

03:12:42.410 --> 03:12:46.670
like GPT or we can go with the open source. You can go with

03:12:46.670 --> 03:12:48.570
open source in a hugging face. There are tons of models.

03:12:48.810 --> 03:12:50.770
Thousands of models are available for embeddings. You can go

03:12:50.770 --> 03:12:53.770
with any models, but yeah. So if you are look, see embedding

03:12:53.770 --> 03:12:56.210
means what you are converting some sentences into a vector

03:12:56.210 --> 03:12:58.330
replacement into a numeric, but that is not the only

03:12:58.330 --> 03:13:01.390
meaning, right? Uh, if I'm using a better model, so better

03:13:01.390 --> 03:13:03.930
model simply means that it has been trained on a lot of

03:13:03.930 --> 03:13:06.650
data, right? So it understands your grammatical, it

03:13:06.650 --> 03:13:08.930
understand your phrasing, it understand the parsing, it

03:13:08.930 --> 03:13:11.010
understand the punctuation and relationship between those

03:13:11.010 --> 03:13:15.310
words. Right. Uh, those tokens better way. So it's always

03:13:15.310 --> 03:13:18.470
better to go with the best of best model. Then only you will

03:13:18.470 --> 03:13:20.950
be able to build up better embedding. If you're going with

03:13:20.950 --> 03:13:24.130
the basic one, obviously it can generate a black, a

03:13:24.130 --> 03:13:28.150
numerical space, but just generating something into a

03:13:28.150 --> 03:13:30.650
numerical space is not that don't just a requirement, right?

03:13:31.650 --> 03:13:34.750
Right. So that's the reason, but yeah, options are like

03:13:34.750 --> 03:13:38.770
thousands on hugging face. So I have a huge amount of data,

03:13:38.890 --> 03:13:41.890
so I can not go with a free source. That's the reason I'm

03:13:41.890 --> 03:13:45.770
using, uh, some paid services for embedding. So I just want

03:13:45.770 --> 03:13:48.690
to know one more thing that embedding directly affect the

03:13:48.690 --> 03:13:52.210
response, right? Embedding is one of the factor which will

03:13:52.210 --> 03:13:57.890
affect the matching a similarity search basically. Okay. So

03:13:57.890 --> 03:14:01.390
what are the factors we have to check like, uh, for the

03:14:01.390 --> 03:14:05.630
context overlapping, you have to check basically embedding

03:14:05.630 --> 03:14:09.150
the input dimension that you try to provide. So that is

03:14:09.150 --> 03:14:12.130
again going to factor. A lot, the similarity, such algorithm

03:14:12.130 --> 03:14:14.270
that it is using. So whether it's using a Hammington

03:14:14.270 --> 03:14:17.290
distance or it is using a cosine similarity, again, uh, that

03:14:17.290 --> 03:14:21.870
matter. So there are like 10, 12 factor, I can name it like,

03:14:21.950 --> 03:14:26.930
okay, so, so, uh, so prompt engineering, whatever the prompt

03:14:26.930 --> 03:14:30.630
we are, uh, we are using for the response that also affect

03:14:30.630 --> 03:14:33.790
the response, right? So obviously it is going to affect

03:14:33.790 --> 03:14:36.230
because prompt itself will get converted to a vector and it

03:14:36.230 --> 03:14:39.030
will go for the matching, right? Which is available into

03:14:39.030 --> 03:14:42.330
your databases. Okay. Vector DB basically, right? So prompt

03:14:42.330 --> 03:14:45.930
is one of the factor, but before that, when we create an

03:14:45.930 --> 03:14:48.990
embedding, uh, again, many factors comes into picture even

03:14:48.990 --> 03:14:53.910
before prompting. Prompt is always a factor even with

03:14:53.910 --> 03:14:59.270
chatting. Okay sir, you told right before creating the

03:14:59.270 --> 03:15:01.810
embedding, some factor effects. So will you brief me that

03:15:01.810 --> 03:15:06.030
thing? Come to the RAG class. I'll explain it to you. Yep.

03:15:06.990 --> 03:15:10.410
We, we have RAG class in this one itself. Like I said. So,

03:15:10.410 --> 03:15:13.510
I've seen that, sir. I seen that video. That's the reason I

03:15:13.510 --> 03:15:17.430
asked. No. So come to this one as well, live lecture, even

03:15:17.430 --> 03:15:21.650
in this curriculum, I have mentioned RAG. Okay, sir. Thank

03:15:21.650 --> 03:15:25.590
you, sir. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Next one, please. Uh, Sivam,

03:15:25.650 --> 03:15:26.190
please go ahead.

03:15:34.630 --> 03:15:37.370
Yeah. So next one, Prakash, Nihal. And now I think anyone

03:15:37.370 --> 03:15:44.950
can go. Yeah. Yeah. Hi, Prakash. Yeah. So first, uh, I have

03:15:44.950 --> 03:15:47.830
two questions. So first question is like, uh, I signed a

03:15:47.830 --> 03:15:49.230
document. So I have an assignment today only after 10 o

03:15:49.230 --> 03:15:52.770
'clock. Okay. So I haven't noticed, uh, this, uh, course

03:15:52.770 --> 03:15:56.650
lunch previously. So suddenly I joined today. Okay. And the

03:15:56.650 --> 03:16:01.270
reason why I joined this course, uh, uh, I was a part of

03:16:01.270 --> 03:16:07.330
iNeuron, uh, data science course in 2020. Okay. Sorry, 2021.

03:16:07.570 --> 03:16:12.690
At the time I, uh, joined KPMG. Uh, so due to some reasons

03:16:12.690 --> 03:16:15.910
after three months, I'm not able to continue. Mm-hmm . So I

03:16:15.910 --> 03:16:20.890
just add some basics of MLM. and uh few other things 36

03:16:20.890 --> 03:16:25.310
model kind of thing okay now i am currently working with

03:16:25.310 --> 03:16:28.750
kpmg and i am trying to build some data system kind of thing

03:16:28.750 --> 03:16:34.430
so just i wanted to explore more into the genii things so

03:16:34.430 --> 03:16:38.370
that is the reason i mainly joined this course and uh so

03:16:38.370 --> 03:16:42.230
first of all uh what are the things i need to do uh from

03:16:42.230 --> 03:16:45.230
yesterday like today nothing yesterday yesterday we just had

03:16:45.230 --> 03:16:47.990
a platform demo right and as you are the old one so you know

03:16:47.990 --> 03:16:52.250
that uh on a very first day i just give a intro uh right and

03:16:52.250 --> 03:16:54.750
we do a chat a lot and then from today onwards i have

03:16:54.750 --> 03:16:57.830
started a curriculum a basic one basically like a system

03:16:57.830 --> 03:17:01.030
setup and everything so so far nothing it's fine like uh

03:17:01.030 --> 03:17:06.750
nothing you have to do from your end okay okay yes so uh the

03:17:06.750 --> 03:17:10.290
industry level like uh so since i'm working in kpmg so there

03:17:10.290 --> 03:17:13.310
is a lot of things coming into the picture like uh everyone

03:17:13.310 --> 03:17:17.790
trying to explore in the things but it is kind of uh just in

03:17:17.790 --> 03:17:22.150
terms of words like uh we are trying to do a lot more into

03:17:22.150 --> 03:17:25.510
the kind of chat assistant things like we are having our own

03:17:25.510 --> 03:17:28.130
we'll build a lot we'll build it don't worry we'll try to

03:17:28.130 --> 03:17:32.690
build it i don't believe in exploration so build it okay

03:17:32.690 --> 03:17:37.290
okay okay yeah thank you okay yeah so pushkar amir go ahead

03:17:37.290 --> 03:17:44.190
anyone any anyone yes uh hello yeah hi yes go ahead what

03:17:44.190 --> 03:17:47.990
what do you think uh how many years this general last one

03:17:47.990 --> 03:17:55.850
sorry how many year this general will what we say last for i

03:17:55.850 --> 03:18:02.350
don't know how many like uh years it will last long but i i

03:18:02.350 --> 03:18:05.590
believe ai is going to evolve more and more and even after

03:18:05.590 --> 03:18:09.930
10 year uh ai will keep on evolving uh the trend i have seen

03:18:09.930 --> 03:18:13.830
in last like a 11 year of my career so i have started uh

03:18:13.830 --> 03:18:17.950
like as a sap guy then data guy and then like uh as a uh

03:18:17.950 --> 03:18:21.570
data science guy uh i think six seven seven years back and

03:18:21.570 --> 03:18:24.870
yeah since then i'm teaching i've seen a lot like uh or at

03:18:24.870 --> 03:18:27.370
that point of time a was not that popular we used like a

03:18:27.370 --> 03:18:30.610
user statistical model mathematical model we used to build a

03:18:30.610 --> 03:18:33.610
lot and then computer vision came into a picture so keeping

03:18:33.610 --> 03:18:38.210
current trend in our mind uh i don't know whether gen ai as

03:18:38.210 --> 03:18:41.310
a position will be available or not but ai will exist for

03:18:41.310 --> 03:18:45.790
sure maybe someone will uh the AI will exist for sure drive

03:18:45.790 --> 03:18:50.930
some new term like i mean asking in terms of like uh

03:18:56.790 --> 03:18:59.130
yeah there was a data scientist there was a machine and

03:18:59.130 --> 03:19:01.190
engineer there was a cv engineer computer vision engineer lp

03:19:01.190 --> 03:19:05.250
engineer that does exist even now right so even after like a

03:19:05.250 --> 03:19:07.770
8-10 year i'm able to see that there does exist that profile

03:19:07.770 --> 03:19:11.430
exists right uh then there was there is a new addition of

03:19:11.430 --> 03:19:14.270
the gen ai engineer then the engineer never existed like two

03:19:14.270 --> 03:19:17.470
years or two and a half years back right uh there was a new

03:19:17.470 --> 03:19:21.010
term i'm like uh getting nowadays prompt engineers i don't

03:19:21.010 --> 03:19:25.070
know what they do but yeah yeah there is a i i know like all

03:19:25.070 --> 03:19:27.370
of you must have heard about this term called as prompt

03:19:27.370 --> 03:19:30.830
engineering yes right then there is a new term that we

03:19:30.830 --> 03:19:33.330
started getting vive coder today we have seen live coding

03:19:33.330 --> 03:19:37.670
right so now we all have become today we all become vibe

03:19:37.670 --> 03:19:42.590
coder right so people will keep on deriving the term under

03:19:42.590 --> 03:19:46.270
the hood things are the same right it's just evolution that

03:19:46.270 --> 03:19:49.330
we are trying to follow along with so just like to follow

03:19:49.330 --> 03:19:51.550
along wherever you will be you will be in a good position

03:19:51.550 --> 03:19:55.510
with a good title simple the answer there is another one

03:19:55.510 --> 03:20:00.110
question that was what do you think about the hangback like

03:20:00.110 --> 03:20:06.550
data science what do you what do you think about uh like a

03:20:06.550 --> 03:20:12.010
facebook amazon google microsoft data science specific

03:20:12.010 --> 03:20:15.590
they're fighting they're hiding so that will be continued

03:20:15.690 --> 03:20:19.930
there is nothing new in that all right uh you don't need

03:20:19.930 --> 03:20:24.210
like a 10 000 job you just need only one right i don't know

03:20:24.210 --> 03:20:28.030
i'm talking about your badge except like guru bootcamp

03:20:28.030 --> 03:20:32.490
regarding the tank see uh you will be able to learn all the

03:20:32.490 --> 03:20:35.570
practical aspect of each and everything night uh but yeah so

03:20:35.570 --> 03:20:39.150
to get into those fan kind of a company uh you have to like

03:20:39.150 --> 03:20:42.150
focus on not just this one which is a core part along with

03:20:42.150 --> 03:20:44.230
this you will have to you will be able to clear two or three

03:20:44.230 --> 03:20:45.670
round with the help of this one but Οмы have take 3 rounds

03:20:45.670 --> 03:20:45.790
you will have to clear 4-7 rounds based on this one but the

03:20:45.790 --> 03:20:48.290
very first two round will be from dsa and system design so

03:20:48.290 --> 03:20:52.210
you have to focus on that one that one okay at a harsh

03:20:52.210 --> 03:20:58.510
reality yeah yeah uh ramesh kumari yeah you can speak yes

03:20:58.510 --> 03:21:01.810
yes you can speak i don't have any issue yeah uh

03:21:03.890 --> 03:21:07.230
sir actually my current project is for uh microsoft

03:21:07.230 --> 03:21:12.370
generally uh so this i'm working as uh so we have given some

03:21:12.370 --> 03:21:15.690
use cases to propose some client but the client would want

03:21:15.690 --> 03:21:19.690
to uh go with some co-pilot or something uh what they have

03:21:19.690 --> 03:21:23.330
the one tool so in this case how this course will be really

03:21:23.330 --> 03:21:27.750
helpful to me that so once again what was what was the

03:21:27.750 --> 03:21:31.970
problem statement my problem statement in my current project

03:21:31.970 --> 03:21:36.090
right we are not using any open source tool so basically we

03:21:36.090 --> 03:21:41.890
are using the they are increasing to use the their own tool

03:21:41.890 --> 03:21:44.830
microsoft tool they are not allowing to use any open source

03:21:44.830 --> 03:21:49.470
tool even by promoting all the use cases right which one uh

03:21:49.470 --> 03:21:53.110
we can get the use cases from uh website as well but it's

03:21:53.110 --> 03:21:57.410
not they're not agreeing with that so how can i propose the

03:21:57.410 --> 03:21:59.670
use cases with this specific project level basically

03:21:59.670 --> 03:22:02.370
proprietary tool they are asking you to create this is

03:22:02.370 --> 03:22:06.270
something yeah yeah they would suggest with the co-pilot or

03:22:06.270 --> 03:22:10.430
something their own tool co-pilot is like yeah i'm like it's

03:22:10.430 --> 03:22:12.970
a big company so obviously like they are providing co-pilot

03:22:12.970 --> 03:22:15.550
so go ahead with co-pilot that's completely fine co-pilot is

03:22:15.550 --> 03:22:18.230
also going to give you like a lot of help in terms of

03:22:18.230 --> 03:22:21.290
generating a code code completion code uh testing and then

03:22:21.290 --> 03:22:24.110
like building the entire end-to-end pipeline but with co

03:22:24.110 --> 03:22:27.390
-pilot that's completely fine so do we also cover the co

03:22:27.390 --> 03:22:30.650
-pilot as part of this level i'll just remind me like a next

03:22:30.650 --> 03:22:33.570
week itself i'll do a demo of co-pilot the way i have done

03:22:33.570 --> 03:22:36.450
the demo of this cursor right it will be very quick it's

03:22:36.450 --> 03:22:40.690
it's like a very quick i'll be using like a co-pilot okay

03:22:40.690 --> 03:22:44.370
because we don't yeah we don't have a practical platform

03:22:44.370 --> 03:22:47.190
practical platform to explore it uh so most of the materials

03:22:47.190 --> 03:22:49.890
i'll show it to you i'll just yeah just give me the reminder

03:22:49.890 --> 03:22:52.170
it will not take more than like a 10 15 minute of time just

03:22:52.170 --> 03:22:55.850
give me a reminder next week yeah yeah sure thank you yeah

03:22:55.850 --> 03:23:03.350
thanks okay anyone next hi sir yeah hi go ahead actually i

03:23:03.350 --> 03:23:08.010
am from automotive domain trying to switch for company for

03:23:08.010 --> 03:23:11.670
jane i said like i have done a little bit drag project and

03:23:11.670 --> 03:23:15.290
all but that guy said we will not do consider that one? Did

03:23:15.290 --> 03:23:19.330
you actually work in production grade or POC like that?

03:23:19.550 --> 03:23:23.350
Nowadays no one is like if you said that like I have worked

03:23:23.350 --> 03:23:26.570
on a small project, no one like care about it because

03:23:26.570 --> 03:23:28.670
everyone knows that those small project can be created

03:23:28.670 --> 03:23:31.390
easily in five minutes of time. That is not quite as even

03:23:31.390 --> 03:23:34.690
experience. Yeah but they are asking in company only did you

03:23:34.690 --> 03:23:37.950
do or not? They are not asking outside project also if I do.

03:23:39.670 --> 03:23:43.490
Yeah so if you have done some like a production grade things

03:23:43.490 --> 03:23:45.150
you can say that okay fine this is something which I have

03:23:45.150 --> 03:23:49.190
done in a company. But they are asking if you worked in

03:23:49.190 --> 03:23:52.470
company only we will consider apart from that we will not

03:23:52.470 --> 03:23:55.050
consider only so it's difficult for me to speak. See

03:23:55.050 --> 03:23:57.210
whatever you will say they will consider. They are not going

03:23:57.210 --> 03:24:00.130
to come and ask your manager or your lead that whether you

03:24:00.130 --> 03:24:03.010
have built this project or not because no one talks about

03:24:03.010 --> 03:24:06.890
that in outside right. So whatever you will say they will

03:24:06.890 --> 03:24:09.030
believe. So you have to say that okay fine this is something

03:24:09.030 --> 03:24:10.890
which I have done in a company and they will believe it if

03:24:10.890 --> 03:24:14.010
you are able to prove it. Yeah another one question is like

03:24:14.010 --> 03:24:17.670
you said the core basics is important right. I used to learn

03:24:17.670 --> 03:24:21.330
that python and all one two three weeks. After some time

03:24:21.330 --> 03:24:23.870
only I got to know that that a is equal to 10 variable

03:24:23.870 --> 03:24:27.330
usually will not store it will refer to that variable. So

03:24:27.330 --> 03:24:31.090
that much deep should I go in learning how it will go python

03:24:31.090 --> 03:24:34.430
memory management back and stuff. With time you will go into

03:24:34.430 --> 03:24:38.630
that on a day 0 so I don't think that we should go into that

03:24:38.630 --> 03:24:41.630
depth. We should take that kind of burden. Yeah. What

03:24:41.630 --> 03:24:44.170
happens is we as a human being are not ready for that. So

03:24:44.170 --> 03:24:49.510
it's fine like work around will be good. Just try to like do

03:24:49.510 --> 03:24:52.690
it get into a job and then you will learn a lot. Learning is

03:24:52.690 --> 03:24:57.730
not going to end till you till you retire right. So you are

03:24:57.730 --> 03:25:00.710
telling like for basics learn these things and start

03:25:00.710 --> 03:25:04.270
learning general after getting job also you can do that one.

03:25:04.330 --> 03:25:07.810
So focus on we all do it will all do it. Yes. Thank you.

03:25:07.810 --> 03:25:10.710
Thank you for the suggestion. Yeah. Okay. Next one guys.

03:25:10.850 --> 03:25:11.610
Anyone. Atul. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

03:25:11.610 --> 03:25:17.950
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. No. Yeah. So I am. You have a student

03:25:17.950 --> 03:25:25.590
of your first batch. Oh, 2019 or 2020 Nineteen. Okay.

03:25:25.650 --> 03:25:29.790
Nineteen. Okay. So after that, like I switched in my end,

03:25:29.850 --> 03:25:34.050
like I learned machine learning deep learning. Everyone is

03:25:34.050 --> 03:25:36.190
everyone is looking for another Tuesday transition. Okay.

03:25:36.250 --> 03:25:39.210
Fine. We'll do it. We'll do it. Yeah. Yeah. So after that,

03:25:39.290 --> 03:25:42.970
like, uh, I switch in the data engineering part, like on

03:25:42.970 --> 03:25:47.630
that time, I did not get a much, uh, uh, a good job in the

03:25:47.630 --> 03:25:51.810
like data science. So as of now, I like try to switch in the

03:25:51.810 --> 03:25:54.770
DNA, all things. So I thought like you were starting new

03:25:54.770 --> 03:25:58.610
batch. So I just joined. So today I joined just 10 minutes

03:25:58.610 --> 03:26:01.570
ago. So I like, You are the oldest friend, you are already

03:26:01.570 --> 03:26:03.990
aware about the culture. So it's fine. Welcome. Welcome back

03:26:03.990 --> 03:26:09.750
once again. Yes. Yeah. So I just asked, like, uh, I miss

03:26:09.750 --> 03:26:13.850
your last class where you taught in 2019, where I taught

03:26:13.850 --> 03:26:20.150
atul. Yes, sir. So on that time I was, yeah, it was a

03:26:20.150 --> 03:26:22.470
company which I sold to physics wallah in 250 crores. Yes.

03:26:22.470 --> 03:26:25.690
Yes. Yeah. So I knew the one, like, uh, I have, as of now I

03:26:25.690 --> 03:26:30.590
have the access of the classes again. Thanks to PW. Yes.

03:26:31.370 --> 03:26:35.410
Yeah. Okay, sir. Okay. So I just asked, like, uh, I. Okay.

03:26:35.430 --> 03:26:37.830
So you got the recording of yesterday class and today class.

03:26:38.190 --> 03:26:40.550
Yeah, it's already. So far as today's class, it's already

03:26:40.550 --> 03:26:42.930
uploaded. And for today's class, I'll, I'll be uploading it

03:26:42.930 --> 03:26:46.690
after like, uh, three hours after the completion closer of

03:26:46.690 --> 03:26:50.670
this batch. Okay. Yeah. So really the same thing we do.

03:26:51.150 --> 03:26:56.830
Okay. So next one, anyone guys, Ganesh, Vizal, anyone you

03:26:56.830 --> 03:27:02.050
have raised your hand. My question is if new students, they

03:27:02.050 --> 03:27:05.930
are taking admission in D or B Tech. Okay. Suppose they are

03:27:05.930 --> 03:27:10.630
planning for AI courses, in that case the institute they are

03:27:10.630 --> 03:27:14.450
charging 7 lakhs 8 lakhs. If they are going in other stream

03:27:14.450 --> 03:27:19.550
like a normal B.Tech sorry mechanical engineering or

03:27:19.550 --> 03:27:22.950
anything and they are charging like 3 lakhs and 4 lakhs. So

03:27:22.950 --> 03:27:26.190
what do you suggest? They should go with the normal and join

03:27:26.190 --> 03:27:30.350
your course that will be enough. See anyhow it doesn't

03:27:30.350 --> 03:27:33.190
matter whether you are going to join a 7 lakh college or

03:27:33.190 --> 03:27:37.510
like who is charging the fees or 1 lakh right. At the end of

03:27:37.510 --> 03:27:41.550
the day we join a college not for a learning because no one

03:27:41.550 --> 03:27:44.830
asked that what kind of a teacher you have obviously when

03:27:44.830 --> 03:27:47.590
you join a private institute like us you do ask a question

03:27:47.590 --> 03:27:51.510
that okay like basically like what kind of a teacher what is

03:27:51.510 --> 03:27:53.990
your result but generally with respect to college we see

03:27:53.990 --> 03:27:56.370
their placement track record that how many companies they

03:27:56.370 --> 03:28:00.130
are calling what kind of you know culture that you have what

03:28:00.130 --> 03:28:02.610
kind of infrastructure that you have. What kind of a food

03:28:02.610 --> 03:28:03.470
you are going to provide. What kind of food you are going to

03:28:03.470 --> 03:28:06.350
provide to my kids or like what kind of a hostel facilities

03:28:06.350 --> 03:28:08.610
you will be able to get and then based on the affordability

03:28:08.610 --> 03:28:13.510
of the family and person so people used to go and choose. So

03:28:13.510 --> 03:28:18.310
selection of college is not about just a learning outcome

03:28:18.310 --> 03:28:23.630
because that is the least bordered thing although I like my

03:28:23.630 --> 03:28:27.030
thoughts are completely opposed to it but I am just talking

03:28:27.030 --> 03:28:30.770
about the general thought right how we think and when I was

03:28:30.770 --> 03:28:32.550
choosing my college so what was the criteria. What was the

03:28:32.550 --> 03:28:34.890
criteria to choose my college at that point of a time and

03:28:34.890 --> 03:28:37.730
even same thing like people used to do so it's not about

03:28:37.730 --> 03:28:42.070
learning learning nowadays you have a kind of an ecosystem

03:28:42.070 --> 03:28:46.690
online so where you will be able to access a best and best

03:28:46.690 --> 03:28:50.810
of the world's knowledge with a person everything right

03:28:50.810 --> 03:28:56.290
person infrastructure. But yeah you should know that what I

03:28:56.290 --> 03:28:59.590
should learn what will be my like milestones what I should

03:28:59.590 --> 03:29:03.810
complete. And. Many. Of us are not ready for that many of us

03:29:03.810 --> 03:29:07.730
are not ready for a self exploration. So this is where this

03:29:07.730 --> 03:29:10.970
environment comes into picture so if your child or your

03:29:10.970 --> 03:29:13.270
neighbor or anyone right to whom you are recommending or

03:29:13.270 --> 03:29:17.630
suggesting if the person is a kind of a person who can

03:29:17.630 --> 03:29:22.950
explore on themselves then obviously you can go ahead with

03:29:22.950 --> 03:29:27.330
the route number two which very few people will take if you

03:29:27.330 --> 03:29:30.170
are not that kind of a person then obviously you need an

03:29:30.170 --> 03:29:34.750
environment. So where. Things will go in a predefined manner

03:29:34.750 --> 03:29:37.210
in a step-by-step manner doesn't matter how much it is going

03:29:37.210 --> 03:29:42.530
to charge there are colleges right they are offering CSS CS

03:29:42.530 --> 03:29:44.950
in just like a one lakh rupees two lakh rupees there are

03:29:44.950 --> 03:29:47.330
colleges but maybe their infrastructure is not that great

03:29:47.330 --> 03:29:50.150
like their hostel facilities their campus is not that great

03:29:50.150 --> 03:29:53.370
so people are charging you for those facilities not for

03:29:53.370 --> 03:29:57.050
education believe me those several lakhs are never meant for

03:29:57.050 --> 03:29:58.710
education at all yeah

03:30:03.480 --> 03:30:05.320
hope I am able to answer your question so which one you

03:30:05.320 --> 03:30:08.780
should choose. Yeah. Depends upon the student caliber just

03:30:08.780 --> 03:30:11.640
choose that and obviously like money matters a lot right

03:30:11.640 --> 03:30:16.520
seven lakhs is not a small amount so that matters people are

03:30:16.520 --> 03:30:19.760
charging like somewhere 20 lakh as well for per year okay

03:30:21.040 --> 03:30:26.840
sir thank you yeah next one like Vishal please go ahead good

03:30:26.840 --> 03:30:30.760
morning sir yeah good evening good afternoon sir good

03:30:30.760 --> 03:30:35.140
afternoon yeah can I share my screen yeah you can share your

03:30:35.140 --> 03:30:38.920
screen so let me make you a panelist you will be joining as

03:30:38.920 --> 03:30:42.440
a panelist in few minutes. Yeah in between so I will take a

03:30:42.440 --> 03:30:45.180
question from Krishna what is your question tell me

03:30:49.660 --> 03:30:54.120
Myself Krishna dada. Yeah I think Krishna right Krishna

03:30:54.120 --> 03:30:58.320
Aleti has raised a question sorry raise a hand so anyone

03:30:58.320 --> 03:31:02.120
anyone can go ahead yeah sir let me stop sharing my screen

03:31:02.120 --> 03:31:09.160
so that you can share so just a minute allow yeah now I

03:31:09.160 --> 03:31:13.200
think you can share your screen. Yes sir. Okay. Thank you.

03:31:13.200 --> 03:31:16.040
So the previous days means before joining this batch I was

03:31:16.040 --> 03:31:20.260
trying to learn langchain by myself for YouTube and chat GPT

03:31:20.260 --> 03:31:27.080
so I created a chat bot but I have few questions related to

03:31:27.080 --> 03:31:30.520
it but means I was not able to understand this part of the

03:31:30.520 --> 03:31:35.960
code. Which part? Okay so what I did this this is the

03:31:35.960 --> 03:31:42.260
function call. Fine. So here I have created a dictionary

03:31:42.260 --> 03:31:46.460
name. Okay. variable name is store so whatever chatting or

03:31:46.460 --> 03:31:52.180
whatever the history fine yeah yeah so my question is if

03:31:52.180 --> 03:31:56.240
this is the function call from line number 27 it is going to

03:31:56.240 --> 03:32:00.480
the line number 20 and over here i am storing the session id

03:32:00.480 --> 03:32:05.140
in the chat message history object but my question is if

03:32:05.140 --> 03:32:09.680
this my this function is returning the store id here i have

03:32:09.680 --> 03:32:14.180
not created any variable so basically from the control will

03:32:14.180 --> 03:32:19.380
be going from 27 to 20 and from 23 it will be coming back to

03:32:19.380 --> 03:32:24.340
the 27 basically you will try to call this line number 25 so

03:32:24.340 --> 03:32:26.800
eventually this is going to call this particular line and

03:32:26.800 --> 03:32:29.480
automatically this will call line number 20 so it's not line

03:32:29.480 --> 03:32:32.140
number 20 focus the return line number 23 always you will be

03:32:32.140 --> 03:32:36.240
able to get return as a number 23 simple okay but if this

03:32:36.240 --> 03:32:40.820
line number 23 will be getting in uh will be catching will

03:32:40.820 --> 03:32:42.940
be will be will be getting will be getting all the time when

03:32:42.940 --> 03:32:45.760
you will call line number 25 it's a single line right yeah

03:32:45.760 --> 03:32:49.360
yeah yeah yes sir yes line number 23 means return will get

03:32:49.360 --> 03:32:52.040
see that's just a function from 20 to 23 it's just a

03:32:52.040 --> 03:32:54.460
function it will give you a single line return so whatever

03:32:54.460 --> 03:32:57.720
return it will give it to you it will go with the uh like

03:32:57.720 --> 03:33:00.940
this chain history c-h-a-i and channel history that you have

03:33:00.940 --> 03:33:04.320
written right line number 25 it will go into that one okay

03:33:04.320 --> 03:33:07.820
so that this particular return will be uh storing in chain

03:33:07.820 --> 03:33:11.200
history yes in that object basically session id object where

03:33:11.200 --> 03:33:15.600
you are calling it okay but uh this uh this is the function

03:33:15.600 --> 03:33:19.760
call so basically it in normal programming whatever means i

03:33:19.760 --> 03:33:22.900
have seen yeah so basically you were you were confused about

03:33:22.900 --> 03:33:25.160
the bracket so why we are not using a bracket why we are not

03:33:25.160 --> 03:33:27.780
able to pass the input something like that no no sir no sir

03:33:27.780 --> 03:33:32.660
so let's take an example let's skip this uh part for now i

03:33:32.660 --> 03:33:36.240
am calling a function and that function is returning me a

03:33:36.240 --> 03:33:40.780
multiplication of two numbers so i will be calling like a

03:33:40.780 --> 03:33:43.260
and b minus equal to mult and two parameters I will be

03:33:43.260 --> 03:33:46.640
passing. So whatever is being written, it will be stored in

03:33:46.640 --> 03:33:53.960
ANS variable. So over here, if I am calling from line number

03:33:53.960 --> 03:33:58.440
27, I am calling the function get session ID. So the control

03:33:58.440 --> 03:34:02.120
should come back to this line, right? Get session ID. It is

03:34:02.120 --> 03:34:05.060
coming back to that line. Basically it is coming back. So

03:34:05.060 --> 03:34:07.700
how control will come in a sequential manner, it will

03:34:07.700 --> 03:34:10.100
execute, right? So first we will execute chain, let's

03:34:10.100 --> 03:34:12.980
suppose. So this is one single object. So all these four

03:34:12.980 --> 03:34:15.400
things will go together inside our enable with the message

03:34:15.400 --> 03:34:17.840
history. See the enable with the message history itself is a

03:34:17.840 --> 03:34:19.960
function, right? You are trying to call. And these are

03:34:19.960 --> 03:34:22.400
basically object parameter means technically you are trying

03:34:22.400 --> 03:34:25.880
to initialize the, this, uh, like, uh, enable, uh, what is

03:34:25.880 --> 03:34:29.460
the method? Yeah. Maybe a class, right? Maybe that is a

03:34:29.460 --> 03:34:32.460
class. I don't know what you have written basically. So

03:34:32.460 --> 03:34:34.760
basically the enable, uh, with the message history, let's

03:34:34.760 --> 03:34:36.720
suppose it's a class we are trying to provide, or we are

03:34:36.720 --> 03:34:39.460
trying to intensiate it. All this four object, which is, uh,

03:34:39.460 --> 03:34:39.540
all these four objects, which is, uh, all these four

03:34:39.540 --> 03:34:41.480
objects, which is, uh, object variable chain gets us an ID

03:34:41.480 --> 03:34:43.800
input, message key, history, message key, all will go

03:34:43.800 --> 03:34:47.220
together. Now out of that, one of these parameter is what

03:34:47.220 --> 03:34:49.540
one of this parameter is basically a function. So basically

03:34:49.540 --> 03:34:51.580
you have created a class which will take input as a

03:34:51.580 --> 03:34:54.760
function, but this is what has been implemented over here.

03:34:55.440 --> 03:34:58.340
Okay. Input as a function. So whenever like, uh, it will try

03:34:58.340 --> 03:35:00.740
to take that input, it will try to call that function. It's

03:35:00.740 --> 03:35:02.540
execute that function. And what that function is technically

03:35:02.540 --> 03:35:05.440
doing, it is trying to store your historical message and

03:35:05.440 --> 03:35:07.760
whenever you are going to call it in that session. So

03:35:07.760 --> 03:35:10.460
technically it is going to store your historical, whatever,

03:35:10.560 --> 03:35:12.720
like a memory that you have saved. Right. So it is going to

03:35:12.720 --> 03:35:16.320
return that from the session ID. This is okay. So, okay. So

03:35:16.320 --> 03:35:20.560
basically this function is in class. I don't know. Maybe you

03:35:20.560 --> 03:35:23.160
can hold your mouse and then I can check, but yeah, as of

03:35:23.160 --> 03:35:26.000
now, it looks like, uh, yeah, loading. Right. See, it's a

03:35:26.000 --> 03:35:29.220
class I told you. And in the, inside this class, uh, clearly

03:35:29.220 --> 03:35:32.260
it's visible that it is trying to take these inputs, right?

03:35:32.360 --> 03:35:35.080
So a get session history, input message, output message,

03:35:35.120 --> 03:35:37.220
history, message, key history, factor configuration, and

03:35:37.220 --> 03:35:39.520
other KWRs. KWRs means any kind of KWRs, any kind of KWRs,

03:35:39.520 --> 03:35:41.540
any kind of a dictionary parameter or key value kind of

03:35:41.540 --> 03:35:43.840
parameter you can try to pass. So this is what it is going

03:35:43.840 --> 03:35:48.500
to take. Okay. Okay, sir. And sir, uh, my second question

03:35:48.500 --> 03:35:52.540
is, means whatever prerequisite for the, uh, deep learning,

03:35:52.620 --> 03:35:57.480
do we will be taking that in the classes? No, for deep

03:35:57.480 --> 03:35:59.500
learning, we have a separate deep learning man. So, Oh, no,

03:35:59.580 --> 03:36:03.640
no, sorry. A prerequisite for the gen AI. I'm considering

03:36:03.640 --> 03:36:06.160
that. Don't worry. So I always like, I believe in, uh, going

03:36:06.160 --> 03:36:08.940
for basics. So next class Saturday, I'm going to talk about

03:36:08.940 --> 03:36:11.720
the API. Okay. And that API from a definition till creation

03:36:11.720 --> 03:36:16.120
of the API, right? So we will be using fast APIs or? I will

03:36:16.120 --> 03:36:20.160
be using fast API. Okay. So you will be teaching some, uh,

03:36:20.280 --> 03:36:22.680
back, uh, background of the first I'll be teaching, like

03:36:22.680 --> 03:36:25.160
I'll be teaching how you can create a very simple method,

03:36:25.360 --> 03:36:28.960
pass the parameter, expose it to the API, tested with the

03:36:28.960 --> 03:36:32.540
postman, basically, uh, with a post get delete and all those

03:36:32.540 --> 03:36:35.340
operations, and then how you will be able to expose that to

03:36:35.340 --> 03:36:39.520
the entire world. Okay, sir. So basically whatever. In this

03:36:39.520 --> 03:36:43.160
batch, the tech stack will be become, so I will be able to

03:36:43.160 --> 03:36:47.420
transition my career, right? Yes. Everyone eventually. Okay.

03:36:47.520 --> 03:36:52.160
Okay. And sir, from when we will be getting, uh, start

03:36:52.160 --> 03:36:56.440
getting assignments for that. Next Sunday, not even maybe

03:36:56.440 --> 03:37:00.540
Saturday, but I'm not sure about it. Uh, Sunday. Yeah. My

03:37:00.540 --> 03:37:03.160
assignments are not like a quite a regular assignment that,

03:37:03.160 --> 03:37:05.440
uh, so there are two, three type of assignment I used to

03:37:05.440 --> 03:37:08.560
create one that I give into a recorded session. Uh, and

03:37:08.560 --> 03:37:09.100
then, and then it's like a, it's like a session. So yeah,

03:37:09.160 --> 03:37:10.960
that's a proper assignment where I like mention the

03:37:10.960 --> 03:37:13.660
questions, uh, generally in my life batches, I don't give

03:37:13.660 --> 03:37:16.160
assignment. I give you a challenges that, okay, build this

03:37:16.160 --> 03:37:19.120
and then discuss inside the group, that kind of a challenge.

03:37:19.620 --> 03:37:22.480
Okay. So we will not, not like a solve this question, this

03:37:22.480 --> 03:37:25.240
question, this question. So that I don't follow in my life

03:37:25.240 --> 03:37:29.100
lecture that I follow in my recorded one. Okay, sir. So as

03:37:29.100 --> 03:37:32.260
you are the part of live, so not like a conventional

03:37:32.260 --> 03:37:35.400
assignment, we are going to do it. We are going to like a

03:37:35.400 --> 03:37:37.880
build it and like, like you have, you're showing your

03:37:37.880 --> 03:37:40.120
screen, right if you are not able to understand so similarly

03:37:40.120 --> 03:37:43.780
people will do that those things on a regular basis okay so

03:37:43.780 --> 03:37:47.600
that will help us to that is the only thing which helps a

03:37:47.600 --> 03:37:50.020
lot of people and this is something which has helped so many

03:37:50.020 --> 03:37:53.800
people in past as per my experience okay so and so sir what

03:37:53.800 --> 03:37:57.660
is i'm currently doing i'm going to chat gpt and i'm asking

03:37:57.660 --> 03:38:01.620
chat gpt that i'm a five year old kid and i want to learn

03:38:01.620 --> 03:38:04.140
like i mean like that kind of that level prompt is not

03:38:04.140 --> 03:38:07.700
required i'm a five year old kid is smart enough to

03:38:07.700 --> 03:38:10.800
understand if we are going to do our follow-ups okay sir

03:38:11.660 --> 03:38:15.900
okay sir okay fine the next question please uh from abhijit

03:38:15.900 --> 03:38:20.740
go ahead with your question yeah this is abhijit i'm your

03:38:20.740 --> 03:38:26.540
old student 2021 i knew that okay so yesterday i think uh

03:38:26.540 --> 03:38:30.280
two three days back i was speaking with you and a group

03:38:30.280 --> 03:38:33.700
itself so with your after your batch i done the transition

03:38:33.700 --> 03:38:38.960
in data science okay so so i have done my salary 3x from

03:38:38.960 --> 03:38:46.080
that time yeah in four years we'll do it again 3x so now so

03:38:46.080 --> 03:38:49.820
currently i'm working in investment management company okay

03:38:49.820 --> 03:38:55.440
so where i'm leading the modern implementation team okay so

03:38:55.440 --> 03:39:00.140
deep looking the modern implementation deployment cicd

03:39:00.140 --> 03:39:05.180
pipeline and as well as i'm working as a rsh lead developer

03:39:05.180 --> 03:39:10.120
as well okay so uh with and and previously i was in

03:39:10.120 --> 03:39:14.060
schneider electric as a data senior data scientist okay so

03:39:14.060 --> 03:39:19.300
with this uh after after like completion of january or might

03:39:19.300 --> 03:39:23.100
be one or two years i am aiming for some architect level

03:39:23.100 --> 03:39:28.540
role so will it be uh justifiable to aim into that way what

03:39:28.540 --> 03:39:33.300
is your total year of experience now uh total year see if i

03:39:33.300 --> 03:39:36.800
include my bpo experience it will be around total total yeah

03:39:36.800 --> 03:39:41.000
total total it will be around 16 16 17 years and i think i

03:39:41.000 --> 03:39:43.240
think you can target see bpo you must have done in your

03:39:43.240 --> 03:39:46.840
early stage of a career for two three years right so no one

03:39:46.840 --> 03:39:50.100
will even do a bgb for that don't worry people do a bgb for

03:39:50.100 --> 03:39:53.000
like last two three companies max to max and again so you

03:39:53.000 --> 03:39:55.360
will be talking about your experience in last two three year

03:39:55.360 --> 03:39:58.540
that you have done so don't worry about like a your initial

03:39:58.540 --> 03:40:01.620
of initial job yeah now coming to the architecture architect

03:40:01.620 --> 03:40:04.780
role so uh the easiest way to crack the architect role i

03:40:04.780 --> 03:40:07.300
would say take your time maybe for six months or nine months

03:40:07.300 --> 03:40:11.120
uh involve your team maybe like a college colleague whoever

03:40:11.120 --> 03:40:15.400
you want and then uh let's build something a little bit

03:40:15.400 --> 03:40:18.940
bigger right and you will be like able to like a switch

03:40:18.940 --> 03:40:22.360
again like easily i think this is what we have been

03:40:22.360 --> 03:40:24.340
following right since a very long time so just do it that

03:40:24.340 --> 03:40:27.400

03:40:51.260 --> 03:40:58.300
let me mute all and then now raise your hand yeah so raise

03:41:01.150 --> 03:41:06.450
your hand please uh because yeah ganesh please go ahead yes

03:41:06.450 --> 03:41:11.230
sir so uh you will be giving that assignment uh that will be

03:41:11.230 --> 03:41:16.170
challenges in this course so can we also discuss the

03:41:16.170 --> 03:41:22.430
solutions no not at all no no not at all because uh see when

03:41:22.430 --> 03:41:25.490
i give a project right a big big project uh so basically

03:41:25.490 --> 03:41:29.970
that i allow to discuss inside the class uh rest when i give

03:41:29.970 --> 03:41:32.030
a small small challenges which will start from let's suppose

03:41:32.030 --> 03:41:36.070
like a next saturday and sunday uh so we have a group and we

03:41:36.070 --> 03:41:36.070
will be giving a project and we will be giving a big big

03:41:36.070 --> 03:41:38.430
project you guys can share your solution over there your

03:41:38.430 --> 03:41:40.890
observation over there and then you can discuss over there

03:41:40.890 --> 03:41:43.710
everything not need to be discussed because anyhow in my

03:41:43.710 --> 03:41:45.950
class itself we are going to write a lot of code we are

03:41:45.950 --> 03:41:49.530
going to discuss a lot right yeah so everything because it

03:41:49.530 --> 03:41:53.250
will unnecessarily consume the time like my time yes so

03:41:53.250 --> 03:41:56.790
small one big one obviously will invite so see generally

03:41:56.790 --> 03:41:59.590
what i do is that whenever i give a big challenge right a

03:41:59.590 --> 03:42:02.010
big project so let's suppose three four or ten people are

03:42:02.010 --> 03:42:04.230
able to do it so out of that we select like a two three

03:42:04.230 --> 03:42:07.710
demos and we just ask them to present it inside the class in

03:42:07.710 --> 03:42:11.390
a live mode all right so that other people will be able to

03:42:11.390 --> 03:42:16.310
you know ask a cross question yeah but yeah not for not for

03:42:16.310 --> 03:42:19.770
all everything so because i know it's too much like time

03:42:19.770 --> 03:42:22.470
consuming yeah krishna pratap please go ahead hello

03:42:26.630 --> 03:42:32.010
krishna pratap i'm audible to you uh prakash you can go

03:42:32.010 --> 03:42:38.110
ahead if i'm audible to you gohar you can go ahead anyone

03:42:38.110 --> 03:42:40.610
can go ahead guys please unmute yourself you all can unmute

03:42:40.610 --> 03:42:44.750
yourself i'm unable to unmute myself is it okay krishna

03:42:44.750 --> 03:42:50.430
pratap is saying okay ping me um remove permission no i

03:42:50.430 --> 03:42:54.350
think you should be able to unmute yourself ask to unmute

03:42:54.350 --> 03:42:58.050
let me okay click now krishna pratap try to unmute yourself

03:42:58.050 --> 03:43:03.030
try to unmute yourself hi sir yeah hi sir recently i

03:43:03.030 --> 03:43:08.330
completed python course from your own great i don't

03:43:08.330 --> 03:43:12.410
understand the fundamental of ai or more things and it is a

03:43:12.410 --> 03:43:17.450
big problem for me maybe i am that student who has no

03:43:17.450 --> 03:43:21.630
knowledge in this class so what i do now nothing just follow

03:43:21.630 --> 03:43:27.250
along with the class yeah have patience okay thank you sir

03:43:27.250 --> 03:43:31.770
yeah thanks okay yeah next one ajit uh go ahead go ahead

03:43:32.930 --> 03:43:37.610
subhan yeah i thought to ask one question but i forgot so

03:43:37.610 --> 03:43:40.450
currently we are having uh implementing everything in python

03:43:40.470 --> 03:43:44.330
chat assistant which we are trying to uh get the data source

03:43:44.330 --> 03:43:48.950
from the sharepoint uh intranet site initially we thought to

03:43:48.950 --> 03:43:52.770
put it in the vector db and then we try to build a chat

03:43:52.770 --> 03:43:56.710
assistant on top of that but there is one new feature we

03:43:56.710 --> 03:44:02.070
recently uh done poc like there is a copilot studio where we

03:44:02.070 --> 03:44:06.310
can just give the uh sharepoint urls to the copilot studio

03:44:06.310 --> 03:44:09.710
so that we can able to directly ask the question to the

03:44:09.710 --> 03:44:15.770
assistant so uh what will be the best uh in going for the

03:44:15.770 --> 03:44:22.230
future like you're saying that like uh going with the rag or

03:44:22.230 --> 03:44:28.950
yeah copilot studio no so if you are using copilot studio if

03:44:28.950 --> 03:44:31.590
it is working for this solution then it's fine for now but

03:44:31.590 --> 03:44:33.690
let's suppose if i would like to like build a complete

03:44:33.690 --> 03:44:36.590
system where i don't want to use a copilot i just want my

03:44:36.590 --> 03:44:39.250
like a rag system to understand my entire document or

03:44:39.250 --> 03:44:42.370
whatever is there in a link i can do that as well there are

03:44:42.370 --> 03:44:44.370
multiple approaches to solve the same problem but yeah if

03:44:44.370 --> 03:44:47.230
that problem we have solved and it's working let it be in

03:44:47.230 --> 03:44:52.930
that way okay okay yeah okay yeah okay ajit please go ahead

03:44:52.930 --> 03:44:57.110
uh krishna pradab i think you have raised your hands since a

03:44:57.110 --> 03:44:59.230
very long time but you are not able to ask the question so

03:44:59.230 --> 03:45:00.670
please go ahead uh

03:45:03.390 --> 03:45:07.210
hello sir am i audible yeah you are you are yeah so in this

03:45:07.210 --> 03:45:11.070
course you will be uh taking any cloud platforms like azure

03:45:11.070 --> 03:45:14.450
uh google or i mean we'll be interacting with the cloud wise

03:45:14.450 --> 03:45:19.370
aws majority of times aws and for like uh gpus paper space

03:45:19.370 --> 03:45:21.630
kind of platform there is something called a paper space

03:45:21.630 --> 03:45:24.710
kind of platform which provides a gpu and again there will

03:45:24.710 --> 03:45:27.090
be a free cloud deployment as well so streamlink cloud

03:45:27.090 --> 03:45:30.330
render cloud for free free cloud platform deployment a basic

03:45:30.330 --> 03:45:34.700
one advanced one like where i will be creating like an

03:45:34.700 --> 03:45:37.100
entire end to an infrastructure pipeline that will be aws

03:45:37.100 --> 03:45:44.910
okay next question please yeah go ahead yeah go ahead go

03:45:44.910 --> 03:45:48.710
ahead so thank you are we going to again cover the rag

03:45:48.710 --> 03:45:52.190
masters or do we have in this one yeah rag is there syllabus

03:45:52.190 --> 03:45:54.790
as a part of syllabus rg is there so i have to cover

03:45:54.790 --> 03:45:58.170
whatever is there in a syllabus uh i'll i'll cover simple so

03:45:58.170 --> 03:46:01.310
we are going to call it in the live class yeah live classes

03:46:01.310 --> 03:46:04.850
yes okay okay so

03:46:06.480 --> 03:46:09.940
fine everyone i think we are good we are able to take all

03:46:09.940 --> 03:46:12.400
the questions uh i can see a couple of people have raised

03:46:12.400 --> 03:46:15.740
their hand but yeah they were not able to That's fine. We

03:46:15.740 --> 03:46:18.380
are connected. So with that, thank you so much everyone.

03:46:18.520 --> 03:46:22.120
Take care. Hope we are aligned. We are able to learn and

03:46:22.120 --> 03:46:25.140
again from next class onwards agenda is going to be, I'll

03:46:25.140 --> 03:46:28.220
teach you how to create the APIs. Then URI API, we'll try to

03:46:28.220 --> 03:46:31.620
experiment a lot and hopefully Saturday, Sunday we will be

03:46:31.620 --> 03:46:34.040
able to cover that. So that will be a part of our base

03:46:34.040 --> 03:46:37.420
building. We are not starting the actual lecture. You can

03:46:37.420 --> 03:46:41.680
say the initial two models are not actually, it's basically

03:46:41.680 --> 03:46:45.320
for a base building. So we'll try to spend a couple of days

03:46:45.320 --> 03:46:49.240
just to build a base so that going forward we should not

03:46:49.240 --> 03:46:52.380
face any kind of problem and believe me, by that time you

03:46:52.380 --> 03:46:54.980
will get used to a lot of things which will be required. So

03:46:54.980 --> 03:46:57.840
you all will be on the same plane basically. With that,

03:46:57.920 --> 03:47:00.480
thank you so much everyone. Take care. Enjoy your entire

03:47:00.480 --> 03:47:02.840
week. There is no assignment which I have given this week,

03:47:02.960 --> 03:47:07.180
but yeah, you can expect this one in our next week, upcoming

03:47:07.180 --> 03:47:11.520
week. So with that, take care everyone. Hope you have liked

03:47:11.520 --> 03:47:16.060
it. And yeah, so go and tell your friends and families and
