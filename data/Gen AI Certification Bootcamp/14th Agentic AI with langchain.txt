WEBVTT

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.600
Okay, so good morning everyone. I think I'm audible and

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.100
visible to all of you. Yeah, so please confirm if I'm

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.920
audible and visible. Okay, so good morning. Good morning,

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.840
everyone. Happy Sunday to all of you.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.390
Okay, so we'll start a class in next like two, three

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.490
minutes. Yeah, so that all of us can join and then we are

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.370
going to start with the same thing that we have initiated

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:54.070
yesterday. So creation of agents, by the way. So we'll not

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.550
do much today, by the way. So we'll try to see how we can

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.230
try to create an agent and if time allows, then we'll try to

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.610
test those agents, by the way. And yeah, so from next class

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.090
onwards, obviously, back to back, back to back, we'll try to

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.970
create so many agents and we'll try to bring those agents

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.850
into our production. So that is something that we'll discuss

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:20.870
next week. New color of t-shirt looking nice. Okay, thank

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:21.090
you.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.900
Hi, sir. It's my first class. Okay, not an issue. Maybe you

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.720
can. You can attend this class and you can spend like a

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.880
coming weeks just to cover the things that we have discussed

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.580
in our previous lectures. And if you have any kind of a

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.600
doubt, so yeah, feel free to ask your doubts.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.690
After two weeks again, please give one week break. Okay, is

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:52.310
it is it required guys break is like a required you need

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:58.620
break for a week. Okay, see the response. So in a group.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.420
Yeah, so said right. Can you provide a list of the agents

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:10.500
you intended of teaching today? I will be talking about very

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.260
basic agent. It's like a calculator agent or you can say a

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:19.040
sequel agent and then maybe a knowledge base kind of agents.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:24.320
But going forward. So as we will move forward, I will try to

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.920
create a WhatsApp agent. Telegram agent. Gmail kind of like

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:33.200
a mail agent. All those real time agent will try to create.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.500
And. And we will try to integrate those agents with the real

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.380
time system. Then you will feel like okay, I have done

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.620
something, I have created something which is like literally

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.640
real. So today we are not going to do it anyhow. So today we

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.520
will try to see like a basic philosophy of an agent, how we

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.140
can try to create it programmatically. But as we will

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.760
progress into our lectures, so we will try to create some

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.960
real time agents so that we can interact with the real

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.720
system to solve real problems. That will be like, that is

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:07.720
something that we are going to do.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:20.080
Okay, that's amazing. No break sir, only hi, okay, okay, one

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.460
code

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.520
review agent, yeah, even code review agent. So that is that

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.620
is also part of my list, basically a code review agent, so

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.200
that it will be able to connect with your GitHub. And then

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.720
it will be able to. You know, check all the pull request

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.780
which has been done or all the code checking which has been

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.040
done all the merge merger with respect to a code which has

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.240
been done if there is a conflict between merge, so it will

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:49.560
be able to identify those conflicts. And then it will be

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.660
able to even tell you like what is the difference between

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:55.240
the previous version and a next version who has done what

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.340
kind of checking. So basically, a agent which will be able

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:02.860
to monitor a particular GitHub repository. Let's suppose. If

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.600
you are building a product, right, so obviously, it's not

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.200
just you who will be building it, maybe like that will be

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.240
like a lot of people who will be involved in your team. And

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.720
we all try to push our code into a single GitHub repository,

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.400
then we try to merge it, right. So we'll like we try to

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:23.020
raise a PR over there. So basically, we'll try to like a

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:26.700
teach you that how to create such kind of agent, but not

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.700
today, like in upcoming classes. Yeah. Like I told you. So

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.880
we'll we'll see. We're not going to create some real time

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.820
agent today. It's just going to be like a basic one. But in

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.560
upcoming weeks, obviously, we'll try to like add all of

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.980
these agents into our lectures by using a different

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.660
different kind of a framework or by writing a custom code.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.520
Bangalore property broker agents that replace that you can

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.940
do any

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.370
course related to automation testing using a Python for my

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:04.930
brother, I will advise you like not to go for automation

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:09.330
testing. So don't give like. Maybe you can send this message

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.250
to your brother. I don't think that it's having a very good

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.990
career now, at least agent

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.620
which can generate a report related to a business that

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.980
that's an easy one. It's a very easy one. So like a report

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.760
generating agent is a very, very basic agent. I think all of

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.760
you will be able to create it in the next like two, three

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.420
weeks. Maybe not today, obviously. Right. But yeah, next

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.660
two, three weeks, most of you will be able to end up

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.640
creating like all these kinds of agents. Fine, guys. So

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.140
let's get started. Okay. So let's get started. Let me share

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.240
my screen. And like I said, so today we are not going to do

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:47.660
something fancy. That day will come. So when we will do like

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.360
a lot of fancy things, fancy means a real thing, by the way,

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.860
that that's this is what I mean by doing a fancy things.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.820
Yeah. So today we'll see today's lecture. Maybe it's going

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.720
to be a little bit boring for some of you. Possible. Yeah.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.360
Because we will not see like something real. No. We'll see

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.840
just a programming. And we'll try to understand those

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.840
programming. But yeah, upcoming lectures are going to be

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.220
pretty much interesting. So where you will like interact

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:18.780
with your real system, with your app, your like a mobile,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.120
your WhatsApp, your Telegram, your mail system, your code

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:26.600
base and many more things. So sit tight. It's not going to

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.200
be very interesting. Today's lecture.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.480
Yeah. Shall we start guys? Boring lectures.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:44.680
Okay. Pehle hi dara diya. Dara na nahi hai, reality hai. I

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.200
think we should be aware about it. But obviously this is

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.640
going to be a building block by the way. So if you're going

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.680
to miss this lecture, so obviously you will not be able to

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.700
understand the upcoming one. So we are just, we have to

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.300
create a building blocks. For example, in case of a vector

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.580
database, in case of a RAG, we have done the same thing.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.100
Right. So we have started with the boring lecture and then

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.820
eventually we have created something which all of you are

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:08.080
able to post. All of you are able to keep it inside your

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:12.340
GitHub repository. Right. So obviously building blocks are

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:15.080
boring. Unless and until your entire house is not ready.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.920
Because it's not going to be interesting again.

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.340
So hope all of you had your tea.

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:35.450
So I believe my screen is visible to all of you and I think

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.990
this is something which I was using as a code base

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:43.230
yesterday. Okay. Let me replace my URI API key. I'm not sure

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:47.770
whether it's working today. Maybe I have deactivated it. So

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.690
where is my API key? Hmm. So

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:11.570
let me create a new one. Copy it and replace.

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:21.870
Okay. So all of you can change your API key if you have not

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:27.660
done that, maybe. And let me deactivate this Amazon queue.

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:31.920
It's disturbing me a lot, by the way, it's not allowing me

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.300
to, you know, select the entire thing. Hmm. Now it's

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:39.620
working. Amazon queue. Why?

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:50.290
Hmm. Okay. So yesterday, basically, like, guys, we have done

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:54.290
some sort of installation, right? And those who are facing a

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:57.510
problem with respect to installation. So you just have to do

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:00.690
this entire installation. So pip install, u, lang, chain,

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:03.630
core, this community, all of this installation you have to

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:06.970
do inside your system. And obviously, after that, everything

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:12.590
will work plus pip install, install URI AI, so that you all

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:15.390
will be able to access URI. So I believe this is going to

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:17.290
work. This installation has been done yesterday itself. Let

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:20.710
me remove this piece of the code. Yeah. And we were able to

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.930
do all of these imports, right? All of these imports, we

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:27.790
were able to do it yesterday itself. So let me execute this

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:33.090
one quickly. Yeah. So this one is working, pidentic, forget

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:37.070
about it. Installation is done. And this import is working

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:40.470
for me, all of this import. So those who have not done, I'm

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:43.710
giving you a code once again, and again, this piece of code

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:46.770
is already available inside your dashboard. So if you will

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:50.330
follow along with the, like yesterday lectures, so you will

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.370
be able to find out this particular notebook, which is

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:57.690
already available. So no need to worry. You can simply go

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:01.250
and you can download this notebook. So I just need a, like

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:04.110
a, this import by the way, right? I just need this

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:08.530
particular import. I need my LLM by the way, uh, which I

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:12.370
have already created here. So then, then we are good to go.

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:14.750
So if you have this imports and if you have this LLM. Yeah.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.390
Then you all will be able to execute a code that I'm going

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:24.570
to discuss today. And one more thing, uh, so those who would

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:27.910
like to like, uh, learn as most of you have a Euron plus

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:31.810
access. So those who would like to learn maybe a DSA with

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:35.090
Python. So today we are going to inaugurate this particular

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:38.570
batch. I'm not a mentor. I'm not the main mentor for this

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.790
batch. So basically our main mentor is Ramendra Kumar. So

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.190
Ram basically. Uh, and uh, this week itself, he had joined

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:49.070
Google. Uh. Uh, in India and, uh, he's a very expert ones

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:52.250
like since three to four years. So he is teaching, he's

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:55.550
taking classes in offline and online mode, uh, along with

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:58.510
that. So recently he has cracked Google and before that, so

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:01.610
he was working in a different, different, like a company as

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:04.930
a lead, as a developer, and, uh, he's pretty much senior by

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:08.290
the way. And plus educational background wise. So he's a NIT

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:11.090
graduate. So again, one of the premium Institute in India.

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:15.490
So maybe you can attend his class. If you are interested in

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:20.210
Python. Python from a scratch, right. And again, DSA plus if

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:22.690
you are looking for some advice or maybe some sort of a

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.730
suggestion, uh, in terms of cracking a product based

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:28.390
company. So I think he's a best person who can guide you.

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:31.430
He's a best person who can advise you. Uh, timing is already

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:34.810
mentioned over here. Uh, right. So timing is basically 4 PM

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:38.590
IST. Uh, today is just like an induction class. I think we

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:42.470
all know the drill, right? So a first class is just going to

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:45.310
be the induction one. I will be available in this induction.

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:48.590
I think for like a 15, 20 minute after that. So I'll hand

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:51.870
over this entire batch to Ramendra and he will be like a

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:54.170
taking care of this entire batch today onwards.

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:03.410
Is it required for 12 year experience? Uh, basically see

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:07.450
when you are going to apply for a product based companies,

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:11.550
right? So at that point of time, somewhere system design and

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:14.430
DSA becomes crucial, at least for a couple of rounds, they

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:17.010
are going to ask you, uh, technically it's a filtration

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:19.190
round, right? So they are going to ask you a couple of

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:24.450
questions, uh, from a DSA, but, uh, uh, like, uh, for any

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:27.270
senior person, it's, it's not that required, I would say.

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:30.290
But yeah, for product based companies, it's, it's kind of a

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:35.090
ritual that they used to follow. So it's better to have, uh,

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:38.570
uh, it's better to know like, uh, things in a depth. So if

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:41.250
you have a time, maybe you can spend some time in this

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:48.240
class. Okay. So now what I will do. So I will try to create

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.600
an agent guys. So I believe definition wise, uh, uh, we all

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.400
are aware about the agent that what is actually called as

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:59.680
agent. Now let's try to create those agent, a couple of

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.260
agent. Let's try to create those couple of agents and then

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.580
let's try to test those agent. Let's see how we can try to

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:09.040
convert any kind of a function into a tools and eventually

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:12.320
into an agent so that you all will be able to understand the

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.840
real definition of an agent. That will be the purpose of,

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:19.580
uh, my today's lecture. That just to make you explain. Okay.

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.480
Because theoretically we were able to understand it, right?

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:26.040
So practically, uh, we'll try to understand that what

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:31.500
actually the agent is and how we can create it and how we

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.760
can try to commence those things as an agent, how system

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.180
will be able to understand that, okay, this is the agent

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:40.000
which I'm supposed to call in this situation. Um,

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.600
technically a routing I'm talking about. So system, uh, how

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.400
system is going to route towards agent and how it is going

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.300
to call it. Okay.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:57.860
So here the very first thing, our very first agent, which

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:01.800
I'm going to create is a calculator agent. So what it will

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:06.640
do by the way, so it will try to take any kind of a

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.220
mathematical expression as a string, right? It is going to

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.340
take any kind of a mathematical extra expression. For

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:15.820
example, if I'm writing like a, uh, two plus three, right?

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.660
Two plus three. So basically this function will be able to

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.060
take this two plus three kind of an input, or let's suppose

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:24.480
if I'm trying to write maybe a sign off. Okay. Or sign theta

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:28.740
of sign of maybe, uh, something, right? So it will be able

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:33.400
to take these inputs and it will be able to evaluate this

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.360
particular inputs and then eventually it will try to give a

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:41.440
output. So ideally I'm going to create a function, a

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.240
function which will be able to take this kind of an input.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:49.460
It will be able to evaluate it and then after evaluating, so

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:53.040
it will try to do a math, it will try to do a calculation.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.900
And you all will be able to get a final output. That is a

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.360
very first function I'm going to create. So forget about

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:02.080
agents and everything, right? Forget about tools. Forget

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:06.240
about agents. Let's just talk about creating a simple plane

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.680
function. So which is going to take input as an expression,

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:14.320
any string it is going to take as an input and then it will

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.240
be able to give me the output. Forget about agents, right?

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.880
Forget about everything. Like forget about like, uh, all

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.740
those elements. Let's just focus on creating. I'm just

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.060
creating a simple function. So here I am going to create a

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:30.840
calculator. C L C U L A T O R. Right. So let's try to create

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:34.140
this calculator and which is going to take input. So input

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.820
wise it is going to take, let's suppose a string as an

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.740
input. So I have written expression. So expression string as

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.800
an input and then it will be able to give me a string as an

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:47.740
output. The reason I'm trying to like, give a string as an

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:50.660
input is very simple because whenever you will try to

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:53.120
interact or my system will try to interact. interact with

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:56.220
this particular function, so obviously it is going to

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:59.960
interact it with the natural language, right. So where you

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.300
are going to give everything as a string, as simple as that.

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:06.920
So keeping that in a mind, I am trying to create a kind of a

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:10.000
function, so which will take input as a string, even though

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.580
it is a mathematical function, but still it will try to take

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:16.660
input as a string, not a numeric value or then it will try

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:19.520
to understand each and everything and then eventually it

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:23.920
will try to perform some sort of a operation. Now so here

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:29.940
let me write down a doc string over here. So evaluate a

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:34.480
numeric math expression,

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:43.290
right, supports may be like a plus or minus or may be into,

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:47.370
may be like a division, may be a power, right.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:54.980
May be a power. Parenthesis and all kind of mathematical

00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:00.640
functions, yeah. Something like that I have written over

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.940
here as a doc string. So this is just a definition of the

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:07.740
function which I have mentioned over here. Now so how it

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:10.640
will be able to perform an operation. So let's try to

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:14.420
understand those things over here. So here what we are going

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:18.180
to allow, what we are not going to allow as an input. So we

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:21.940
have to define those things. So here. So here I am going to

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:28.300
create a variable called as allowed underscore nodes, yeah.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:31.080
So what and all things are allowed, what and all things are

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.180
not allowed. So we can try to mention it over here so that

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:38.540
it will be able to like evaluate all the inputs and then

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:42.360
based on that it will try to give all kind of a output. So

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.940
here in a beginning itself, so we have done an import of

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:49.800
AST. Now what is this AST by the way? So AST is nothing but

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.980
inside a Python. It is a library. So which is called as

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:58.060
abstract syntax tree, yeah. So abstract syntax tree. So

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:02.680
basically what it does, so it will try to evaluate a math

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:06.380
expression as a string basically. This is what this AST

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:09.740
does, abstract syntax tree does. So basically it will try to

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:12.180
break it down. So let's suppose if I have written a string

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:17.480
means inside a code 2 plus 3. So it will try to parse that

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.720
string. It will try to break down that. Okay. Just like a

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.120
tree, it will try to break down. So maybe you can think in

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:26.320
this way, abstract syntax tree. So those who are coming from

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.180
a computer science like compiler design kind of a

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:31.200
background, they will be able to understand it easily. So

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.120
for example, I have 2 plus 3, right. So this is basically a

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.600
string and inside a string, I have a mathematical

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:41.160
expression. So what this AST kind of a library will do, so

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.740
basically it will try to create a tree. So maybe it will try

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:47.840
to keep plus over here, 2 over here, 3 over here, right, out

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.640
of this string. it will try to. And then it will send this

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.720
one to a compiler for the evaluation. So this is what

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:58.280
abstract syntax tree does. It take any kind of a

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:01.100
mathematical expression as an input as a string and then

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.920
like create a tree kind of a structure so that one by one,

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.540
one by one, it will start evaluating it. And this is a very

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:10.940
simple expression, right? Maybe I can write something like a

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:17.920
2 plus 3 into 4 plus 8 divided by 2 plus like, you know, 2

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:21.020
to the power. Something like 4.5. Something like 4 and we

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:24.280
have to basically create some sort of a calculation or we

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.460
have to do this particular math. So obviously it will try to

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:29.100
create a tree kind of a structure, one by one, one by one,

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:32.060
one by one in order it will start solving it and then

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:34.520
finally you will be able to get the output. So this is what

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.720
happens even internally, right. So whenever you will

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.620
interact with a computer and the current one that you are

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.260
interacting, this is how computer will try to understand,

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:45.340
this is how computer will be able to break it down. So this

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:48.060
is where this AST comes into a picture. So here what I will

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.920
do. So I will try to like a write down over here that what

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:55.600
is allowed and what is not allowed basically. So here

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:59.540
allowed wise, so I can try to write so abstract syntax tree

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:04.020
and maybe I can allow some of these expression, right. So I

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:07.560
can allow maybe expression, unity operation, binary

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:12.020
operation, a numeric operation, right. Maybe I can allow

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:18.290
more. So I can allow maybe a load operation. Maybe I can

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:23.470
allow. Uh. Maybe I can allow AST dot POW power operation. It

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:24.990
will be able to do AST,

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:33.760
AST addition operation, function operation, model. So I can,

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.920
I can just this like a entire list is infinite list, right.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.840
So I'm just trying to mention that, okay, uh, inside this

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.560
tuple that, okay, these are the operation which is allowed

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:46.500
and uh, maybe it will try to evaluate each and every

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.940
expression which I'm going to give an intern. So here I'm

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:51.520
just trying to prepare the list, nothing much, uh, as you

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:55.820
can see, right. So this is literally a allowed node. Now

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:59.720
where I'm going to use it, right. And what is this binary

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.000
operation? So for example, if I'm doing two plus three, it's

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.180
basically a binary operation. Uh, what is basically a call?

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:07.940
So call is nothing but let's suppose if I'm writing sign is

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:11.380
sign 30 or sign 90. So that is something called as like a

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:14.460
function calls. Uh, what is the meaning of this name? Uh,

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:18.000
somewhere. Okay. So name I have not mentioned. Fine. Let's

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.520
mention name. So what is the meaning of this name? So name

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.540
is nothing. But let's suppose if I'm trying to call some

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:25.700
function by PI or cause, so basically the other names, which

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.980
is already defined inside a Python programming language,

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:31.780
right? Uh, meaning of constant is nothing but basically I'm

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:34.480
trying to perform some sort of a is equal to one kind of

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.820
operation. So here I'm just trying to like a mention that,

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.560
okay, these are the operation which is allowed. And uh,

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:44.100
whenever I'm going to pass something as a string, so you can

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.060
perform these allowed operation, right? You can perform this

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:49.760
allowed operation, but this is just a list which I've

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.080
created or technically. It's a tuple, right? Symbol wise,

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:55.780
it's a tuple that I have created over here now. So what I

00:26:55.780 --> 00:27:00.120
will do, I will try to parse this entire things. So allowed

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.440
node I have already created, we'll try to parse this entire

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:12.130
things. So here I can create maybe like a explanation and I

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:21.050
can say that, okay, uh, for key and a value pair in

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:27.910
basically variable math dot item, okay, so this is one of

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:30.270
the expression which I have written. This is just a follow

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:32.690
which I have written. So for key and value inside a

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:36.810
variables basically, and I'm just trying to extract all

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:39.770
those items from this variable and I'm trying to say that,

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:42.330
that if it is not going to start with under the score, so

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:44.850
what is the meaning of this? So if it is not going to start

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:47.330
with the under the score, simply means that, that if it is

00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:51.510
not a private one. Right? So basically it will try to find

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:54.390
out the private one and it will not try to parse the private

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:58.630
one. So in this situation, try to return what? Try to return

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:02.910
basically key and a value pair. And I'm just trying to like

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:08.650
keep it inside a variable called as allowed underscore names

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:12.730
that, okay, so whatever which falls under this criteria,

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:16.150
which is not a private one. So always try to allow this

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:22.350
particular name. And then here, so I can try to call allowed

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:30.330
name dot maybe like update, maybe some expression I can try

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:32.990
to keep. Right? Some expression I will try to keep over here

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:36.650
so that it will allow maybe a built in function. So this abs

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:40.070
is a built in function round is a built in function. Maybe I

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:44.250
can try to add a couple of more over here. So minimum

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:48.590
maximum. So these functions are basically inbuilt functions.

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:50.330
So I'm just saying that, okay, fine. These things are

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:53.590
basically allowed. You can try to take this function as a

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:59.630
input by the way. Now what is next? So next is that, that

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:08.970
I'm going to say that, okay, AST dot parse and parse

00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:12.690
expression and mode is equals to evaluate. So just try to

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:17.010
pass any kind of expression means pass this string and then

00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:20.750
mode is equal. To evaluate. So just try to evaluate this

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:24.450
one. So it will try to just pass it and then let's store it

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:27.610
inside a variable called as node. Some random variable

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:30.250
inside a node. Let's try to store it. Let's try to hold this

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:34.850
one right now. This is nothing to do with the agents by the

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:37.930
way. Nothing to do literally means agent. I'm just trying to

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:41.130
say that, okay, what is allowed and what is not allowed? As

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:44.210
simple as that. Nothing to do with any kind of agent which I

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:46.950
have created. I'm simply trying to say that, that, okay, it

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:49.870
will try to take a string as an input. And what kind of

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:53.550
expression is allowed means what kind of evaluation this

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:56.710
function will be able to do and what it will not be able to

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:59.430
do. So simple, whatever is private, it will not be able to

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:02.050
do that. And whatever it is not private, it will try to do

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:08.270
that as simple as that now. So here, once this allow list is

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:12.630
created, once this allow list is created for me, then what I

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:16.810
can do, so I can try to maybe call a loop and inside a loop,

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:20.450
I can try to run it. So basically whenever some input will

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:23.670
come, right, whenever some input will come inside this

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:28.200
particular node, let's suppose if I'm trying to create

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:32.200
something like a 2 plus 3. So whenever this input, this kind

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.000
of an input will come means this node will come over here.

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:39.020
Anyhow it is trying to evaluate this expression with the

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:42.460
help of AST, right? So with the help of AST, it is able to

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:45.840
pass it and it is able to evaluate it. Now once it will be

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:49.160
able to evaluate it, so I'm going to create a walk. Walk

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:54.100
means, so first take 2, then 2 plus, do this one, then plus

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:57.660
this one. So this is something called as walk, walk inside a

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:01.240
tree. This is how AST internally works or this is how your

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:04.720
event compiler or your computer works by the way. So one by

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:07.720
one, one by one, it will create a walk. It will go from here

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.560
to here maybe, maybe here to here or maybe it will start

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:14.380
with this one. It will keep plus over here, then on a left

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:16.640
hand side there is a 2, on a right hand side there is a 3.

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:19.600
So this is something called as a walk. Walk inside a

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:24.140
abstract syntax tree means technically a string which I'm

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:27.320
going to pass. So abstract syntax tree will try to go

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:30.720
through a walk. It's basically a core like computer science

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:34.740
fundamentals. This is how like the entire system is going to

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:38.520
work and evaluate any kind of a string that we are going to

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:42.420
pass. So let's try to create a walk for this one. I can

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:48.260
write over here that for n in AST walk node. It means just

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:51.340
try to go through any kind of an expression, 2 plus 3 kind

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:55.140
of an expression that we have given. Walk it. AST.walk. So

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:57.520
walk is an inbuilt function. Walk inside what? Walk inside

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:00.160
the node. It means expression that we have passed. The tree

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.940
internally it is going to create. Just try to walk through

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:13.420
this entire tree and then do what? So if not in a instance

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:19.420
allowed node. So if this walk. Walk is not allowed means if

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:24.200
I have not allowed here. So in that situation do what? So in

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:27.580
that situation raise the exception because I have given a

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:31.680
couple of allowed node right that you can try to perform the

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.060
unary operation, binary operation, number operation,

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:38.900
argument operation, constant operation, module operation,

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:42.860
power operation, load kind of operation. Now again there can

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:46.280
be another hundreds of other walk which I can try to create

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.420
or another. There are hundreds of I can say expression which

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:52.240
I can allow but I have not allowed all. I have just allowed

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:56.500
some of it right. I have just allowed some of it I would

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:59.320
say. So here I am trying to say that okay so whenever you

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:03.840
are trying to walk through a tree basically always make sure

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:08.680
that if this tree element right n basically is a part of

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:14.740
allowed node it's fine if it is not right if it is not in

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:17.460
that case try to raise the expression and say that that okay

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:20.600
this is a invalid node. So the node that you have created

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.800
means the walk that you are trying to do. So basically it's

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:30.220
not a valid one. Otherwise is instance of ast.name. So if it

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.920
is a part of the name so in that case say that okay fine so

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.960
basically it's a valid one. So in this way I am just trying

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.520
to label I am just trying to evaluate that okay which is

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:42.560
allowed and which is not allowed by the way yeah which is

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:47.340
allowed which is not allowed. And then. If. If this is fine

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:52.300
if this is done then in that situation do one thing so try

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:55.940
to compile it yeah try to compile it. So basically I am

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:59.340
trying to call a compile function over here and compile a

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:04.620
particular node as a string and evaluate it right as a

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:08.060
string. So this compile is going to compile your entire tree

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:11.260
that you are going to create like two plus three again

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:17.180
example. So if it is a tree. So just try to evaluate this

00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:19.700
particular tree. So first check the condition if condition

00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:24.160
is satisfied its condition is valid it's well and good. Just

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:27.460
try to compile that one. So this is where I am trying to

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:31.820
compile my entire node and basically like trying to evaluate

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:35.020
this entire node so that I will be able to get 2 plus 3 is

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:38.760
equals to 5 or any other expression. So maybe if I am trying

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:41.900
to do like a sign of 90 so it will be try to evaluate it and

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:46.520
finally. It will try to give me the output. Now this is a

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:49.740
very basic and simple function I have created which will

00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:53.580
take a string as an input so that my LLM will be able to

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:56.500
access it and evaluate it and finally it will try to give me

00:34:56.500 --> 00:35:01.280
the output if it is a valid one if it is a valid one allowed

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:04.480
one if it is not allowed one it is not going to give me the

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:08.580
output. Okay that's cool. So a string based function I have

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:12.520
created for mathematical evaluation. Right. And this is a

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:16.100
normal function so far. Now how I will be able to convert

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:22.600
this function as a tool in terms of like using this agentic

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:26.760
AI. So obviously I have to convert any of this function as a

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:31.360
tool so that whenever I am going to say that evaluate sign

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:37.060
90 right whenever I will say that okay evaluate 2 plus 3 it

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:39.940
should know or my system should know that there is a

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:43.660
registered tool. There is a tool which is available inside

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:48.660
me and the tool which I can use and I can try to maybe give

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:52.460
this particular output. I will try to perform this kind of

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:55.160
operation. So how I will try to convert this one this

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:59.200
function as a tool. It's very simple. Just try to call a

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:03.060
decorator. What a decorator. So here we have already done an

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:06.640
import of tool from a lang chain. So from a lang chain code.

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.880
So we have already done the import. So what you have to do.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:14.120
So you have to just place a decorator over here and just try

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:18.280
to call tool decorator and then maybe you can try to give a

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:22.980
name to this decorator clculator so calculator right. So

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:27.240
just you have to give a name to this like a tool that okay

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:30.780
this is a now registered tool. So you have to just call a

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:33.700
decorator. That's it right. And this is something that we

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:36.040
have already done as an import from a lang chain code. So

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.800
this is how my lang chain library will be able to understand

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.780
that. Okay there is a function which takes input as a string

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:46.360
and then it try to evaluate this entire things with the help

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:49.920
of AST abstract syntax tree and it will try to do the

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.880
calculation and it will be able to give me the output. Is it

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:56.700
making sense guys to all of us. This function is bit weird.

00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:00.260
I understand that part but again not that weird by the way.

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.760
So I'm just trying to create not a regular calculation

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:05.920
function not a calculator kind of a function. So where it

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:09.380
will try to like evaluate if plus. Then do this. If minus

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:12.140
then do this. But I'm trying to create a function which will

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:16.100
try to take input as a string because I have to provide this

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:19.000
function to my LLMs and obviously when LLMs comes into a

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.340
picture it's a natural language right. Technically it's a

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:26.120
string by which you will try to interact with your LLMs. So

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:29.280
this is something that you have to do. Now let me send you

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.900
this code to all of you.

00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:46.610
Okay so here is half of the code and then here is the

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:51.210
another half of the code. Yeah. So I just pinged you the

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:52.990
code guys in two pieces.

00:37:57.310 --> 00:38:02.770
Yeah the way of coding is getting changed now. It's not a

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:05.790
way of coding. It's just basically like writing a function

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:08.390
so which can take a string as an input even for the

00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:11.370
mathematical expression. And here I have introduced one

00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:15.450
library called as AST abstract syntax tree. So technically

00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:18.830
this always takes input as a string it like do the

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:22.550
evaluation and internally computer will try to do the

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:27.090
computes. I saw this kind of a call first time. Yeah. So

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:32.230
welcome to the reality then. Okay fine. So this is one kind

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:36.450
of a function that we have created. Now execute it. Leave

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:38.910
it. Yeah. Execute it. Leave it. We are not calling this

00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:42.850
function. And then you have to register basically this

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:44.770
particular tool or maybe you have to keep this particular

00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:48.770
tool inside some sort of a list. So let's try to like a call

00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:54.470
tools. T double O L S tools. Underscore math. Let's create a

00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:57.370
variable and let's keep this calculator tool that we have

00:38:57.370 --> 00:38:59.810
created like this calculator tool that we have created.

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:05.050
Let's keep it inside a list. Simple. So this is one of the

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:09.170
tools that we have created now. So once this tool is

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:13.990
created, right, once this tool is created, now what we have

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:19.290
to do. So basically we have to create basically a reactive

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:22.530
prompt. Right. We have to create basically a reactive

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:26.110
prompt. Now what this reactive prompt will do. So this

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:29.870
reactive prompt will try to understand this tool. It will

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:33.310
try to create a kind of an interface with my LLMs. So

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:37.030
whenever you will start chatting, so this reactive prompt is

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:40.290
going to help me out or help my LLMs basically that, okay,

00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:43.210
so I have this tool available with me. Maybe you can try to

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:46.590
call it. Yeah. Maybe you can try to call it. So let's try to

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:49.250
create a reactive prompt. Are you able to copy and paste

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:52.870
this? This is the above one guys, everyone initial

00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:02.380
download. Okay. Initial. Yeah. So this is like a import

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:09.060
guys. Here is my LLMs by the way, change with your API key.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:16.700
And again, I'm giving you this code of this tool in bits and

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:20.980
pieces in two pieces by the way. Yeah. So now it's available

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:27.500
to all of you. Okay. So here, right? So here what we are

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:32.120
going to do, so we are going to create a kind of a prompt, a

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:35.880
prompt which will be able to understand this particular tool

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:39.120
that I have created and it will behave like a kind of a

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:43.000
interface, right? A kind of a middleware in between my LLMs

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.320
and in between my functions. So it will, it will understand

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.620
that. Okay. So whenever I'm going to do some sort of a

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:52.220
calculation, so obviously it has to call this tool. It has

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:54.520
to call this tool because there will be hundreds of tools

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.900
that we are going to attach, right? For example, if I'm

00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:59.220
trying to send a message over a WhatsApp, over a Telegram

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:03.920
and over a email. So obviously I have to define that in case

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:07.680
of WhatsApp, what function I have to call means what tool I

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.820
have to call in case of Telegram, it should understand that,

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:13.540
okay, which one I'm supposed to call and in case of a Gmail,

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:16.120
it should understand that which one I'm supposed to call

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:20.500
here. It's just a function I have written, right? Nowhere. I

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:23.680
have mentioned that. What this will be able to do in a

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:27.700
natural language. So this is where this prompt will come

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:30.840
into a picture. So let's try to write down this particular

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:34.920
prompt so that system will be able to understand now here to

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:38.420
create a prompt for this particular tools or create a

00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:42.080
reactive prompt for this particular tool. Let's try to

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:49.440
import basically a chat prompt, chat prompt template. So

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.200
there is something called a chat prompt template. Which we

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:57.480
have already import, right? So somewhere we have done the

00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:01.080
import for a chat prompt template

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:12.380
and then here chat prompt template from a message and

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:14.880
basically we are going to define. So we are going to define

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:19.560
a message over here that what you are supposed to perform by

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:24.700
the way. Let me close this square bracket and this

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:27.240
particular bracket. Now here. I'm going to define the

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:30.800
message. I'm going to define a system message by the way.

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:34.520
Technically I'm going to give a prompt over here. So here

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:38.440
key wise I'm going to say that that okay, you are basically

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:43.740
a system. So you are basically a system and you are

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:51.170
basically precise mathematical. You can say, let me remove

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:53.910
this part. Let me write down this prompt from the scratch.

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:59.630
So here I can write that you are. You are a precise math

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:09.380
assistant. You can use these tools by the way, tools over

00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:13.500
here and here. So what I will do. So I'll just try to define

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:21.860
my tools in this particular place. Yeah. Now so I can say

00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:26.760
that that when you are going to use this tool. When you are.

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:31.900
Going. Going to use this tool,

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:37.700
follow these, these

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:41.840
instruction,

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:49.820
exactly the same, yeah, exactly the same format now. So what

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:53.580
I can, uh, like, uh, give us an, like a format over here. So

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:57.520
I'll simply say in terms of prompt that, okay. So whenever

00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:00.700
you will receive a question, let's suppose questions,

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:07.160
whenever you are going to receive. So basically give a

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:07.440
thought.

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:15.180
Give a thought and then after giving a thought, you should

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:18.680
call technically an action, right? So you should call

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:22.540
technically an action based on the input, uh, not this slash

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:24.340
slash and let's suppose a new line,

00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:30.350
new line, new

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:39.000
line, new line. Yeah. So I'm just trying to say that, that,

00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:42.180
okay. So whenever you will get some sort of a question, so

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:45.660
always think through it, then try to call the action. And

00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:48.980
with the help of, so whenever you are trying to call this

00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:53.240
action, let me remove this observation means you can write

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:55.820
it down in your own way, basically it's a natural language

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:59.260
which I'm using. So you can try to write down. So action,

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:08.480
just try to call the action by using the action by using one

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:15.360
of the tools above or one of the tool. Okay. Click the

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:15.360
control button in my right hand corner. So the tool's going

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:19.960
to not give you the access I can write that you have and

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:23.980
maybe in a list, I can try to give tool

00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:33.480
underscore names. Yeah. So I can, I'm just simply saying

00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.840
that, that, uh, okay. So whenever you will try to get any

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:40.860
kind of a inputs, try to use one of my tool, which I have

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:45.560
already created. Yeah. Um, again, you can, you can try to

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.840
modify this one. You can try to manipulate this one. It's

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:51.240
completely up to you. No one is going to like a stop you.

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:54.060
from modifying this one. It's just a natural language which

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:57.300
I am trying to use. So maybe my way of writing this one will

00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:00.240
be different and your way will be different. And then I can

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:05.980
try to give like an instruction that always finish with

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:10.780
final answer.

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:18.340
And specific instruction wise, so always give

00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:28.020
me a numeric answer. Although I am giving you like a string,

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:33.120
but just try to give me a final answer into a numeric one.

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:35.900
So this is the instruction which I have given to my system

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:39.700
that never try to give me a string as an output, but try to

00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:44.280
give me always a numeric one simple as simple as that over

00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:50.540
here now. So this is basically a chat prompt template and

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:53.600
here. So let's suppose I'm going to store it inside one of

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:55.140
the variable react.

00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:08.690
So maybe inside this, I'm going to store it inside this

00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:12.150
variable. I'm going to store it now. This is and you can try

00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:15.050
to make it even more detailed. So let's suppose if my system

00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:18.030
is not able to understand the tools, right? So I can try to

00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:22.190
make it more flexible. I can try to write more and more in

00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:25.370
terms of giving an instruction so that my system is going to

00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:28.290
behave in that way because whatever prompt that you are

00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:30.890
going to write, it's going to behave accordingly. Right?

00:47:31.290 --> 00:47:33.630
Because your elements are not going to understand these

00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:36.830
things. Your elements are going to understand this and based

00:47:36.830 --> 00:47:40.290
on this, it is going to call the action at the end of the

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:43.290
day and whenever we try to give this action, so always we

00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:45.790
try to mention the question, then thought processing, then

00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:48.670
action, then action input, maybe like observation and

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:53.110
finally the output, it will be able to give it to me. It is

00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:56.250
going to follow the same sequences. If I have not mentioned

00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:59.510
something inside the sequences, I think I have mentioned

00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:03.630
action two times. Yeah. So it will call action, action. So

00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:07.790
it's better question, thought, action using one of the tool.

00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:15.450
Simple. So this is just a simple prompt. Take this one so

00:48:15.450 --> 00:48:18.690
that my elements will be able to behave accordingly. Now

00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:22.910
once this part is done, right? Once this part is done, means

00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:26.570
once I am able to basically create this particular prompt,

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:32.450
then what I am supposed to do? So then I can try to create a

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:35.830
agent. So how I will be able to create an agent. So far we

00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:38.990
have not created the agent. So far we have two independent

00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:41.870
things. This is the independent function, right? I have

00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:44.850
converted this into a tools obviously with the help of this

00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:48.870
decorator from a lang chain and this is just a prompt that I

00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:51.210
have created for this one. But both of these things are

00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:55.050
almost independent, right? Almost independent. So how I will

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:59.490
be able to convert this entire things? Yes. I have created

00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:03.750
an agent. Means how I will be able to combine and how I will

00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:08.030
be able to attach with the LLMs, right? The LLM which I have

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:11.950
already created. So here we have done the import by the way,

00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:16.390
create reactive agent. This is the import that we have done.

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:19.210
Now I am going to use this function which is going to help

00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:22.790
me out to convert anything into the agents by the way. So

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:28.190
here I can try to call create reactive agent and what we are

00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:31.910
going to attach? So we are going to attach basically LLMs,

00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:36.610
right? We are going to attach a prompt by the way, yes? And

00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:40.310
then we are going to attach a tool. Which tool? The tool

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:42.610
which I have registered. I can register one. I can register

00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:45.350
many. Basically it is a list, right? It is a list. So

00:49:45.350 --> 00:49:48.350
basically I have registered only calculator. So this is a

00:49:48.350 --> 00:49:51.730
way, this is creating an agent by the way, right? This is

00:49:51.730 --> 00:49:55.030
creating an agent. Now this agent is having what? This agent

00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:58.370
is having LLM access, right? Right. This agent is having an

00:49:58.370 --> 00:50:01.450
instruction in terms of prompt and this agent is having a

00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:04.830
real function. So which will be able to do the final job,

00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:08.270
whatever job it was designed for basically. So this is

00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:14.130
technically a agent. Simple, right? And everywhere you can

00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:16.750
try to set any different, different kind of LLMs. Let's

00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:19.090
suppose if I would like to like attach a LLMs which can

00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:22.210
generate the images. If I would like to attach a LLMs which

00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:24.330
will, for some of the tool, right? Let's suppose I am

00:50:24.330 --> 00:50:27.530
creating a tool where this is not the point. This is not the

00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:29.410
purpose. Mathematical calculation is not the purpose, but

00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:32.530
maybe it should generate the images or it should basically

00:50:32.530 --> 00:50:36.610
call some of the voice based LLMs, right? And then it should

00:50:36.610 --> 00:50:39.990
perform some sort of a job. It's completely fine on an agent

00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:44.070
basis, right? On an agent basis, I can try to attach any of

00:50:44.070 --> 00:50:47.150
my LLMs. Yeah. At different, different LLMs. Let's suppose I

00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:49.890
have to use 10 or 20 LLMs, right? Some for image, some for

00:50:49.890 --> 00:50:53.250
embedding, some for maybe like a chat completion, some for

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:56.410
streaming, some for image. Yeah. Yeah. So I can try to

00:50:56.410 --> 00:51:00.470
attach all of those LLMs separately. I can try to provide

00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:03.850
the instruction separately and I can try to attach a

00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:07.830
function separately. So in one single agent, I can try to

00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:10.570
attach even a multiple functions. That's completely fine

00:51:10.570 --> 00:51:13.070
because this tool math which I have created, technically

00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:16.570
it's a list, right? Technically it's a list. So I can try to

00:51:16.570 --> 00:51:19.870
give any n number of functions for this agent. So one agent

00:51:19.870 --> 00:51:23.470
can have a multiple access and every agent can have a

00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:26.790
separate separate LLM access as well. Right? And every agent

00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:30.510
will be having a separate instruction in a natural language

00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:33.410
basically. Right? The way they I'm trying to give over here.

00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:37.210
Is it making sense guys? Are we able to understand what we

00:51:37.210 --> 00:51:41.590
have done so far? Yeah. Now try to understand from this

00:51:41.590 --> 00:51:45.070
side, from here. Right? Don't try to understand from like a

00:51:45.070 --> 00:51:47.530
top to bottom. Now from bottom to top, try to understand

00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:51.330
what we have done. So I'm trying to create a smart basically

00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:55.730
a process over here. Right? And now that smart process is

00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:58.990
having a LLM access. That smart process is having an

00:51:58.990 --> 00:52:02.150
instruction in terms of natural language. Right? And that

00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:05.230
smart process is having some functional access and that

00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:10.090
function I'm calling as a tool. Yeah. So I believe we all

00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:13.270
are able to understand what is the meaning of tool. What is

00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:17.330
the meaning of a tool calling? Right? LLM anyhow we

00:52:17.330 --> 00:52:20.190
understand. Right? So I'm just trying to show you that I can

00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:24.770
provide a separate LLMs to a separate separate. Because like

00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:29.530
I said, some agent may need a, some sort of a LLMs, which

00:52:29.530 --> 00:52:33.190
can generate images, which can deal with the TTS text to

00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:36.710
speech or a speech to text, right? Which may interact with

00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:39.410
the embeddings. I can create such kind of agents, which will

00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:42.170
try to pass the entire document, convert those document to

00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:44.990
embeddings, store those things into a vector DB or somewhere

00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:48.470
else. Right? There can be a infinite number of different,

00:52:48.590 --> 00:52:51.690
different tasks, which I can automate. So every one should

00:52:51.690 --> 00:52:53.930
be a custom one. And this is what we are trying to do.

00:52:56.990 --> 00:53:04.440
Yes. Yeah. Making sense to all of us guys. So when you will

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:07.680
start looking from this side, it will give you better

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:11.000
understanding by the way. Yeah. It will give you a better

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.140
understanding getting error. So maybe just check the

00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:16.760
indentation over here because of this indentation, it might

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:19.800
have given you a, like a error. Otherwise I don't see any

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:24.100
other reason by the way. Yeah. So here we have created this

00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:28.420
agent. Okay. So. So now let's try to, you know, store this

00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:30.660
one into one of the variables. So I'm going to call this

00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:34.320
variable as a agent, what agent math variable, let's

00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:36.520
suppose. So this is a mathematical agent, which I have

00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:40.920
created by a kind of autonomous, like a entity, which will

00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:44.100
be able to use the LLMs, which will be able to use my

00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:47.540
instruction and which will be able to call some of my tools,

00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:50.580
a function, right? Which will be able to call some of the

00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:54.720
function. So this is my prompt missing the required variable

00:53:54.720 --> 00:54:00.740
agent. A scratch pad. Uh, okay. So missing the required

00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:03.840
variable. Fine. Let me attach this agent, a scratch pad

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:09.440
inside this prompt agent, a scratch pad. I have not

00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:14.720
mentioned. So here agent, a scratch pad is going to be,

00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:19.180
let's suppose I'm going to write human and then humans are

00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:22.700
going to give questions in

00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:27.620
the put. And then.

00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:43.860
Yeah. So I'm going to write, agent underscore is C R a T C H

00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:46.060
P a D and,

00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:56.660
uh, here, so let me close this one. Yeah. So that it should

00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:58.520
not give me any error. Okay.

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:06.100
This looks fine, but it is still okay. Because of maybe this

00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:07.880
one, it is giving me an error or

00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:16.190
agent scratch pad and then message

00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:22.710
placeholder variable

00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:27.010
name history. Okay.

00:55:31.570 --> 00:55:34.390
This looks fine, but, uh, okay.

00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:45.730
Input and then slash and agent is scratch pad and

00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:59.270
then closing the bracket was not closed. No, I'm closing it

00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.550
here.

00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:19.700
Uh, somewhere I'm missing the parenthesis because of that.

00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:22.760
It's telling me that it's closed, but I have closed it.

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:28.180
Yeah. I'm closing it. So human. Okay. So human fine. Okay.

00:56:29.540 --> 00:56:33.120
So a quotes was a mistake, uh, inside the human. So human, I

00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:36.340
have opened, but yeah, I have not closed it. Fine. So agent

00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:43.980
scratch pad. Now this is the final one we can try to use. So

00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:46.240
hopefully this should not give an issue now.

00:57:00.070 --> 00:57:02.850
So basically this, it was looking for a agent scratch pad.

00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:05.630
What it does, uh, let me try to explain you this part. So

00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:08.650
here, whenever humans are going to ask a question, so what

00:57:08.650 --> 00:57:11.490
agent scratch pad will do. So it will try to do a reasoning.

00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:14.390
So you must have seen that, uh, your elements does. Our

00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:17.010
reasoning reasoning means, so it will always try to keep a

00:57:17.010 --> 00:57:20.910
memory before calling a tools. It means it will try to like

00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:23.510
a check the memory that, okay, so whether something is

00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:25.710
available inside my memory or not, this is something called

00:57:25.710 --> 00:57:29.770
as agent scratch pad. Now let me execute now. So prompt

00:57:29.770 --> 00:57:32.490
missing required variable. Okay. I have also already

00:57:32.490 --> 00:57:33.910
provided agent scratch pad.

00:57:36.530 --> 00:57:39.250
Now it's fine. Yeah. So basically this is what agent scratch

00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:42.530
pad does. It will try to look into the memory, right before

00:57:42.530 --> 00:57:44.950
any kind of a function calling. So before calling this

00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:47.950
particular function. Uh, as per this instruction, which is

00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:50.590
given inside the prompt. So it will try to call the memory

00:57:50.590 --> 00:57:53.490
and uh, it will try to like a see the observation. So

00:57:53.490 --> 00:57:56.110
basically it's called as a reasoning, uh, trace traces

00:57:56.110 --> 00:57:58.830
basically. So this is how like a reasoning happens by the

00:57:58.830 --> 00:58:03.910
way, by referring it to a prior experiences. Okay. So here

00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:07.590
we are able to create the agent. Now once we are able to

00:58:07.590 --> 00:58:11.470
create this particular agent, let's attach a memory into

00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:14.650
this particular agent. Yeah. Let's try to attach some of the

00:58:14.650 --> 00:58:19.190
memory into this particular agent. Uh, and again, so agent

00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:21.710
wise, I can try to attach a different, different kind of a

00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:25.830
memory over here. So here I'm going to call conversation,

00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:29.910
conversation buffer memory. So there are so many different,

00:58:29.970 --> 00:58:33.030
different kinds of memory, which I have called. So here I'm

00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:36.810
going to call a conversation buffer memory and I'm going to

00:58:36.810 --> 00:58:41.570
attach to it. Yeah. So here, memory key is going to be,

00:58:41.610 --> 00:58:44.370
let's suppose a chat header. History return message. So

00:58:44.370 --> 00:58:49.110
obviously it's going to be true and uh, here, so chat memory

00:58:49.110 --> 00:58:54.730
fine. I can try to attach maybe a input key as an input and

00:58:54.730 --> 00:58:59.370
then maybe output key as a output. So this is a memory which

00:58:59.370 --> 00:59:02.770
I'm going to attach conversation buffer memory over here,

00:59:02.830 --> 00:59:07.330
which is again one kind of a memory. So it is going to keep

00:59:07.330 --> 00:59:09.950
everything, whatever discussion that we have done with

00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:12.490
respect to this agent. So it will try to keep each and

00:59:12.490 --> 00:59:17.310
everything inside a memory. This is what it means. So let me

00:59:17.310 --> 00:59:19.930
create it separately. As of now, I'm not attaching, so I'm

00:59:19.930 --> 00:59:22.850
just trying to create it separately. So memory, I can name

00:59:22.850 --> 00:59:28.910
it as a memory underscore math. So one of the memory I have

00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:31.490
created conversation buffer memory. I can try to create even

00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:34.270
a conversation buffer window memory. I can try to create a

00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:36.810
entity based memory, which will try to remember name and

00:59:36.810 --> 00:59:40.950
place all those things. So this is something. This is

00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:44.970
something which I have created now ticket conversation

00:59:44.970 --> 00:59:49.890
buffer memory. Okay. Now once we are able to like a create

00:59:49.890 --> 00:59:54.950
this conversation buffer memory, then how I will be able to

00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:59.230
execute it, right? How I will be able to execute this entire

00:59:59.230 --> 01:00:01.930
things because everything is like a available into a

01:00:01.930 --> 01:00:05.910
complete fragmented way. So to execute this one, I have to

01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:09.570
call something called as agent executor, agent, agent

01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:11.250
executor, the important thing. This is the import that we

01:00:11.250 --> 01:00:15.530
have done. So this agent executor is going to help me out to

01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:20.170
call this entire agent at the end of the day. So here agent

01:00:20.170 --> 01:00:24.150
name is equal to agent math, right? And agent math is by

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:27.530
default calling its tool LLMs and like a prompt, right? So

01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:30.270
by default it's calling tool prompt each and everything. So

01:00:30.270 --> 01:00:33.210
I'm just trying to call agent executor the import that I

01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:35.930
have done before and I'm trying to provide that. Okay, fine.

01:00:36.030 --> 01:00:40.010
So agent math tool is basically tool math. Memory is

01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:42.790
basically memory. Memory math, verbose is equal to true

01:00:42.790 --> 01:00:46.370
means whatever it will do internally, try to print. If you

01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:48.130
are going to make it false, it will not try to print

01:00:48.130 --> 01:00:50.470
something in your console. But yeah, if you are making it

01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:53.810
true, it will try to print it and handle parsing error is

01:00:53.810 --> 01:01:03.030
equals to, maybe I can try to write handle parsing error as

01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:05.030
a detailed instruction over here.

01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:11.060
You did not follow the follow.

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:21.180
The section that I have given to you, use the tool, yeah,

01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:25.640
use the tool only. So something like that. So whenever it

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:28.880
will like, uh, see the error, this is going to like, uh,

01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:32.560
give it, give it as a print as simple as that. And then I

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:38.900
can try to not invoke. Let's leave it. Yeah. Get it

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:42.960
separately. So this is my agent executor. Now. Math.

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:51.710
Underscore. E-A-X-E-C-U-U-T-O-R. So this is a variable which

01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:55.090
I have created called as math executor. And I have attached

01:01:55.090 --> 01:02:00.550
all of the component of my agent. So agent math, this one,

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:03.550
memory I have already attached, tool I have already

01:02:03.550 --> 01:02:05.610
attached. So these things are required for any kind of

01:02:05.610 --> 01:02:09.710
agent. Now it's ready for a call by the way. So once we are

01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:14.890
able to do this, now it's technically ready for a call. I

01:02:14.890 --> 01:02:18.410
can try to like. I can start calling all of these agents one

01:02:18.410 --> 01:02:23.890
by one, one by one. And maybe I can start using this

01:02:23.890 --> 01:02:27.690
particular agent in a sequential manner. Just just by

01:02:27.690 --> 01:02:31.110
calling like a invoke over here. Yeah. Just by calling

01:02:31.110 --> 01:02:34.670
invoke over here. So this is how agent creation has been

01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:37.310
done guys. So this is the final point. Now after this final

01:02:37.310 --> 01:02:39.810
point, I can directly go ahead and I can start calling this

01:02:39.810 --> 01:02:42.690
agent. But yeah, if I have a multiple agents, so in that

01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:45.830
case I have to create even a dispatcher. Dispatcher means

01:02:45.830 --> 01:02:49.230
like a route basically, which will be able to decide which

01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:52.110
agent I'm supposed to use. So far I just have only one

01:02:52.110 --> 01:02:55.870
agent. I don't have like, you know, multiple agents as of

01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:59.190
now. Making sense? Yes.

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:12.520
Can you show agent math again? Agent math? This one. Yeah.

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:17.920
So this is the agent. So this is how one agent has been

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:22.880
created. So it's very sequential. So create a tool. Then try

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:26.320
to write a prompt. Then try to create the agent. Then if you

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:28.920
have to attach a memory, because this is optional. If you

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:31.700
would like to attach the memory, attach it. If you don't

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:34.520
want to attach the memory, don't do it. It's completely

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:38.860
fine. It's okay. Keep it null. Right. And then finally try

01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:41.840
to create the executor. So which will try to call a final

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:46.400
execution of your entire things.

01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:54.440
Okay. So this is one which has been done. Now let's try to

01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:58.200
create another agent. Yeah. So maybe I can try to create one

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:02.220
more agent and then we can start doing a call over here. So

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:06.440
now we can try to create maybe again, simple agent, which is

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:09.480
a knowledge based search kind of agent. So again, which will

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:12.880
try to take input as a query, right? It will try to take

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:16.880
input as a query and based on the query, it will try to

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.540
return something, right? It based on the query, it will try

01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:23.900
to return something. So let's, let's do that. So here, let

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:27.480
me write down a knowledge based function. So maybe I can

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:32.080
write a knowledge base, underscore search function, just

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:35.080
like any independent function, which is going to take a

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:38.940
query as an input, right? Which is going to take query as an

01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:42.860
input, a mock function for search knowledge base. And here,

01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:45.640
so this is the knowledge base I'm trying to provide. So what

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:48.400
is the capital of France? So capital of France is Paris, who

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.800
is the president of United States. So United States is Joe

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:53.300
Biden, who is not by the way. So Joe Biden was a former

01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:55.920
president. What is the largest mammal? So largest mammal.

01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:59.420
The largest mammal is a blue whale. So this is just a key

01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:01.740
value, key value, key value, kind of a knowledge base. I

01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:06.120
have also, I have already created, right? And here, so

01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:09.200
whenever user is going to send a query, so it will try to

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:12.580
convert all of those query into a lower cases. And then it

01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:15.220
is going to call knowledge base means this dictionary that I

01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:18.480
have provided dot get, and then it will try to like, you

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:22.700
know, send up a query as a key. And if it is same, so it is

01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:24.980
going to give the answer, if it is not same in that case, I

01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:27.400
don't know the answer of that question. As simple as that.

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:29.960
This is something that it is going to do. So a simple

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:32.160
independent function I have created and we'll follow the

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:35.260
same steps. So first of all, I have to convert this entire

01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:40.700
knowledge base into a tools. I'll write tool, right, uh,

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:44.180
tool. And then maybe I can try to give a name over here. So

01:05:44.180 --> 01:05:48.760
knowledge base KB search, knowledge based search. Yeah. So

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:52.120
this is a, this is how I'm able to convert this entire

01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:59.050
things into a tools. Now. I'm able to do that. Now let's try

01:05:59.050 --> 01:06:03.750
to do the next. So just try to create a list tools,

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:08.880
underscore knowledge base, and then KB search. Just try to

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:13.780
give a KB search over here. Step number two. Now once we are

01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:17.360
able to do this, then let's try to convert this entire

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:20.440
things into a agents, right? This is what we have done even

01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:22.900
with respect to the previous one. So let's try to convert

01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:27.820
this into an agent. So create, sorry, not chat model. Create

01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:32.040
a agent. Create a reactive agent. Yeah. Now to create a

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:34.340
reactive agent, what we need to

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:39.540
create a reactive agent, we need LLM same LLM. I can try to

01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:43.980
use if I want, I can use a different instance of LLMs then I

01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:47.040
have to create a prompt by the way. Yeah. So react prompt, I

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:49.700
have to create, and then I can try to pass them a tool over

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:53.900
here. So let's create a prompt first of all, before creating

01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:57.920
an agent, because agent needs a prompt. Let me do that. Same

01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:02.600
thing. Same thing. So chat prompt template, I can try to

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:07.220
call and dot from message. And now let's start creating a

01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:11.880
prompt. So tool, tool name, agent, a scratch pad. Okay. Let

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:17.600
me write down something in English. So inside this prompt.

01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:25.670
So basically I think it's fully functional thought action

01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:28.670
question based on your knowledge base. You can use the

01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:32.810
following. Okay. Yeah. I think it looks fine. System. You

01:07:32.810 --> 01:07:34.890
are helpful assistant that can answer the question based on

01:07:34.890 --> 01:07:36.790
your knowledge base. You can use the following when you are

01:07:36.790 --> 01:07:39.210
using this tool, follow this instruction exactly the same.

01:07:39.610 --> 01:07:41.750
Okay. There is a spelling mistake, but that's okay.

01:07:41.810 --> 01:07:44.450
Question, thoughts, action. Fine. Tool name. Okay. Human.

01:07:44.530 --> 01:07:46.910
And then agent is scratch pad, which can call the memory.

01:07:47.370 --> 01:07:50.650
Fine. So this is again, same thing we have done. So whatever

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:53.410
we have done for the previous one, this one, so almost

01:07:53.410 --> 01:07:55.610
exact, similar kind of a prompt that we are giving.

01:07:55.850 --> 01:07:59.370
Obviously I have to give a prompt in a better way. So, so

01:07:59.370 --> 01:08:01.310
that it will be able to give me the better answer. It will

01:08:01.310 --> 01:08:03.990
be able to understand my tools in a better way. If my prompt

01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:07.890
is incorrect, it will not be able to like, uh, help you out

01:08:07.890 --> 01:08:10.890
in terms of calling a tools. But yeah, as we are creating it

01:08:10.890 --> 01:08:15.030
for the very first time, we'll tune it in later stage. So I

01:08:15.030 --> 01:08:18.770
can try to like, uh, save it inside the variable react

01:08:20.310 --> 01:08:21.650
prompt,

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:26.020
knowledge base, fine.

01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:33.330
Now happily I can go ahead and I can try to create the agent

01:08:33.330 --> 01:08:38.510
for this one. So basically I can call react,

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:48.900
sorry, create react agent and then for a knowledge base. So

01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:52.740
LLM default, LLM I'm calling and then prompt. This is the

01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:56.080
prompt which I'm giving and then tool. So tool is basically

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:58.720
this tool I'm trying to provide. So which is having an

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:03.840
access of this function KB search. Now let's store it. So

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:11.020
here. I can try to store it as a agent knowledge base. Okay.

01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:15.380
So agent creation is done. Now if I would like to attach a

01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:18.780
memory inside this one, I can try to attach a memory over

01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:23.160
here. So maybe I can try to attach some sort of a

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:26.620
conversation entity memory so that it will be able to

01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:29.920
understand or like store places. Maybe I can try to attach a

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:32.500
window memory conversation, window memory so that it will be

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:37.060
able to, you know, uh, remember some of the previous lines.

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:39.740
This is the meaning of the window. So let me attach some

01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:46.380
memory over here. So conversation, I can choose Bindo. Okay.

01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:47.580
Let's go ahead with the window memory.

01:09:52.510 --> 01:09:56.510
So Chad history, true input output, and then window of five

01:09:56.510 --> 01:10:00.090
minutes. Just try to remember the last five conversation.

01:10:00.490 --> 01:10:02.890
This is the meaning of the window in window. This is the

01:10:02.890 --> 01:10:06.550
additional parameter you will be able to see. And uh, let's

01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:08.430
try to store it as a.

01:10:12.230 --> 01:10:15.870
Memory KB. So knowledge based memory I'm going to create,

01:10:16.050 --> 01:10:21.430
okay. So it has not given me any error, but it seems fine.

01:10:21.970 --> 01:10:24.570
So this is a memory again, like I said, it's optional one.

01:10:24.650 --> 01:10:27.390
And here I'm using a window memory. Last time I have used a

01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:31.030
buffer memory. I can even try to use, uh, some sort of, uh,

01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:33.030
entity memory. So there are different, different kinds of

01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:36.110
memories that you can try to attach all depends upon me. So

01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:40.470
how, how I'm calling it. Okay. I'm going to attach it. Okay.

01:10:40.530 --> 01:10:43.550
So once this is done, now let's try to create the executor

01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:46.590
for this one. So agent executor, I'm going to call agent

01:10:46.590 --> 01:10:51.410
executor and a agent executor for what? So agent executor

01:10:51.410 --> 01:10:56.350
for KB agent, knowledge based agent tool. This one, uh, KB

01:10:56.350 --> 01:10:58.870
tool, it is going to call memory KB memory. It is going to

01:10:58.870 --> 01:11:02.270
call verbose means just try to show me the process while

01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:05.510
executing and then parsing error. So you do not follow the

01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:08.690
instruction I have given you to use the tool. Or like. KB

01:11:08.690 --> 01:11:14.810
tool more precisely, it was the KB tools. So this is the

01:11:14.810 --> 01:11:18.170
executor which I have created and let me name it as a KB

01:11:18.170 --> 01:11:23.110
underscore E X E C U T O R KB executor. Let's save it in

01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.530
this manner.

01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:30.720
I think I have pasted all the code guys. Uh, you can, you

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:33.380
can just try to follow along. So for a KB again, same

01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:36.200
process we have followed. So now I, like I have shown you

01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:38.880
for two agents, let's suppose if I'm going to create any

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:42.000
number of agents, so I'm going to follow the same drill. It

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.460
is not going to change, right? In case of lang chain, only

01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:47.700
in case of lang chain, not with respect to any other

01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:50.600
framework. So in case of a lang chain, this is how we create

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:54.640
the agents simple. So a start from a tool means a start from

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:57.740
the function decorated with the tools. And then after

01:11:57.740 --> 01:12:00.400
decorating with the tools, try to give the prompt, try to

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:03.840
give the LLMs. If you want attach a memory, if you don't

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:07.240
want to leave it, it's like completely fine. And then try to

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:10.840
create the executor. So here, if I have to write the whole

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:14.560
process. For creating any kind of a agent. So a step number

01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:16.080
one function,

01:12:19.670 --> 01:12:29.280
a step number two, decorate it as tool, a step number three,

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:33.840
create

01:12:36.370 --> 01:12:38.410
instruction prompt,

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:47.320
a step number four, add memory. If you want, right. A step

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:50.300
number five and a step number zero, obviously, right. A step

01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:57.040
number zero. Create LLM means again, LLM can be only one,

01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:00.220
like I'm using it, or maybe you can try to create a five

01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:03.400
different, different instances of the LLMs because all your

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:06.420
agents are going to use a separate LLM. So in that case you

01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:08.540
have to create that many number of LLMs, like I have given

01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:14.740
an example. So some agents may need basically like a excess

01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:17.240
of the LLMs, which can understand the images. Some may be

01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:20.860
voice, some may be something else. So here, create LLMs.

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:23.740
This is a by default step without LLMs, nothing is going to

01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:27.780
work. So add a memory. Then after adding a memory, basically

01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:31.580
create executor. So agent,

01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:42.240
executor. So this is the steps all of us has to follow. So

01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:45.800
whenever we are going to create a agent in case of a land

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:49.700
chain, so that one agent will be done. Is it fine? So

01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:51.960
whether I'm creating one, whether I'm creating hundreds of

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:56.560
agents, same step, we have to follow. Keep one or maybe

01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:59.680
separate, create your own function. Eventually I will

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:01.860
convert those function into a tools with the help of

01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:05.800
decorator. And then I can try to like create an instruction

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:10.120
prompt where tool access will be given. And then if I want,

01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:15.260
I can add a memory and then call the agent executor so that

01:14:15.260 --> 01:14:20.560
I will be able to execute it. In a production also see

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:22.980
whatever is running in a local system that you will bring to

01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:25.720
a production. Right? But in production, a situation will

01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:30.580
change little bit again, right? So see, uh, this is

01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:33.940
something which I'm executing inside my Jupyter notebook one

01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:37.220
by one, a step by step in a production. So it should be a

01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:41.040
modular one. Part number one, part number two, you have to

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:45.600
use maybe as an API, right? So maybe you can try to expose

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:49.820
your agents as an API. There is something called as lang

01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:53.000
serve, right? Lang serve is nothing but it's a wrapper on

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.380
top of a tool. It's a wrapper on top of fast API. So we all

01:14:54.380 --> 01:14:57.160
understand API and we all understand even fast API. We all

01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:00.160
have learned that right, uh, in a beginning of this entire

01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:03.980
session itself. So basically there is a library called as

01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:08.740
lang serve and lang serve is eventually nothing but it's a

01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:12.100
wrapper on top of the fast API, which this lang people have

01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:16.180
created, which you can try to use and then you can try to

01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:19.240
create a route basically because see API is also a route,

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:21.440
right? So route means pointing to the particular function.

01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:24.520
This is what lang serve does. So you have to create that

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:26.980
wrapper and then you can bring those entire things into the

01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:29.680
production and you can try to do the interfacing,

01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:32.700
interfacing with any of your chat, interfacing with any of

01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:34.940
your system because some, if something is available as an

01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:38.340
API, I can do interfacing with anything, anything I want in

01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:40.640
this entire world, maybe with a separate programming

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:43.180
language, right? I'm creating something, some agent into

01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:46.120
Python. I can consume it in a Java. That's good. That's

01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:49.640
okay. Maybe into a CSA, I can consume it, right? Maybe into

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:52.640
like a JavaScript, I can consume it. So this is how it

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:54.780
happens. In a production that I'm not going to show you

01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:57.660
today, next week obviously I'm going to show you. I already

01:15:57.660 --> 01:15:59.420
have that example. Lang serve example I have already

01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:02.560
prepared and then obviously there is something called as

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:06.240
lang smith. So when I'm going to teach you a lang graph, so

01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:09.540
there is a, uh, like a, there is a platform called as lang

01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:13.220
chain studio or lang studio. You can say inside that there

01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:15.900
is a service called as lang smith, which is going to help

01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:18.840
you out in terms of creating the, or in terms of hosting a

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:21.060
graph and you will be able to visualize it. You will be able

01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:23.640
to interact with it. All these things will come, but not

01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:28.140
now. So in upcoming classes, a step by step. Yeah. But yes,

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:31.100
as of now, when I'm trying to create a agent inside my local

01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:34.420
system, this is the steps. Are we clear with the steps guys?

01:16:37.290 --> 01:16:41.430
Yeah. Are we, are we clear? Okay. So tool, right? So let's

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:43.250
see. We have already done the import. Lang chain already

01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:48.950
provides you basically a library for creating a tools. So

01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:51.090
that system will be able to understand that. Okay. This is

01:16:51.090 --> 01:16:53.190
the tool. This, this is not a normal function. This is

01:16:53.190 --> 01:16:56.790
basically a tool. Right. Tool means again, just a function,

01:16:56.950 --> 01:17:01.150
but in terms of agentic AI, it's called as tool. Tool is

01:17:01.150 --> 01:17:04.150
technically a normal function, right? In terms of agentic

01:17:04.150 --> 01:17:07.550
AI, in terms of making it understand to the lang chain

01:17:07.550 --> 01:17:10.650
framework that, okay, I have to call it based on the prompt.

01:17:10.750 --> 01:17:15.030
It's technically called as tool. Fine.

01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:25.160
Yeah. Okay. So this is something that we have to do. I'll

01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:27.860
share the entire notebook. So don't worry. Yeah. I'll share

01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:31.120
the entire notebook, but hope this entire order is clear,

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:34.280
right? So whenever we have to create an agent, what we are

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:37.580
following and where we can do the customization, is it clear

01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:42.540
guys, the order, right? So basically agents need LLM access.

01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:46.260
Now it's pretty much clear that I can provide any number. So

01:17:46.260 --> 01:17:49.280
different, different kinds of LLM access, right? A tool is

01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:52.460
technically a normal Python function in this case actually,

01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:55.580
but with the help of lang chain tool decorator, eventually

01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:58.040
I'm converting those functions into tools. So meaning of

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:01.940
tool is pretty much clear to all of us, right? Then meaning

01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:04.660
of memory is pretty much clear to all of us, at least two

01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:06.860
kinds of memory. One is a buffer memory. One is a window

01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:10.080
memory, right? Again, there are like another kind of a

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:12.320
memory, which I will introduce in later stage. But yeah,

01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:15.120
memory is pretty much clear why we are using memory. I

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:17.940
believe that's pretty much clear, right? And then we are

01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:22.180
like creating a prompt. Why prompt? So that LLM will be able

01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:25.160
to interact because LLM understands only NLP natural

01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:28.000
language. That's it. So we have a prompt, prompt for each

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.980
and every tools, right? So which will make my LLM

01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:34.080
understands that, okay, when I have to use this tool, when I

01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:36.620
have to use that tool, because we will be having multiple

01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:39.280
tools here. We have two tools, right? We can have 200 tools.

01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:43.940
And then finally we have a agent executor. Eventually agent

01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:46.180
executor is going to help me out in terms of executing

01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:53.920
things. Yeah, okay. So this is the flow. And in both of my

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:57.660
agent creation, I have used the same flow. Exactly same flow

01:18:57.660 --> 01:19:02.540
I have used that I have written over here. So now let's move

01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:08.320
ahead. I'm like removing this text now. So how I will be

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:12.740
able to combine it and then how I will be able to basically

01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:17.580
execute this tool, how I will be able to test this tool,

01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:21.300
that whether this is working or not. Yeah. So now it's time

01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:25.060
for testing it. How system will be able to create a route?

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:29.520
Because within my system, right? So because within my

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:32.780
system, so I have two tools, right? I have technically two

01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:38.860
tools, tool number one and then tool number two, right? I'm

01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:41.220
going to pass any kind of instruction. So let's suppose if

01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:44.540
I'm trying to pass that, okay, do sign of 90 or if I'm going

01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:47.220
to pass, what is the capital of Paris? Something like that.

01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:51.540
If I'm going to pass as a prompt now, how it will be able to

01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:54.920
route to these two tools, which tool? It is supposed to

01:19:54.920 --> 01:20:00.060
choose in which case basically, right? All of these. Now we

01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:03.380
are going to do it. So basically we are going to create a

01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:07.880
router, which will try to like route, we will try to create

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:10.500
a dispatcher and then finally we will try to create a

01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:13.840
orchestrator, right? Which will try to like keep all of

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:16.860
these tools inside one single box. Technically I will call

01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:19.860
that as a orchestrator. Yeah. So which is going to do the

01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:23.180
orchestration for my tool and separate, separate, I can

01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:26.500
create any number of a tool the way I have done that so far.

01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:31.840
So now let's do it in a step by step manner and creating

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:36.520
this agents in Lang chain is like bit in this way. If you

01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:40.880
will look into the Lang graph, it's pretty much easy.

01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:45.600
Believe me, it's easier than like a Lang using like a Lang

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:49.400
chain library. And if I'll talk about a crew AI, it's almost

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:52.500
similar to like a in, in terms of ease of use, right? In

01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:54.740
terms of ease of use, crew AI, again, it's very, very

01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:58.300
simple. So you don't have to write much and all of these

01:20:58.300 --> 01:21:01.360
like a wrappers functions are already created. Just have to

01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:04.420
call it and then pass your values. This is how like a things

01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:09.800
is going to work. Okay. So now let's go ahead and let's try

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:13.740
to create a router prompt first of all. Yeah. Router prompt

01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:17.580
first of all. So here in terms of creating a router prompt,

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:22.640
let's like a call chat prompt. So I'm going to create a

01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:26.580
router prompt template itself and then from message, same

01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:33.820
thing, which I have already used. So this one, okay. Now

01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:38.060
here I'm going to create a router prompt by the way. Is it

01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:38.340
correct?

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:44.480
No. Let me write it down.

01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:57.580
So system and here. So I can try to say that you are, you

01:21:59.370 --> 01:22:02.130
are. Router.

01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:15.510
Now read the user message and output exactly one token for

01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:24.550
me or like, uh, for the input given by user input given by

01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:27.590
user. Now in a next line.

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:33.570
I can say. I can say that, okay, uh,

01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:48.750
just try to give me math basically, if it is, if a user is

01:22:49.670 --> 01:22:55.730
asking for calculations, yeah. So if user is asking for

01:22:55.730 --> 01:22:59.730
calculations, so try to give me math system.

01:23:08.420 --> 01:23:11.820
This is why and why it is able, not able to take it as a

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:17.700
string. Again, I have missed something. This is a string

01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:18.440
fine.

01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:24.440
This one is string.

01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:40.240
Oh, I have just closed it. Right. Hmm. Fine. Yeah. So

01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:42.060
because of that, it was not able to take it as a string.

01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:45.340
Fine. So I'm saying that, okay, fine. So just give me like a

01:23:45.340 --> 01:23:48.640
math as output. So if user is asking for the calculation,

01:23:48.860 --> 01:23:56.220
then in our next line, uh, maybe I can write again. So. Try

01:23:56.220 --> 01:23:59.820
to give me. KB. If user is asking for general knowledge

01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:03.620
question. So try to give me KB basically, uh, so that I will

01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:08.400
go and I will try to search for a KB and then I can try to

01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:13.540
write maybe a strict instruction over here that, uh, output

01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:23.400
only KB, KB or math, nothing else, math, nothing else from

01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:30.760
your side. Okay. Yeah. Your side. So this is the instruction

01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:36.760
and then here. So human is equals to input. So human are

01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:42.840
going to give an input, uh, curly braces. Okay. Parametrize

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:47.500
it. Fine. So whatever input human is going to give. So chat

01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:49.940
prompt template from a messages. So whatever messages that

01:24:49.940 --> 01:24:53.500
you are going to send, uh, initially. So what it will do, it

01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:56.240
will behave like a router. I have already given a prompt.

01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:58.260
Again, based on the prompt itself, it will behave like a

01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:01.280
router. So whatever input humans are going to give, you are

01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:04.560
going to give basically system is going to return you what

01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:07.380
either it is going to return math or either it is going to

01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:12.360
return the KB. Yeah. Now. So if it is returning math, it

01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:15.740
will go and hit your math agent because here somewhere you

01:25:15.740 --> 01:25:18.680
have already defined, right? Even in case of a math agent,

01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:22.540
when you have mentioned like, uh, this one, uh, like this

01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:25.540
particular prompt. So somewhere you have mentioned. And if

01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:27.420
you have not mentioned, you should mention by the way,

01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:31.340
right? That you are basically a mathematical assistant. So I

01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:33.520
have already mentioned that, okay, I'm, you are basically a

01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:36.960
mathematical, uh, like our systems. And, uh, yeah. So in

01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:39.320
case of mathematical assistance, just try to call a

01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:41.720
particular tool and then try to do the evaluation and then

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:44.860
give me the output. So this is how, with the help of this

01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:47.980
prompt, it will be able to do the routing again, in case of

01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:50.840
a knowledge base somewhere I have mentioned, if I have not

01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:52.920
mentioned, it will not be able to route. If I have

01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:55.180
mentioned, obviously it will go and route. If it is not

01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:55.200
mentioned, it will not be able to route. If it is not

01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:58.060
working. So maybe I will tune my prompt, prompt for my KB,

01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:00.760
prompt for my math, basically, so that it will be able to

01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:04.200
understand. Okay. Uh, so this is how this communication

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:07.100
happens by the way, right? Prompt to prompt communication.

01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:10.160
And then internally prompt is calling a particular tool.

01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:17.000
Okay. So here, this part is clear. Now let's try to store

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:22.060
this one as a router prompt.

01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:29.680
Uh, what happened? Expected to role template got system. You

01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:35.600
are expected to tuples of role and template got system.

01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:44.200
Format is wrong. It is expecting only two tuples. Fine. So

01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:48.400
one tuple is this one tuple is this one.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.440
Now it's working. I've just removed the separator over here.

01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:08.160
It was expecting two tuples. I have given two tuples, okay?

01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:11.440
So this is basically a router I have created so that it will

01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:13.880
be able to select. So whether like I should go ahead with

01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:16.960
the math or I should go ahead with the knowledge base. Now,

01:27:17.060 --> 01:27:20.860
once this is done, right? So once this is like a router is

01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:24.880
done outer for my math function or math tool and my

01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:28.460
knowledge based tool is done. Then let's try to create the

01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:32.680
dispatcher dispatcher means so router will try to route

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:37.700
towards one of them. The agents now dispatcher will now

01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:40.320
dispatch that. Okay, fine. Go and use that particular agent.

01:27:40.460 --> 01:27:43.540
Yeah. Go and use that particular agent. So let's try to

01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:46.920
create one like a private function. You can say

01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:54.020
dispatcher function. So what it will do. So it will try to

01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:56.820
take maybe like a input and

01:28:04.850 --> 01:28:07.170
we'll try to take the input and

01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:16.500
then what it will do. So input wise, let me keep a notation

01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:20.240
over here that it is going to take dictionary as an input.

01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:25.420
And then here let me write down dog

01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:38.590
string for this input. So it is going to take a new input.

01:28:38.910 --> 01:28:50.590
It will take new input from human and it will attach also

01:28:50.590 --> 01:28:59.070
attach history from memory. Okay. If, if there is any, for

01:28:59.070 --> 01:29:01.010
the first time, obviously there will be no memory, but yeah,

01:29:02.330 --> 01:29:05.210
so a history will be injected over here. This is something

01:29:05.210 --> 01:29:08.130
that it will do now here.

01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:16.540
So I can try to create a variable INPUTS input is nothing

01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:22.880
but the input, which is coming inside the function. And

01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:25.940
let's try to keep it as a user message. So whenever you are

01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:28.280
going to send any kind of a messages that will be treated as

01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:33.900
a input over here. Okay. And then what it will do. So it

01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:38.540
will try to, right. So it will try to call a router chain.

01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:40.620
Now here, have

01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:56.790
I done some sort of a import? Let me check.

01:30:21.950 --> 01:30:25.430
Okay. So let me just call.

01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:36.720
So input user will give and yeah, so even I can try to like

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:40.240
a call in this way. This is called as LCLE. So language

01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:47.620
chain expression, or I can try to call router underscore

01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:59.570
chain dot invoke. So invoke based on what? So invoke based

01:30:59.570 --> 01:31:02.770
on the user message. So whatever user is going to provide

01:31:02.770 --> 01:31:06.270
the message, it will try to call the router chain. It will

01:31:06.270 --> 01:31:10.110
try to invoke it based on the user messages. So basically it

01:31:10.110 --> 01:31:13.570
will, it will try to like take just as an input. Let me.

01:31:14.230 --> 01:31:16.510
Suppose you have given the input. So let me like a remove

01:31:16.510 --> 01:31:21.310
the trailing and the leading space. So I can try to call a

01:31:21.310 --> 01:31:26.170
simple string function called a S T R I P strip. And then

01:31:26.170 --> 01:31:29.130
let me convert everything into a lower case or maybe upper

01:31:29.130 --> 01:31:33.110
cases so that it will, it won't be a case sensitive. So

01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:37.790
router chain, and this is going to be my choice, choice of

01:31:37.790 --> 01:31:40.850
the messages. So if choice

01:31:43.670 --> 01:31:48.770
is math. Then just go. And call a math executor if choice is

01:31:48.770 --> 01:31:52.970
equal to KB. So just go and execute a KB executor. So this

01:31:52.970 --> 01:31:55.850
is called as dispatcher. Now how dispatcher is going to work

01:31:55.850 --> 01:31:59.250
obviously after this router prompt, because what this router

01:31:59.250 --> 01:32:02.250
prompt is trying to return, this router prompt is trying to

01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:06.050
return either math as per my instruction, right? This is

01:32:06.050 --> 01:32:11.510
returning what either math or either KB simple. So you are

01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:15.310
sending a message. Now message is going through a router.

01:32:15.310 --> 01:32:18.470
Now router is trying to give you either of these things.

01:32:18.590 --> 01:32:22.690
Let's suppose it has given you a math, right? Then it will

01:32:22.690 --> 01:32:25.350
call internally. This is the region. It's a private function

01:32:25.350 --> 01:32:27.310
or you can say protected function I'm trying to create,

01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:31.370
right? So this will automatically call a dispatcher. Now

01:32:31.370 --> 01:32:33.910
what dispatcher is doing? So dispatcher is just trying to

01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:36.810
judge your message, judge your message from where? From a

01:32:36.810 --> 01:32:39.450
router prompt. You are not sending a messages. You are

01:32:39.450 --> 01:32:42.170
sending a message to a router prompt. Router prompt is

01:32:42.170 --> 01:32:44.890
trying to convert your layman kind of a message. This is

01:32:44.890 --> 01:32:47.970
because as a user you will enter anything, right? Router

01:32:47.970 --> 01:32:51.030
prompt will identify basically because it will be able to

01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:53.530
understand based on the this like entire prompt that I have

01:32:53.530 --> 01:32:56.130
given. It will try to understand. It will try to return

01:32:56.130 --> 01:32:58.550
either math. It will try to return either a KB. Let's

01:32:58.550 --> 01:33:01.170
suppose it is returning a math. Then dispatcher internally

01:33:01.170 --> 01:33:05.670
will be called and if choice is math means if this router is

01:33:05.670 --> 01:33:09.190
returning math, it will call math executor. So this is how

01:33:09.190 --> 01:33:13.470
it is reaching out basically, right? So if dispatcher is

01:33:13.470 --> 01:33:16.670
getting basically input. Okay. Out from here, right from

01:33:16.670 --> 01:33:20.870
here, input as a math call math executor and now we know

01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:24.310
that what math executor is doing. So math executor is trying

01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:26.550
to call basically a math agent. We have already created a

01:33:26.550 --> 01:33:29.350
math executor, right? We have already created a KB knowledge

01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:32.790
base executor. So this is how this dispatcher is going to

01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:35.310
work internally. Is it making sense guys? How these two

01:33:35.310 --> 01:33:39.430
things are connected? Yeah. What is the meaning of this user

01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:41.630
message? Technically user message has been returned by my

01:33:41.630 --> 01:33:46.030
router prompt. Simple. So here my original message will go.

01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:49.650
It will try to identify math or KB because I have given a

01:33:49.650 --> 01:33:53.570
clear instruction that give me only one word means only one

01:33:53.570 --> 01:33:56.690
token return me just one token. Just give me one word. I'm

01:33:56.690 --> 01:33:59.170
not looking for like a lengthy, lengthy kind of like a

01:33:59.170 --> 01:34:02.890
things or maybe like a lengthy sentences over here and a

01:34:02.890 --> 01:34:06.010
dispatcher internally will be called and then it will try to

01:34:06.010 --> 01:34:09.650
call the executor. So this is how it will actually call the

01:34:09.650 --> 01:34:12.550
agents internally. Just a program, right? Just a program.

01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:14.630
This is how it will be able to understand that. Okay, fine.

01:34:14.710 --> 01:34:18.230
Call math or maybe call a KB or maybe any other executor,

01:34:18.230 --> 01:34:22.130
right? Any other executor. So this is where a dispatcher

01:34:22.130 --> 01:34:27.530
comes into a picture. Now dispatcher function is done. Let

01:34:27.530 --> 01:34:32.070
me send you this dispatcher function, right? So dispatcher,

01:34:32.070 --> 01:34:35.750
so router, we are able to create dispatcher. We are able to

01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:41.590
create, by the way. Now let me make it like a runable. Okay.

01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:48.570
So I just have to call, yeah. So once this dispatcher is

01:34:48.570 --> 01:34:53.250
created, so let me call a runable lambda. So which will try

01:34:53.250 --> 01:34:58.550
to execute this dispatcher dispatcher and here let me create

01:34:58.550 --> 01:35:02.710
a variable called as dispatcher variable. Yep. So dispatcher

01:35:02.710 --> 01:35:05.750
dispatcher internally will understand this router and

01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:08.390
whatever outer is going to return automatically dispatcher

01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:11.970
will be invoked. Okay. Now. So dispatcher I have created.

01:35:11.970 --> 01:35:16.650
Now, apart from this, right, apart from this, I can try to

01:35:16.650 --> 01:35:19.630
even maintain a session, right? I can try to maintain the

01:35:19.630 --> 01:35:23.090
session. For example, I'm trying to create a system, again,

01:35:23.250 --> 01:35:25.670
this is not mandatory. This is optional. At least for this

01:35:25.670 --> 01:35:28.970
example, this is optional for obviously like a deployable or

01:35:28.970 --> 01:35:31.430
for like a production grid example, it will become

01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:33.810
mandatory, right? But for this example, at least it's not

01:35:33.810 --> 01:35:36.310
mandatory, but still I'm going to show you that part. So

01:35:36.310 --> 01:35:41.230
see, basically let's suppose I have one application. Okay.

01:35:41.970 --> 01:35:45.690
I'm using this one application to the entire world. Now in a

01:35:45.690 --> 01:35:47.470
class itself, let's suppose there are a hundred people,

01:35:47.610 --> 01:35:50.310
right? There are a hundred people. So obviously some will

01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:53.370
call or maybe you, all this hundred people will try to

01:35:53.370 --> 01:35:56.350
interact as per their need, right? Everyone is not going to

01:35:56.350 --> 01:35:59.210
follow the same, uh, drill. Basically someone will call this

01:35:59.210 --> 01:36:02.550
agent. Someone will call that agent means everyone will chat

01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:04.490
in a different, different manner. Basically, right? Everyone

01:36:04.490 --> 01:36:06.470
is going to chat. Everyone will be having their different

01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:08.910
memory, right? Everyone will be having their different

01:36:08.910 --> 01:36:12.390
memory. Everyone will be having their different trails. So

01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:16.010
what we have to do so that it should, the entire system

01:36:16.010 --> 01:36:18.430
should work, which should be like personalized to a user,

01:36:18.510 --> 01:36:21.050
all this hundred user, it should feel like it should be a

01:36:21.050 --> 01:36:24.670
personalized one. So keeping that in our mind, we can try to

01:36:24.670 --> 01:36:28.270
integrate a sessions. So basically for one user, there will

01:36:28.270 --> 01:36:30.750
be one session for other user. There will be another session

01:36:30.750 --> 01:36:33.170
for another user. There will be another session so that

01:36:33.170 --> 01:36:37.590
memory and all of the entities, which is related to a

01:36:37.590 --> 01:36:41.710
particular session will be intact. So that. Every user will

01:36:41.710 --> 01:36:44.550
feel like it's a personalized agent to them. So this is

01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:46.990
where session comes into a picture. Again, not mandatory if

01:36:46.990 --> 01:36:49.830
you are having just only one user, but yeah, if you have a

01:36:49.830 --> 01:36:53.110
multiple user in that case, maintaining a session is pretty

01:36:53.110 --> 01:36:57.250
much important so that you will entire tool should look like

01:36:57.250 --> 01:37:02.470
a personalized tool towards a particular user. So here let's

01:37:02.470 --> 01:37:05.130
create a session. Again session is nothing but piece of the

01:37:05.130 --> 01:37:08.750
code by which we used to maintain the session as of now. So

01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:12.230
here. Let's do. Let's do one thing. Let's try to create

01:37:12.230 --> 01:37:16.730
maybe a private variable or protected variable you can say

01:37:16.730 --> 01:37:17.790
session

01:37:20.140 --> 01:37:23.080
and let's just create a blank dictionary. So here I will try

01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:26.980
to maintain the sessions. So let's create one simple

01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:30.940
variable called as session and let's try to maintain it. So

01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:33.060
what we are going to maintain inside the session, obviously

01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:36.640
your history, user history, chat history by the way, right?

01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:40.060
And for every user I have to maintain it. So maybe I can try

01:37:40.060 --> 01:37:42.360
to create in that way. So for every user, maybe I can try

01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:46.460
to, you know, create a session ID and then I'll just try to

01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:49.780
maintain it with respect to a user login or credential. But

01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:52.860
I'm not getting into that login credential that is not built

01:37:52.860 --> 01:37:55.940
over here. But yeah, so maybe I can try to just create a

01:37:55.940 --> 01:38:01.940
history function. So get underscore H I S T O R Y. This is a

01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:05.420
very plain function I'm going to create, which is going to

01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:11.600
take maybe a session ID, right? And here. So if session ID

01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:15.380
is not in session, so if it is not here in that case, do one

01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:18.660
thing, create one. Yeah. Create one means if you are the

01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:22.680
first time user, it will try to create your session ID. So

01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:25.700
how it will be able to create a session ID. So basically it

01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:28.920
is going to create a session ID just by following your chat

01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:31.420
messages. So it will give you session ID one, two, three,

01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:34.080
four, five, six, or even I can try to give the like a

01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:37.960
numbering or maybe a name to it. So that customization is

01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:40.420
also possible. Just a piece of the pipeline. Python code,

01:38:40.580 --> 01:38:43.940
right? Just a piece of the Python code over here. And then

01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:47.960
return what? So return basically a session ID. So this is

01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:55.160
how I can, I can try to create a session ID over here. Let's

01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:59.720
execute it. So this is again like a internal function I'm

01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:03.020
creating, which will be used now. So router is done.

01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:06.840
Dispatcher is done. Now I have to bring everything into the

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:10.940
box, right? I have to bring like a. Like all of these

01:39:10.940 --> 01:39:14.300
things, whatever I have created into the particular box. So

01:39:14.300 --> 01:39:17.860
how I will be able to do that. So let's try to create the

01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:21.280
orchestrator. Yeah. Let's try to create the orchestrator. So

01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:26.920
here runable with a message history. I'm just trying to call

01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:29.080
the function. I'm saying that that, okay, you are the

01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:32.860
function and basically you run yourself with the history

01:39:33.380 --> 01:39:36.100
means. First of all, you will pull the history attached with

01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:39.240
the current messages, and then you will try to call. The

01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:43.240
router and then eventually the dispatcher internally. So

01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:46.240
function is dispatcher. Yeah. Function is dispatcher and

01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:49.360
dispatcher is automatically calling my executor and

01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:52.460
internally obviously it is calling this router bound. So

01:39:52.460 --> 01:39:56.320
here I'm trying to call the dispatcher function. I'm trying

01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:59.540
to even attach my get history function so that, okay, get

01:39:59.540 --> 01:40:05.080
the history first input message key and input message key is

01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:08.940
fine. I should attach history message key. History message

01:40:08.940 --> 01:40:16.640
key is equals to history. Yeah. So this is called as

01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:17.440
orchestrator.

01:40:20.710 --> 01:40:23.130
I've just named it as an orchestrator. You can name it

01:40:23.130 --> 01:40:25.970
anything that's cool. Runable missing two position

01:40:25.970 --> 01:40:33.030
requirement, runable and get message history. Okay. So

01:40:33.030 --> 01:40:34.970
runable

01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:40.820
is equals to, let

01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:46.820
me. Missing one required position argument. Done. Get

01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:48.020
session history.

01:40:51.820 --> 01:40:56.820
Get sorry. This should be session. Yeah. Just mapped it in a

01:40:56.820 --> 01:41:00.800
correct way. Fine. So this is my orchestrator, which I'm

01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:05.140
able to create. Now once my orchestrator has been done, like

01:41:05.140 --> 01:41:09.320
once my orchestrator has been done. So what I will do, so I

01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:13.080
will start basically invoking this orchestrator. This is the

01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:16.440
final one. This is the entry point, by the way, from top to

01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:19.320
bottom, bottom to top. I have already created. Everything is

01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:24.040
done. So how I will be able to invoke it and how I will be

01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:26.780
able to test it. Let's let us start testing it. So basically

01:41:26.780 --> 01:41:30.360
I can create a chat window chat interface and with the help

01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:32.920
of chat, I can create it. But here inside a Jupyter

01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:36.880
notebook, maybe I can call a simple print statement. I can

01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:40.820
try to call orchestrator.invoke this one and let's execute

01:41:40.820 --> 01:41:44.740
it right orchestrator.invoke and here. So I'm going to give

01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:47.400
an input. What is the capital of France? Let's see. Let's

01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:51.560
see which agent is going to call. So this is the input. This

01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:53.820
is the user message which I'm trying to give as of now.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.400
Right. This is the user message I'm trying to give as of

01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:00.080
now. And let's see. Right. So whether it is calling my

01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:09.230
agents or not. Okay. So missing key session ID in the. Okay.

01:42:09.310 --> 01:42:15.550
So here get session session ID. I have also provided user

01:42:15.550 --> 01:42:22.990
one as a key. So it. Okay. It should technically work.

01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:27.720
But why is the error session ID in the configure.

01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:39.340
Okay fine. So let me create a configuration. And through

01:42:39.340 --> 01:42:43.960
configuration let me pass it. So here I'm going to create my

01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:48.400
variable just to pass inside the print function. So let's

01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:54.640
suppose CFG configuration variable and inside that as a key

01:42:54.640 --> 01:43:03.810
configurable. Okay. By configurable let's suppose I'm

01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:11.480
going to say that session ID means

01:43:14.110 --> 01:43:22.210
this one is equals to user one. Same thing. So here session

01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:34.660
underscore ID is equals to let's suppose user one. Fine. Key

01:43:34.660 --> 01:43:42.770
and a value. Okay. And instead of giving this one config

01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:55.460
is equal to CFG. So yeah session ID is equal to user one.

01:43:55.800 --> 01:44:01.880
Now let's execute name input is not defined inputs is not

01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:07.700
defined input. I have created okay

01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:15.860
inside

01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:26.160
our dispatcher inputs is equals to as

01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:36.420
a key fine as a key key and key. So I have made a typo

01:44:36.420 --> 01:44:42.000
mistake session session orchestrator config name router

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:46.800
chain is not defined again some spelling mistake router

01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:48.700
chain router

01:44:52.220 --> 01:44:55.260
chain so

01:44:57.400 --> 01:45:00.580
just

01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:10.970
take a choice it

01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:27.350
should get just a message. So it should be router prompt.

01:45:27.470 --> 01:45:32.550
Not a chain. Yeah just it is basically like it is okay so

01:45:32.550 --> 01:45:35.690
basically from this one it should get this one so router

01:45:35.690 --> 01:45:38.430
prompt basically because it is like a calling this one

01:45:38.430 --> 01:45:42.610
internally. So it should be router prompt. Now it's correct

01:45:42.610 --> 01:45:47.450
it should not be chain. Now dispatch session get history

01:45:47.450 --> 01:45:51.970
orchestrator charge prompt value object has no attribute

01:45:51.970 --> 01:46:00.590
strip. Okay. So. I. Think. This should be str ip router

01:46:00.590 --> 01:46:08.250
prompt invoke then user message that's fine strip looks fine

01:46:08.250 --> 01:46:11.710
because it's a string so obviously it should work router

01:46:20.030 --> 01:46:27.250
agent need to be created router agent need to be created no

01:46:27.250 --> 01:46:31.270
router agent need not to be created it's a router prompt

01:46:31.270 --> 01:46:34.790
it's not an agent basically agent is math and kb these two

01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:37.930
agents there is nothing called as router agent actually it

01:46:39.590 --> 01:46:42.350
is giving me a little bit this one I can I can remove this a

01:46:42.350 --> 01:46:44.970
strip function it's fine if I'm not like a stripping the

01:46:44.970 --> 01:46:47.110
leading and trailing space

01:46:49.290 --> 01:46:54.770
now chat prompt object has no attribute upper maybe it's a

01:46:54.770 --> 01:46:58.870
issue input and then user message router prompt it will try

01:46:58.870 --> 01:47:01.890
to invoke it will try to give me okay remove this upper as

01:47:01.890 --> 01:47:06.110
well just take a raw input. Anyhow my input will be like.

01:47:07.950 --> 01:47:08.910
One token.

01:47:13.940 --> 01:47:19.240
Now it is able to execute and it is telling me that I can

01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:24.840
only answer math or kb related question so somehow it is it

01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:27.460
is able to call and now it is telling me that I can only

01:47:27.460 --> 01:47:30.320
answer math and kb related a question after like fixing all

01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:36.340
these things so here it is coming over here right somehow it

01:47:36.340 --> 01:47:39.800
is coming over here and from this dispatcher it is telling

01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:44.780
me that I can only answer math and kb related a question it

01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:47.920
is not able to call my agents but yeah so maybe it is not

01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:50.840
able to get this math or maybe it is not able to get this

01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:57.520
like a kb it is maybe getting into a lower case I have to

01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:03.700
call upper because a keyword to keyword match right so upper

01:48:05.590 --> 01:48:07.070
because

01:48:10.940 --> 01:48:14.100
I have given it's in a upper cases right maybe I can write

01:48:14.100 --> 01:48:17.320
or over here. If it is not going to work but yeah it's

01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:22.020
calling now field chat prompt object has no attribute upper

01:48:22.020 --> 01:48:26.400
I mean like why chat prompt object router dot prompt it will

01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:30.820
invoke that's fine then there is a this is going to return

01:48:30.820 --> 01:48:36.460
me input user message router prompt invoke

01:48:39.940 --> 01:48:40.580
oh

01:48:45.540 --> 01:48:50.120
it's a dictionary obviously it's a dictionary and I can't

01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:57.140
call directly upper over here. I have to do something okay

01:49:01.580 --> 01:49:08.140
let me remove upper and let me do one thing so choice

01:49:10.380 --> 01:49:11.300
fine

01:49:13.540 --> 01:49:15.120
or okay

01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:24.220
so this one and then I can write or this one I

01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:34.100
can only read kb related questions so my dispatcher is not

01:49:34.100 --> 01:49:37.100
able to dispatch there is some issue with the dispatcher

01:49:37.100 --> 01:49:38.100
chat

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:56.620
prompt. This is what it looks like so I have to look into

01:49:56.620 --> 01:50:03.780
this one I have strictly mentioned that output only kb or

01:50:03.780 --> 01:50:09.810
math nothing else from your site kb or math this is the

01:50:09.810 --> 01:50:14.310
instruction I have given but I think it's not able to follow

01:50:14.310 --> 01:50:15.310
along at

01:50:44.370 --> 01:50:47.930
kb output only math or kb no

01:50:52.730 --> 01:50:56.770
still not able to call up proper. Okay, so I have to look

01:50:56.770 --> 01:50:58.670
into this one. dispatcher okay

01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:42.420
i'll fix it not an issue because

01:51:46.260 --> 01:51:49.700
if it will start calling it then obviously it just we are

01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:52.220
like one step away by the way

01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:07.460
dispatcher uh

01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:26.370
here so we can go ahead with our debugging we can like try

01:52:26.370 --> 01:52:30.950
to print basically like a choice over here so that we can

01:52:30.950 --> 01:52:33.910
see what it is getting as a choice so

01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:40.380
you are a router choice wise this is something it is getting

01:52:40.380 --> 01:52:44.160
you are router read the user output token and calculate kb

01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:49.100
otherwise tech education reg agent general knowledge output

01:52:49.100 --> 01:52:54.400
only math kb additional kw arcs response metadata human

01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:57.140
message so content

01:52:58.970 --> 01:53:02.890
wise this is something it is trying to return i have to trim

01:53:02.890 --> 01:53:07.550
this content and i have to make it understand that outer

01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:14.280
template uh

01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:21.390
dispatcher get history orchestrator will call dispatcher and

01:53:21.390 --> 01:53:28.510
dispatcher so it is returning me a plain one it is not able

01:53:28.510 --> 01:53:30.430
to understand so

01:53:32.900 --> 01:53:35.560
whatever like i have entered it is just trying to return me

01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:38.400
the exact same thing

01:53:54.530 --> 01:54:01.290
okay so i have to pass this one through a llm let me do one

01:54:01.290 --> 01:54:07.660
thing i think there is a llm access i have to create so let

01:54:07.660 --> 01:54:12.880
me create one thing called as routr a site access list so we

01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:12.940
can nutrient can use threadchain dishes as a property we can

01:54:12.940 --> 01:54:15.060
op do lat or line hotel and let me pass a lisi le chain this

01:54:15.060 --> 01:54:19.200
is something called a like a acknowledge expression so one

01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:27.240
variable which will try to take my router prompt pass these

01:54:27.240 --> 01:54:33.200
things toa lm default that i have used and then try to give

01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:39.040
me as an output as a string output yeah so in this way this

01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:41.820
prompt instead of like a call controller because here when

01:54:41.820 --> 01:54:44.960
i'm trying to print it right so it is just able to take my

01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:48.440
entire user messages but there is no llm access to this one

01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:51.140
so it is not able to pass to the llms i have just created

01:54:51.140 --> 01:54:54.320
expression over here so there is something called as lcle

01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:56.300
inside a lang chain so there is something called a lang

01:54:56.300 --> 01:54:59.360
chain expression so it will try to take a any prompt and

01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:02.120
then pass it over here and then it will try to return it as

01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:05.680
a string so this is a router chain and then here instead of

01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:09.700
using a router prompt let's use router chain yeah that was

01:55:09.700 --> 01:55:12.940
the variable which i have already prepared in my example now

01:55:12.940 --> 01:55:18.160
strip will work because now it's a string it's not

01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:21.740
dictionary and then upper will also work yeah now

01:55:27.020 --> 01:55:35.800
my system will be able to yes it will work now 443 right uh

01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:41.980
so 401 unauthorized url okay execute once again it is

01:55:41.980 --> 01:55:49.680
calling my llm api you're on uri chat completions no it

01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:51.320
should not be why

01:55:54.710 --> 01:56:00.350
it is giving me unauthorized urls fine api v1 uri chat

01:56:00.350 --> 01:56:03.270
completion that's a correct url yeah

01:56:12.710 --> 01:56:16.230
this testing is working for me now

01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:24.120
so here uri

01:56:29.460 --> 01:56:35.040
chat chat model okay it's not able to get it from me the

01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:40.320
environment let me keep it as a lm default string

01:56:57.250 --> 01:57:02.390
object has stip okay strip it should be strip strip

01:57:04.380 --> 01:57:06.920
now

01:57:10.790 --> 01:57:15.390
it's working guys see so uh my chain is working as you can

01:57:15.390 --> 01:57:19.710
see that it is getting into a agent execution right and what

01:57:19.710 --> 01:57:21.890
was the question by the way so what is the capital of the

01:57:21.890 --> 01:57:25.850
france this was a question we all know that if this is a

01:57:25.850 --> 01:57:28.570
question it should call which agent it should call my

01:57:28.570 --> 01:57:31.910
knowledge base agent by the way right so this is a verbose

01:57:31.910 --> 01:57:35.590
in a verbose you are able to see that first it is thinking i

01:57:35.590 --> 01:57:37.470
have already given that instruction it's not thinking

01:57:37.470 --> 01:57:40.570
automatically by the way so it's thinking because i have

01:57:40.570 --> 01:57:44.010
already done that i have already mentioned it inside my

01:57:44.010 --> 01:57:47.750
prompt that okay so think question whenever you get think

01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:50.030
then call the action all those things i have already given

01:57:50.030 --> 01:57:53.090
to it so as per my instructions so it is trying to think

01:57:53.090 --> 01:57:56.710
action by using one of the tool access that you can have so

01:57:56.710 --> 01:57:59.590
kb search it is trying to call a kb search query is

01:57:59.590 --> 01:58:02.390
basically capital of france this is the query that it is

01:58:02.390 --> 01:58:07.350
able to like you know understand right so again it is like a

01:58:07.350 --> 01:58:09.530
thinking again and again again and again it is trying to

01:58:09.530 --> 01:58:13.130
think basically and then it is trying to access a kb search

01:58:13.130 --> 01:58:18.050
capital of france so it is able to finish uh this one so

01:58:18.050 --> 01:58:21.070
input is what is the capital of the france and then chat

01:58:21.070 --> 01:58:25.630
history output so agent stop due to the iteration limit or

01:58:25.630 --> 01:58:29.730
the time limit is reached so again and again again and again

01:58:29.730 --> 01:58:33.550
again and again so it just kept on thinking it is able to

01:58:33.550 --> 01:58:37.410
even reach out to my kb search and it was it was technically

01:58:37.410 --> 01:58:41.730
trying to like a search basically uh some of the data which

01:58:41.730 --> 01:58:46.630
i have already given over here right so some of the data it

01:58:46.630 --> 01:58:49.970
is able to do it and maybe it is it is not able to like uh

01:58:49.970 --> 01:58:53.450
uh understand the question or maybe it is not able to do

01:58:53.450 --> 01:58:56.530
something so it has it has basically ended right it has it

01:58:56.530 --> 01:58:59.610
has basically ended but yeah it is able to reach out to my

01:58:59.610 --> 01:59:04.990
agent now the only goal for me is that that try to make this

01:59:04.990 --> 01:59:09.090
agent better so that it will not just reach to the agent but

01:59:09.090 --> 01:59:12.750
it will also try to give me the final output let me test it

01:59:12.750 --> 01:59:15.710
with another agent by the way so maybe i can try to call

01:59:15.710 --> 01:59:18.710
some of the mathematical things right so i will try to call

01:59:18.710 --> 01:59:21.690
some of the mathematical things i will try to copy the same

01:59:21.690 --> 01:59:25.530
print i'll just change my input statement so orchestration

01:59:25.530 --> 01:59:30.070
invoke and my input is going to be let's suppose uh i can

01:59:30.070 --> 01:59:35.550
write what is basically sign of maybe like a 90 let's

01:59:35.550 --> 01:59:42.190
suppose yeah sign of 90 execute so again router choice math

01:59:42.190 --> 01:59:47.170
see by default it is able to route right and here so could

01:59:47.170 --> 01:59:50.810
not parse the llm output thought so it is thinking to find

01:59:50.810 --> 01:59:53.450
the sign of 90 i need to evaluate the sign of 90 degrees

01:59:53.450 --> 01:59:56.370
since the calculation works so this is just a internal stuff

01:59:57.770 --> 02:00:00.770
to see from the like a verbose so the calculator works with

02:00:00.770 --> 02:00:05.010
the radiant by default i will like you know convert 90

02:00:05.010 --> 02:00:07.630
degree to the radian so now it is able to understand that

02:00:07.630 --> 02:00:10.230
okay 90 if someone has mentioned so i have to convert that

02:00:10.230 --> 02:00:13.850
to a radian by the way so pi by 2 now i will calculate sine

02:00:13.850 --> 02:00:18.710
of pi by 2 right so action by using one of the tool and it

02:00:18.710 --> 02:00:21.630
is by default trying to call my tool called as calculator

02:00:21.630 --> 02:00:25.870
yeah so a tool called as calculator so again it is like a

02:00:25.870 --> 02:00:29.510
thinking again it is trying to call the action action by

02:00:29.510 --> 02:00:33.950
using one of the tool so sine of pi by 2 radian is one this

02:00:33.950 --> 02:00:37.250
is my output it is able to give so yeah my calculator agent

02:00:37.250 --> 02:00:40.670
is working fine and this is basically a chain of thoughts

02:00:40.670 --> 02:00:45.410
yeah this is basically a chain of thought so successfully we

02:00:45.410 --> 02:00:48.890
are able to create a system now i can now claim that okay

02:00:48.890 --> 02:00:53.710
successfully i am able to create a system so where we have a

02:00:53.710 --> 02:00:58.670
multiple agents so we have basically agent number agent

02:00:58.670 --> 02:01:04.090
number one we have basically agent number two and agent

02:01:04.090 --> 02:01:08.570
number two it is able to choose which agent i am supposed to

02:01:08.570 --> 02:01:10.990
use in which cases i'm not saying anything right i'm just

02:01:10.990 --> 02:01:13.270
trying to call orchestrator or invoke i'm just trying to

02:01:13.270 --> 02:01:15.570
pass my message right i'm just trying to pass my message

02:01:15.570 --> 02:01:19.330
over here and it is able to like a decide that okay whether

02:01:19.330 --> 02:01:22.070
this query should go for this one whether this query should

02:01:22.070 --> 02:01:26.490
go for this one and then eventually if agent is powerful

02:01:26.490 --> 02:01:32.070
enough right it is trying to execute it execute it after

02:01:32.070 --> 02:01:34.850
giving us like a chain of thoughts and then finally i am

02:01:34.850 --> 02:01:39.290
able to get the output right so this is called as agentic ai

02:01:39.290 --> 02:01:44.190
by the way system is deciding taking decision automatically

02:01:44.190 --> 02:01:47.090
i have just created once now anyone can come and anyone can

02:01:47.090 --> 02:01:49.490
try to you know give any kind of things mathematical

02:01:49.490 --> 02:01:52.490
expression obviously because it will work just with the

02:01:52.490 --> 02:01:54.970
agent capability if that that agent is not available

02:01:54.970 --> 02:01:57.310
obviously it will not work and this is the internal

02:01:57.310 --> 02:01:59.850
mechanism that it is following so this is what lanche is

02:01:59.850 --> 02:02:04.410
doing internally so calling my llms and then like processing

02:02:04.410 --> 02:02:07.650
the thoughts one by one one by one one by one and then

02:02:07.650 --> 02:02:13.410
finally i am able to get the output over here yes so

02:02:13.410 --> 02:02:16.390
basically input was what is sign 90 this is the input

02:02:16.390 --> 02:02:21.290
finished chat history so human message what is sign 90 and

02:02:21.290 --> 02:02:24.570
then it is able to give

02:02:28.340 --> 02:02:32.120
me the final output so output is stopped okay fine this is

02:02:32.120 --> 02:02:35.260
the final but yeah in between i am able to get the output

02:02:35.260 --> 02:02:38.200
the sign of pi by 2 is radian pi by 2 is this one

02:02:44.570 --> 02:02:46.830
yes okay

02:02:48.660 --> 02:02:54.040
so now let me give this entire notebook to all of you so

02:02:54.040 --> 02:02:57.000
that all of you can test it because i have like uh made a

02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:01.920
lot of typo mistake in between uh so i have changed couple

02:03:01.920 --> 02:03:06.600
of things plus i have added one more line chain line so

02:03:15.490 --> 02:03:19.810
control s and copy path let

02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:44.700
me save it somewhere yeah

02:05:04.350 --> 02:05:06.850
so here is the link guys drive link you can download this

02:05:06.850 --> 02:05:11.950
latest one with all the fixes replace key with your own key

02:05:11.950 --> 02:05:16.990
and then maybe you can try to like a run it so

02:05:31.260 --> 02:05:34.380
someone is asking can you fix the kb okay i'll fix it uh

02:05:34.380 --> 02:05:36.100
basically fine

02:05:47.590 --> 02:05:50.150
guys just just download it and execute it let me know if you

02:05:50.150 --> 02:05:52.770
are able to execute with your own api key so just change the

02:05:52.770 --> 02:05:55.650
api key and then run it everything will work now do

02:06:47.810 --> 02:06:50.410
it guys quick and let me know in

02:06:53.390 --> 02:06:58.710
between i can look into my kb so what is the capital of

02:06:58.710 --> 02:07:02.550
france why it is not giving me the answer it should id like

02:07:02.550 --> 02:07:08.130
uh because it is able to reach out to this function so uh

02:07:08.130 --> 02:07:12.950
basically why it is not giving me the output uh i'll tell

02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:16.090
you the reason so if you will look into the output right uh

02:07:16.090 --> 02:07:19.970
this trace if you will look into it so when i have given

02:07:19.970 --> 02:07:24.410
input what is the capital of france so internally it is

02:07:24.410 --> 02:07:27.910
trying to convert my query into capital of france not what

02:07:27.910 --> 02:07:30.990
is the capital of france and over there i am doing a

02:07:30.990 --> 02:07:34.630
dictionary match right so dictionary dot get means uh

02:07:34.630 --> 02:07:38.510
basically my kb document dot get which i am trying to do so

02:07:38.510 --> 02:07:43.390
it's not same key is not same so because of that although

02:07:43.390 --> 02:07:46.630
intent is same but key is not same because basically the key

02:07:46.630 --> 02:07:49.850
is what is the capital of france and internally i can see it

02:07:49.850 --> 02:07:53.230
is converting it into capital of france so because of that i

02:07:53.230 --> 02:07:57.090
have to fix it if i'm like able to fix it either i have to

02:07:57.090 --> 02:08:00.910
fix this or maybe i can try to fix my search inside my kb so

02:08:00.910 --> 02:08:04.630
then things will work so that that's actual issue with my kb

02:08:04.630 --> 02:08:08.170
search there is no other issue hope all of you are able to

02:08:08.170 --> 02:08:10.810
understand why am i why it is able to reach out to the kb

02:08:10.810 --> 02:08:13.790
but still it is not able to you know uh give me the output

02:08:13.790 --> 02:08:15.430
for a kb do

02:08:44.680 --> 02:08:47.080
it guys execute and let me know no

02:09:18.400 --> 02:09:22.240
module name anxious core execute then if not done the

02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:25.480
installation of these things which is already mentioned this

02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:28.960
one then it will not work this installation we have done

02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:30.860
yesterday itself 401

02:09:56.340 --> 02:10:02.140
unauthorized url no it will not give you uh that so you have

02:10:02.140 --> 02:10:07.240
to pass a correct key over here just pass a correct key it

02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:07.680
will work

02:10:14.300 --> 02:10:18.360
in between let me fix my searching inside a knowledge base

02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:24.460
let me make it little bit parametrize agent is fine agent is

02:10:24.460 --> 02:10:28.080
working for me so knowledge base the only thing is here it

02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:31.180
is failing in terms of matching because my lms is trying to

02:10:31.180 --> 02:10:35.360
convert things into like you know a different question and

02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:38.260
here we are just doing a dictionary search basically so

02:10:38.260 --> 02:10:41.660
dictionary search always works on key to key so

02:10:43.860 --> 02:10:49.220
here whenever someone is sending me a query i can convert

02:10:49.220 --> 02:10:54.720
those query into a lower and then just call the strip for

02:10:54.720 --> 02:11:01.020
the cleaning purposes now that will become my uh query query

02:11:01.020 --> 02:11:05.420
and then let's do one thing parse all the string which is a

02:11:05.420 --> 02:11:12.360
part of this query so q in knowledge base uh okay so for key

02:11:12.360 --> 02:11:20.680
and nswer in knowledge base dot items and uh let's go ahead

02:11:20.680 --> 02:11:23.660
with regex matching yeah

02:11:33.900 --> 02:11:37.780
so i just made my like a matching independent of the entire

02:11:37.780 --> 02:11:43.900
key um basically now it will match even based out of one of

02:11:43.900 --> 02:11:47.460
these words one of this key right i'm just iterating through

02:11:47.460 --> 02:11:50.160
all the string this is just a simple python implementation

02:11:50.160 --> 02:11:53.040
now let me run the what

02:11:55.380 --> 02:12:00.820
happened for geo3 forbidden this one okay run once again i

02:12:00.820 --> 02:12:07.700
think many people are hitting my api key okay let me handle

02:12:07.700 --> 02:12:07.940
it

02:12:14.590 --> 02:12:20.430
api api keys and delete the previous one let me check the

02:12:20.430 --> 02:12:24.950
uses oh i have already crossed my uh limit for today it's a

02:12:24.950 --> 02:12:29.170
one lakh token um that's amazing many people have used it i

02:12:29.170 --> 02:12:35.870
can see now so crossed my limit for today let me use my

02:12:35.870 --> 02:12:39.110
different account i have crossed my limit because many

02:12:39.110 --> 02:12:44.710
people have used it uh it's it's not just me okay let me use

02:12:44.710 --> 02:12:50.870
my another account create a api key okay so i have to check

02:12:50.870 --> 02:12:55.950
if i have a plus access working now one key replacement was

02:12:55.950 --> 02:13:00.870
missed yeah it will work all this code is working okay this

02:13:00.870 --> 02:13:06.070
is my another account api key let's go and create one okay

02:13:14.300 --> 02:13:15.860
where is my api

02:13:19.100 --> 02:13:19.620
okay

02:13:34.020 --> 02:13:37.480
so kb i'm executing as you can see and my question was what

02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:40.700
is the capital of france it is just trying to call the

02:13:40.700 --> 02:13:43.560
reactive agent uh basically which is trying to initiate my

02:13:43.560 --> 02:13:49.620
action thoughts and everything and yeah kb search capital of

02:13:49.620 --> 02:13:54.450
france chain finished not

02:13:57.360 --> 02:14:04.240
able to see for troubleshooting okay thoughts are we able to

02:14:04.240 --> 02:14:07.060
get the answer action by using one of the tool kb search so

02:14:07.060 --> 02:14:12.300
fine it is able to reach out to my agents uh but still not

02:14:14.540 --> 02:14:21.920
able to fetch the output anywhere okay so i have to tune

02:14:23.270 --> 02:14:30.350
little bit my tool so key answer knowledge base item regex

02:14:30.350 --> 02:14:34.750
full matching maybe it is not able to do it i can keep it

02:14:34.750 --> 02:14:43.190
simple that if key is in query return answer so if key is

02:14:43.190 --> 02:14:44.550
available in my query

02:14:49.970 --> 02:14:52.410
return answer okay capital

02:14:58.940 --> 02:15:05.420
of france action query thought action query thought capital

02:15:05.420 --> 02:15:07.480
of france key

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:19.260
is in query so capital of france let's suppose this is the

02:15:19.260 --> 02:15:21.280
query and

02:15:23.900 --> 02:15:28.160
capital of france is available capital

02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:35.540
of france capital

02:16:12.950 --> 02:16:18.810
of france let me send only one token then so question

02:16:29.370 --> 02:16:31.170
and

02:16:32.650 --> 02:16:38.030
query of only let's suppose last

02:16:44.590 --> 02:16:52.290
let's try to fetch only the last one and write it as a query

02:16:53.860 --> 02:17:02.820
and then key is in knowledge base if so

02:17:06.530 --> 02:17:10.450
query of this one so this will fetch let's suppose france

02:17:10.450 --> 02:17:16.730
and i have to just check that it's available inside this

02:17:18.940 --> 02:17:20.480
one or not here

02:17:27.260 --> 02:17:29.520
not this for

02:17:33.260 --> 02:17:34.660
key

02:17:37.320 --> 02:17:46.960
in knowledge base dot keys if it is available here query

02:17:59.700 --> 02:18:07.240
in key return knowledge base of key

02:18:12.550 --> 02:18:19.050
capital of france kb search capital of france capital

02:18:38.220 --> 02:18:41.080
of france if capital it is returning now

02:18:51.700 --> 02:18:53.720
i'm doing a lower so

02:19:06.840 --> 02:19:09.440
basically guys it's like a why

02:19:11.430 --> 02:19:13.450
i'm not able to get the output because basically it's like a

02:19:13.450 --> 02:19:13.450
it's like a it's like a it's like a it's like a it's like a

02:19:13.450 --> 02:19:16.130
reason is simple like it is not able to do a search in my

02:19:16.130 --> 02:19:20.350
this one so i just have to write like a python handler over

02:19:20.350 --> 02:19:23.330
there it will work by the way this

02:19:30.590 --> 02:19:34.290
is working for me now but with a multiple calls yeah so see

02:19:34.290 --> 02:19:37.770
this a multiple calls is nothing but it's a result of your

02:19:37.770 --> 02:19:41.110
reactive agent and you have made your verbose is equals to

02:19:41.110 --> 02:19:43.930
true if you are so basically this is what reactive agent

02:19:43.930 --> 02:19:47.690
does so here see you are able to see this multiple things uh

02:19:47.690 --> 02:19:50.190
in a inside your console because of this one verbose is

02:19:50.190 --> 02:19:52.470
equal to true make it false you will not be able to see

02:19:52.470 --> 02:19:54.630
anything you will be able to see just a output part number

02:19:54.630 --> 02:19:58.330
one part number two is that that we have created a reactive

02:19:58.330 --> 02:20:01.030
agent reactive agent what it does so basically it will try

02:20:01.030 --> 02:20:03.850
to call the action then it will try to call basically a

02:20:03.850 --> 02:20:06.850
chain of thoughts and then it is going to run it it will try

02:20:06.850 --> 02:20:09.330
to face the data and we'll keep on doing it multiple times

02:20:09.330 --> 02:20:12.610
right it will keep on doing it and that's the nature and

02:20:12.610 --> 02:20:14.430
this is what you are trying to print it with the help of

02:20:14.430 --> 02:20:17.470
reverse is equal to true so that's the nature by default you

02:20:17.470 --> 02:20:19.270
can't like avoid that part i

02:20:29.320 --> 02:20:30.740
am just trying to fix it so i'm going to try to fix it so

02:20:30.740 --> 02:20:32.300
i'm going to fix this so that it will give me at least the

02:20:32.300 --> 02:20:39.700
output so query lower fine strip fine so s t r i p so

02:20:39.700 --> 02:20:44.360
convert that into a lower strip even a question if i have

02:20:44.360 --> 02:20:51.020
okay and then for key answer

02:20:53.040 --> 02:20:58.060
in knowledge base answer in knowledge base item if key is in

02:20:58.060 --> 02:21:03.780
query yeah so if key is available in query return the answer

02:21:03.780 --> 02:21:04.460
i

02:21:18.630 --> 02:21:21.590
will serve the knowledge base for the capital of france this

02:21:21.590 --> 02:21:27.730
is the thought it has but because of my logic it is not able

02:21:27.730 --> 02:21:30.250
to match capital

02:21:32.910 --> 02:21:35.270
of france okay

02:21:40.040 --> 02:21:45.700
final answer is one so first one it is trying to return got

02:21:45.700 --> 02:21:52.180
it final answer is basically one it is giving me answer so i

02:21:52.180 --> 02:21:53.680
just have to return

02:21:56.630 --> 02:21:58.190
knowledge base of one

02:22:00.890 --> 02:22:05.650
basically k no w knowledge base of this answer it's a

02:22:05.650 --> 02:22:09.370
dictionary right so i just have to return this part so

02:22:09.370 --> 02:22:11.810
knowledge base of one let's

02:22:15.430 --> 02:22:19.850
see anyhow it will be like fixed capital

02:22:24.420 --> 02:22:30.040
of france answer one final answer one one one two

02:22:32.570 --> 02:22:33.590
okay

02:22:43.030 --> 02:22:46.870
so i think in my prompt someone has highlighted the correct

02:22:46.870 --> 02:22:50.690
manner let me check my prompt as well because it is it is

02:22:50.690 --> 02:22:54.390
able to search but where is my prompt so system you are a

02:22:54.390 --> 02:22:56.090
helpful association that can answer question based on your

02:22:56.090 --> 02:22:59.990
knowledge based you can use the following tool fine when you

02:22:59.990 --> 02:23:02.110
are going through this tool follow the instruction exactly

02:23:02.110 --> 02:23:05.390
the same form the question thoughts action fine by using

02:23:05.390 --> 02:23:08.610
tool access you have answer when is given okay

02:23:12.170 --> 02:23:15.350
always finish with the final answer

02:23:17.500 --> 02:23:20.180
to the question question that

02:23:22.670 --> 02:23:30.950
you are able to to search from my knowledge base okay so i

02:23:30.950 --> 02:23:34.230
have just changed a prompt little bit that's the reason i

02:23:34.230 --> 02:23:35.590
was just wondering why it is giving like

02:23:42.920 --> 02:23:46.180
thoughts thoughts thoughts answer

02:24:07.330 --> 02:24:08.350
now

02:24:12.130 --> 02:24:16.870
at least it is not calling like a yeah now i am able to get

02:24:16.870 --> 02:24:19.630
the answer see final answer in a single attempt itself the

02:24:19.630 --> 02:24:23.550
capital of france is paris yeah so from my knowledge base i

02:24:23.550 --> 02:24:26.350
am able to get the answer it was a minor tweak so in my

02:24:26.350 --> 02:24:29.710
prompt i have just like you know copied the same prompt of

02:24:29.710 --> 02:24:33.670
calculator into this one so that was one mistake second

02:24:33.670 --> 02:24:36.550
mistake was that was not a mistake by the way second thing

02:24:36.550 --> 02:24:38.890
was like a parsing so i have written a for loop and for loop

02:24:38.890 --> 02:24:41.690
is working so it is able to like give me the final output

02:24:41.690 --> 02:24:44.490
the capital of france is paris the capital of france so

02:24:44.490 --> 02:24:47.010
again and again it is trying and every time it is able to

02:24:47.010 --> 02:24:50.290
like get the final answer as a capital of france is paris

02:24:50.290 --> 02:24:55.330
yeah so see guys uh my objective was to show you that how to

02:24:55.330 --> 02:24:58.710
create a agent part number one i think we are able to

02:24:58.710 --> 02:25:02.630
fulfill that objective in a lang chain my second objective

02:25:02.630 --> 02:25:07.370
was to show you that how it is able to route because i could

02:25:07.370 --> 02:25:10.630
have created one agent but in one agent uh you will not be

02:25:10.630 --> 02:25:13.550
able to understand that okay because if there is only one

02:25:13.550 --> 02:25:16.850
agent obviously it will go and call that agent if that agent

02:25:16.850 --> 02:25:20.030
is like a something which is going to fulfill the task

02:25:20.030 --> 02:25:21.130
otherwise it will not be able to fulfill the task otherwise

02:25:21.130 --> 02:25:24.470
it will call the default or fallback you can say. So

02:25:24.470 --> 02:25:28.010
successfully we are able to test it. So here when I am

02:25:28.010 --> 02:25:31.530
sending this input right as a chat you can say so when we

02:25:31.530 --> 02:25:34.690
are sending this chat automatically it is able to decide

02:25:34.690 --> 02:25:37.850
that okay I should call this agent when I am trying to send

02:25:37.850 --> 02:25:40.630
a chat for like some sort of a mathematical calculation

02:25:40.630 --> 02:25:43.930
automatically it is able to decide that it is a calculator

02:25:43.930 --> 02:25:47.430
one which it is supposed to call. Let's suppose on some

02:25:47.430 --> 02:25:51.610
event I have to book someone's calendar yeah I have to

02:25:51.610 --> 02:25:55.230
schedule a meeting on just with the chat just with the chat

02:25:55.230 --> 02:25:59.210
input just like this input right. So like based on some

02:25:59.210 --> 02:26:03.250
input I have to send a whatsapp message. Based on some input

02:26:03.250 --> 02:26:06.950
I have to send a telegram message. Based on some input if I

02:26:06.950 --> 02:26:10.270
have to prepare maybe a summary of the document. Based on

02:26:10.270 --> 02:26:14.550
some input if I have to maybe like execute the entire ops

02:26:14.550 --> 02:26:19.870
pipeline or deploy the code yeah can we say we can do it we

02:26:19.870 --> 02:26:22.130
just have to keep on writing the separate separate function

02:26:22.130 --> 02:26:26.610
yeah one function for booking a calendar maybe with the help

02:26:26.610 --> 02:26:31.430
of calendarly API right or maybe a google meet API. Then we

02:26:31.430 --> 02:26:34.230
can try to call maybe like a server API for doing a real

02:26:34.230 --> 02:26:36.910
time search. So we can create one tool for that one function

02:26:36.910 --> 02:26:39.550
for that we can create one function for sending a whatsapp

02:26:39.550 --> 02:26:43.610
messages by using maybe a vati right we can try to like

02:26:43.610 --> 02:26:46.810
create one function I think in my previous class we have

02:26:46.810 --> 02:26:51.530
used like a mail right SMTP we were trying to use. So can we

02:26:51.530 --> 02:26:54.710
say that we can try to create one function which will just

02:26:54.710 --> 02:26:57.390
be responsible for sending a mail. It will take email id as

02:26:57.390 --> 02:26:59.770
an input and send the mail yes

02:27:04.730 --> 02:27:07.530
can we say that we can we can do it yeah.

02:27:09.500 --> 02:27:12.520
So can we say that that we can try to create any number of

02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:17.380
agent that we want and just with the chat I can like call

02:27:17.380 --> 02:27:20.580
those agents automatically my system will be able to call

02:27:20.580 --> 02:27:23.120
those agents automatically. Can I say that yes

02:27:27.700 --> 02:27:30.740
so that that's a that's a beauty of like you know calling

02:27:30.740 --> 02:27:35.040
the agent now as a task what I will what you can do maybe

02:27:35.040 --> 02:27:40.460
you can do the experimentation. So one whatsapp tool try to

02:27:40.460 --> 02:27:46.280
add it then email tool try to add it right then third maybe

02:27:46.280 --> 02:27:50.100
SMS tool you can try to add it fourth you can try to add

02:27:50.100 --> 02:27:57.680
maybe a telegram it's also like easy one. 5th one. Email is

02:27:57.680 --> 02:28:05.040
done fifth one you can try to use maybe a calendar tool you

02:28:05.040 --> 02:28:08.640
can try to create you can try to create a notes like a

02:28:08.640 --> 02:28:14.440
taking tool live note taking tool just try this out anyhow

02:28:14.440 --> 02:28:16.740
I'm going to teach you even if you're not going to try it's

02:28:16.740 --> 02:28:19.840
completely fine but yeah so if you have a time I think we

02:28:19.840 --> 02:28:22.520
all have a time for this entire weekend for this entire week

02:28:22.520 --> 02:28:26.120
five days of time. So just try to search. Or maybe try to

02:28:26.120 --> 02:28:29.740
explore that how to create a function because the only thing

02:28:29.740 --> 02:28:32.520
is that that you have to write this function simple these

02:28:32.520 --> 02:28:36.780
kind of functions right these kind of functions that's it

02:28:36.780 --> 02:28:42.560
done simple. So just try to do your research and just try to

02:28:42.560 --> 02:28:46.040
create these tools email I think email is the easiest one I

02:28:46.040 --> 02:28:48.820
have already shown you so I don't think that any one of you

02:28:48.820 --> 02:28:50.780
are going to face any kind of issue with respect to our

02:28:50.780 --> 02:28:54.220
emails whatsapp SMS telegram and calendar maybe you can try

02:28:54.220 --> 02:28:57.720
to explore. And then just with the help of chat that okay

02:28:57.720 --> 02:29:01.300
send an email to this person send a SMS to this person send

02:29:01.300 --> 02:29:04.400
a whatsapp message to this number send a telegram message to

02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:07.340
this particular telegram ID or like you know schedule a

02:29:07.340 --> 02:29:12.680
meeting from this to this with this particular user. Try to

02:29:12.680 --> 02:29:14.040
call it yeah.

02:29:21.730 --> 02:29:26.410
So this is all about my today's class. I think this is

02:29:26.410 --> 02:29:29.210
already available to all of you so now if you have any kind

02:29:29.210 --> 02:29:31.210
of a doubt so we can start taking your questions. Your

02:29:31.210 --> 02:29:34.390
doubts and then we are going to close the classes. But hope

02:29:34.390 --> 02:29:38.330
all of you are able to. Can you share the modified tool KB

02:29:38.330 --> 02:29:46.690
search okay tool fine KB yeah this is the only like query I

02:29:46.690 --> 02:29:51.430
have added so let's just take this one okay and you have to

02:29:51.430 --> 02:29:54.010
change this one as well for a KB search you have to change

02:29:54.010 --> 02:29:55.490
the prompt yeah

02:29:58.660 --> 02:30:00.940
file will be shared anyhow file I am going to upload it

02:30:00.940 --> 02:30:07.280
inside the dashboard so you all can use it. Yeah. Okay so

02:30:07.280 --> 02:30:11.040
anyone guys who is not able to understand the agent part

02:30:11.040 --> 02:30:14.460
like how agent actually works how it is trying to route it

02:30:14.460 --> 02:30:17.500
how it is able to invoke it any anyone who is not able to

02:30:17.500 --> 02:30:19.720
understand anything I'm

02:30:25.090 --> 02:30:27.670
just waiting for your chat all of you are able to understand

02:30:27.670 --> 02:30:28.830
yes

02:30:33.540 --> 02:30:38.840
sir follows some job but code is bit tough it's not a bit

02:30:38.840 --> 02:30:42.420
tough code I would say it's just a process that we have

02:30:42.420 --> 02:30:45.200
followed and doesn't matter like how many times you are

02:30:45.200 --> 02:30:47.640
going to create the agent with the language in you will

02:30:47.640 --> 02:30:50.440
follow the exact same sequence see the major code is your

02:30:50.440 --> 02:30:54.800
tool code that's it right the tool code apart from that just

02:30:54.800 --> 02:30:56.900
a standard approach that we are following apart from that

02:30:56.900 --> 02:30:59.880
there is no code actually so Langton has already defined it

02:30:59.880 --> 02:31:02.880
and we are just trying to use it again nothing to remember

02:31:02.880 --> 02:31:06.840
nothing to memorize it's not under our control basically

02:31:06.840 --> 02:31:09.800
it's under Langton's control so whatever framework that they

02:31:09.800 --> 02:31:13.980
have created we are just using that set template without any

02:31:13.980 --> 02:31:18.060
kind of a control. Okay. As simple as that right the only

02:31:18.060 --> 02:31:22.860
control that we have over a logic is our tool that's it that

02:31:22.860 --> 02:31:27.980
is something that that we are like a creating crew is very

02:31:27.980 --> 02:31:31.420
easy yeah even land graph is very easy right land graph is

02:31:31.420 --> 02:31:34.280
but again you have to create a tools see this tool part

02:31:34.280 --> 02:31:36.720
again whether you are using a land graph whether you are

02:31:36.720 --> 02:31:39.880
using a crew AI whether you are using a land chain doesn't

02:31:39.880 --> 02:31:42.920
matter at all tool is something that you have to create

02:31:42.920 --> 02:31:45.980
because that's your custom function right that's your custom

02:31:45.980 --> 02:31:49.540
agents. So and and how system will know that which tool you

02:31:49.540 --> 02:31:52.100
have to call whether you have to call or maybe like a real

02:31:52.100 --> 02:31:54.940
time source tool or like a calculator tool or maybe WhatsApp

02:31:54.940 --> 02:31:57.460
tool or telegram tool or any other tool. So this is

02:31:57.460 --> 02:32:00.340
something that we are we used to create this is where like

02:32:00.340 --> 02:32:03.900
our responsibilities and rules will come into a pictures the

02:32:03.900 --> 02:32:06.880
rest is just a standard procedure whatever we have done

02:32:06.880 --> 02:32:10.740
after tool creation it is something which has been defined

02:32:10.740 --> 02:32:16.230
by Langton we have just followed the template we are adding

02:32:16.230 --> 02:32:18.890
tool by creating our agents. So why do we need to add it.

02:32:18.910 --> 02:32:22.150
Again while creating agents it's just a standard approach

02:32:22.150 --> 02:32:24.610
which has been defined by a language and so we are doing it

02:32:24.610 --> 02:32:28.050
right like I said we don't have much of control after that.

02:32:36.190 --> 02:32:38.330
Yes fine okay

02:32:52.120 --> 02:32:55.020
so now let's

02:33:03.120 --> 02:33:08.560
go ahead with the question why it keeps on iterating even

02:33:08.560 --> 02:33:11.460
after the final answer it will go like this is the this is

02:33:11.460 --> 02:33:13.180
what reactive does so

02:33:18.330 --> 02:33:20.710
we will learn about MCP monogamous protocol yeah that's a

02:33:20.710 --> 02:33:23.390
part of your syllabus. So again. Again inside a model

02:33:23.390 --> 02:33:28.270
contest protocol we created tools and we assign to some of

02:33:28.270 --> 02:33:32.550
the like frameworks or maybe a tools which can call MCP

02:33:32.550 --> 02:33:35.370
protocol just like API but

02:33:40.650 --> 02:33:44.950
we have we covered enough JNI in terms of using LLMs doing a

02:33:44.950 --> 02:33:47.510
fine tuning yeah I think it's a part of syllabus you can

02:33:47.510 --> 02:33:51.530
check the syllabus first. So now it's time for a question so

02:33:51.530 --> 02:33:54.030
raise your hand guys those who have a question and then one

02:33:54.030 --> 02:33:58.170
by one let's go ahead with it. Yeah. Anyone who is having

02:33:58.170 --> 02:34:04.960
question raise your hand. So first Prabhat Kumar Jena you

02:34:04.960 --> 02:34:08.840
can go ahead second Kushal Kumar you can go ahead third

02:34:08.840 --> 02:34:14.020
Abhijeet. Yeah. Go ahead. Hi sir. Yeah. Hi. Yeah. Sir

02:34:14.020 --> 02:34:17.340
actually I am referring to the like last week because they

02:34:17.340 --> 02:34:21.060
are like we are build a medieval chart right so I have

02:34:21.060 --> 02:34:24.020
questions regarding to that mostly okay yeah go ahead build

02:34:24.020 --> 02:34:27.760
it using like react on next.js and the backend is fast API.

02:34:28.040 --> 02:34:31.300
Okay. So. So I want to make it something as production

02:34:31.300 --> 02:34:34.540
related because I want to show it to my company for like

02:34:34.540 --> 02:34:38.140
exactly like to specific my project something so I am

02:34:38.140 --> 02:34:41.680
wanting to know what in production what better stack I can

02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:45.140
use. So basically for your front end right so let's suppose

02:34:45.140 --> 02:34:47.920
if which which one you have used next right for front end

02:34:47.920 --> 02:34:51.180
react I'm not exactly implemented but I'm planning to what

02:34:51.180 --> 02:34:54.020
exactly to find. Okay so fine so if you are using a next or

02:34:54.020 --> 02:34:56.820
react basically like people are using next we are not using

02:34:56.820 --> 02:35:00.160
react but it's a deprecated one. So basically you can think

02:35:00.160 --> 02:35:03.260
about it. You can try to use a apply from AWS or maybe you

02:35:03.260 --> 02:35:05.960
can try to use a Vercel for your front end deployment. Yeah.

02:35:06.360 --> 02:35:09.520
Better to go ahead with apply. So it's it's again Vercel is

02:35:09.520 --> 02:35:12.340
also same like but yeah why do you separate separate

02:35:12.340 --> 02:35:16.700
platform so just try to use AWS and in case of AWS apply and

02:35:16.700 --> 02:35:21.820
then for a backend try to use a ECR and then try to use a

02:35:21.820 --> 02:35:25.740
ECS basically and then maybe you can try to use an app

02:35:25.740 --> 02:35:29.800
runner on top of it. So ECR for a registry. ECS for serving.

02:35:29.800 --> 02:35:32.200
For serving and then try to call those maybe into an app

02:35:32.200 --> 02:35:35.940
runner or maybe just ECS right and in that way your backend

02:35:35.940 --> 02:35:39.000
will be productionized. If you have to attach maybe a

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.460
catching or something which is not required for at least a

02:35:41.460 --> 02:35:44.340
demo application. So catching wise you can try to attach a

02:35:44.340 --> 02:35:47.320
reduce if you want database wise you can try to go to RDS

02:35:47.320 --> 02:35:51.780
from if you're attaching a databases for some of the work if

02:35:51.780 --> 02:35:54.880
you're attaching some sort of a relational databases then go

02:35:54.880 --> 02:35:57.960
to the RDS services into AWS and then from there you can

02:35:57.960 --> 02:36:00.540
choose your favorite databases. Just all databases will be

02:36:00.540 --> 02:36:03.620
listed down over there including a postgres and SQL and

02:36:03.620 --> 02:36:07.400
everything. Yeah so database is done catching is done front

02:36:07.400 --> 02:36:12.360
is done back end is done. So here my question is like you

02:36:12.360 --> 02:36:15.980
you said earlier there is URI is you made using mon right.

02:36:16.620 --> 02:36:21.020
Yeah basically mon front and back end both. So what like

02:36:21.020 --> 02:36:24.040
python part it is used for agents and like anything it is

02:36:24.040 --> 02:36:27.380
used for particularly our agent tech stuff or. For for

02:36:27.380 --> 02:36:29.540
couple of things. We have used python. Instead of using a

02:36:29.540 --> 02:36:32.860
node js code but not much the URI that you are able to see

02:36:32.860 --> 02:36:34.780
as of now even though there is a previous version of the

02:36:34.780 --> 02:36:37.960
URI. So over there we have written front end and back end

02:36:37.960 --> 02:36:40.800
completely by using a mon stack means front end by using a

02:36:40.800 --> 02:36:44.120
next by the way a react alternative you can say and then

02:36:44.120 --> 02:36:48.500
back end by node. So so what do you suggest for like a back

02:36:48.500 --> 02:36:52.160
end also I am Python is also good go with the node but yeah

02:36:52.160 --> 02:36:54.980
if you don't know node if you are comfortable with python go

02:36:54.980 --> 02:36:57.060
ahead with that because at the end of the day you are going

02:36:57.060 --> 02:37:00.380
to consume everything as an API. So let's suppose if I don't

02:37:00.380 --> 02:37:03.060
know node it's it's completely okay go with the python and

02:37:03.060 --> 02:37:08.160
use a fast API. Oh yes but I know express and I because I am

02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:12.880
unstack developer then it's cool then it's cool then like go

02:37:12.880 --> 02:37:17.800
ahead with the mon concern is like for industry when I like

02:37:17.800 --> 02:37:22.600
I will like so my resume like projects so they are not

02:37:22.600 --> 02:37:25.500
checking the stack or then the if we had done something on.

02:37:25.580 --> 02:37:27.440
Obviously they will check their stack. So obviously they

02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:30.340
will be looking for. If you know inside a JD someone has

02:37:30.340 --> 02:37:32.160
mentioned a python so obviously they will be looking for a

02:37:32.160 --> 02:37:37.220
python inside your resume. So is it python using first API

02:37:37.220 --> 02:37:41.600
in the back end will be benefits in this time it's just like

02:37:41.600 --> 02:37:45.660
you have to say that okay I have used fast API no one is

02:37:45.660 --> 02:37:48.740
going to come and check your code right. Yes sir but I will

02:37:48.740 --> 02:37:52.500
give the repo in the github for the like for them obviously

02:37:52.500 --> 02:37:55.300
yes so maybe you can just try to do a wipe coding convert

02:37:55.300 --> 02:37:58.120
your next years or sorry convert your back end code. You can

02:37:58.120 --> 02:38:01.900
do a fast API code I guess I know first a pacer I can yeah

02:38:01.900 --> 02:38:05.680
so just before that planning is there like what I'm planning

02:38:05.680 --> 02:38:08.960
to so that I'm asking you if is it if I'm in the right path

02:38:08.960 --> 02:38:11.760
or not yeah it's the right path actually so anything you can

02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:15.660
use anything back end python or maybe a node based it's

02:38:15.660 --> 02:38:18.720
completely fine so they are they will not see exactly the

02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:21.120
lang chain is not used or lang graph is not used in this

02:38:21.120 --> 02:38:23.540
particular project that is fine for them right and they will

02:38:23.540 --> 02:38:28.020
see whatever you will show as simple as that. Like. Right.

02:38:28.120 --> 02:38:31.300
Like selection process like it is mostly will focus on JD

02:38:31.300 --> 02:38:34.200
what exactly the JD is provided and will provide the project

02:38:34.200 --> 02:38:40.820
accordingly. Yes. Yeah. Got it. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. Next

02:38:40.820 --> 02:38:41.820
one guys. Go ahead.

02:38:47.060 --> 02:38:50.500
I was getting module not found error, but like sometimes get

02:38:50.500 --> 02:38:53.480
what you're not found and it's all now so like I tested now

02:38:53.480 --> 02:38:59.020
it's all today I completed with Google even a but now I did

02:38:59.020 --> 02:39:02.980
the URI in Bergen. Okay. Okay. That's great. Great. Yeah.

02:39:03.220 --> 02:39:08.500
Okay. Abhijit. Go ahead, please. Yeah. Can we ever use

02:39:08.500 --> 02:39:13.140
multiple LLM for creating a one agent? Can we do that?

02:39:15.340 --> 02:39:20.040
Technically, no. I will say in general because one agent

02:39:20.040 --> 02:39:22.620
multiple LLMs doesn't make sense.

02:39:25.940 --> 02:39:29.880
Okay. Because I'm saying that while we passing a one API

02:39:29.880 --> 02:39:38.060
key. Okay. That will be released. So basically API key is

02:39:38.060 --> 02:39:40.940
nothing to do with the particular LLMs. Basically, it's a

02:39:40.940 --> 02:39:43.840
model name which is it's a model name which is segregating

02:39:43.840 --> 02:39:49.340
not API key. Yes. But if I'm using any open API key in that

02:39:49.340 --> 02:39:53.200
case, we need to put a model name. Yeah. Even in that case,

02:39:53.280 --> 02:39:55.880
you have to put the model ID because OpenAI one single key

02:39:55.880 --> 02:39:58.720
provides you multiple like a model access from OpenAI

02:39:58.720 --> 02:40:04.140
itself. Okay. But answer. My question is that we can use but

02:40:04.140 --> 02:40:09.880
it's not to prefer to use multiple. Exactly. I mean like why

02:40:09.880 --> 02:40:14.620
to use a multiple LLMs because one agents will be having one

02:40:14.620 --> 02:40:18.380
kind of a responsibility and we are going to design it for

02:40:18.380 --> 02:40:22.140
one single purposes. It's better to use if let's suppose we

02:40:22.140 --> 02:40:24.860
are trying to create an agent which should do a multiple

02:40:24.860 --> 02:40:28.260
task. Even in that case, just to keep my code cleaner

02:40:28.260 --> 02:40:31.700
modular, I will create a separate separate agent and keep it

02:40:31.700 --> 02:40:35.840
inside. One variable like a list, right? So that approach I

02:40:35.840 --> 02:40:39.920
can try to follow but in general one agents one LLM I think

02:40:39.920 --> 02:40:45.260
that that fits better. Okay, but the use case where we can

02:40:45.260 --> 02:40:48.760
club multiple agent activity in one one just like the

02:40:48.760 --> 02:40:52.340
editing the images just just example, let's we are getting

02:40:52.340 --> 02:40:57.700
the agent and for editing a agent, we need to crop the image

02:40:57.700 --> 02:41:03.020
for that cropping or adding the different variables. So, you

02:41:03.020 --> 02:41:08.580
know, effects on that or add any emojis on can the 3d 3d

02:41:08.580 --> 02:41:14.540
kind of stuff in that in such case. In such case, obviously

02:41:14.540 --> 02:41:18.320
see here I have clearly mentioned that this is a list right?

02:41:18.420 --> 02:41:21.340
I can try to provide a multiple tools to this one as simple

02:41:21.340 --> 02:41:28.960
as that. Yeah that that we understood for a different for

02:41:28.960 --> 02:41:34.940
particular tasks. Just like for a. Yeah. Adding the effects.

02:41:35.180 --> 02:41:37.880
So we are creating a different agent, but I'm asking if I

02:41:37.880 --> 02:41:42.320
creating one agent and I in one single agent, I will add

02:41:42.320 --> 02:41:48.020
three different tasks in that. So for one of the editing and

02:41:48.020 --> 02:41:53.140
adding the effect or adding 3d imagination. So for 3d, if I

02:41:53.140 --> 02:41:57.300
use the different LM and for editing can be okay, okay, got

02:41:57.300 --> 02:41:59.860
got your point. See what you're trying to say over here. See

02:41:59.860 --> 02:42:03.820
where we are using LLM. There are two context over here. One

02:42:03.820 --> 02:42:07.920
context is so this LLM that we have given now this LLM is

02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:10.520
trying to do what it is trying to help me out to understand

02:42:10.520 --> 02:42:15.520
the prompt agree. Yeah. Agree. Right. Okay. So basically,

02:42:15.580 --> 02:42:18.580
this is what this responsibility of this LM is. Now let's

02:42:18.580 --> 02:42:20.720
suppose if I this is the tool, this is the tool I've

02:42:20.720 --> 02:42:23.640
created. Now inside that if I'm creating a multiple task,

02:42:23.740 --> 02:42:26.400
for example, you said one image it will one will crop and

02:42:26.400 --> 02:42:29.060
then one will do maybe polishing one will do maybe like a

02:42:29.060 --> 02:42:31.300
fine tuning and then eventually it is going to give you the.

02:42:31.660 --> 02:42:35.900
Final output. That's cool. You can do it. But can we say

02:42:35.900 --> 02:42:39.520
that it's like the responsibility of this one is to

02:42:39.520 --> 02:42:43.560
understand the prompt right based on the input that you have

02:42:43.560 --> 02:42:46.780
given and if I'm using LLMs inside this one, right?

02:42:47.140 --> 02:42:49.600
Responsibility of this is different. So basically, it will

02:42:49.600 --> 02:42:52.040
be more like behave like an executor. I mean, you can say

02:42:52.040 --> 02:42:56.660
that more like a final task, you can say like a task

02:42:56.660 --> 02:43:00.060
enabler. Right? So basically here, if you're trying to use

02:43:00.060 --> 02:43:04.600
LLMs in this place. So technically it is going to do a final

02:43:04.600 --> 02:43:08.140
task here. You are trying to attach it. So technically it is

02:43:08.140 --> 02:43:13.340
trying to do a routing. Responsibility of both is different,

02:43:13.620 --> 02:43:17.200
right? So this LLM is just helping me out in terms of

02:43:17.200 --> 02:43:20.840
understanding the user query and mapping with the prompt.

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.760
This one, the reactive prompt, which I have attached with

02:43:23.760 --> 02:43:28.380
respect to a particular tool. That's it. Okay. Meanwhile,

02:43:28.480 --> 02:43:32.560
either the same one. Just like we're creating one. Exactly.

02:43:32.800 --> 02:43:36.300
Exactly. Right. So here again, so this is, this is one of

02:43:36.300 --> 02:43:38.260
the contexts. This is one of the contexts of which, where

02:43:38.260 --> 02:43:40.660
you are using one for like a routing and then you are trying

02:43:40.660 --> 02:43:43.040
to use internally this one. So it's, it's like completely

02:43:43.040 --> 02:43:46.100
two different contexts. The another context that you can try

02:43:46.100 --> 02:43:50.360
to like, again, integrate in this one is that when we are

02:43:50.360 --> 02:43:54.880
trying to create a router basically. So here we have created

02:43:54.880 --> 02:43:59.540
a router. So basically here we have created a router and

02:43:59.540 --> 02:44:02.180
then we are creating the routing chain. So that it will be

02:44:02.180 --> 02:44:04.500
able to take a routing prompt and then it will try to call

02:44:04.500 --> 02:44:07.780
the default LLM. So it doesn't matter which route it is

02:44:07.780 --> 02:44:11.080
going to follow means math or KB, it is coming from which

02:44:11.080 --> 02:44:14.500
one coming for which one LLM default, right? Now here it is

02:44:14.500 --> 02:44:17.780
possible that I can attach a multiple LLMs. So maybe I can

02:44:17.780 --> 02:44:20.360
try to attach one LLMs for just like, you know, giving the

02:44:20.360 --> 02:44:23.220
final answer, one LLM maybe for doing some sort of a

02:44:23.220 --> 02:44:27.240
reasoning over here, here it is possible. So I can, I can

02:44:27.240 --> 02:44:30.980
just like a change this particular router by writing one.

02:44:30.980 --> 02:44:34.620
Like a piece of the code called as I'm not able to see,

02:44:34.680 --> 02:44:39.400
sorry. There is something called as a runnable branch. So

02:44:39.400 --> 02:44:42.820
basically what we do with the runnable branch, that if this

02:44:42.820 --> 02:44:45.980
is the route, then use this LLM. If this is the route, then

02:44:45.980 --> 02:44:48.920
use this LLM. If this is the route, then use this LLM. So

02:44:48.920 --> 02:44:52.520
then it will be able to use them a multiple LLMs here. So

02:44:52.520 --> 02:44:55.220
instead of like a, you know, I, with the router, I can

02:44:55.220 --> 02:44:59.220
attach it. So if it is calling math, then use maybe like a,

02:44:59.220 --> 02:45:02.120
some different LLMs. If it is calling. KB, then try to use

02:45:02.120 --> 02:45:07.100
some different LLMs. Okay. I will try and I'll even show

02:45:07.100 --> 02:45:09.300
you, I'll even show you that part. This is LCL, right? So

02:45:09.300 --> 02:45:11.660
even like in my upcoming example, so there is something

02:45:11.660 --> 02:45:13.860
called as a runnable branch, which I'm going to show you

02:45:13.860 --> 02:45:17.180
that. Okay. So maybe in some cases I'll call Gemini in some

02:45:17.180 --> 02:45:19.200
of the cases I'll call even embedding because when I'll show

02:45:19.200 --> 02:45:22.940
you an example, the same integration with the RAG. So over

02:45:22.940 --> 02:45:25.740
there, maybe I'll try to show you that I'm trying to call

02:45:25.740 --> 02:45:29.200
one LLMs for embeddings, because even for that, we are going

02:45:29.200 --> 02:45:33.160
to use our LLMs. Yeah. Yeah. And this is not going to work

02:45:33.160 --> 02:45:36.100
because this is the chat completion LLMs, basically. So I

02:45:36.100 --> 02:45:39.020
have to use LLMs, which is, which can do embeddings. So in

02:45:39.020 --> 02:45:41.820
one cases, call the embedding one in one cases, call the

02:45:41.820 --> 02:45:44.820
chat completion LLMs in another cases, call some streaming

02:45:44.820 --> 02:45:48.100
one. And in one cases, maybe call the, uh, image creation

02:45:48.100 --> 02:45:51.440
one. So here, based on the task, I can route it. So from

02:45:51.440 --> 02:45:55.640
here, yes, it is possible from outing side. Thank you. Thank

02:45:55.640 --> 02:46:00.860
you so much. Yeah. Okay. Next one guys.

02:46:06.040 --> 02:46:12.940
Yeah. So any questions? Okay. Mustafa, go ahead. Yeah. So,

02:46:13.040 --> 02:46:15.880
so my question is, you just said that, uh, when we are

02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:19.040
trying to implement RAG in the agent, we have to call

02:46:19.040 --> 02:46:24.000
different LLMs for that RAG. So, uh, can we not do it this

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:27.620
way that if we have already built a RAG application, we can

02:46:27.620 --> 02:46:33.880
expose that API and just call it inside the agent or call it

02:46:33.880 --> 02:46:36.580
inside the agent application that we're using. Instead of

02:46:36.580 --> 02:46:39.940
writing the RAG logic, See, see, see, see, see the thing is

02:46:39.940 --> 02:46:41.020
what is the purpose of agent?

02:46:43.840 --> 02:46:46.880
To automate the process of understanding the situation, the

02:46:46.880 --> 02:46:49.840
condition. Okay. Yeah. So understand the situation right

02:46:49.840 --> 02:46:53.520
now. So let's suppose in my application, so I have a

02:46:53.520 --> 02:46:56.220
knowledge base, which is available inside some of the vector

02:46:56.220 --> 02:46:58.560
databases. I'm not keeping knowledge base here as of now,

02:46:58.620 --> 02:47:01.620
I'm keeping it in a hard coded text, right? So this

02:47:01.620 --> 02:47:03.780
knowledge base is not available over here. Technically. This

02:47:03.780 --> 02:47:06.900
knowledge base is available in some vector databases. And

02:47:06.900 --> 02:47:10.680
now, so basically my agent has to decide that, okay, I

02:47:10.680 --> 02:47:14.320
should go ahead with a vector search or I should not go

02:47:14.320 --> 02:47:19.360
ahead with the vector search. Yes. Technically you have two

02:47:19.360 --> 02:47:21.800
contexts, one context in which you are looking for a

02:47:21.800 --> 02:47:26.280
calculation, just a mathematical equation. So is it, is it

02:47:26.280 --> 02:47:30.640
supposed to hit my vector database? No, it should not. No.

02:47:30.760 --> 02:47:34.100
Right. It should call basically the calculator agent, a

02:47:34.100 --> 02:47:38.560
tool, basically. And when I'm trying to ask some query in

02:47:38.560 --> 02:47:41.840
that case, it should, so it should understand my query and

02:47:41.840 --> 02:47:44.200
it should know that now I should look into the vector

02:47:44.200 --> 02:47:47.040
databases. Right. So I should convert my query into

02:47:47.040 --> 02:47:49.620
embeddings. And then from a vector database, I should do a

02:47:49.620 --> 02:47:52.500
similarity search. And then I have to bring the result from

02:47:52.500 --> 02:47:55.920
the vector databases. Agree? Right. So technically

02:47:55.920 --> 02:47:59.000
responsibility of the agent is to take a decision

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:04.700
automatically. When to do and what to do. Right. So in that

02:48:04.700 --> 02:48:06.700
case, obviously it's not like you will just create an RAG

02:48:06.700 --> 02:48:09.500
and then, uh, that there will be a plain, simple RAG

02:48:09.500 --> 02:48:11.840
application. But let's suppose if I'm doing hundreds of

02:48:11.840 --> 02:48:14.900
tasks, right? Hundreds of tasks means, so I'm like a, I have

02:48:14.900 --> 02:48:17.300
a vector databases. I'm doing a calculation. I'm sending

02:48:17.300 --> 02:48:19.960
some sort of a messages. I'm scheduling a call that, okay.

02:48:20.020 --> 02:48:23.620
So if a data, or maybe I'm trying to hit my SQL system, that

02:48:23.620 --> 02:48:25.880
if data about this person is available, then do one thing,

02:48:25.940 --> 02:48:29.020
schedule a call, or maybe a send a mail to this person or to

02:48:29.020 --> 02:48:31.340
this particular person. As per our medical chat bot. Right.

02:48:31.480 --> 02:48:35.240
So basically the responsibility of agent is to first decide

02:48:35.240 --> 02:48:44.140
right out of any task. So, uh, basically then in that case,

02:48:44.280 --> 02:48:47.600
we have to create a tool which contains the logic of the RAG

02:48:47.600 --> 02:48:50.920
application involving converting into embedding. Exactly.

02:48:51.560 --> 02:48:54.460
And then system will choose that tool automatically as and

02:48:54.460 --> 02:48:57.320
when user will pass the query. So you have to create a tool.

02:48:58.540 --> 02:49:02.500
Okay. So other way around, I was thinking, sir, that just

02:49:02.500 --> 02:49:06.540
like we are using APIs for going to use like Google invite

02:49:06.540 --> 02:49:10.620
or email or WhatsApp. Similarly, maybe if we can create a

02:49:10.620 --> 02:49:15.180
RAG API and just integrate it with a, uh, you know, agent.

02:49:15.920 --> 02:49:18.240
RAG API means what, what is the meaning of creating a RAG

02:49:18.240 --> 02:49:22.540
API? Um, a basic functionality of the RAG, which will always

02:49:22.540 --> 02:49:25.240
take an input convert into an embedding, do a search

02:49:25.240 --> 02:49:28.560
functionality and get the response back based on the user

02:49:28.560 --> 02:49:31.580
training. Right. That, that you can do it, but why to expose

02:49:31.580 --> 02:49:33.760
it as an API? It's a simple, small function. Yeah, you can

02:49:33.760 --> 02:49:36.040
do it. I mean like API is nothing, but you can call anything

02:49:36.040 --> 02:49:38.260
and everything over the API, right? Like any kind of

02:49:38.260 --> 02:49:41.220
function so that, that you can do it, but why to like follow

02:49:41.220 --> 02:49:44.400
that approach? If it's just one single function, a small

02:49:44.400 --> 02:49:46.860
function, right? So where you are calling an embedding and

02:49:46.860 --> 02:49:48.980
then you are converting your query into this one, and then

02:49:48.980 --> 02:49:51.500
you are doing a search, bringing a result, a top K result.

02:49:52.340 --> 02:49:56.140
Got it. So the reason why it came to my mind is because when

02:49:56.140 --> 02:49:59.440
building this project, you know, I really realized that it

02:49:59.440 --> 02:50:02.960
becomes very complicated and clustered. Everything is inside

02:50:02.960 --> 02:50:07.960
one thing. So, you know, it is not easy to visualize if I

02:50:07.960 --> 02:50:10.180
need to make change and I have to search a lot in there.

02:50:10.880 --> 02:50:13.260
That's the reason. So that's the reason we talk about a

02:50:13.260 --> 02:50:16.180
modular coding, right? Even in your Medi Chatbot Pro. So we

02:50:16.180 --> 02:50:20.580
have kept all the files separately. One file responsible for

02:50:20.580 --> 02:50:24.000
only one job. Keep it in a modular way. Even if you're going

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:27.020
to create an API, again, you will end up creating one more

02:50:27.020 --> 02:50:30.820
overhead over there. Oh, okay. So each tool can be created

02:50:30.820 --> 02:50:34.980
as a different Python file. This is just a function. Don't

02:50:34.980 --> 02:50:37.420
think in a other way. This is just a one simple function. I

02:50:37.420 --> 02:50:39.960
can keep it in some different file. So different, different

02:50:39.960 --> 02:50:41.940
tool, different, different file or similar kind of a tool in

02:50:41.940 --> 02:50:46.560
one file and then import it. Call it. Got it. Got it. Yeah.

02:50:47.020 --> 02:50:49.720
Sir, just one last question. So this is more like not

02:50:49.720 --> 02:50:53.180
related to agent or LLM, it's like more towards the

02:50:53.180 --> 02:50:56.820
development, Python development. So I realized that we were

02:50:56.820 --> 02:51:01.740
not being using classes. Concepts and creating objects and

02:51:01.740 --> 02:51:08.360
constructors in this, all these projects. So how can you,

02:51:08.440 --> 02:51:11.020
can we implement this? And can you also let us know that

02:51:11.020 --> 02:51:15.260
when we're building projects in real time, usually contain

02:51:15.260 --> 02:51:19.380
classes, right? And then different constructors and without

02:51:19.380 --> 02:51:23.780
parameter or by default parameters, all these things. So can

02:51:23.780 --> 02:51:27.540
you give us some example like this? Not now, obviously later

02:51:27.540 --> 02:51:29.560
in the future. Just a class example is nothing like I just

02:51:29.560 --> 02:51:31.660
have to keep the same functions at the class pass

02:51:31.660 --> 02:51:34.780
constructor as a data or call it by default. So yeah, that,

02:51:34.860 --> 02:51:37.840
that can be like a data doable, but not in every example

02:51:37.840 --> 02:51:40.180
because people, many people inside the class, they will,

02:51:40.240 --> 02:51:42.820
again, just by looking into this simple function call,

02:51:42.900 --> 02:51:46.400
people are like feeling overwhelmed and maybe like a lot of

02:51:46.400 --> 02:51:49.320
people will not be able or not to be able to understand, uh,

02:51:49.440 --> 02:51:53.160
if I'll start introducing class and all like a logging and

02:51:53.160 --> 02:51:55.620
exception handling in every module, then same class will

02:51:55.620 --> 02:51:59.280
take like a three classes for me to complete. So maybe last,

02:51:59.540 --> 02:52:03.160
maybe at the very last of the, see doing for anything for me

02:52:03.160 --> 02:52:05.740
is not a big deal. This is very easy for me, but again, I

02:52:05.740 --> 02:52:08.280
have to make it understand right inside the classes. Yeah.

02:52:08.700 --> 02:52:11.380
Yeah. I got to understand. Yeah. Maybe you can try this out

02:52:11.380 --> 02:52:13.460
from your side because it's not a big deal to like convert

02:52:13.460 --> 02:52:16.600
any function and keep it inside the class. Yeah. And then

02:52:16.600 --> 02:52:19.740
structuring is a problem because I don't have much

02:52:19.740 --> 02:52:22.120
experience in development. So how to structure it and which

02:52:22.120 --> 02:52:24.300
class. Somewhere you have to start, right. At least with two

02:52:24.300 --> 02:52:26.940
functions, you can't keep on saying for the entire life that

02:52:26.940 --> 02:52:29.340
the structuring is a problem. I'm not comfortable with this

02:52:29.340 --> 02:52:31.220
or that. You have to be comfortable at some point of time.

02:52:31.340 --> 02:52:34.520
So do it. I have already given 10 examples, right? Have you

02:52:34.520 --> 02:52:41.340
built any examples on the way? It's already been eight, nine

02:52:41.340 --> 02:52:43.940
days, right? It's already been eight, nine days. You can't

02:52:43.940 --> 02:52:46.540
come and say that it's on the way. You must have done that

02:52:46.540 --> 02:52:48.960
at least one or two, right? That's a problem actually.

02:52:49.120 --> 02:52:52.820
Right. That's a problem. So see the simple logic is if you

02:52:52.820 --> 02:52:54.740
are not doing it, if you're not building it, if you're not

02:52:54.740 --> 02:52:57.880
writing a code. Anyone, whether it's me or maybe someone

02:52:57.880 --> 02:53:00.900
else. So we can come, we can explain the things you will not

02:53:00.900 --> 02:53:03.420
be able to understand. Maybe at that point of time, you will

02:53:03.420 --> 02:53:05.640
be able to understand, but later you will not be able to

02:53:05.640 --> 02:53:08.880
build it. This is not how coding works. Right. And I keep on

02:53:08.880 --> 02:53:10.720
saying in my classes that we are not preparing for the exam.

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:15.280
We are preparing for building something real. And that's the

02:53:15.280 --> 02:53:17.620
reason I keep on giving you a task to take it seriously. Do

02:53:17.620 --> 02:53:23.560
it. Yes. So the application is done. Which one? 10 example

02:53:23.560 --> 02:53:28.580
I've given to you. Okay. I created something simple, right?

02:53:28.640 --> 02:53:33.420
There's no particular example I followed. Simple right, sir.

02:53:33.480 --> 02:53:35.620
I have already discussed inside your class. Not a simple

02:53:35.620 --> 02:53:39.460
one, even a complex one, maybe chatbot pro that too by

02:53:39.460 --> 02:53:41.820
taking more classes. Okay. Fine. Then leave that discussion.

02:53:41.980 --> 02:53:45.180
But yeah, try to try to like solve the cases. I think it

02:53:45.180 --> 02:53:46.920
will give you a lot of experience. That's the reason I keep

02:53:46.920 --> 02:53:50.380
on giving you a task. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. Try to be more

02:53:50.380 --> 02:53:53.140
serious. Believe me, it will work. It'll work. Definitely.

02:53:53.140 --> 02:53:57.000
Absolutely. Thanks. Yeah. Okay. Next question. I had one

02:53:57.000 --> 02:54:00.700
question. Yeah. Go ahead. Like it's more from the interview

02:54:00.700 --> 02:54:03.820
perspective. So I'm not roasting by the way. See, I'm just

02:54:03.820 --> 02:54:06.240
like, see, as a teacher, I have to give you a guidance,

02:54:06.440 --> 02:54:11.360
Armaan and to every one of you. And I'm giving you a task

02:54:11.360 --> 02:54:14.360
because I know if you are going to complete this task,

02:54:14.480 --> 02:54:17.900
right? Believe me, even after a year, you will not face any

02:54:17.900 --> 02:54:21.540
problem. And those who are doing it, they will not. But

02:54:21.540 --> 02:54:23.260
those who are not doing it. They will just keep on

02:54:23.260 --> 02:54:26.500
complaining about the small, small things they will say how

02:54:26.500 --> 02:54:30.080
this will happen. That will happen. And here in terms of

02:54:30.080 --> 02:54:32.640
coding and programming, right? Everything is practical.

02:54:32.840 --> 02:54:34.680
Everything is pretty much real. And everything is pretty

02:54:34.680 --> 02:54:38.520
much like, you know, very much logical. But that logic, you

02:54:38.520 --> 02:54:42.320
will be able to build it once you will do it. That will not

02:54:42.320 --> 02:54:44.860
like come just by reading my classes or anyone's classes,

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.780
right? I'm not the one who's giving the class, right? There

02:54:47.780 --> 02:54:49.400
are many people, thousands of people who is giving the

02:54:49.400 --> 02:54:54.700
classes. But again, all depends on you. Yeah, because with

02:54:54.700 --> 02:54:59.380
your question, go ahead. Yes. So yeah, I was asking, like,

02:54:59.380 --> 02:55:03.640
so these projects, like I'm doing right now are kind of POCs

02:55:03.640 --> 02:55:07.880
mainly. And my main projects are on ML, where I get client

02:55:07.880 --> 02:55:13.340
details and like savings also. So how I can like so that in

02:55:13.340 --> 02:55:17.200
the interview that these are also contributing a lot to the

02:55:17.200 --> 02:55:21.520
like, organization or like that. Because I think when I just

02:55:21.520 --> 02:55:22.440
say that I have a lot of experience, I have a lot of

02:55:22.440 --> 02:55:24.760
experience, I have worked on this, they say that, okay, but

02:55:24.760 --> 02:55:29.140
have you done any real time project? Okay, so see, Akash,

02:55:29.320 --> 02:55:31.760
your client is in which domain, like in which domain you are

02:55:31.760 --> 02:55:35.940
working as of now? Manufacturing. Manufacturing, right? And

02:55:35.940 --> 02:55:40.440
what problem you're trying to solve? I'm trying to help

02:55:40.440 --> 02:55:45.900
improve the efficiency of the steel plant, like blast

02:55:45.900 --> 02:55:50.620
furnace or packaging lines or something like that. How? So

02:55:50.620 --> 02:55:53.400
I'm trying to like, build a project. I'm trying to predict

02:55:53.400 --> 02:55:57.900
the release of like harmful gases in the air, that is a rare

02:55:57.900 --> 02:56:01.320
like common issue in blast furnaces in the steel plant.

02:56:01.740 --> 02:56:05.380
Okay. Okay. Now, so till this point, you already know,

02:56:05.480 --> 02:56:08.880
right? So till this point, you're okay. Now let's talk about

02:56:08.880 --> 02:56:11.020
something with respect to today's class itself. Forget about

02:56:11.020 --> 02:56:15.280
previous classes. Today, I talked about agents, right? Yeah.

02:56:15.440 --> 02:56:18.980
Yeah. Now, what agent does? So can I say that agent

02:56:18.980 --> 02:56:21.800
automatically choose which function it is supposed to call

02:56:21.800 --> 02:56:24.100
or what? What a task it is supposed to do automatically,

02:56:24.300 --> 02:56:27.920
like a call set. This is what the agent is, right? Yeah.

02:56:28.940 --> 02:56:31.240
Now, you're trying to do a prediction with respect to a

02:56:31.240 --> 02:56:33.960
blast furnace with respect to a poisonous gases or all those

02:56:33.960 --> 02:56:36.840
things, right? So where your ML models are trying to do a

02:56:36.840 --> 02:56:39.860
prediction. Now after doing that prediction, so obviously

02:56:39.860 --> 02:56:43.220
you or your system must be triggering some sort of an alarm.

02:56:44.600 --> 02:56:48.280
Yes. Yeah, it must be sending some sort of a report to

02:56:48.280 --> 02:56:52.160
someone. Yes. Yes. You must be doing some sort of a

02:56:52.160 --> 02:56:54.940
modification or if you are able to find out some sort of a

02:56:54.940 --> 02:56:58.100
drifting in your model, because in ML model, drifting is

02:56:58.100 --> 02:57:00.600
pretty much real, right? Every model drift after some time,

02:57:00.700 --> 02:57:02.600
maybe because of data, maybe because of some different

02:57:02.600 --> 02:57:06.300
unseen or unforeseen situation or like circumstances. So

02:57:06.300 --> 02:57:08.960
drifting. So in that case, you try to rebuild the model, you

02:57:08.960 --> 02:57:11.600
try to retrain the model, you try to tune the model, right?

02:57:11.960 --> 02:57:15.200
Correct. Can I say that I can configure my agents everywhere

02:57:15.200 --> 02:57:18.560
in terms of sending the report in terms of maybe sending the

02:57:18.560 --> 02:57:21.640
alarms in terms of even handling the model? Drift in terms

02:57:21.640 --> 02:57:25.780
of even doing a DevOps deployment end to end model will

02:57:25.780 --> 02:57:27.680
select a function automatically and then it will keep on

02:57:27.680 --> 02:57:29.360
fighting all those things automatically, right?

02:57:29.600 --> 02:57:31.700
Automatically based on the prediction, just the prediction

02:57:31.700 --> 02:57:35.120
that you are able to get from your ML model. There's just

02:57:35.120 --> 02:57:40.180
one single point. Yeah. This is a little tricky. I need to

02:57:40.180 --> 02:57:44.500
like find out how we can do this. When you are sending

02:57:44.500 --> 02:57:47.640
alarm, can I say that you are configuring some services or

02:57:47.640 --> 02:57:52.700
writing some functions? Yes. Yes. Agent is doing the same

02:57:52.700 --> 02:57:58.060
thing, right? Okay. But, but all these things are happening

02:57:58.060 --> 02:58:02.020
like automatically right now also. So That's fine. That's

02:58:02.020 --> 02:58:04.980
fine. That's the reason. See, in my yesterday's class, I

02:58:04.980 --> 02:58:07.720
simply told you one thing that this is nothing but

02:58:07.720 --> 02:58:15.540
automation plus plus by, by creating, by creating agent.

02:58:15.880 --> 02:58:19.180
It's not like I'm trying to solve some new problem. What we

02:58:19.180 --> 02:58:21.520
are trying to do. By creating an agent, we are actually

02:58:21.520 --> 02:58:24.360
trying to solve the old problem, which we have already

02:58:24.360 --> 02:58:28.200
solved. But with the help of LMS, maybe with more

02:58:28.200 --> 02:58:31.580
autonomous, by using a more autonomous approach without

02:58:31.580 --> 02:58:33.900
writing, even now you are doing it right. But you must have

02:58:33.900 --> 02:58:36.080
written if else kind of a statement, this is what I said

02:58:36.080 --> 02:58:38.540
yesterday, right? It's not like we were not doing automation

02:58:38.540 --> 02:58:41.780
before. We have done automation in last two decades. A lot

02:58:41.780 --> 02:58:44.940
of automation by writing some sort of a rule by logic, right

02:58:44.940 --> 02:58:50.100
now here, the introduction of agent. Agent simply says that,

02:58:50.120 --> 02:58:52.200
that, okay, you don't have to write the rule. I can

02:58:52.200 --> 02:58:54.640
understand everything in an NLP, right? Your manager can

02:58:54.640 --> 02:58:57.700
come chat just like a layman, like just like a natural

02:58:57.700 --> 02:59:01.180
language. Just the way we, me and you are speaking or we are

02:59:01.180 --> 02:59:04.860
talking together and system will work automatically. So it's

02:59:04.860 --> 02:59:07.120
just automation plus plus, right? Whatever you are doing,

02:59:07.200 --> 02:59:11.020
just replace whatever you are doing it with the help of rule

02:59:11.020 --> 02:59:14.940
based, just replace it with this one. Simple. I think this

02:59:14.940 --> 02:59:17.760
is a great idea. So I will try to think on this. Exactly.

02:59:18.220 --> 02:59:22.440
But here, like you have given some tasks and now if I work

02:59:22.440 --> 02:59:30.020
on these, like my specific project related use case. So like

02:59:30.020 --> 02:59:33.320
it said to work going on parallelly and then apart from the

02:59:33.320 --> 02:59:37.020
project work also. So it becomes a lot of things. So which

02:59:37.020 --> 02:59:39.680
one should I focus? Should I build on what I am working

02:59:39.680 --> 02:59:42.880
right now or should I build on the use case that you have

02:59:42.880 --> 02:59:47.320
said? Both. Just try to complete one task one single day.

02:59:47.320 --> 02:59:51.860
Okay. I think that's a solid. Okay. Yes. Yeah. So create

02:59:51.860 --> 02:59:54.800
your calendar, then say that, okay, fine. I'll do this. Then

02:59:54.800 --> 02:59:57.260
once I'll complete, I'll do this. Maybe it is going to take

02:59:57.260 --> 02:59:59.460
another 15 days. It's completely okay. Right. Maybe one

02:59:59.460 --> 03:00:01.960
month. It's completely okay. Right. But try to create a

03:00:01.960 --> 03:00:06.340
schedule one by one. Start cleaning it. Okay. Thank you.

03:00:06.840 --> 03:00:10.720
Yeah. Okay. Next one, please. Hello. Yeah. I'll see it. Go

03:00:10.720 --> 03:00:14.280
ahead. Yeah. Yes. Can you allow me to say this please? Yeah,

03:00:14.360 --> 03:00:17.740
sure. Sure. See the promoter panelists in between. Yeah. As

03:00:17.740 --> 03:00:22.760
is Maria. You have a question. Yes, sir. Yeah. Go ahead. I

03:00:22.760 --> 03:00:28.460
have, I have the question not for this lecture, but I have

03:00:28.460 --> 03:00:32.660
the question where we build the Maddy chat. Yesterday I have

03:00:32.660 --> 03:00:35.880
pinged you on WhatsApp group. There I am facing the numpy

03:00:35.880 --> 03:00:39.100
related issue. Okay. Got it. Yeah. I remember. Yes. Maybe

03:00:39.100 --> 03:00:41.920
you can share your screen. I think that'll be better. Yes.

03:00:45.740 --> 03:00:49.640
I think you have a screen sharing access. You can share your

03:00:49.640 --> 03:00:56.180
screen. Already seems that's here. My screen. Okay. Allow.

03:00:56.360 --> 03:00:58.780
Yeah. No, I think it will be visible in some time.

03:01:02.020 --> 03:01:05.400
Other people hope all of you are enjoying it. Hope all of

03:01:05.400 --> 03:01:08.540
you are able to connect the dots. The basic, the

03:01:08.540 --> 03:01:12.160
fundamentals. Yeah. And hope all of us are able to

03:01:12.160 --> 03:01:15.540
understand that agent is nothing like a fancy stuff. It's

03:01:15.540 --> 03:01:18.080
just automation plus. Plus. And why I said automation plus.

03:01:18.160 --> 03:01:23.440
Plus. I get less one. Yes. From Sahil. What about others?

03:01:27.450 --> 03:01:32.450
What about, what are your questions? My question was simple.

03:01:32.590 --> 03:01:34.530
So hope all of you are able to understand the bottom line of

03:01:34.530 --> 03:01:38.810
agent. The definition of agent. Yes. Yes. Got it. So are you

03:01:38.810 --> 03:01:41.290
able to see my screen? Yeah, I can see your screen. Yes.

03:01:41.390 --> 03:01:46.630
See, see. That's what the, what I understood. Just saying

03:01:46.630 --> 03:01:50.330
here. So the prompt. Yeah. So the prompt is, actually, if we

03:01:50.330 --> 03:01:53.630
go to the use cases, it will be better. For example, we are

03:01:53.630 --> 03:01:58.590
hiding portions and onboarding, we want to automate the

03:01:58.590 --> 03:02:02.730
whole process of onboarding. Yeah. So that's why I created a

03:02:02.730 --> 03:02:06.570
channel of thought. Means if we go here, it will first

03:02:06.570 --> 03:02:10.530
perceive it, right? Then it learn from it and it decides as

03:02:10.530 --> 03:02:14.170
a orchestrator, you told me. So it creates all the tasks. If

03:02:14.170 --> 03:02:17.210
you see these are the list of tasks and from here, what are

03:02:17.210 --> 03:02:19.610
the tools it's going to use? What are the LLMs going to use?

03:02:19.790 --> 03:02:24.230
Right. So based on that, it will create, and then it will

03:02:24.230 --> 03:02:27.750
hear, execute it, decide, then execute it and then learn it.

03:02:28.010 --> 03:02:30.370
This is what my understanding is. My understanding. Okay. So

03:02:30.370 --> 03:02:32.250
you are, you are basically trying to create the complete

03:02:32.250 --> 03:02:35.630
hiding solution, right? Yeah. Onboarding solution.

03:02:36.110 --> 03:02:38.410
Onboarding solution. You're trying to get. Okay, fine. So

03:02:38.410 --> 03:02:41.630
generally if I'll, if I'll try to follow the industry trend

03:02:41.630 --> 03:02:44.350
or industry norms. So basically in terms of onboarding,

03:02:44.370 --> 03:02:48.110
let's suppose my interview is done and I already had a

03:02:48.110 --> 03:02:51.410
discussion. With HR, HR will release the offer later. Now

03:02:51.410 --> 03:02:55.550
once HR will release the offer later. So HR is going to

03:02:55.550 --> 03:02:59.530
basically send me a portal access, basically, and they're

03:02:59.530 --> 03:03:02.710
going to ask me to fill out a couple of details, whatever

03:03:02.710 --> 03:03:06.430
basic detail that I have. And obviously like accept the

03:03:06.430 --> 03:03:11.150
offer later. Now once that will be done, then my onboarding

03:03:11.150 --> 03:03:14.730
process is going to start from that particular day. From

03:03:14.730 --> 03:03:17.730
that point. It is. Once the onboarding starts, right, the

03:03:17.730 --> 03:03:20.090
day he joined, right, they just schedule the welcome

03:03:20.610 --> 03:03:23.310
meeting, right? Welcome meeting. And then create the

03:03:23.310 --> 03:03:26.630
employee profile once they commit, right, in the HR system.

03:03:26.790 --> 03:03:28.850
This is a different system. This is a tool you can say,

03:03:28.930 --> 03:03:32.950
right? Yeah. Yeah. And for that, we may just say also put

03:03:32.950 --> 03:03:36.330
the LLM, but I don't know whether here we need the LLM or

03:03:36.330 --> 03:03:38.870
not. Then after he joined, he then allocate the projects,

03:03:39.050 --> 03:03:42.850
right? And not the projects. So you have to access the drive

03:03:42.850 --> 03:03:48.310
or cloud assets. All things assets, right? But through Azure

03:03:48.310 --> 03:03:52.730
and then also get GitHub access. Then you put him in the...

03:03:52.730 --> 03:03:55.550
No, no, no. Before that, I think step number four will come

03:03:55.550 --> 03:03:58.910
in three. So see, first of all, you are going to welcome a

03:03:58.910 --> 03:04:02.850
person, like task number one, task number two. So basically

03:04:02.850 --> 03:04:06.490
the entire profile creation and its verification must be

03:04:06.490 --> 03:04:10.050
done in your HRM system basically. Right. So over there,

03:04:10.230 --> 03:04:14.530
like you are going to send a welcome mail as well. In that

03:04:14.530 --> 03:04:18.590
mail, there will be a HRM system link, whatever, like, and

03:04:18.590 --> 03:04:21.590
plus ID password, HRM. So for a user, you are going to

03:04:21.590 --> 03:04:24.590
create, first of all, email ID, right? See, before even

03:04:24.590 --> 03:04:27.790
scheduling a welcome meeting, the process which will come is

03:04:27.790 --> 03:04:31.290
create the official mail ID. Now once official mail ID has

03:04:31.290 --> 03:04:33.970
been created on the same mail ID, it should trigger the

03:04:34.330 --> 03:04:38.290
welcome meeting. Yes. Then on the same official mail ID, so

03:04:38.290 --> 03:04:42.570
it should also send a HRM link with user ID and password of

03:04:42.570 --> 03:04:44.630
the HRM. Because that will be different, HRM system will be

03:04:44.630 --> 03:04:48.750
different, right, from its mail system. So HRM system, user

03:04:48.750 --> 03:04:51.670
ID and a password with a link that, okay, fine, now you can

03:04:51.670 --> 03:04:55.310
log in, let's suppose Asit, right? So now Asit can log into

03:04:55.310 --> 03:05:00.250
a HRM system and you can fill your own detail. Now once the

03:05:00.250 --> 03:05:03.970
user is going to fill out all the details, then what I will

03:05:03.970 --> 03:05:07.150
do, I will send a mail saying that, okay, in this

03:05:07.150 --> 03:05:09.550
department, in this block, you can go and connect.

03:05:09.750 --> 03:05:12.210
Basically, it's an IT admin block, right? So where you can

03:05:12.210 --> 03:05:14.130
go and you can try to collect your laptop. So again,

03:05:14.170 --> 03:05:17.430
autonomous mail or notification user will receive or Asit

03:05:17.430 --> 03:05:22.310
will receive. Then once that is done, then there will be a

03:05:22.310 --> 03:05:24.190
lot of projects. Let's suppose there are hundreds of

03:05:24.190 --> 03:05:27.750
projects, right? So basically, either HR is going to find a

03:05:27.750 --> 03:05:31.370
project or hiring manager or what will happen, so even

03:05:31.370 --> 03:05:35.410
generally managers or lead try to approach to the HR that,

03:05:35.430 --> 03:05:36.790
okay, fine, I'm looking for this kind of resources.

03:05:37.210 --> 03:05:39.450
Basically, it's two way, right? Always happens in two way.

03:05:39.530 --> 03:05:42.470
So fine. Let's talk about one way where HR is assigning the

03:05:42.470 --> 03:05:44.650
project or hiring manager is assigning the project. So there

03:05:44.650 --> 03:05:47.390
will be hundreds of project. So what system will do? So

03:05:47.390 --> 03:05:50.870
system will try to check the users, basically like a details

03:05:50.870 --> 03:05:54.170
or whatever, like a job description was there or like

03:05:54.170 --> 03:05:57.950
whatever user skill set is there. And then out of those

03:05:57.950 --> 03:06:01.170
hundreds of pool of the project, if there is a resource

03:06:01.170 --> 03:06:04.330
requirement, right? If there is a, it will check that there

03:06:04.330 --> 03:06:06.510
is a resource requirement or not. That will also be

03:06:06.510 --> 03:06:09.310
available in some system, right? Because someone must have

03:06:09.310 --> 03:06:12.330
raised the resource allocation, right? Some manager or lead

03:06:12.330 --> 03:06:15.050
that I need one resources from this, this, this, so it will

03:06:15.050 --> 03:06:17.510
do the matching and then it will allocate to that manager

03:06:17.510 --> 03:06:22.190
and send an email or send a notification to a manager for a

03:06:22.190 --> 03:06:25.110
particular project plus a candidate that, okay, this is your

03:06:25.110 --> 03:06:28.090
manager detail. This is your project. And now you can like

03:06:28.090 --> 03:06:32.750
go together and start working. Once that will done, then

03:06:32.750 --> 03:06:36.190
there will be a manager or you can say a project based agent

03:06:36.190 --> 03:06:38.650
will come into picture. Okay. So you are going to join the

03:06:38.650 --> 03:06:41.930
project, right? Then like a project based agent will come

03:06:41.930 --> 03:06:44.810
into picture and that is going to give an access to your

03:06:44.810 --> 03:06:47.990
point number three, GitHub, whatever, right? And there will

03:06:47.990 --> 03:06:50.810
be so many drive access, client access. So again, that will

03:06:50.810 --> 03:06:52.970
be a specific to the project because every project

03:06:52.970 --> 03:06:55.870
requirement is, will be different, right? Every project will

03:06:55.870 --> 03:06:58.910
be using a different, different tools, right? Not the same

03:06:58.910 --> 03:07:01.430
tool, right? Even for like a DevOps or even for a cloud and

03:07:01.430 --> 03:07:04.510
everything. So according to the project requirement, the

03:07:04.510 --> 03:07:07.470
project specific agent will be invoked and then it will

03:07:07.470 --> 03:07:10.870
start. Like a, you know, giving this assignment. So that is,

03:07:10.870 --> 03:07:14.290
this is how we should think. I agree. Yeah. So you're very

03:07:14.290 --> 03:07:17.450
right. Just, just to make my understanding that I quickly, I

03:07:17.450 --> 03:07:22.050
put through it so that I can get your inputs. Yeah. But this

03:07:22.050 --> 03:07:25.190
is not about the work. This is just to understand the agent

03:07:25.190 --> 03:07:30.050
existence. And one more thing I completed this, this one,

03:07:30.090 --> 03:07:34.190
and this is actually real data. I did it. And so this is

03:07:34.190 --> 03:07:38.410
really, I get a lot of feedback. I get a lot of

03:07:38.410 --> 03:07:41.850
understanding on this side. So, but next step is how to put

03:07:41.850 --> 03:07:46.570
the images, videos, right? So if those kinds of data also

03:07:46.570 --> 03:07:49.070
coming from the, from the investigations, how can you

03:07:49.070 --> 03:07:52.310
incorporate it? But that will be, Okay. Yeah. I'll talk

03:07:52.310 --> 03:07:55.470
about that. How to like handle or how to deal with the video

03:07:55.470 --> 03:07:58.210
and image based data with respect to RAG. But before that,

03:07:58.270 --> 03:08:00.690
maybe you can try to attach agents, couple of agents over

03:08:00.690 --> 03:08:04.350
here. So, so that's interesting here. What are the agents I

03:08:04.350 --> 03:08:07.170
can, how can I incorporate here as agents? Right. So

03:08:07.170 --> 03:08:09.910
basically, so what is the data you are using cancer data,

03:08:10.030 --> 03:08:11.950
right? And it's a pay issue. Must be patient data or

03:08:11.950 --> 03:08:15.570
something. Yeah. Okay. So just, just try to create one

03:08:15.570 --> 03:08:18.130
agent. So let's suppose if I'm trying to do a chat, right.

03:08:18.190 --> 03:08:22.230
And if I'm saying that, okay, fine. So do one thing. So go

03:08:22.230 --> 03:08:25.170
to our internet, do a real time search, or maybe like there

03:08:25.170 --> 03:08:27.930
is some new research on a cancer or new medicine, which is

03:08:27.930 --> 03:08:31.190
like a coming with respect to this particular cancer,

03:08:31.290 --> 03:08:33.270
because there will be a segment of the cancer disease,

03:08:33.350 --> 03:08:35.970
right? So this particular cancer, just try to give me that

03:08:35.970 --> 03:08:39.310
suggestion. Try to give me, so this is one agent, right?

03:08:39.350 --> 03:08:41.670
Then another agent will be involved, which will try to give

03:08:41.670 --> 03:08:44.570
a life advice that, okay, what should be your routine? Uh,

03:08:44.670 --> 03:08:46.650
if you're a cancer patient, then what you should do, what

03:08:46.650 --> 03:08:49.590
you should not do. The third agent, maybe you can try to

03:08:49.590 --> 03:08:52.930
create that. Okay. Now it's done. Do one thing. This is a

03:08:52.930 --> 03:08:56.950
user ID. Go to a database, right? Maybe a SQL databases, try

03:08:56.950 --> 03:08:59.950
to fetch a customer email ID and a phone number, and then

03:08:59.950 --> 03:09:03.590
send a notification automatically to that customer, the,

03:09:03.650 --> 03:09:05.370
whatever report that you have generated, whatever suggestion

03:09:05.370 --> 03:09:07.930
that you have generated. Okay. The cure that you have

03:09:07.930 --> 03:09:09.970
generated that, okay, take this medicine. This is the latest

03:09:09.970 --> 03:09:13.530
research, right? So I have done the research for you. So

03:09:13.530 --> 03:09:15.570
this is the latest treatment, which is available for you.

03:09:15.630 --> 03:09:18.370
This is what you should follow and do, uh, in terms of

03:09:18.370 --> 03:09:21.170
medication and everything, right? Or maybe a routine. And

03:09:21.170 --> 03:09:24.430
then one agent will go and try to fetch basically a user

03:09:24.430 --> 03:09:28.090
record from a SQL DB, right? Because, uh, it will be like a

03:09:28.090 --> 03:09:31.130
user ID will be, let's suppose I have a label as a document

03:09:31.130 --> 03:09:34.990
and then maybe in a citation and, uh, then it will try to

03:09:34.990 --> 03:09:39.230
fetch and send a notification back to back. And if a user

03:09:39.230 --> 03:09:42.450
would like to like, uh, uh, ask any kind of a question,

03:09:42.710 --> 03:09:46.610
right? So again, give our access or expose your entire

03:09:46.610 --> 03:09:50.930
system to our WhatsApp chat. So that let's suppose you have

03:09:50.930 --> 03:09:55.690
sent the message, right? User back a message, right? That,

03:09:55.770 --> 03:09:59.330
okay. I want to know more about it. Yeah. Got it. So

03:09:59.330 --> 03:10:01.930
technically users should be able to invoke your, uh, agents.

03:10:02.630 --> 03:10:07.690
Huh? Yeah. Yeah. So that should be the next step. Yeah. Uh,

03:10:07.810 --> 03:10:11.670
thank you. This input will help. And one more help I need,

03:10:11.810 --> 03:10:17.270
uh, um, um, Sudhanshu, uh, so I'm using Mac. So when I, uh,

03:10:17.550 --> 03:10:19.990
uh, here, here, the putty, I'm not get the support, right?

03:10:20.230 --> 03:10:24.350
That's the regions. I'm not able to create my key to create

03:10:24.350 --> 03:10:28.850
a model, do the SSH in a Mac. So by default in a Mac or

03:10:28.850 --> 03:10:32.970
Linux, you can do a SSH by the way. Okay. Sometimes maybe,

03:10:33.050 --> 03:10:36.090
uh, Monday or Tuesday evening, right? That, uh, uh,

03:10:36.250 --> 03:10:39.390
interview sessions after, uh, during that time, I, uh, just

03:10:39.390 --> 03:10:42.630
log in everything. I take it from you. Okay. Okay. Sure.

03:10:42.770 --> 03:10:45.830
Sure. Sure. Thank you. Uh, you can do a chat GPT, like how

03:10:45.830 --> 03:10:48.590
to, uh, this is my keys and how to log in. It will give you

03:10:48.590 --> 03:10:51.550
just one single line of command and you can do it. Okay.

03:10:51.570 --> 03:10:55.230
Somewhere. I'm sticking. I will try. Oh, okay. I'm sticking.

03:10:55.450 --> 03:10:58.610
Yeah. It's like a simple SSH. You don't need a putty in case

03:10:58.610 --> 03:11:02.470
of Mac and Linux. Oh, okay. Great. Okay. Thank you. Thank

03:11:02.470 --> 03:11:05.270
you. Uh, and whatever you are now teaching and uh, whatever

03:11:05.270 --> 03:11:10.150
the, my experience I had last few years and, uh, uh, I knew

03:11:10.150 --> 03:11:13.550
on and, uh, then you, so it's awesome. Now, right. So I'm

03:11:13.550 --> 03:11:18.150
very, very, uh, good state of mind and applying things very

03:11:18.150 --> 03:11:21.350
fast. Thank you. Yeah. A simple thing is if you are able to

03:11:21.350 --> 03:11:23.450
connect things logically, right? Anyone can build it.

03:11:23.490 --> 03:11:27.030
Anyone. Huh? That's true. That's true. Yeah. That's the only

03:11:27.030 --> 03:11:29.410
thing matters coding and all this thing doesn't matter at

03:11:29.410 --> 03:11:30.570
all. Yeah.

03:11:33.190 --> 03:11:38.970
uh go ahead i can see your screen as is hello yeah yeah so i

03:11:38.970 --> 03:11:41.770
am facing this issue sir numpy is not available i have tried

03:11:41.770 --> 03:11:45.390
you can everything like i'm installing the numpy and

03:11:45.390 --> 03:11:52.260
restalling again and you are using the same environment uh

03:11:52.260 --> 03:11:58.800
yes sir okay let me check give me control yeah

03:12:20.430 --> 03:12:25.490
just i have given the control yeah i'm just trying to

03:12:25.490 --> 03:12:34.050
control it okay but i am not by the way i think i am not to

03:12:34.050 --> 03:12:37.450
give up the remote control okay give me which system you

03:12:37.450 --> 03:12:42.190
have mac so from a windows keyboard i'm trying to access

03:12:42.190 --> 03:12:47.890
your mac it will not work because your ctrl key is different

03:12:47.890 --> 03:12:53.390
mine is different yeah okay so just just close the terminal

03:12:53.390 --> 03:12:59.130
close this numpy is not available but it seems it's running

03:12:59.130 --> 03:13:04.190
just yes it's running but uh even over there is giving you

03:13:04.190 --> 03:13:08.170
the issue right yes yes close this terminal close means like

03:13:08.170 --> 03:13:11.730
terminate this terminal do the cls clean the screen yeah

03:13:13.270 --> 03:13:21.530
clean it now just type pip show numpy show numpy

03:13:30.490 --> 03:13:37.990
so sun fundamental package available so miss numpy is

03:13:37.990 --> 03:13:42.790
available okay got it numpy

03:13:44.130 --> 03:13:48.470
let me uh like uh reinstall it now and

03:14:19.510 --> 03:14:25.130
python version is uh basically uh 3.10 right uh yes let me

03:14:25.130 --> 03:14:27.730
check now you can check your python version python the space

03:14:27.730 --> 03:14:29.730
hyphen hyphen version 3

03:14:32.130 --> 03:14:39.210
.10 3.10 okay okay yes yes actually i have tried 3.11 and 3

03:14:39.210 --> 03:14:44.070
.12 and also latest one fine fine sometime it happens not an

03:14:44.070 --> 03:14:48.750
issue we'll fix it uh okay so i'm

03:15:06.320 --> 03:15:08.940
just bringing you a couple of command one by one quickly

03:15:08.940 --> 03:15:12.100
executed so first this one sure

03:15:16.290 --> 03:15:21.990
and then this execute execute back to back so we can check

03:15:21.990 --> 03:15:22.970
then

03:15:30.110 --> 03:15:32.970
second one this is done yeah second command up

03:15:41.160 --> 03:15:45.660
install python m requirement already satisfied 2.26 is

03:15:45.660 --> 03:15:49.420
available but still not showing even

03:15:55.150 --> 03:16:02.270
i have tried the pi charm also but it didn't work maybe just

03:16:09.790 --> 03:16:10.510
run the project

03:16:35.130 --> 03:16:38.630
embedding okay embedding model now it's able to download

03:16:38.630 --> 03:16:40.470
fine go

03:16:44.560 --> 03:16:45.820
to the url uh

03:16:48.800 --> 03:16:51.920
which one yes it has already given the url right go up go up

03:16:51.920 --> 03:16:57.840
go up runtime numpy is not able to find uh embedding as

03:16:57.840 --> 03:17:01.980
array all embeddings empire okay so pytorch is trying to use

03:17:01.980 --> 03:17:06.160
a number internally and it is not able to find out because

03:17:06.160 --> 03:17:09.460
of the library okay just do one thing copy the like last uh

03:17:09.460 --> 03:17:12.800
got the issue yeah so just

03:17:15.140 --> 03:17:21.740
copy the last couple of lines um this one yeah the one that

03:17:21.740 --> 03:17:24.860
you are able to see a couple of lines like yeah just a

03:17:24.860 --> 03:17:29.480
couple of lines from the last and ping me yeah okay so

03:17:35.520 --> 03:17:37.980
basically pytorch is looking for cuda you are using mac

03:17:37.980 --> 03:17:40.960
machine inside mac machine there will be no cuda there is no

03:17:40.960 --> 03:17:45.880
nvidia right and that was the issue that you can see so if

03:17:45.880 --> 03:17:52.750
you'll just trace the error above so what can i use uh you

03:17:52.750 --> 03:17:59.890
can directly try to do this uh and maybe we can remove yeah

03:18:00.550 --> 03:18:02.910
force install and just just bring me the entire things like

03:18:02.910 --> 03:18:07.790
just copy and paste the error okay to me we'll remove the

03:18:07.790 --> 03:18:09.410
cuda dependency i'm

03:18:33.000 --> 03:18:35.020
not able to paste just

03:18:37.580 --> 03:18:38.800
drag drag and copy

03:18:44.460 --> 03:18:46.540
yeah got it by

03:19:21.580 --> 03:19:24.080
the way hit the url like hit the url that you are able to

03:19:24.080 --> 03:19:25.100
see uh

03:19:27.760 --> 03:19:31.740
this one no no no sir above above link streamlit url

03:19:31.740 --> 03:19:44.260
streamlit run url go up go up okay up up up up yeah up hm

03:19:44.260 --> 03:19:48.600
that means we are able to open it url this one local local

03:19:48.600 --> 03:19:51.800
host yeah okay go

03:20:00.860 --> 03:20:02.100
into the browser open it

03:20:18.030 --> 03:20:21.590
browser browser any browser i'm

03:20:48.090 --> 03:20:49.670
not able to see browser uh

03:20:53.250 --> 03:20:57.790
is it visible now no this one uh google chrome no i think

03:20:57.790 --> 03:20:59.910
you have shared just only single screen you have to share

03:20:59.910 --> 03:21:05.330
the whole screen okay is it

03:21:18.480 --> 03:21:22.240
visible now hmm it's visible now okay now go to the go to

03:21:22.240 --> 03:21:23.640
the code now

03:21:25.600 --> 03:21:32.560
inside a code uh go to uh vector store vector store utility

03:21:32.560 --> 03:21:38.440
.py file yeah now so here model name is hugging face that's

03:21:38.440 --> 03:21:43.100
fine uh we are trying to call hugging face facebook as

03:21:43.100 --> 03:21:51.960
sentence transformer all msp net now fine so okay so we have

03:21:51.960 --> 03:21:56.340
to restrict this one and

03:21:59.640 --> 03:22:04.860
internally it is calling numpy so ui pdf utl config chat

03:22:04.860 --> 03:22:07.480
utils that's fine go

03:22:10.140 --> 03:22:16.400
to main.py file maybe chat zip so come

03:22:18.160 --> 03:22:25.290
come down down down down down if we can set only a cpu

03:22:25.290 --> 03:22:34.520
access and dogs fine set models fine go to vector store

03:22:34.520 --> 03:22:37.600
itself sanity check transformer

03:22:41.990 --> 03:22:46.250
sentence hugging face we are calling model name is this one

03:22:46.250 --> 03:22:53.740
uh okay just try to add one parameter over here like uh in a

03:22:53.740 --> 03:22:57.880
model name it's line number six line number six hugging face

03:22:57.880 --> 03:23:01.780
embeddings just try to like uh uh add one more parameter

03:23:02.180 --> 03:23:04.960
parameter parameter in the hugging face not there in the

03:23:04.960 --> 03:23:09.220
hugging face embedding okay yeah try to add parameter cpu

03:23:09.220 --> 03:23:12.660
because you are running into a mac so mac is actually issue

03:23:12.660 --> 03:23:18.440
basically okay so here i need to add uh here uh just add

03:23:18.440 --> 03:23:25.100
device is equal to cpu device is going to cpu yeah save it

03:23:25.100 --> 03:23:27.320
control s

03:23:30.670 --> 03:23:33.270
yeah now it has started running once again

03:23:40.470 --> 03:23:48.210
syntaxes syntax expected farsi indexes syntax error uh now

03:23:48.210 --> 03:23:52.890
error has changed line number four module app vector it will

03:23:52.890 --> 03:23:58.830
go go back to the code we have done something okay my

03:23:58.830 --> 03:24:02.470
mistake okay control s now

03:24:15.040 --> 03:24:23.070
i think the first issue has gone okay so what is the issue

03:24:23.070 --> 03:24:27.270
pidentic core hugging face extra input are not permitted

03:24:27.810 --> 03:24:30.550
interface importing device extra input not permitted cpu

03:24:30.550 --> 03:24:35.170
input good value cpu input type string fine the input that i

03:24:35.170 --> 03:24:39.650
have added is not permitted over there just copy it's a

03:24:39.650 --> 03:24:46.470
pidentic one model dot encode sentence transformer okay

03:25:34.180 --> 03:25:41.520
so this is the parameter syntax pidentic y okay i will just

03:25:41.520 --> 03:25:44.420
ping you this one so instead of device cpu just copy and

03:25:44.420 --> 03:25:45.200
paste this this one

03:25:47.990 --> 03:25:51.290
that's a syntax for your non-cpu place

03:25:55.710 --> 03:25:58.710
model kwelax is equal to device cpu yeah

03:26:01.560 --> 03:26:02.940
remove it remove remove that one

03:26:07.680 --> 03:26:08.940
no no no

03:26:41.010 --> 03:26:45.650
no no control z you have edits yeah

03:26:55.120 --> 03:26:59.460
just just type it type it i think that will okay fine still

03:26:59.460 --> 03:27:01.820
it's an incorrect sentence i think you have given a

03:27:01.860 --> 03:27:08.620
additional codes after cpu yes remove it yes yeah

03:27:10.730 --> 03:27:16.920
go back to your url uh should i need to restart again simply

03:27:16.920 --> 03:27:19.640
it generally it starts automatically but yeah ideally better

03:27:19.640 --> 03:27:24.160
just to just for a safer side restart ideally it refreshes

03:27:24.160 --> 03:27:28.040
it if you are doing any code changes control z yeah and then

03:27:28.040 --> 03:27:29.120
same

03:27:58.940 --> 03:28:00.560
issue right copy

03:28:05.140 --> 03:28:08.980
and send it to me it's basically like kuda issue it is not

03:28:08.980 --> 03:28:12.480
able to understand because it works well wherever we have a

03:28:12.480 --> 03:28:16.140
kuda and wherever we don't have a kuda which is like ideally

03:28:16.140 --> 03:28:21.020
your device actually i have purchased this machine for this

03:28:21.020 --> 03:28:25.540
course only i have but gpu gpu is not available right gpu is

03:28:25.540 --> 03:28:30.460
not right so kuda is related to gpu actually so if there is

03:28:30.460 --> 03:28:33.580
no kuda then uh if you are using a api for embedding right

03:28:33.580 --> 03:28:36.520
it will not give you the issue because in case of api if you

03:28:36.520 --> 03:28:38.800
are calling then there is no dependency on it your system

03:28:38.800 --> 03:28:46.360
ping me that issue it's just like a kuda issue which i can

03:28:46.360 --> 03:28:47.620
see ping

03:29:34.890 --> 03:29:39.690
me that uh ping you sir okay so

03:29:49.930 --> 03:29:53.350
it says again embedding in code add

03:30:25.640 --> 03:30:32.260
one more argument inside this one as this try this out

03:30:35.140 --> 03:30:39.980
add one more argument just beside your device argument that

03:30:39.980 --> 03:30:41.820
you have added yeah

03:30:53.550 --> 03:30:56.650
yeah so just beside the model kw argument just add this one

03:30:56.650 --> 03:31:03.450
comma yeah one more argument this uh okay uh be i think you

03:31:03.450 --> 03:31:08.060
have missed comma in between you have placed comma at last

03:31:08.060 --> 03:31:09.120
yeah

03:31:11.200 --> 03:31:13.680
now control s run

03:31:23.530 --> 03:31:24.170
same

03:31:47.820 --> 03:31:54.980
issue same issue

03:31:54.980 --> 03:31:59.000
in that case just replace your embedding with the api then

03:31:59.640 --> 03:32:00.700
down get ready it you know if if you always ever load the

03:32:00.700 --> 03:32:00.700
Myers problem is if it's a consistency yes give a name to it

03:32:00.700 --> 03:32:04.680
okay so it's a problem that I can't even test it i can just

03:32:04.680 --> 03:32:06.960
test it in my system so just just change the embedding model

03:32:06.960 --> 03:32:10.980
change like uh i think i have used like embedding api or

03:32:10.980 --> 03:32:14.300
maybe from my url itself just use the embedding aproximator

03:32:14.300 --> 03:32:20.280
so that it is not supposed to processing a local yeah i will

03:32:20.280 --> 03:32:22.780
try cuz basically it's a p versus yeah okay awesome um yeah

03:32:22.780 --> 03:32:28.200
