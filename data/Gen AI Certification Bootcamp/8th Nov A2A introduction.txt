WEBVTT

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.540
Okay, so hi everyone, good morning. I'm a little bit late, I

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.540
think, but yeah, so we are here.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.280
Okay, so I believe I'm audible and visible to all of you,

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.500
right everyone? Yeah?

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:16.020
Okay, great. We'll start in some time. So I believe we all

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.440
know the agenda for today's class. So basically, we'll be

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.380
talking about theory of A2A. I'll discuss about just a basic

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.980
of A2A today and then tomorrow. So we'll see how we can do a

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.500
practical of A2A. Basically, how we can create a multiple

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.380
agent and then, you know, do the orchestration and connect

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.420
all the agents all together.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.370
Good morning, good morning, everyone.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.440
Okay, fine, everyone. So let's start with the class. I think

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.600
there are some people, I don't know, I mean, like Amit is

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.780
doing some conversation. I believe he's looking into a wrong

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.900
class, it seems, because this link is working. We all are

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:10.080
here. So and it's working as it works. Always. So, yeah,

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.080
maybe he's looking into some different class and he is

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:14.500
confused.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.710
Okay, so let's start with the class. So I'll not take class

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:33.350
for a very long time today. The reason is that that I'm

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.310
preparing this A2A examples and I'm facing some sort of a

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.450
configuration issue, not configuration issue, it's a

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.870
dependency issue. So basically, UV package issue I'm facing.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.770
I'm just trying to resolve it. So even a study night till

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:48.230
late morning. So I was trying to resolve it. So I'm still

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:51.250
working on that. So theoretically, what is A2A, how does it

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:55.330
works and where A2A can be used? So that is something which

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.170
I will discuss and then tomorrow we'll do the practical.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:02.450
Simple, right? So that is the agenda of this particular week

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.070
we are going to cover and from next week. So next week, I

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:07.790
believe we are going to cover basically a generative AI with

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:11.710
respect to a cloud. So with respect to Azure, AWS and GCP,

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.790
we have to cover all of those things as per the syllabus.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:18.030
And then we are supposed to start with that. CICD pipeline

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:22.570
and then like Prometheus and then Grafana, which is ops part

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.150
basically, which is you can say a part of LLM ops, which we

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.650
are supposed to cover and then we will start building the

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:32.330
project. So that is going to be the whole flow as per our

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.870
syllabus, which has already been published. Now, so let me

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:39.010
share my screen and let's talk about a couple of things that

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:41.970
we have released this week. And then let's talk about a

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:47.470
theory of this one, A2A protocol. Yeah. So this week,

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:50.310
basically, we have released a couple of things. So I don't

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:52.490
know whether you have gone through that or not, but yeah, so

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.130
it's my responsibility to talk about it. So this week we

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:58.130
have launched something called as Euron Consulting. Why we

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:00.350
have launched this one? So there are so many people, right?

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.350
There are so many people who are working into our industry.

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:06.850
There are so many students who is, you know, maybe into a

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:10.230
college. So there are so many people and they have a

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.510
different, different kind of a requirement. Requirement

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.170
wise, so they have some sort of a requirement. For example,

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:18.870
you have joined. A company and company has given you a

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.430
project. Maybe you are not able to do that particular

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:24.610
project. Maybe you are stuck somewhere and it happens. It

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:27.850
happens with all the techies, right? And again, so maybe

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:31.830
like your manager is escalating it or maybe your team member

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:35.730
is escalating it. And yeah, so maybe you feel stuck

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.490
somewhere with respect to these kind of projects which

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.190
someone has given to you. So this is where this Euron

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:45.850
Consulting comes into picture. So again, to rescue you. You

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:49.350
can say. Let's suppose you are working into maybe or maybe

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.790
not working. So you are just a student. You are finally a

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:54.790
student and you are looking for a project. So again, Euron

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:58.110
Consulting comes into a picture. So for anyone and everyone.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:02.350
So who is looking for like to build any kind of a project or

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:05.530
they are stuck somewhere and they need a professional help.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:08.350
So this is where we have started this Euron Consulting. So

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:11.590
where my team is going to help you out in terms of building

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:14.290
delivering end-to-end things. So we'll be considering you as

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:17.250
a client basically. You will give. All the requirements. So

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:21.110
we are not going to give you any project by the way. We are

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:23.530
going to take the requirement and then whatever requirement

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:26.050
you will be having. So we will try to discuss the timeline

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:28.750
will try to discuss the entire flow which we are already

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:31.470
doing. So we have onboarded lot of clients in last like a

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.470
three days and people are literally liking it because it's

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:37.350
one of the much needed service which is required. And I

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:41.030
believe no one is providing this kind of a service in this

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:44.190
at least a super super affordable price because it needs a

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.150
huge team, right? Huge team. Without team, it's not

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.650
possible. It's like a direct involvement of like, you know,

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:56.450
people. So it's that kind of a model and I think we all know

00:10:56.450 --> 00:11:00.630
how consulting things actually works. So again, people are

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:04.590
providing it with like, you know, $100 per hour price or

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.830
maybe $200 per hour price and we are providing it. But just

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:12.130
by taking a small like a peanut amount. So where you can you

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:15.210
can submit your requirement. You can talk to team and even I

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:18.530
will be. Part of most of the like a team initially. So which

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:23.030
I'm doing it from my side and we are helping a lot of people

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:25.270
in terms of building a project. Maybe you are launching your

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:28.230
own edited and you say that that okay. I wanted to build

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.970
this kind of a LMS platform the kind of a platform that we

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:34.010
have so not an issue. We are going to do that for you,

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:36.850
right? So let's suppose you are working into a company and

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:40.090
someone is saying that I need maybe a URI WhatsApp kind of a

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:42.230
system the WhatsApp system that we have already created

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:45.550
which is up and running and we all are aware about it. Right

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:48.570
that it works basically, right? It works as per the

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.170
expectation. So we are going to build it for you. Someone is

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.190
going to say that I need this URI kind of a system or maybe

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:58.650
API kind of a system or any any system, right? So if that is

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:01.430
a kind of a requirement, so obviously we are going to build

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.590
it for you because we have experience. We have expertise

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:06.870
basically in terms of like, you know, building thing. This

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:09.530
is what we do. This is what my like a entire team is aligned

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:12.830
with. So yeah, this is where your own consulting comes into

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:15.810
picture. So for a student for professional. So basically for

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.870
a student for professional and for a startup, basically,

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:21.330
like if you are trying to build something big, right?

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:24.490
Something big beyond that. So let's suppose there is a very

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:28.190
very big project. So in last like a two days after launch.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:31.270
So there are a lot of people who you know, reach out to me

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:35.310
and from India and even from outside and they were saying

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.550
that that okay, I have a big requirement basically. So they

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.970
have their own team and their team is not able to fulfill

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:43.250
some requirement. Their team is not able to work on some

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:46.690
requirement. And they are saying that that we are looking

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:50.690
for a long-term Enterprise grade commitment. So for that we

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:55.130
are like doing a separate discussion basically. So let's

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:57.450
suppose there is a company or maybe you are a company and

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:01.230
you are trying to build something which is big very very big

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:06.410
basically, right? You would need like a big team involvement

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:10.130
of very very dedicated team involvement and you want

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:13.650
something very quick in that case. Obviously like we'll go

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:16.990
with the custom discussion. So we'll not come fall under any

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:20.090
of these package. So we'll go for the custom discussion. So

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:23.470
where we are charging hourly. So that's a whole idea behind

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:26.670
a Euron consulting and going forward. I have a plan to you

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:29.150
know, separate this Euron consulting from a Euron. I mean

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:32.430
like on a different URL. We have to host it as a different

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:36.530
entity. So this is where this Euron consulting comes into

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:39.370
picture. Hope you are going to like it and basically this is

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:44.610
a kind of a service which you will need when it is required.

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:48.330
Right? It's a requirement driven service. You can say but

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.670
yeah, many people have taken that and they are literally

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:56.410
like enjoying it. Yes. So Sarik is saying hats off again.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.330
Disrupting the market. Okay. Thank you. I was a market

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.950
people are charging too much for a similar kind of yeah. So

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:04.190
see there are so many like, you know freelancing platform

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:08.910
freelancer.com and then like, you know a platform. So where

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.270
you can go and hire freelancer. It's very difficult, right?

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:15.250
It's very difficult even when we had some. A lot of our work

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:18.490
right with respect to iOS the app that you are able to see

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:22.810
we were stuck a little bit when we were building it. I think

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:28.650
a year back right this Euron iOS app. So we were like a

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:31.930
stuck with respect to one compliance issue that comes from

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:36.750
the iOS side or you can say Apple side, right? And it's very

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:39.650
difficult, you know to find a genuine people. They will say

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:43.610
that I will charge this I will charge that and again, you

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:47.850
know market. Market is full of like a fraud. They have

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:50.850
created a big big profile. But when you connect and when you

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:54.430
make a payment, even I have made a payment and then when you

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:57.670
like, you know, get a people first of all, it's very

00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:00.330
difficult to connect right connect is very difficult. I mean

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.890
like they will take a charge and then they will not respond.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.570
So it's a very chaotic system. It's a very chaotic system.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:10.070
The finance system which is there it was good initially. But

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:13.630
yeah, so it's not pretty much helpful. I would say plus

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:18.810
charges. Are too too too much high and we all need this kind

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:21.790
of a things right because I as a student obviously I will

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:24.290
get stuck when I'm doing a project. I as a professional

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:28.170
obviously I will get stuck somewhere when we have to do a

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:31.590
project delivery or maybe as a maybe it's a client has given

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:33.730
me a requirement by manager. My director has given me a

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:36.070
requirement. Maybe I'm not able to design the architect.

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:39.290
Maybe I'm not able to like, you know, find out the solution.

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:43.650
So we all have like, you know, a kind of a bottleneck which

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:46.990
comes in. Our life and obviously to rescue that this

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:51.870
consulting things comes into a picture. Like I said, so we

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:55.410
have like you can just ask. Okay, fine. So build this for me

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:58.470
build that for me and we are going to like my team is going

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:00.990
to build it for you, right? Obviously we are going to like

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:04.450
it's not like you will say build today and then tomorrow you

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:06.550
will be able to get it. We are going to give you a timeline

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:09.530
the way real-time project happens, right? Everything goes

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:12.630
with the timelines basically and we have kept it affordable

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:15.630
initially. We are going forward. So obviously we are going

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:17.950
to increase the price but yeah, initially we have kept it

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:23.510
very very super super affordable by the way 60k for years.

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:27.730
So is there any less installment system as of now? So we are

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:31.110
like in talk with provider of this installation installation

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:35.590
things but as of now there is no so there is none by the way

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:39.770
even fewer people charge 50k for simple AI task. Yeah, I'm

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:42.790
like just go and check the price by the way. So even if you

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:45.050
have to deliver it. A very very simple task, right? A very

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:49.510
very simple one 15 20 K. I mean like for just for nothing.

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.390
They will charge just for talking to you and they are going

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:56.070
to charge. This is how market is working and I don't know

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:59.610
whether they are going to deliver it or not. Right because I

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:03.430
had a bad experience with that and keeping that in the mind.

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:06.170
So if I had a bad experience, obviously many people will be

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:08.910
having a bad experience keeping that in the minds. I have

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:12.170
just launched it my own that okay, let's start because I

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:16.470
have a team. I have a strength. And again, I have you all of

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:20.250
you basically, right? So if I have to build maybe like a

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:24.450
strong team, I can onboard many of you from my group as

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:27.570
simple as that. So last week again, we have released a

00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:30.470
requirement for eight interns. I believe we have already

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:33.830
finalized three three or four. We have received all the

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:37.090
resumes and yeah, so interview still going on. I think even

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:41.410
today I believe my team is taking an interview for rest of

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:44.770
the nothing. So eight interns. We are onboarding not for

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:48.970
this job for this job. We already have a big team for a

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:52.150
future basically. So we are like onboarding a team.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:03.190
I saw YouTube Databricks. You can go to your dashboard. You

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:05.950
will be able to see more videos. I think 1920 video from my

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:08.230
side. I have uploaded. So that is my recording. Visal is

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:10.910
also a mentor who is doing a recording. So go and check out.

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:15.950
Okay. Now, this is one announcement. Like I said guys, so

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:18.990
today I will not discuss much in terms of technical things.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:24.510
I think tomorrow will be the day another thing which we have

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:28.250
launched study study. We have made announcement. So full

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:30.710
-stack automation. I believe we have already talked about it

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:35.450
even in our batch, right? So Dhruv basically, I think we all

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:39.150
know Dhruv Dhruv is your batchmate. He is coming from your

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:43.830
batch, right? And he has already given you a demo a good

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:48.110
one, right? A big one. So basically along with Dhruv. I have

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:50.810
planned to launch. This particular batch, right? This

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:52.990
particular batch, which is basically a full-stack automation

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:56.570
bootcamp when it is going to start. So it is going to start

00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:00.670
from 23rd of November, by the way. Yeah. So this month

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:02.710
itself, we are not taking much of time to start this

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:05.850
particular batch. So in next like a two week of time, we are

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:08.610
going to kick off this particular batch. Now, what is the

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:10.690
idea behind this particular batch? So idea behind this

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:13.130
particular batch and if you will go through a syllabus of

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:15.610
this particular batch, you will be able to find out that we

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:19.190
are focusing on a pure automation and that too pure. So code

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:22.930
automation means to attend this particular batch, you are

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:26.370
not supposed to know any kind of a coding. We are not going

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:29.790
to do any kind of a coding, obviously in some of the node,

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:33.270
as we have all, as you have already seen in my class that

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:35.290
somewhere we are writing a JavaScript somewhere. We are

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:37.770
writing a Python, right? A small script. We are writing in

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:41.310
some of the node only that much of coding we are going to

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:44.390
do. So technically it's an, it's a follow everyone. So who

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:48.150
is like a wanted to do an automation and they're struggling.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:52.670
So. So just for that, this is our dedicated batch. So where

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:57.950
no code is required, most of the classes will depends upon

00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:03.330
the N8N framework basically, right? So just go and check the

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:07.870
syllabus, read out the entire syllabus part. So you will

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:11.870
love it obviously, right? And at the end of this entire like

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:14.810
a things, you will be able to know a lot of like automation.

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:18.710
Although I know in this batch, people are capable enough to

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:21.490
do automation. All of these automations, I don't have any

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:23.770
kind of a doubt because we have already done that in our

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:27.850
batches, in our classes. But yeah, so if someone would like

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:30.530
to like, you know, learn the automation from the scratch,

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:34.210
maybe this is, or maybe if you have not attended those

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:39.010
classes from your batch. So where I talk about N8N, because

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:42.090
we have discussed a lot, right? Almost everything we have

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:45.650
discussed. So I believe all of us are capable enough to do

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:48.250
any kind of automation, but still, if you would like to

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:52.190
like. Do that. Go with it. Yeah. Go with it. If you are

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:55.210
senior, if you are non tech person, so maybe this is the

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:58.890
perfect batch for you in terms of doing a AI based

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:02.970
automation, creating an agents based on the AI and your

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:04.910
batchman Dhruv is going to take care of this particular

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:08.730
batch. I will not be taking this particular batch. I have

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:13.450
like another batch AI ML at the same time, like 8pm IST. So

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:17.150
I have another batch at 7pm IST. So that's the reason. You

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:20.450
can see the mentor name. Right? It's a Dhruv. So I have like

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:23.490
not given my name for this particular batch. So maybe I will

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:27.290
be part of just a inauguration. That's it. I'll just come

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:30.530
with a Dhruv, inaugurate it and then Dhruv is going to take

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:32.730
care of this end to end. And Dhruv is very capable person.

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:35.930
So I had a lot of discussion with him in recent days and

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:39.530
he's very capable, very dedicated person. I found out.

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:53.590
It's okay. I mean like N8N already discussed for you in

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:56.530
class maybe. So this is basically a productivity booster.

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:58.750
You can say that. Yes. This is basically a productivity

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:01.030
booster. So where you can go and you can try to automate

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:06.150
anything that you want. Technically for this batch people, I

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:10.650
don't think it's like, you know, required because I have

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:13.830
already discussed in detail and you can do any kind of

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:17.090
automation on your own. But still, if you are looking for

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:21.150
like a, you know, something like this, maybe we just just go

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:22.190
ahead with this one. Yeah.

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.320
Suppose we have to design a recruitment system, which should

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.740
provide all the details. So if you have a candidate, then

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:35.580
how much time it will take? That depends upon your

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.360
requirements. I can't say that that it will take one month,

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.460
two months or maybe six months of time. So maybe it's all

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.260
about features. So what kind of features you are looking for

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.720
and when you give a requirement, when you give a features,

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:50.180
we'll give you a proper document saying that, okay, fine. So

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.680
this is the time it is going to take and this is the phase

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:56.540
wise deliveries. Right. And then we will start like working

00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:01.680
on it the way real consulting project happens. Right. Maybe

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.120
for some project, it will take eight or nine months of time,

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:04.480
depends.

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:10.870
So in this way, this entire consulting like is going to work

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:12.190
now.

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:19.100
So do we to join if you are good, if you are good, it's not

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.920
like we'll like onboard just like that. But yeah, so if you

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:26.240
are good, you have to send your like, you know, proper

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.780
lectures and after evaluating your lectures, then only we

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:31.600
are going to onboard it. Otherwise we are not going to

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.220
onboard it. And now, so coming to the next announcement,

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:39.380
today is okay. Just announcement day it seems, but yeah,

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:45.600
young year on. So yeah, we are like, again, this was one of

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.860
the batch, right, which I have launched. But yeah, I was

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:53.020
just amazed. So what Vive coding can do and what a kits can

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:55.760
do basically. So this is one new batch which is going to

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:59.340
start. One batch is already running and yeah, this is

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:01.740
basically for kits. So if you have a kits, maybe they can

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:05.620
join this particular batch. Kits who have joined now. So if

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.380
I'm going to show you their project, you will be literally

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:11.200
amazed. You will be literally amazed that what people are

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:15.020
doing, basically what kits are actually doing and that too

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:18.940
till deployment. And because I remember when I was a kits, I

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:24.220
was at their age, I was like doing a programming in a logo,

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:29.260
RT 60, LT 90 kind of a, I don't know how many of you know

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:32.240
this programming language. Logo and basic. There is a

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:36.820
programming language called as logo and basic, we used to do

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:37.540
in our childhood.

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:45.140
So RT 60, LT 90 and we try to, we used to create, you know,

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:48.120
a different, different kind of a shape. But yeah, thanks to

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:52.200
AI and thanks to all of this advancement, now we are able to

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:57.880
build lot of, you know, big, big projects and feature. Logo

00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:01.100
was awesome. It was only time we got to access AC room. Due

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:07.460
to computer, we used to go for AC room, but yeah, that, that

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:11.300
was like, uh, those were the day maybe, uh, kids of this

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:16.160
generation will not be able to see those days. Okay. Now

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:20.200
coming to, uh, lecture part, like I said, I'll not discuss

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:24.160
much. I'm stuck with, uh, you know, uh, building, uh, a to a

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:28.220
protocol, a system I'm like libraries giving me a lot of

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:32.520
conflict. Uh, so. Okay. I'll discuss about this just in

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.880
terms of theory and then I'll close the class for today so

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.960
that tomorrow I'll come and I'll try to discuss, uh, this

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:42.560
entire a to a protocol in practical. So guys, uh, as per

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:45.820
your syllabus, we have like a, we have to discuss about a

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.900
protocol called as a to a protocol. So technically it's a

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:51.240
agent to agent protocol, which has been developed and

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:55.780
designed by Google. So MCP is one of the protocol, right? So

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:58.420
where you can try to take any kind of a tool and exposed to

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:02.180
the LMS. And we all have done that. And I believe you all

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:04.420
have tested, I'm assuming because there was a lot of

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:07.320
discussion which was going on inside a group. So I believe,

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:12.980
uh, we all have used a Gmail MCP, a calendar, MCP, Google

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:18.100
seat, MCP, SQL database, MCP, and a MongoDB MCP. Right?

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:22.920
Everyone. Yeah. I've seen those discussions. So I am

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:25.360
assuming that majority of you have already created those

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:31.460
MCPs and you have already like, uh, uh, used it. Yeah. Okay.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:39.280
So, uh, so, uh, basically, uh, this was one of the protocol

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:43.260
MCP was one of the protocol and the idea was very simple

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:47.300
that, uh, use a library, basically use a orchestrator,

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:50.400
right? Uh, which is going to help me out in terms of

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:55.500
creating MCPs and, uh, then try to use any of your tools

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:59.500
means any of your services that you are using and then give

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:03.040
an access to LMS. Right? Given access to LMS so that now

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:07.100
with the help of just chat as we have done last week, uh, so

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:10.100
you will be able to generate our reports. You will be able

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.980
to generate like a, you know, uh, talk to your databases.

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:17.040
You will be able to talk to your email ID or maybe like a

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.720
calendar or anyone, and then you will be able to do a given

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:23.180
task. There was a whole idea behind MCPs and we all have

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:26.140
done up real, real practical things, not a dummy practical

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:28.260
things. Right? So we all were able to connect with our

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:31.460
system. A five system technically. And then we were able to

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:35.120
expose all of those five system, uh, to, uh, like a cursor.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.100
And then, uh, we were able to talk to all of those five

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:43.120
system. Now there is another protocol called as A2A, agent

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:48.460
to agent. So I think, uh, as name suggests, right, A2A

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:50.320
protocol, agent to agent protocol, which has been developed

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:54.940
by a Google, by the way, right? So this protocol was

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:58.860
designed and developed in a manner. Or you can say with a

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:02.380
theme that, that let's suppose I have created some agent in

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:05.680
Langchain, right? Some agent I have created into a, uh,

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.960
maybe by using a crew AI, right? Some agent I have created

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.940
by using a auto gen. So now Langchain is a different

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.620
framework altogether. It's a different company, right? Their

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.440
framework is different. Then there is a crew AI. Then there

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.280
is a auto gen and likewise, there are multiple other

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.660
frameworks. So which try to give you, or which, which allows

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:27.820
you to create an agent, right? Create an agent. Yeah. Yeah.

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:31.860
So basically, uh, this, uh, A2A protocol is nothing but a

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:35.280
protocol. So where you will be able to establish a

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.580
communication among a different, different, different,

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:40.140
different kind of, uh, agent that that's a whole idea. That

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:43.440
was the whole idea behind this, uh, A2A protocol. So whether

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.280
I'm going to create an agent into a crew AI or maybe auto

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.460
gen or maybe a Langchain or maybe by using any other given

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:53.880
framework. But yeah, so if I have, uh, I can, I can use this

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:57.420
A2A library, A2A SDK, A2A library, and with the help of

00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:00.900
that. I will be able to basically, uh, you know, establish a

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:05.000
communication between any of these agents in between. So

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.320
this, this, what this framework does by the way. So this

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.200
framework always helps us out in terms of structuring our

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.320
messages, right? So what agent should like, uh, you know,

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:17.040
uh, represent in terms of our intent, what agent should

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.620
consider as a context, what agent should, you know, take as

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:23.660
a responses. Plus it, uh, like, you know, uh, take care of

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.260
transport layer because when we are talking about the

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:29.220
communication. Maybe it's a HTTP based communication or

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:32.760
maybe a web socket based communication or maybe a SSE based

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:36.580
communication. So it, it, uh, like always try to, you know,

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.800
uh, take care of this, uh, transportation layer that what

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:42.880
kind of a packet should go from where to here or what kind

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.300
of a message we are supposed to transport in what format,

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:48.640
because format matters a lot, right? Because format is, uh,

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:52.140
ultimate things, which gives, uh, any agents understanding

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:54.780
that what is the input and then what I should yield as a

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:59.500
output. And, uh, then, uh, basically like, uh, it gives us a

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:02.740
power in terms of discovering a capabilities of the agent

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:05.620
that, okay, for which task I'm supposed to call what kind of

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:08.580
a agent plus a session management. So this is, this is kind

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:11.440
of a things which, uh, you will be able to find out with

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:15.540
respect to A to A. Now, so let me share my screen and let me

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:22.100
show you something with respect to A to A. Uh, so there is a

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:28.920
very good repository they have released. And, uh, A to A Git

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:36.740
repo, yeah. So there is a very good repo that, uh, one, only

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:40.180
one repo is available again. So they have given you

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.380
examples, they have given you a lot of things over there.

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:46.520
But the problem is that, that, uh, uh, if you will try to

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.840
run those examples, so maybe those examples are a bit old

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.580
and maybe you will not be able to run it. I have already

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.820
tried and I have like, I was facing a lot of problems over

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:56.280
there. So based on my experience, I'm just telling you,

00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:00.540
yeah. So A to A Python, A to A samples, okay. Let's go to A

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:06.180
to A samples now. So this is the whole idea is how to

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:08.520
establish or how to build an agent by using a different,

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:11.300
different, you know, uh, things and then how I will be able

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:15.160
to basically build it. So I'll, I'll give you this repo. Now

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.860
let's go to this particular repo and this is just a

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:21.000
introduction. I will be showing you a different set of a

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.500
code. I have my own code, which I'm building. Uh. Not this

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:27.780
like a repo one, because I was going through this repo and

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:30.940
it was a basic, uh, you know, uh, agent that they have

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:34.400
built. Uh, I'm just trying to expose something real, which

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:38.160
is going to do a real job for me. The way we have seen with

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:43.220
respect to MCPs, right? So and here one more thing. So when

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:45.640
I, when I say agent, so you can even try to give an access

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:48.920
of your MCPs and even it is going to like a, you know,

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:53.340
orchestrate this MCPs. So here I would like to show you one.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:56.220
Uh, this one, which is a small, very, very small task, a

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:59.320
travel planner agent, just introduction of the library.

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:03.100
Right. And then I'll give you this GitHub repo. But tomorrow

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:06.880
I'm going to discuss my own set of a code, uh, which like,

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.280
uh, which is going to help you out to understand and do

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:13.040
things in a practical manner. So here, if you will come and

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:16.120
look into this library. So this is our single agent system,

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.440
travel planner agent is a single agent system and they have

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:21.480
also released a multi agent system. So here, if you will

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.360
come, you will be able to find out something. There is

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.380
something called as agent.py agent executor and these are

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:28.780
the two pile, which is important. The rest of the file is

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.380
just a UV files, which is helping me out in terms of, you

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:35.100
know, and then this loop client, uh, apart from that, this

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.960
config file or toml file is nothing but just a config file

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:41.360
for my library dependencies installation. Now here inside

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:45.480
the agent.py and technically what this one is doing. So

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:49.900
technically this is helping me out in terms of creating or

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:53.120
chatting with the agents. So where I will go? And I will say

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:56.880
that, okay, I'm like, uh, looking for this kind of, uh,

00:32:56.980 --> 00:33:00.140
booking from, or maybe I'm traveling from this place to this

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:03.260
place and then give me all the details, all the itineraries.

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:08.060
This is what this table agent is going to, uh, do and, uh,

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:11.200
here. So if you will come, so you will be able to find out

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:15.100
that this entire things has been created in a language

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:18.700
chain. So language chain is one of the framework that we

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.760
have already discussed and agent is located in a language

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:25.380
chain. And here the entire system message is given that what

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:28.820
you are supposed to do, what kind of information. And as we

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:31.820
all know how to create a agents inside a language. Like I

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:33.520
said, you can create your language and you can create in a

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:36.640
crew AI. You can create an auto gen or whatever framework

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:40.940
that you like. You can create agents over there and A2A is

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:43.920
going to orchestrate it. This is the only place where A2A

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:48.260
comes into a picture. So this is an agent file. Now the main

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:51.260
file is agent executor. This is where you will be able to

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:54.460
find out A2A SDN. So they have already released the SDKs,

00:33:54.460 --> 00:34:00.680
this A2 SDK, uh, and again, this SDK like I was giving me a

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.640
lot of problem in terms of, you know, library dependencies.

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:08.020
So it's, it's a real pain that maybe in the future they are

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:10.800
going to release a new version, new update and this pain

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.960
will be gone. But yeah, as of now, we're configuring, this

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:17.320
is a literally real pain, uh, because of like a library

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:21.060
dependencies and their version mismatch. So here you can do

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:24.760
what? So you can try to use this A2A SDK, agent to agent

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.200
SDK, which is like our official SDK, which has been

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.640
released. And then you can try to create your own

00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:34.180
orchestrator, uh, which is going to take some other agents.

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:38.980
For example, in my, uh, like a example. So here we have

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:42.880
created a travel planning agent, which is a agent in a land

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:45.800
chain, by the way. Yeah. So basically that agent is

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:49.420
available into a land chain. This A2A will do what? So this

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:53.760
A2A is going to establish. Okay. A server and it is going to

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:56.880
invoke that particular agent. Nothing more than that. It is

00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:00.460
doing over here as simple as that. So it is just going to

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:04.400
use the same agent as we are doing a import of this agent in

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:09.240
this particular place. That's it. And it's easy, right? It's

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:13.700
easy. And, uh, when we talk about basically handling, uh,

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:16.820
transportation of the messages in between, or maybe a

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:20.140
session management, maybe a capability discovery. Maybe.

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:23.500
Maybe a messaging structure. All of these things will be

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:28.100
handled by my A2A itself. This is the place where A2A comes

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:31.520
into picture. So we are, we are able to get an idea that

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.120
what A2A is. Yes.

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:39.050
A2A orchestrator framework, by the way. Yeah. So another

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:41.550
like a framework. So where I can configure a multiple

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:42.090
agents,

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:49.470
um, uh, DAO is saying that token JSON where we can have it.

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:53.690
I was not able to understand your query by the way. Yes,

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:56.930
everyone. Yeah. I think we are able to understand the

00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:59.550
feature behind A2A theoretically.

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:16.100
Okay. So this is just one of the official repository and

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:18.020
they have, they have given basically a lot of like an

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:21.000
example in our Python. So they have given a multi agent

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.220
example as well over here. Uh, so they have basically Airbnb

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:33.470
planner, where is that agents and then yeah, multi agent. So

00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:36.350
here what they are doing. So they are like creating three

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:39.930
agents. One is an Airbnb agent. One is a host agent. One is

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:43.710
a better agent, all three agents for one single task. So one

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:46.870
by one, anyone can go and anyone can try to explore these

00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:49.450
like, uh, agent that what technically these agent is doing.

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:53.750
So Airbnb, again, one of the company we all know, which we

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:57.810
are using worldwide in terms of planning a trip, right? So

00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:02.830
many of us are using Airbnb. So this is what this, uh, like

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:05.870
a whole agent multi agent is going to do. So it is going to

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:08.510
plan your trip. And it is going to basically check our

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:12.030
weather and based on the weather and all the other

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:15.370
information with respect to like a Airbnb, it is going to

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:18.770
coordinate amongst an agent, a multiple agent altogether.

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:21.950
And then finally it is going to complete your particular

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:26.130
task. So technically A2A is nothing but it's a orchestrator

00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:29.910
framework by the way. Yeah. Till now for project we have

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:32.630
used only one framework. What is the use for the multiple

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:35.450
framework? Only one framework. Which one?

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:47.160
When you are talking about the MCB project, token.json,

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:52.820
where we can have it. Token.json. I mean like which file

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:55.820
you're talking about in what context it should have a

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:58.020
covered interaction between agent to agent across a

00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.040
different framework. But this looks like one agent is being

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:03.700
called by agent server. Uh, yeah. Sanjeev, uh, in a previous

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:06.320
example, now look into this example. So we have a multiple

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.980
agents which has been created and then all of these, uh,

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:11.520
like agents are going to coordinate. So when we are going to

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:14.200
write a code, our code, uh, you will be able to understand

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:16.900
it more and more, which I'm building. So by tomorrow I will

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:20.420
be talking about that particular code as well. This is just

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:24.380
a repo which is available over the internet, uh, latest

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:27.460
repo. You can say one of the best repo you will be able to

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:30.360
find out over a internet, but I'm not going to talk about

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:34.400
this. Uh, so basically when I was learning, I was exploring

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:37.420
A2A, so I have just like a found out this repo. So I thought

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:39.960
of discussing with all of you. So maybe you can follow. And

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:44.160
you can like, uh, you know, uh, just go through it. I'll be

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.820
discussing my own example, not this examples.

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:55.330
One framework per project. I mean, what's the need of, uh,

00:38:55.510 --> 00:39:00.450
merging multiple frameworks? Uh, why, uh, required, um, I

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:03.150
mean like, uh, depends upon, you know, a project

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:06.070
architecture. So if my architect is saying that, no, I have

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:09.190
to use a language and I have to use a crew AI. I have to use

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:11.390
this. I have to use that as well. Then go ahead with that.

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:13.950
If someone is saying that, okay, I just have to use a

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:16.890
language in itself. So in a language and I can create a

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:19.910
separate separate agents, right? And then I need a

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:22.830
communication between those language in Asia itself. Let's

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:25.610
suppose I have created a five language in Asians, uh, maybe

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:28.150
Airbnb agent. This is also in Langton. This is also in

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:30.630
Langton. This is also in Langton. So obviously I have to

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:32.950
establish a communication in between agent to agent.

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:36.870
Although language in itself supports a multi agent

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:40.090
communication. Yeah. Multi agent. Multi agent. So this is

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:42.450
again one of the framework which has been released by Google

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:45.570
and uh, if you want, you can use it. If you don't want it,

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:49.470
it's completely up to you because, uh, it's not like I

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:53.050
should use a two way always. Uh, it's, it's not mandatory.

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:57.490
It's just one of the other tech which is available to all of

00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:01.090
us as simple as that. So I'm not saying that, uh, a two is

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:05.670
solving something very, very unique problem. Right? Uh, so I

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:09.070
can, I can achieve the same task even without using a two

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:12.810
way. Without touching a two way. But yeah, so if my company

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:16.490
is using a two way, then maybe I won't be able to avoid it.

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:21.190
That's the only difference. So that's my take on this a two

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:23.910
way as we have seen multiple frameworks, right? And

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:26.230
technically in all the frameworks, what we were doing,

00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:29.210
whether it's a Lang chain, land graph, Lama indexes, or

00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:33.910
maybe like a two way, sorry, not a two way auto gen and a

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:38.550
crew AI. We were creating agents. Even in any 10. We were

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:39.090
creating agents.

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:45.190
So it's like framework for integrating multiple agentic AI.

00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:48.130
It's a orchestrator framework. Actually a two way is

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:51.030
actually a orchestrator framework for orchestration. So

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:53.870
multiple agents, if you have to plug and then if you have to

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:56.390
run it, because when we talk about a multiple agent, so

00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:58.670
obviously we have to like, you know, uh, take care of the

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:01.210
sessions. We take care of the, like a messaging structure.

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:05.050
We take care of the transportation layer. Uh, so all of

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:07.870
these things will be handled by this library. This is what

00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:08.690
they claim.

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:12.940
Can I have a second? Can I have a single agent with a

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:15.340
multiple tool expose for the translation other than a two

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:19.540
way? So the little more obviously Leela. So see when we are

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:23.200
designing the agentic system, right? It it's like a complete

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:27.520
depends upon me that how things will flow, right? So there

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:30.540
is like, uh, no hard and fast rule that I should always go

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:34.200
with this or that. I think after taking these many number of

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:37.000
classes, we all are able to understand this agentic world.

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:42.240
A2 is very helpful. Imagine one year down the lane. Every

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:45.740
team would have used a different framework. Integration for

00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:49.960
them needed ultimately and can be doing, I mean like, uh,

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:54.840
depends upon the, uh, like, you know, um, simple

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:59.020
requirements, right? So everyone will not do it. Uh, and,

00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:03.740
uh, again, so I won't say that, that they will not do it. So

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:07.140
obviously there is a possibility, a lot of possibility. So

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:10.160
you should know, I'm saying that the only one line statement

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:13.520
that, that you should know. Okay. So if you are a part of

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:16.980
maybe a generative AI world, then you are supposed to be

00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:17.820
aware about it.

00:42:24.490 --> 00:42:29.150
Okay. So fine guys, I'm still building, like I said, so I'm

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:32.270
struggling a little bit in terms of like resolving some sort

00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:34.890
of a dependencies. So till morning I was trying to do it,

00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:39.110
but yeah, I went for a sleep. Uh, it's a small work which is

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:42.530
pending with respect to my project. I believe I'm going to

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:46.790
complete that work today itself. Yeah. And, uh, then, uh,

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:48.910
uh, I'll, I'll discuss it. I'll discuss that particular

00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:52.670
piece of the code, but not this one. Yeah. Not this one. So

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:56.310
I have my own piece of the code, uh, for explanation so that

00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:59.870
you all will be able to build, uh, agents and then you all

00:42:59.870 --> 00:43:02.550
will be able to use a A2A and communicate between each

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:06.130
other. Uh, if I'm going to discuss a same project, then you

00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:08.450
will face a lot of difficulties, right? And you will, maybe

00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:11.550
you will not be able to learn it in a better way. Yeah. Uh,

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:15.130
so, uh, which, which I don't want. So that's why, you know,

00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:17.670
I'm building my own piece of the code that I will be

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:21.770
discussing. Tomorrow. Uh, so anyone who is having any kind

00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:25.210
of a question, go ahead, try to put up your question.

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:31.400
Yeah. Ram, go ahead.

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:39.460
Hi, sir. Thank you for the information. And I have a

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:42.140
question actually, when we interact with the agent to agent,

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:47.160
so what is the current trending use cases? Uh, maybe any

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:50.840
real time use cases when we interact with probably in

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:54.860
between agent to agent. Okay. So basically. Okay. So the

00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:57.120
real time use cases you are talking about, right? Yeah.

00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:00.400
Yeah. Okay. So recently I was working in one of the

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:03.380
projects. So where, what, what they are doing is that, that,

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:07.340
uh, there is a client called as IHG, right? And they have a

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:11.440
chains of basically a hotels and, uh, because it's, it's one

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.940
of my client projects on which we are like already working

00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:16.640
and we are building a multiple agent for them. So basically

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:19.720
they have a multiple hotels and they are trying to create

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:23.680
their own app, their own application so that their customer

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:26.800
can come. Okay. And their customer can, you know, uh, like,

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:29.440
uh, check, uh, their nearest. So they can, they can simply

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:33.160
say that, that, okay, so I'm like, uh, planning my stay on

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:37.180
this particular day with your hotel. Uh, so just tell me

00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:39.680
like, and they have in one single location, I think we all

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:42.260
know IHG brand. You can even search on Google. It's a big

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:45.440
brand by the way. Uh, so basically they are trying to build

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.940
the complete framework. So where customer can come and they

00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:50.140
will be able to do everything just with the help of

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:52.960
chatting, something like that. Uh, they have, they have the

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:56.560
requirement. So we have like a, we are building one agent,

00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:59.920
uh, for example, for just for the hotel search one agent for

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:04.240
a checkout purposes, one agent for, uh, maybe like

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:08.080
allocating them a particular rooms and they're all the, uh,

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:12.420
designated services. We are building one agent just to do

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:15.700
some sort of ordering when they are staying into a hotel. So

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:20.040
likewise we have done a multiple, uh, like, uh, we are, we

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.940
are trying to create a multiple or we are trying to

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:24.480
orchestrate a multiple agent. Framework. And we are creating

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:27.840
a multiple agent, one agent for one particular task right

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:33.060
now. So let's suppose if I'm trying to maybe give them a

00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:37.240
room. So obviously I have to check first of all, right? That

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:40.720
okay. So whether, uh, this person have already booked or

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:44.200
not, and, uh, many things, obviously you can, you can come

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:47.220
and say that, that I can do it with the help of even tool

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:49.540
calling. That's true. Even with the help of tool calling, we

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:52.440
can do it without even creating a separate agent. But, uh,

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:55.720
here. So a couple of agent that we have created. So one is

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:58.280
helping me in terms of doing a booking, finding out the

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:03.160
places, nearest one and a X to Y location. And one agent who

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:06.540
will try to like help me out after a booking, one agent who

00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:09.720
will help me out in terms of like after booking. And then,

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:12.300
so at the time of booking itself in terms of doing a

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:15.920
transaction, validating all the transaction and here we have

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:19.200
to talk, right? We have to talk that, okay, so if customer

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:23.420
is trying to come for check-in, so obviously I have to, uh,

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:27.800
check whether like all the previous process has been done or

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:32.120
not without asking a customer again, right? Without asking

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:34.700
the customer again, even we have really the agent, so which

00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:37.660
will help us out in terms of doing a pre-check-in means they

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:39.920
can just like a talk to a system and they can upload all

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:42.520
their Aadhaar card or maybe their passport over there and

00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:45.340
then, uh, for Indian, Indian clients. So they can upload the

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:48.600
Aadhaar card and everything and then, uh, I, we will be

00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:50.940
done, uh, basically, so they are not supposed to come. And

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:53.460
again, do the verification, re-verification, they can simply

00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:56.460
come. So that QR code, because we are going to generate a QR

00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:59.420
code and then they will be able to get their room. So they

00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:03.020
don't have to stay into a lobby. So multi-agent

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:07.400
communication is required wherever, right? At that point of

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:09.920
time, you can go ahead with this kind of orchestrator

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:15.160
framework. But again, I'm saying A2A is not the only

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:18.800
framework by, or A2A is not the only way by which I will be

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:21.680
able to achieve it. Okay. So if I am creating A2A, I will be

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:25.200
able to achieve it. But yeah, if I have so, so many like

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:28.780
agents, which I'm creating a pool of the agent, then maybe

00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:32.640
in future I need a A2A, uh, where I have to, you know, uh,

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:35.920
like establish a communication and that too, you know, a

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.560
heterogeneous kind of agent I have. One agent in Langchain,

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:42.080
one agent in Langraph, one agent in a crew AI, one agent in

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:46.960
a, like a autogen, then maybe I need this framework and I

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:51.220
can, I can do orchestration, which will ease my life. That's

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:54.760
it. This is the only requirement. Hope I'm able to make

00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:58.200
sense. For this similar use case, right? So before 10 years

00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:02.020
or something, uh, uh, some, a team has implemented through

00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:04.720
the rule based system, right? When we go to the bank as

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:07.900
well, uh, we have the cask over there and whatever we need,

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:13.020
it can do it. So how the, this system is different from that

00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:16.680
rule based. So I think, what is the, I understood LLM can

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:20.380
refine and it can make some additional benefit and it can,

00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:20.380
it can, it can, it can, it can, it can, it can, it can, it

00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:20.580
can, it can, it can, it can, it can, it can, it can, it can,

00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:20.580
it can, it can be, you know, it can be, it can, it can make

00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:25.160
an own, own intelligence power, but, uh, how, uh, how, uh,

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:28.400
uh, will it be getting different from the old system? See

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.940
your old system was any how your rule based system, right?

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:34.040
So you do EFL, CFL, CFL kind of a statement. It's not

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:36.300
agentic. You don't understand. First of all, your language

00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:41.120
by the way. Yeah. So NLP agents is the main advantage or

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:45.540
main superpower of agent is LLM capability, which was not

00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:49.440
there in your, like a previous system. Uh, yeah. It can do

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:52.280
some extra work. Uh huh. right according to it can

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:54.080
understand your language by the way that's that's a

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:57.300
superpower of the entire ntk system that's the main

00:48:57.300 --> 00:49:00.700
superpower apart from that i we could have done that even

00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:02.580
with the help of writing a e-fail statement which we have

00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:05.380
been doing it since a very very long time but yeah it's a

00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:09.300
superpower for you yeah but it is also have own intelligent

00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:12.520
technique it can do that our unexpected result as well right

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:17.640
sometime uh we ask something it can return some collusion or

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:21.960
some problem from ai right if the model is not properly

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:25.480
trained uh it can return the wrong result right it may be

00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:30.440
possible it's possible everywhere by the hallucination is a

00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:35.040
real thing in case of model world yeah but from the previous

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.540
when we come while comparing the previous system this is

00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:41.140
having a lot of advantages i think that's the reason we are

00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:43.080
taking a geni classes right we have seen all those

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:51.680
advantages okay okay yeah yeah so uh ranjit please go ahead

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:52.840
yeah

00:49:58.570 --> 00:50:02.190
okay so elgo please go ahead uh

00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:10.830
hi sir yeah go ahead uh so actually i have some questions

00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:17.430
regarding the agents that we have built so sir uh let's say

00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:22.170
we have three four frameworks so can you please tell that

00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:26.250
how to select a particular agent and whether it is a no code

00:50:26.250 --> 00:50:26.710
one or a no code one or a no code one or a no code one would

00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:30.230
be the best or the coding selection i think i think yeah i

00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:33.090
think i have discussed this question so many times and that

00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:36.090
will be the practical example see no code one if you have

00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:38.990
this uh you can you can go ahead with that so let's suppose

00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:41.410
if i'm trying to automate my day-to-day task right for

00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:43.690
example maybe i'm doing a email automation calendar

00:50:43.690 --> 00:50:46.510
automation minutes of meeting kind of automation right auto

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:49.730
reply for the email in that or wherever i have a batch kind

00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:53.070
of a task so which is is supposed to like you know do or

00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:56.830
maybe once in a day twice in a day kind of uh task we can we

00:50:56.830 --> 00:50:59.210
can go ahead with the no code it's the best one and it is

00:50:59.210 --> 00:51:02.050
going to give you a better result but let's suppose i have

00:51:02.050 --> 00:51:05.470
even like a discussed a lot of projects where i told you

00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:09.090
simply that wherever i have a concern with respect to my

00:51:09.090 --> 00:51:12.610
latency so this system should give me a response in this

00:51:12.610 --> 00:51:15.510
microsecond or this millisecond you can't go ahead with the

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:18.530
no code solution no code solution is not going to solve that

00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:20.670
problem at all so in that case you have to go ahead with

00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:23.450
this framework this kind of a framework so where you have a

00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:27.190
control over the low code basically so where you can you can

00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:30.990
try to do any kind of optimization as per your requirement

00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:35.950
so that's my answer yes sir sir i i uh recall this answer

00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:39.690
because i was so so is this the correct reason uh

00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:44.270
interpretation that in the no code one the uh cloud and all

00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:49.430
is given by them who told you that cloud is cloud and all is

00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:52.030
given by them anytime you can try to install it and then you

00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:55.130
know uh host it on your own server same goes for even

00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:58.770
autogen autogen gives you two things right so one is a ui

00:51:58.770 --> 00:52:01.230
based approach so where you can just drag and drop and then

00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:04.050
create a agent orchestrated and one is a code based approach

00:52:04.050 --> 00:52:06.710
and in both the approach they say that okay fine go and host

00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:11.050
it on your corporate form okay of your choice so yeah they

00:52:11.050 --> 00:52:14.710
have they have given you like you know this fragility okay

00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:21.270
yeah uh so one more request is regarding uh the production

00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:26.790
part of these agents so we have run in local so this length

00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:30.590
serve and the length we'll come to that so we'll we'll

00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:32.890
discuss about this cloud part right so we'll be talking

00:52:32.890 --> 00:52:35.210
about that we have projects as well so even over there we

00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:38.210
are going to use a lot of agents and over there so obviously

00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:42.410
we have to go to the production right okay just to avoid a

00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:45.350
repetitive class for the same thing uh we're just going in a

00:52:45.350 --> 00:52:48.730
flow simple okay so as per the syllabus that's the reason so

00:52:48.730 --> 00:52:51.990
we have like a syllabus in place right okay yes yes sir but

00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:56.270
actually i'm i'm trying these things so if you can uh on my

00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:58.810
own i'm trying so yeah because see if something is running

00:52:58.810 --> 00:53:01.310
in my local and we have already talked about a lot of like a

00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:05.130
deployment i believe in a past we all know how to send a

00:53:05.130 --> 00:53:08.970
code how to like you know do a docker and then like uh host

00:53:08.970 --> 00:53:11.450
a code maybe on a render or even without docker how to host

00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:14.270
a code on render but yeah we have to talk about these uh

00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:16.850
entire like a production things with respect to major cloud

00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:20.350
platform azure it was in gcp i believe that is also a part

00:53:20.350 --> 00:53:24.850
of your syllabus uh great service just i'm trying on my own

00:53:24.850 --> 00:53:31.170
before that so uh uh actually in our projects uh most of the

00:53:31.170 --> 00:53:36.710
things we are using in terms of the azure azure so is it a

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:44.010
benefit so that we'll see this autogen uh because autogen is

00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:48.150
from microsoft no it's not like that so you will not be able

00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:51.050
to see any kind of a benefit i mean like uh things will not

00:53:51.050 --> 00:53:53.950
happen automatically right you have to do it and the way you

00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:56.130
are going to productionize autogen in the similar manner you

00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:58.090
will be able to recognize even a language based like uh

00:53:58.090 --> 00:54:02.210
things or agents uh on any cloud platform yes see cloud

00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:06.330
gives you just a instance right and then yes i if i can

00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:08.770
productionize like so for autogen they are not going to give

00:54:08.770 --> 00:54:11.250
you any flexibility by the way this is that's the whole

00:54:11.250 --> 00:54:15.450
point okay so one last question is uh sir you in the in the

00:54:15.450 --> 00:54:18.650
lecture you were saying uh this length chain and length

00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:23.530
graph uh i mean uh you're not against it but you said i will

00:54:23.530 --> 00:54:28.390
not prefer this in production so basically yeah so i have

00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:31.750
made one statement saying that that don't just rely on a

00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:34.710
lanchan or a langra because even their founders if you'll go

00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:38.370
and check over the internet they say that that see uh we are

00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:41.450
just like you know giving you a kind of orchestrator so

00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:45.110
don't try to build a whole product just by using me this is

00:54:45.110 --> 00:54:48.590
what even they used to claim that there is a because they

00:54:48.590 --> 00:54:51.470
are doing a lot of developments and again a lot of like you

00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:55.050
know enhancement which is going on it's not that stable

00:54:56.590 --> 00:55:00.030
always say that that okay uh do a double check right do

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:03.110
always a double check uh again if you're if you are sending

00:55:03.110 --> 00:55:06.830
your piece of code into a production uh maybe like that is

00:55:06.830 --> 00:55:10.050
that is going to crash so it's like uh they have just

00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:12.430
advised you and even i have advised you that use it with the

00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:18.410
like a bit be a bit careful when you are trying to use all

00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:20.710
of these frameworks in terms of security in terms of a

00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:26.030
leakage sure sure sir sir so uh can you uh just just a

00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:29.290
personal question your your favorite if you can say your uh

00:55:29.290 --> 00:55:33.570
tested one which is the best uh no code uh code all

00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:37.530
including all of this uh if you can uh tell your because you

00:55:37.530 --> 00:55:40.990
have tested most of this no could i see my preferred choice

00:55:40.990 --> 00:55:44.930
is always n8n even crew is giving you this ui interface

00:55:45.550 --> 00:55:49.310
autogen is also giving you a ui interface a crew ai bit

00:55:49.310 --> 00:55:53.470
immature not bit immature super immature one you can say uh

00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:56.870
even open i have released a agent builder but again i have

00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:59.970
already given my feedback over here yes it will and i have

00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:04.050
also shown you inside a class uh so maybe uh we have it will

00:56:04.050 --> 00:56:06.250
they will take time because same goes with crew they will

00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:09.430
take some time uh again same goes with i would say uh

00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:12.870
autogen no code platform uh they will take some time because

00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:16.770
they have a lot of limitations so you can't build uh any

00:56:16.770 --> 00:56:20.750
production grade automations by using that yes in it in uh

00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:24.610
it's an old company and again it's a company it's automation

00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:29.810
company even before this ai era so i think like they are six

00:56:29.810 --> 00:56:32.610
seven year old company and they have started their company

00:56:32.610 --> 00:56:35.570
with the motto that will do the automation and then when ai

00:56:35.570 --> 00:56:38.470
came into a picture so they have plugged in ai node as well

00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:42.370
that's a whole story so in that way uh if you'll go and

00:56:42.370 --> 00:56:45.790
check all the nodes and intent so they have a very very huge

00:56:45.790 --> 00:56:49.390
you know ecosystem so where they have given you because if

00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:52.230
i'm going with the code i need all the nodes very simple yes

00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:55.970
obviously i won't go and write a code because that will not

00:56:55.970 --> 00:56:59.290
make sense so any 10 so far in a market let's see in the

00:56:59.290 --> 00:57:01.630
future what will happen maybe after one year after two years

00:57:01.630 --> 00:57:05.490
story will change but as we are sitting in november month of

00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:10.290
10 25 so in this month i would say any 10 okay as compared

00:57:10.290 --> 00:57:13.910
to any other framework for a no code now if i'll talk about

00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:18.510
a code based framework uh so crew ai is something which i

00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:22.250
founded it's very very easy in terms of you know uh like uh

00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:26.350
writing a code and creating uh or orchestrating the agent so

00:57:26.590 --> 00:57:29.890
ai you can say it's an easy one so based on ease i'm telling

00:57:29.890 --> 00:57:33.150
you right so it's very easy like create an individual crew

00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:35.410
and then you know attach all of those crew in the sequence

00:57:35.410 --> 00:57:39.810
that you want yes then like uh send it to a production easy

00:57:39.810 --> 00:57:43.470
easy to develop and you know easy to like a maintain so

00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:47.290
that's that's my take but yeah i'm not saying that don't use

00:57:47.290 --> 00:57:50.530
lang chain lang graph for lama yes use all of these things

00:57:50.530 --> 00:57:54.550
but yes evaluate and always try to check that what is your

00:57:54.550 --> 00:57:58.590
expectation are you looking for maybe like some low level

00:57:58.590 --> 00:58:02.750
control accordingly you can select the framework but that's

00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:06.290
my two frame like favorite one thanks thanks a lot sir sir

00:58:06.290 --> 00:58:10.050
and one one last thing regarding 3i uh let's say if you're

00:58:10.050 --> 00:58:13.410
building something so is this the correct approach that we

00:58:13.410 --> 00:58:17.330
build it based on the chat and then download the code from

00:58:17.330 --> 00:58:21.790
there and then tweak it or develop it from uh is this the

00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:26.090
correct approach uh that we can follow build it from a chat

00:58:26.090 --> 00:58:31.830
means i was not able to get it uh uh we we have given a

00:58:31.830 --> 00:58:35.190
prompt and it has developed code no no no i'm not talking

00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:38.750
about that set of a crew ai code based code based okay i'm

00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:40.910
not talking about no code so if you're going with the code

00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:44.730
one forget about that that ui interface and uh no okay okay

00:58:44.730 --> 00:58:48.190
that they have given to you simple install the library and

00:58:48.190 --> 00:58:51.390
then start building one by one one by one on your own that

00:58:51.390 --> 00:58:54.190
that's approach i'm talking about yes yes you have covered

00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:56.530
that as well thanks thanks i think thanks a lot for our

00:58:56.590 --> 00:58:59.210
answering i mean this clears most of my questions thanks a

00:58:59.210 --> 00:59:04.170
lot okay hi sir so elengo uh yeah go ahead oh just one

00:59:04.170 --> 00:59:07.990
question um just one question sir uh sir in the last class

00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:10.750
you have covered uh predominantly you have covered the

00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:15.970
multiple tools as mcp right uh so uh when we issued the

00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:20.250
program how does it identify that right system suppose when

00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:23.730
you ask a question list of the tables when you ask i think i

00:59:23.730 --> 00:59:26.210
have i have given an answer for that as well multiple times

00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:28.910
in the last class itself and i have even given an

00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:32.550
explanation so you must be able to see uh like we are trying

00:59:32.550 --> 00:59:37.610
to basically uh you know list the entire mcp server or list

00:59:37.610 --> 00:59:40.490
the entire tool that we have given right and in every tool

00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:43.170
you will be able to see a description by the way so there is

00:59:43.170 --> 00:59:46.090
a keyword called description and against our descriptions

00:59:46.090 --> 00:59:49.610
there is a write-up that we have mentioned well this would

00:59:49.610 --> 00:59:52.750
be back exactly whatever we typed right this would match

00:59:52.750 --> 00:59:58.850
exactly the not why we are using llms this is where lms

00:59:58.850 --> 01:00:01.150
comes into picture lm can understand us and lm can

01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:03.970
understand even that language or description that we have

01:00:03.970 --> 01:00:07.790
mentioned as a part of list tool list basically right so

01:00:07.790 --> 01:00:11.190
this is where lm comes why it will go and match like exactly

01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:13.890
we are not building a rule-based system over here right

01:00:13.890 --> 01:00:18.350
correct so if there is no any matches and it can build some

01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:22.450
content from uh let's suppose you are asking that okay fine

01:00:22.450 --> 01:00:25.570
go and access my slack and let's suppose slack slack tool is

01:00:25.570 --> 01:00:28.230
not available will come back to you saying that i'm not able

01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:33.010
to find a slack tool yeah yeah correct sounds good yeah and

01:00:33.010 --> 01:00:36.130
uh yeah sir from the second question from the experience

01:00:36.130 --> 01:00:39.370
point of view right sir will you plan to conduct any system

01:00:39.370 --> 01:00:42.090
design course something sir because when we attend the

01:00:42.090 --> 01:00:45.330
interview i can't say anything by the way because as of now

01:00:45.330 --> 01:00:48.790
i i can't say anything i can't give a commitment in future

01:00:48.790 --> 01:00:51.990
obviously but yeah subject to my like a slot availability

01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:57.730
because for now i am like full completely for interview when

01:00:57.730 --> 01:01:00.090
we go for interview more than 12 year experience so they are

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:03.670
expecting that particular areas as of now just just explain

01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:06.270
just explain the project that i have told you i think that

01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:09.250
will be more than enough right let's see how in the future

01:01:09.250 --> 01:01:13.510
we can bring something like that okay yeah thank you sir

01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:17.930
yeah yeah yes that's why i cannot ask you a question now

01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:21.390
yeah go ahead please yeah yeah okay uh then my question is

01:01:21.390 --> 01:01:26.270
uh i need some kind of heads up from you if you have so

01:01:26.590 --> 01:01:33.070
basically i have uh one uh a company small company and they

01:01:33.070 --> 01:01:38.810
and they have a need like they have emails so when the

01:01:38.810 --> 01:01:43.150
emails come and tomorrow next morning the boss comes so he

01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:48.650
wants an agent that can go through his emails and this and

01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:55.010
provide him uh that okay what he should respond and so uh

01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:59.150
how do i go about developing this just if you can provide me

01:01:59.150 --> 01:02:02.990
some heads up so then i can go i think email access system

01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:05.250
we have already built it right it's the last class itself

01:02:05.250 --> 01:02:10.830
yeah i think we built something but can it go ahead and then

01:02:10.830 --> 01:02:15.250
compile all the go through all the emails and then uh

01:02:17.110 --> 01:02:21.030
so same same system same system you can try to use exact

01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:24.450
same thing so we have already built that mcp uh so same

01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:27.430
thing same thing you can try to use it for a response so if

01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:31.810
you'll go and check that mcp uh so we have already created a

01:02:31.810 --> 01:02:35.130
tool inside that even to send you a message it's already

01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:39.170
there by the way now sometime right it's not something i

01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:42.330
would say let's suppose uh like i have to build an

01:02:42.330 --> 01:02:45.990
improvised version of the same system where it is supposed

01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:49.730
to understand my business and then it should respond because

01:02:49.730 --> 01:02:52.810
see lm will give a generic response as per its own knowledge

01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:56.950
right so in that case we have also discussed about a system

01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:59.970
yeah we have already discussed about allergy kind of a

01:02:59.970 --> 01:03:03.170
system even in the same example the last class example

01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:06.190
itself we will go and check so we had given a database

01:03:06.190 --> 01:03:09.590
access as well we have connected our mongodb we have

01:03:09.590 --> 01:03:13.950
connected our sql databases right so let's suppose uh like

01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:17.470
uh someone has asked me a question with respect to my

01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:21.190
company let's suppose right that okay so try to give me all

01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:25.250
of the detail uh with respect to your own consulting right

01:03:25.250 --> 01:03:28.270
try to give the detail with respect you're on consulting or

01:03:28.270 --> 01:03:35.530
uh let me give you a exact example of this so for example we

01:03:35.530 --> 01:03:38.390
have this whatsapp system i believe people are using it

01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:41.930
people have given uh many good feedback about this uri ai

01:03:41.930 --> 01:03:45.950
system now we have integrated ai over here with uri ai the

01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:48.130
real system the whatsapp system that we all are using right

01:03:48.130 --> 01:03:54.310
but we have also integrated our whole database now if i'm

01:03:54.310 --> 01:03:58.350
going to ask a question that tell me the latest course uh

01:03:58.350 --> 01:04:03.610
latest course launch on your own right again like uh

01:04:03.610 --> 01:04:06.690
spelling a lot of spelling mistake and all those things it's

01:04:06.690 --> 01:04:11.770
llm lm will be able to understand so here uh again see uh so

01:04:11.770 --> 01:04:14.750
20 full stack automation yesterday itself we have launched

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:17.150
it right yesterday itself we have like a published this

01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:19.550
course and yeah so by the time we have published this course

01:04:19.550 --> 01:04:22.150
it is able to understand and see just telling me that okay

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:24.110
this is the latest course that has been launched and which

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:26.570
is going to start full stack automation bootcamp so let's go

01:04:26.570 --> 01:04:26.890
ahead and let's go ahead and see what happens so let's go

01:04:26.890 --> 01:04:28.510
ahead and see what happens now this is not coming from a lm

01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:31.350
by the way right this is coming from where my database yeah

01:04:31.350 --> 01:04:34.870
now can i say that mail is something like that so we have

01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:38.490
already built a system so where i can uh like you know uh

01:04:38.490 --> 01:04:42.370
send a reply over the mail just like a whatsapp mail is also

01:04:42.370 --> 01:04:46.610
like request response kind of a system right so and uh again

01:04:46.610 --> 01:04:50.490
so it is supposed to respond with respect to my knowledge or

01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:53.810
my company's like uh you know data that we have just like

01:04:53.810 --> 01:04:56.870
this one and in some of the cases for example it will give

01:04:56.870 --> 01:05:02.010
me a 10 python for loop example right now this is not

01:05:02.010 --> 01:05:04.070
related to my company by the way this equation is not

01:05:04.070 --> 01:05:06.370
related to my company so what it will do it will use a lm

01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:10.530
capability yeah so basically you need this kind of a system

01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:14.350
and we have already talked about this kind of a system very

01:05:14.350 --> 01:05:18.250
good very good no i got all the ideas from you i understand

01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:23.050
now yeah so basically this is just give access to your reg

01:05:23.050 --> 01:05:25.650
system if you are storing something into sorry if you are

01:05:25.650 --> 01:05:28.930
storing something into the vector databases otherwise give

01:05:28.930 --> 01:05:31.370
access to your mongodb otherwise give access to your sql

01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:34.510
databases or any other databases and we have already like uh

01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:38.230
we already have a ready to use code in our previous class so

01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:44.050
yeah this company is a law company is it's a law firm and

01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:50.790
and he said that okay he will help me creating a creating a

01:05:50.790 --> 01:05:54.650
product which will be mature product and used the real life

01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:56.570
by all the law for which we live in our own affairs so he's

01:05:56.570 --> 01:06:00.290
saying that we can need need to be used by all the law firms

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:04.230
can use that product so so he said that okay one of the

01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:07.730
thing will be the agent but uh you are right the agent

01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:12.850
cannot be just uh uh standalone like this until unless we

01:06:12.850 --> 01:06:16.590
have the rank system because the data not just the system i

01:06:16.590 --> 01:06:19.110
would say everywhere access them is not required right so

01:06:19.110 --> 01:06:22.370
unnecessarily whenever we see agents right under agentic

01:06:22.370 --> 01:06:24.890
things so we say that okay fine give access to rack system i

01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:27.970
am against that again so like this is not my style of

01:06:27.970 --> 01:06:31.570
designing the architecture i like observe and then uh for

01:06:31.570 --> 01:06:34.610
example maybe i have to pull a data from my databases our

01:06:34.610 --> 01:06:37.670
database is postgres sql which is sitting on aws cluster

01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:41.750
right i'm just like fetching it from there it's fine i have

01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:45.170
built my agent so which will go to my like you know uh my

01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:47.790
postgres uh database and then from there it is trying to

01:06:47.790 --> 01:06:50.130
fire the query and then from there it is trying to bring the

01:06:50.130 --> 01:06:53.790
data and it's very quick right it's very very quick anyone

01:06:53.790 --> 01:06:56.490
can come and test it because the public system that we have

01:06:56.490 --> 01:07:00.990
created uh so yeah i mean like every time like we should not

01:07:00.990 --> 01:07:05.390
say that okay fine rag system or this system or that system

01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:09.070
it depends upon my requirement and this is how i think we

01:07:09.070 --> 01:07:13.450
all should design the architecture of the project thank you

01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:19.490
yeah okay now uh yeah yeah go ahead i'll go yeah i have

01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:25.070
under the we have we are discussing about the uh rack

01:07:25.070 --> 01:07:28.810
concept when you go for the rack concept we will uh check

01:07:28.810 --> 01:07:32.510
the file so in the vector db then semantic search we will

01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:37.490
bring the data when we in the last uh class we add the mcb

01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:41.710
protocol right in that one we are connecting the database um

01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:46.410
uh how rag is also your rag is also your database right so

01:07:46.410 --> 01:07:50.470
what is f a i s s what is a chroma db what is a pine cone

01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:55.490
what is a quadrant yes yes the structural database

01:07:55.490 --> 01:08:00.910
structural uh i mean like we discussed about mongo db as

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:03.490
well mongo db was not yeah yes yes we we were discussing

01:08:03.490 --> 01:08:09.130
mongo db um and also the even even with respect to rag so

01:08:09.130 --> 01:08:13.610
what we do we fire a query right in our ll nlp i mean like

01:08:13.610 --> 01:08:16.030
in a natural language we fire a query and then it will try

01:08:16.030 --> 01:08:18.350
to go and do the semantic search bring the data and then

01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:21.090
send it to the llms and lm try to structure it and then you

01:08:21.090 --> 01:08:24.730
will see the response this is how ragflow works yeah there

01:08:24.730 --> 01:08:28.670
we are doing that um vectoring then go and bring the data

01:08:28.670 --> 01:08:31.870
here in the mcp we are not doing these things we are

01:08:31.870 --> 01:08:35.090
connecting no no no no i think i think i think you

01:08:35.090 --> 01:08:38.650
misunderstood the entire whole mcp concept mcp is nothing

01:08:38.650 --> 01:08:42.250
but just a protocol it is not like related to rig or maybe

01:08:42.250 --> 01:08:46.410
llm or something it's calling a tool by the way so go and

01:08:46.410 --> 01:08:49.230
watch the same lecture try to execute a same example which

01:08:49.230 --> 01:08:51.850
is already discussed try to attach your email id and then

01:08:51.850 --> 01:08:54.590
your databases yes you will be able to get a real real

01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:58.130
understanding i believe you have uh maybe just yeah i got i

01:08:58.130 --> 01:09:01.630
under i got no no you haven't you haven't got anything

01:09:01.630 --> 01:09:03.950
basically right when you ask this question you haven't got

01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:08.670
technically mcp is just a protocol right okay i can give an

01:09:08.670 --> 01:09:11.430
access to rag the way i have given access to my five systems

01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:17.410
okay simple yeah i mean like uh it's a protocol i try to

01:09:17.410 --> 01:09:20.110
understand and it's not a correct comparison by the way it's

01:09:20.110 --> 01:09:23.670
a protocol simple just like a http protocol we were using

01:09:23.670 --> 01:09:27.230
since a very long time uh okay but when i connect with the

01:09:27.230 --> 01:09:31.010
gmail how is go and get that into the relevant information

01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:35.110
executing adding any extra code when they connect with the

01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:41.350
gmail right is it is it okay you have not gone through the

01:09:41.350 --> 01:09:44.170
class please go through the class execute and connect

01:09:44.170 --> 01:09:46.550
connect your gmail see you will not be able to understand

01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:49.270
you are using my gmail credentials which is already

01:09:49.270 --> 01:09:52.490
mentioned use use your gmail credential execute it and then

01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:55.650
come back to me believe me your question will be gone okay

01:09:55.650 --> 01:10:00.310
okay i know one more things uh when i see the framework this

01:10:00.310 --> 01:10:04.250
is a land graph and uh agentic development kit in the google

01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:09.470
uh so do we need to learn both things or which one is uh you

01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:11.090
should know you should know as per the current market

01:10:11.090 --> 01:10:13.390
situation yes you are supposed to be aware about all of

01:10:13.390 --> 01:10:16.110
these things because you never know what interviewer is

01:10:16.110 --> 01:10:19.770
going to ask and what framework other company is using and

01:10:19.770 --> 01:10:21.430
it's not that different um it's very very difficult i mean

01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:24.130
like theoretically all these frameworks are same i would say

01:10:24.130 --> 01:10:26.550
in a practical manner so obviously it's a different library

01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:29.670
so they have like a different different like a feature

01:10:29.670 --> 01:10:34.210
inside that one but yes you should know everything okay and

01:10:34.210 --> 01:10:37.850
one more thing when you go for the structural database do we

01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:42.750
need to maintain if if you need to connect with the like

01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:46.370
mysql or anything like a structure database do we need to do

01:10:46.370 --> 01:10:50.710
the vector vectoring for all the data no no why because we

01:10:50.710 --> 01:10:50.710
saved the data and then we use the data and then do the rest

01:10:50.710 --> 01:10:52.450
of it so like in the the i mean like uh here we are not

01:10:52.450 --> 01:10:54.390
doing a vectoring see we are getting a result in a fraction

01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:56.930
of seconds we have not done the vectoring i have designed

01:10:56.930 --> 01:10:59.450
the system right and i have not done the vectoring over here

01:10:59.450 --> 01:11:04.010
i'm directly hitting my sql db so we will so for example

01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:08.470
when you go for the calculations for some certain uh um

01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:15.050
result expectation uh how it will can be we do doing to me

01:11:15.050 --> 01:11:20.010
uh create separate tool or to maintain the calculation part

01:11:20.010 --> 01:11:25.610
in the recording or how it will either or the llm will only

01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:28.030
one thing let me let me give you one feedback you have not

01:11:28.030 --> 01:11:30.250
executed any example that i have discussed throughout the

01:11:30.250 --> 01:11:34.050
class i can see that right please go ahead and discuss

01:11:34.050 --> 01:11:37.630
because like i can see like you don't have a practical like

01:11:37.630 --> 01:11:40.610
exposure to any of these please go ahead and execute all

01:11:40.610 --> 01:11:43.790
those projects which i have discussed since a day zero right

01:11:43.930 --> 01:11:47.190
okay then then come to class and ask the question because i

01:11:47.190 --> 01:11:50.690
don't see a valid question in your questions basically right

01:11:50.690 --> 01:11:55.370
basically what i can see is that you have uh like

01:11:55.370 --> 01:11:58.490
misunderstanding about a very basic concept which is

01:11:58.490 --> 01:12:04.210
required again okay okay yeah do it yeah do it and then come

01:12:04.210 --> 01:12:07.130
back to me and then i'll answer all of your questions okay

01:12:07.130 --> 01:12:09.810
maybe maybe you won't ask these questions your question set

01:12:09.810 --> 01:12:14.630
will change by the way okay okay okay yeah uh next one is

01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:17.770
okay hital is saying uh sir can we uh integrate a multiple

01:12:17.770 --> 01:12:21.090
database in chat application like one have pine cone yeah i

01:12:21.090 --> 01:12:23.870
think that we have done with respect to mcp last class

01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:27.350
itself uh so multiple means you can ten hundred thousand

01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:30.570
whatever you want it's your wish you can do it right that is

01:12:30.570 --> 01:12:34.610
pretty much possible we have already done that right uh next

01:12:34.610 --> 01:12:39.700
one is yeah asit please go ahead with the question yeah good

01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:47.600
morning uh yeah yeah yes just uh uh first is uh can help you

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:51.220
to understand what is when we use the mcp and when we use

01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:58.820
the a2a uh see mcp you can try to use it so wherever uh for

01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:02.960
example uh some i have built my ai right for example i have

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:05.780
built my uri system let me explain in that way so i have

01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:10.060
built my uri system and uh here inside a uri system so i am

01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:13.400
telling you that that okay so when you are trying to chat i

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:16.940
have given you uh basically provision so where you can come

01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:21.040
and you can try to attach your own tool same if i'll talk

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:25.400
about open ai so let me open up a chat gpt by the way right

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:30.320
and if you will go to chat gpt this is a chat gpt right and

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:33.620
if you will go here and if you will go to its setting by the

01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:37.520
way so here you will be able to see something called as a

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:41.580
connection interface personalization account yeah so here

01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:44.500
you will be able to find out the uh connection are you

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:47.580
sharing something okay okay i think yeah i'm sharing

01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:53.180
something i'm not so uh literally when i uh uh finding this

01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:57.980
mcp is a model context protocol right uh yes it means uh the

01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:02.480
context of one model llms if i'm using multiple uh model so

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:06.200
one model context how can you pass to the next model uh is

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:11.300
that my understanding is correct uh no i would say uh

01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:15.940
correct me correct me yeah so basically mcp is something

01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:18.260
okay let me let me show you i think my screen is visible

01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:22.060
right no i think i'm not sharing my screen okay let me share

01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:25.540
my screen i'll give you a very simple understanding uh so

01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:29.560
for example i'm using chat gpt right i'm using some other

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:33.800
llms by the way yeah now chat gpt will try to give me an

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:37.020
answer based on chat gpt's understanding so whatever like

01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:39.320
question i'm going to ask if chat gpt understands it is

01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:43.180
going to give me the answer now chat gpt will not be able to

01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:46.920
give me an answer if I am asking some question with respect

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:49.640
to my personal data. For example, if you will go to chatgpt

01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:53.220
.com and if you are going to ask a question that, okay, so

01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:57.460
what was a recent release on a Euron? The way I have asked

01:14:57.460 --> 01:15:00.480
to this WhatsApp, right? The way I have asked to this

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:03.660
WhatsApp, if you will go and ask a same question that tell

01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:06.400
me the latest course launch from a Euron, chatgpt will not

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:09.180
be able to give you an answer. If you are going to ask a

01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:12.980
chat... Yes, so that problem was solved using the RAG,

01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:18.740
right? No, so see RAG is something... So, let me come to the

01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:23.860
conclusion, not RAG. So, here, this is a third-party

01:15:23.860 --> 01:15:26.560
platform. Just look into this URL. This is a third-party

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:30.040
platform, right? It is a chatgpt platform. Now, similarly,

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:33.700
there is a PopXLT. Similarly, there is a CloudA, right?

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:36.680
Where they are providing you a Sonet model. Similarly, there

01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:40.900
is a Gemini. Similarly, there can be any number of a system

01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:43.660
because every company is trying to build something like this

01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:46.100
kind of app. They are trying to bring the entire company

01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:52.120
structure into a simple chat window. Now, how this system is

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:58.260
going to allow you to integrate your functionality? If

01:15:58.260 --> 01:16:02.340
chatgpt has to give an answer from your database or maybe to

01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:05.720
interact with your, I would say, Gmail or maybe interact

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:10.040
with your calendar. So, chatgpt should allow you by

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:14.900
provisioning something. Agree? Yes. Yes? How you will be

01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:18.220
able to integrate? So, generally, when we have to establish

01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:21.200
a system for some communication, so what kind of a protocol

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:26.380
we have been using so far or maybe in the beginning of the

01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:29.040
class, what we have done? So, can I say that we have created

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:34.120
an API? Yeah. And we say that, okay, fine. So, anyone who is

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:37.100
going to consume this API, so they will be able to access my

01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:39.480
system. I think this is what kind of a statement we have

01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:42.360
made and we have seen those examples, right? Yes. Now, how

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:46.300
this LLM will be able to access my function, my system,

01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:50.200
right? So, keeping that in mind, they have created a

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:53.820
provision. They have created basically a set of the rule,

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:57.740
technically a protocol. And that name of that particular

01:16:57.740 --> 01:17:03.980
rule is what? MCP, right? So, that you can simply go over

01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:07.920
here, go to a setting and then you can try to go to apps and

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:11.520
connection and then all of these are MCPs, right? Yes. So,

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:15.360
here, then how it is different than APIs? Yes. Yes. Yes.

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:17.760
Yes. You're doing the... API also doing the same thing.

01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:20.520
Exactly. Then why do the MCP? So, basically... So, just

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:23.820
I'm... This is also I have answered already in my previous

01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:28.540
class. So, see, MCPs are technically calling a tool. API

01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:31.120
means what? One function, one API. It means one endpoint,

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:35.340
right? One URL, yeah? Another function, another URL. But if

01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:38.120
you will see the code base that we have already discussed in

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:42.120
my previous class. So, here we are trying to give a

01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:46.180
multiple, right? A multiple, like a... Functions access

01:17:46.180 --> 01:17:50.040
to... Or we are trying to bind multiple functions in one

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:55.240
single list. Yeah? Now, my chat system... So, MCP is

01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:59.100
allowing me to, you know, search for a particular tool. So,

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:02.400
basically, it is allowing me to take an input as a chat,

01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:05.640
right? So, basically, this protocol is being designed in

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:08.980
such a way that it is allowing me to take an input in a form

01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:12.620
of chat. NLP, by the way, right? In a particular format.

01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:15.660
Search through the entire list of the tool, which is

01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:21.380
available to me. And then select our best one. Okay. Yes?

01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:23.780
So, that is the reason. So, we have... Orchestrating.

01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:26.040
Orchestrating it is. Finding out which is the best tool for

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:28.300
this. Technically, yes. Orchestration. And this is what we

01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:31.340
have done in my, like, previous class, right? Yeah, we did.

01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:36.300
New conversation. Now, let me open up. So, here, we have

01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:41.820
already seen that we... Okay. Cloud will return soon. Okay.

01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:44.780
Maybe it's some technical issue. Yeah, they are facing...

01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:48.420
It's a cloud. So, basically, you must have seen that we have

01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:51.520
attached a multiple tool in one single MCP connection

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:54.560
itself, right? So, technically, we have created three. But

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:57.160
in three, so almost more than 20 plus tool attachment we

01:18:57.160 --> 01:19:00.800
have done. And technically, it is trying to explore. But,

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:03.140
yeah. So, on a very high level, if someone is going to ask

01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:06.860
me a question, like, what is MCP? Simple. Giving my system

01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:10.700
access to any LLM is like where MCP comes into picture. That

01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:13.860
would be my answer. Got it. Got it. And how is different

01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:17.440
than... Not easy. Now, you have asked me one more question.

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:19.980
I'll come to A2A. So, you have asked me one more question

01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:24.180
with respect to RAG, right? See, RAG is just a storage.

01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:30.020
Simple. Just like we have been doing a storage into SQL

01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:33.940
databases or maybe a NoSQL databases. Similarly, so we are

01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:36.720
trying to do a storage into a vector databases. We have been

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:40.840
firing a query on a SQL database since ages, right? And we

01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:43.880
are able to fire a query even on NoSQL databases, MongoDB,

01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:47.060
Cassandra. Like a databases even now. Yeah. Now, with

01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:49.360
respect to vector databases, what we are doing? We are

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:51.780
firing a query, right? Yes. Nature of query is what? My

01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:56.700
natural language. And also, it's giving me the context. No,

01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:59.400
no. I mean, like, see, that's a property of the database.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:02.400
SQL database is having its own property. It will go do a

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:05.060
sequential search. And then, if you are looking for a joint

01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:07.020
operation, group operation, it will do all those joint

01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:09.100
operation, group operation, give you the result. Now, that

01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:12.220
is a property of the database, right? In case of, basically,

01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:14.740
in case of a MongoDB, so, it's a property of the database

01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:17.920
that it allows you document-based search, right? So, it's a

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:20.520
property of a vector database that it is allowing you a

01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:23.780
semantic-based search. Yes. Yeah. Cosine similarity-based

01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:25.680
search. So, it is going to, that is a property. But

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:29.860
technically, if I'll talk about a RG system, so, it is using

01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:32.980
a vector database and RG system is nothing but whenever I'll

01:20:32.980 --> 01:20:36.200
fire a query. So, instead of hitting an LLM, for example,

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:38.520
this model directly, what it will do? So, it will basically

01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:42.380
go to my database and then it will try to like, you know,

01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:45.200
search the result. Based on my natural language, whatever

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:48.060
query which I have asked, right? For example, I am building

01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:50.980
same system. For example, this system, where it is supposed

01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:54.360
to give an answer with respect to Euron, yeah, is that same

01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:57.540
system. So, based on my query, it will, instead of hitting

01:20:57.540 --> 01:21:00.400
my, you know, LLM directly, what it will do? It will go to

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:03.380
my database and vector database, let's suppose. In a vector

01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:05.500
database, I have stored all those results. So, it will try

01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:09.700
to search and whatever will be the result. So, it will try

01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:13.300
to bring, give it to LLM again. Okay. So, that LLM will be

01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:16.200
able. To structure it, right? Yes. LLM will be able to

01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:18.560
structure it and then it will show me the result. So, that

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:22.940
is a flow basically RAG follows. So, wherever I want an

01:21:22.940 --> 01:21:29.600
answer from my data, yeah, from my data. So, in that case, I

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:33.720
can try to use a RAG based approach from my data, not a

01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:37.240
system I am talking about, from my data. So, after learning

01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:40.660
this agent, right? So, now through agents, we can even call

01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:45.100
the APIs, right? You can call APIs. You can call MCPs. You

01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:48.360
can call your RAG system. So, if I am able to call the APIs,

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:53.500
I can call to my any database? Yes, exactly. Yes. Yes. Now,

01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:59.560
do we need the RAG then? Yes. So, see, I told you, right? I

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:03.640
think we misunderstood a system like a RAG system. It's a

01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:08.300
matching system. In case of your SQL database. So,

01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:11.220
basically, SQL database will try to do a sequential search,

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:14.520
right? And in terms of doing a similarity. So, it is having

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:17.380
its own limitation, right? It's having its own bottleneck.

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:21.460
Think always RAG as a kind of a system. So, where we are

01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:25.540
doing a search based on like a similarity or NLP search we

01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:28.760
are doing. Yeah, then it will be database, right? Vector DB,

01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:32.920
right? Actually, the backbone of RAG is actually a vector

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:35.840
DB. Without vector DB, RAG is nothing technically. Yeah. So,

01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:39.300
if I connect to API, to vector DB, then I don't need RAG.

01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:42.760
Just connect with it. I'm just connecting the dots. Okay,

01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:45.520
fine. So, let's suppose you are hitting like a vector

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:48.460
database with the help of API. That's okay. And then it will

01:22:48.460 --> 01:22:51.420
give you a result, right? Huh. Now, where you will pass that

01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:58.150
result? Or maybe you will... To LLM. Yeah. So, in a RAG also

01:22:58.150 --> 01:23:00.950
two parts. One is indexing. One is retrieval. In the

01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:02.870
retrieval, we will connect to the LLM. Here, we will connect

01:23:02.870 --> 01:23:05.650
to the LLM. Right? Yeah. Let's imagine this situation. So,

01:23:05.690 --> 01:23:07.830
you said that you have an API. It will hit the vector

01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:11.070
databases. Now, it will try to give you a response. Agree?

01:23:11.250 --> 01:23:14.270
Yeah? Now, what will be your next step? So, what you will

01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:15.390
do? What will be that response?

01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:23.720
Yeah. That response I pass to the user. Okay. Either you

01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:27.160
will try to pass that raw response to the user. Or maybe you

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:29.600
will try to pass to the LLM. So, that you know, it will be

01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:32.700
able to rephrase it. Right? Yes. Yes. Technically, we are

01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:39.320
doing RAG. Huh. We are doing RAG. Right? Yeah. So, yeah.

01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:42.460
Technically, we are doing RAG. So, RAG is nothing but it's a

01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:45.700
concept. Retrieval Augmented Generation. It's just a

01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:48.800
concept. How you are achieving... How you are designing your

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:54.200
RAG, it all depends upon you. As simple as that. If

01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:56.760
retrieval... Retrieval means you are going to vector

01:23:56.760 --> 01:24:00.020
databases. Augmented means... So, you are trying to like

01:24:00.020 --> 01:24:02.600
fetch it and then give it to the LLMs. And then LLMs is

01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:06.320
going to generate the final response. That's RAG. Right?

01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:09.560
Now, I am trying to hit my vector database with the help of

01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:16.380
APIs. Okay. Not an issue at all. Right? Yeah. Yeah. So, RAG

01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:19.800
is a fundamental... It's a concept. A2A is what concept? MCP

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:23.620
is a what concept, basically. It's a theory. So, by using

01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:26.680
agents, those things can be achieved also. There is an

01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:30.140
alternative way. Yes. You can use agent. You can create a

01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:33.680
MCP. Technically, MCP will call some tool. Right? Or maybe

01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:37.540
APIs. As you said, APIs. So, MCP will call APIs. Right? And

01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:40.380
with the help of MCP, it will try to fetch all of those

01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:43.620
results from somewhere. So, you can use any kind of agent.

01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:46.740
You can try to create your own MCP server. And then your

01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:50.360
MCP... It will call. Anything is like fine. But yeah, if you

01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:53.240
are retrieving something from vector DB, that is technically

01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:57.200
a RAG. Now, if you are calling it with the help of agent,

01:24:57.260 --> 01:25:00.940
agent means auto call. Auto call. Yeah. This is the meaning

01:25:00.940 --> 01:25:03.360
of agent. Right? It will go for the auto call. So,

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:07.140
technically, it will be called as a agentic RAG. People have

01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:10.320
given a name to it as a agentic RAG. Yeah. Okay. But

01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:12.860
technically, it's the same thing that you are doing. Yeah.

01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:18.800
Thank you. And the MCP and this A2A. So... This is also A2A

01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:21.080
protocol, right? A2A protocol. Both are the protocols,

01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:24.500
right? So, how is that different? Yeah. So, see, I told you

01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:26.760
about the MCP, right? So, let's suppose this LLM is

01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:30.040
expecting me to, you know, this LLM, chat GPT, is expecting

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:33.780
me to, like, access some of my system. So, MCP is a

01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:37.100
protocol, right? By which... Because they have created MCP

01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:39.260
and they said that, okay, fine. So, create your own MCP,

01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:42.480
attach it with me. And they have provisioned it. And again,

01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:44.820
everyone is trying to do it so that, you know, things will

01:25:44.820 --> 01:25:47.480
be easy. Anyone can give any system access. Anyone can give

01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:50.580
any system access to anyone. Now, A2A. A2A is nothing but

01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:53.900
it's, again, an orchestration framework. So, wherever I have

01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:56.740
to do or I have to establish a communication between

01:25:56.740 --> 01:26:00.500
multiple agents, not just one. So, between a multiple agent,

01:26:00.660 --> 01:26:05.520
in that case, I can go ahead with an A2A protocol so that it

01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:08.380
will be able to... And that too in a heterogeneous system.

01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:11.400
For example, in a LAN chain itself, by using LAN chain or

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:14.540
maybe by using crew AI, right? I have created 10 agents,

01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:19.340
right? In LAN chain itself. Then I don't even need A2A.

01:26:19.420 --> 01:26:22.060
Because LAN chain itself provides you a multi-agent

01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:25.240
communication. Their library is having that capability,

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:29.340
right? Now, let's suppose crew AI. I have created 10-20

01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:33.180
agents. Fine? For like a different kind of purposes. I don't

01:26:33.180 --> 01:26:36.780
need A2A over there. Because crew AI itself provides you a

01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:40.460
multi-agent orchestration, right? Yeah, and A10 also. Same

01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:44.440
goes with everyone. So, where I need then A2A. Exactly.

01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:47.860
Yeah, coming to that point. Now, so basically... What I have

01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:51.300
done... So, basically, I have a big team or maybe a small

01:26:51.300 --> 01:26:56.540
team. One team is using LAN chain. One team is using crew

01:26:56.540 --> 01:27:01.320
AI. One team is using autogen. Autogen, right? Heterogeneous

01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:04.280
system. Yeah. So, 10 agents they have created, 20 agents

01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:07.020
they have created, and 30 agents they have created. Oh,

01:27:07.020 --> 01:27:09.400
heterogeneous system. Got it. Yeah. So, basically, it became

01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:13.920
a heterogeneous system. And basically, like I... Now, so LAN

01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:17.560
chain provides a multi-agent orchestration. Only in LAN

01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:20.780
chain, right? Crew AI provides only in crew AI. And autogen

01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:25.060
provides only in autogen. But my problem is how to establish

01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:28.420
a communication between these two when all of these agents

01:27:28.420 --> 01:27:32.620
framework, which my team has... So, one approach is convert

01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:36.040
every agent into one framework, right? But as your team will

01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:39.560
grow and there will be a fight that no, my is best, my is

01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:41.760
best, I can't do it. Or again, there will be a headache,

01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:44.480
right? Converting this 20-30 because technically you are

01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:47.460
rewriting the entire code base, right? Yeah. Got it. Now,

01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:51.760
you can use what? You can use one big umbrella on top of it.

01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:56.200
And that big umbrella is called as A2A. Use A2A library and

01:27:56.200 --> 01:28:00.500
now it will allow you to communicate between LAN chain, crew

01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:05.920
AI, autogen. Very simple. Yeah. One more thing. When I

01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:10.020
exploring this, there is one more protocol is ACP. Agent

01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:13.500
Communication Protocol. So, this is by IBM, right? So, I

01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:17.080
mean... Wait for some... Wait for some... Sometime people

01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:20.260
are like... People are going crazy after AI. They are doing

01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:25.480
anything. Okay. So, this is one. Okay. There are a lot more

01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:29.060
questions, but I won't take your much time. Sometimes I

01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:33.160
message you. And I also share you one thing I achieved last

01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:36.940
two months. So, I will tell you. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Thank

01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:41.180
you. Thank you. Okay. Yeah. Narish, please go ahead with the

01:28:41.180 --> 01:28:45.620
question. Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Yeah. Good morning. Go

01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:49.840
ahead, please. So, I don't have a question, actually. I have

01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:54.880
a suggestion. Okay. So, we have built MCP and locally we are

01:28:54.880 --> 01:29:00.060
able to access it, our system. Right now, I am trying to

01:29:00.060 --> 01:29:03.860
expose it and access it in NIT and as you showed in chat

01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:08.480
GPT, we can connect our own MCP servers in chat GPT. Yes.

01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:11.720
Yeah. So, I was trying that, but, you know, facing a lot of

01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:15.080
issues because I am going through the document and any...

01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:18.140
So, you are not... Technically, you are not able to do it.

01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:21.100
Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. We will see if we can discuss something

01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:25.660
with respect to hosting of this MCPs as a SSC. Fine? Yeah.

01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:31.340
Okay. Fine. Got it. Yeah. Thank you, sir. Yeah. Okay. Anil,

01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:35.060
go ahead, please, with the question. I was just hearing for

01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:36.580
your conversation that you are telling the difference

01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:41.120
between RAG, MCP, where you are using it. Understood. So, I

01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:44.500
got the point. The point, my question was that MCP, you have

01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:46.340
done it. So, you are exposing. You are exposing your

01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:49.800
personal data or you are exposing your function as a tool to

01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:54.020
the CloudA. Now, the question here is that now CloudA, since

01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:56.840
you have installed it or pre-installed the CloudA or you

01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:59.520
installed it locally, you have done it. But similarly, and

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:03.260
you deployed MCP or exposed MCP here. But today, you have

01:30:03.260 --> 01:30:08.120
exposed CloudA. How can we expose to other tools like

01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:14.020
ChatGPT or anything? Or MCP there? ChatGPT has already given

01:30:14.020 --> 01:30:17.900
you a provision. See, it depends upon... Like a tool which

01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:20.540
has given you a provision. So, this is my ChatGPT. See, I

01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:23.440
have opened ChatGPT itself. Now, click over here. Go to a

01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:26.620
setting. Click on apps and connectors. And then here, come

01:30:26.620 --> 01:30:28.880
to a developer mode, advanced setting. Enable a developer

01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:31.480
mode. Now, once you are going to enable a developer mode,

01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:33.820
you will be able to see this button. Before that, you won't.

01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:36.840
All of... Actually, this Booking.com, Canva, Coursera,

01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:39.900
Spotify, Expedia that you are able to see, right? It's

01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:43.200
actually a MCP exposure. So, here, if you have to expose

01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:46.100
your own, so click on create. Now, here, you will be... You

01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:48.960
will be able to get a MCP server URL. So, create your own

01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:52.940
MCP. Host it as a SSC, basically. And system send event,

01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:56.640
basically. This is the full form of SSC. And just give a

01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:59.500
URL, your own URL over here. So, I have done that. I have

01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:02.540
done that for a couple of my MCPs already with the ChatGPT.

01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:05.560
So, just give your URL over here. Simple. Give a name, any

01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:08.640
kind of a description. Create. Done. So, in that case, you

01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:11.160
are saying we need not change anything from the code of MCP

01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:13.520
exposure? No, we are not changing anything. So, we are just

01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:15.920
like, you know, hosting it somewhere on a cloud. And...

01:31:16.100 --> 01:31:18.680
Exposing it as a SSC. And then, like, just pasting a URL

01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:21.740
over there. That's it. It will be able to access. Okay.

01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:25.220
Second question is that in CloudA, you showed that everyone,

01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:28.440
like individual, everyone who exposed the MCP in your local

01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:32.140
system. And they are able to do individually. But if you are

01:31:32.140 --> 01:31:34.920
deployed, how can I see? I mean, it should be deployed in

01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:38.000
some server. Basically, see. If I have deployed it, so I

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.160
have to share the URL. Otherwise, you won't be able to see

01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:43.600
it. And let's suppose if something is working in my CloudA,

01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:46.520
in my local system, in my local setup, right? You won't be

01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:49.960
able to use it. So, basically, it's MCP has been created

01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:53.380
with the personalization. See, to make your system

01:31:53.380 --> 01:31:56.600
personalize that, okay, I want to expose my own system. That

01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:59.940
was the whole idea. Now, on a company label, if you have to

01:31:59.940 --> 01:32:02.520
do it, let's suppose you have created one server, right? So,

01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:05.740
where some... See, my mail is my mail. My calendar is my

01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:07.580
calendar, right? But let's suppose I'm talking about

01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:10.720
database. Or generic data or some weather.com or something

01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:13.140
you created. Technically, my database is not my database.

01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:15.640
It's a company's database, right? Right. So, let's

01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:17.940
suppose... There are 10 people who would like to use it. So,

01:32:18.020 --> 01:32:21.300
I have created a MCP. Now, what I will do, I'll create this

01:32:21.300 --> 01:32:25.180
kind of a URL. Simple, right? I'll try to create this kind

01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:29.160
of a URL, SSC URL. I'll try to give a SSC URL. So, anyone

01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:31.720
who will be having this authorization for this URL and then

01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:34.020
maybe I can try to secure it. Secure it with the help of

01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:37.640
auth, password basically, right? Maybe API auth basically. I

01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:40.620
can try to expose it. And then I can share it with you. I

01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:43.800
can share it with any other stakeholder of mine, right? So,

01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:46.600
now, when they are using a GPT or something... They will

01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:49.000
just try to paste the URL, sign in and then they will be

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:52.240
able to use the database. Simple. Okay. So, tell me if I'm

01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:54.000
wrong or I'm picking wrong, correct or wrong. Suppose,

01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:56.220
you're on... We have your neuron, right? You create,

01:32:56.280 --> 01:32:59.700
developed an MCP in your local system. You expose that URL,

01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:04.300
what you were telling, right? If you put that in the neuron,

01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:07.780
everyone can see it, right? Yes. Yeah. So, everyone can see

01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:10.420
it. If I'm going to put it over there, everyone can see it.

01:33:10.660 --> 01:33:13.780
Actually, I don't know how many of you remember. But...

01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:18.860
Like... There is a URI chat system that we have released.

01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:23.340
Over there, we have also provisioned MCP servers. Okay. And

01:33:23.340 --> 01:33:26.040
back end, we are not able to... We are not... Don't... Then

01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:28.900
in a later stage... No, no, no. So, we have allowed you to

01:33:28.900 --> 01:33:31.840
integrate. Just like a ChatGPT, right? So, even before

01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:34.780
ChatGPT, so at that point of time, this feature was not

01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:37.980
available. I think I'm talking about this story like six or

01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:40.700
eight months back, I think April or March. So, we have

01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:43.040
already... Maybe you will be able to go and find out the

01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:46.360
videos. So, we have also given MCP options over there. Just

01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:49.220
like they are giving you. So that, you know, with URI, come

01:33:49.220 --> 01:33:52.040
and then, you know, put your own MCPs and do whatever you

01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:56.040
want. Got it. Thanks. Thanks very much. Yeah. Maybe... Yeah.

01:33:56.060 --> 01:33:58.360
Adib is saying in MCP course. Yeah. Maybe you can go and

01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:01.480
check. But yeah, in URI, that feature was there. Then in a

01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:03.800
later stage, we said that, okay, I'm like, who is going to

01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:07.280
attach MCP? Let's remove it. Users was very less. So, you

01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:09.180
know, feature revamped. So, we have removed that feature.

01:34:09.780 --> 01:34:14.000
Yeah. Got it. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. Let me switch off my

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.380
developer mode. Yeah. Next question. Dhruv. Dhruv. I think

01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:18.540
he's asking question. Dhruv is going to be your new mentor,

01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:23.220
guys, by the way, for your next automation class. Yeah.

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:26.260
Dhruv, you have a question? Yeah. So, just I wanted to know.

01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:31.140
So, there are projects in Intensive Portal. So, there are,

01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:34.720
like, we have to make something with QAI, we have to use

01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:39.760
some specific tech stack. So, just I wanted to know, if I

01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:43.280
have an understanding which tool need to be used, might be

01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:47.500
there are other tool. As compared to QAI or take an example,

01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:50.240
there are OpenAI, there are Cloud, there are some other

01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:54.440
Gemini, right? So, can we tweak to get the result or just

01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:58.960
stick to that as a learner or what's your suggestion?

01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:01.560
Whatever is written there, this is what you have to use.

01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:05.920
Then you have to use that one because as a client, so you

01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:09.240
won't be, let's suppose you are like working on a client

01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:13.900
project, right? Right. You won't be having an option. Okay.

01:35:13.900 --> 01:35:17.380
So, that was my next question. For example, recently one

01:35:17.380 --> 01:35:20.520
client came to me, like I think two days back, we were like

01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:23.380
talking about their project and they said that I'm using

01:35:23.380 --> 01:35:27.120
Vertex and I'm using a model only from Vertex. They're using

01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:30.240
technically a complete Google Cloud stack and Vertex AI is

01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:33.280
integrated part of that. Right. So, they said that I don't

01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:36.060
want to use any other model, I just wanted to use a Vertex

01:35:36.060 --> 01:35:38.340
and from Vertex itself, I would like to access my Gemini

01:35:38.340 --> 01:35:42.700
like a model. I don't have any other option. Although there

01:35:42.700 --> 01:35:45.480
are like a millions of like a model, even the best one which

01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:47.720
is available in the market. But if client has said that,

01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:50.140
because client have already like done some sort of

01:35:50.140 --> 01:35:51.960
partnership and agreement with the Google, they are using

01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:57.000
that stack. So, and they have also like said that even from

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:00.660
a genetic framework, so I have to use only this much. I

01:36:00.660 --> 01:36:03.720
don't have any option. I have to do whatever like in that

01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:06.620
framework itself. If it will fail, I'll go back to client,

01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:09.140
then I will negotiate. But yeah, initially I won't be having

01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:12.620
any option. Okay. So, there might be. In this scenario that

01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:15.420
client already paid or has taken out their work, the entire

01:36:15.420 --> 01:36:18.520
team has worked on some kind of technology, that's why you

01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:21.200
have to use. Exactly. Because you will not be, there is a

01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:23.120
very high chance that you will not be a first person in a

01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:25.340
team. Right. They have already worked on something. They

01:36:25.340 --> 01:36:27.400
have already defined their own like infra and architecture

01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:30.380
and everything. So, you have to work in the existing system

01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:33.480
and like that's the reason I say, see, try to understand

01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:35.600
fundamentals of everything and then like you should, you

01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:37.840
should know everything because it's not that tough to build

01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:41.060
by the way. So, what is the harm in terms of, you know,

01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:44.320
knowing everything? Got it. Might be, might be if I'm like,

01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:47.460
if we are from lead or from first stage in any company, like

01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:50.860
in a startup and all and then you will be having a buying,

01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:53.600
then you will be having a stake holding. You can go and give

01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:55.680
a suggestion that, okay, let's, because you will be the

01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:58.000
first one to design something. Right. Right. Right. From

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.700
that, that level, if, if we think this could be the best,

01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:04.540
take an example, there is Claudia, there is a chat GPT,

01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:08.320
Claudia. Nothing. Yeah. Right. Yeah. See, as far as for me,

01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:10.400
nothing is best. Nothing is worst. Everything actually

01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:14.500
works. It works. So choose anything. It, it work. You just

01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:17.900
need a right person in your team. That's it. Okay. Got it.

01:37:17.940 --> 01:37:20.500
Got it. Are you getting clients from Fever and freelancer?

01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:23.800
Uh, no, uh, we were like, uh, we don't have account on Fever

01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:27.280
and freelancer. So we have, uh, our own like, uh, client

01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:31.500
base, uh, by the way, uh, so who comes to us directly. Uh,

01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:36.420
and then now we have launched your own consultancy. So even

01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:42.920
we are getting like a client as you all. Yes. Yeah. Uh,

01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:46.660
hello. Good morning. Yeah. You go ahead, please. Uh, I want

01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:50.960
to know about the, in the, uh, Vatex CI Gemini, there is two

01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:54.700
ways, uh, two ways to pass the credentials. The one is the

01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:58.020
API key. Uh, API key. And the second with the service

01:37:58.020 --> 01:38:00.440
account, we can create the JSON format service account,

01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:03.900
right? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, so for the production, uh,

01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:08.020
system, which is the best way. Anything is best way. Both

01:38:08.020 --> 01:38:09.680
the approach is best. Go ahead with the API key. This is the

01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:12.720
API approach. I think this is like, uh, everywhere we are

01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:15.880
trying to use, even when I have access to my calendar and my

01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:20.860
Gmail. So I have used that same approach. Okay. Yeah. Any,

01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:24.020
anything is fine. Both, both is secured away. Okay. Even

01:38:24.020 --> 01:38:25.020
good. Go ahead. Please do a question.

01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:34.380
Yeah. Yeah. Question when good. No. Okay. So fine guys. Uh,

01:38:34.580 --> 01:38:37.020
I think it was amazing discussion. I think this discussion

01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:39.340
was required somewhere because, uh, many of you were

01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:42.360
confused with respect to these multiple, like, uh, you know,

01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:46.000
RIG. And then eight to a, and then MCPs where to use, what

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.500
to use. I'll keep on clarifying these things again and

01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:52.380
again. And yeah, if you have anything in your mind, so you

01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:55.180
can feel free to like, ask me a question. Uh, tomorrow

01:38:55.180 --> 01:38:57.900
agenda, we already know. So today we talked about a theory

01:38:57.900 --> 01:39:00.900
of like this eight to eight, uh, tomorrow I'll show you a

01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:03.520
practical. So how I can create, you know, uh, different,

01:39:03.660 --> 01:39:05.920
different agents and then establish a communication between,

01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:08.800
uh, different, different agent. Most probably. So I'm trying

01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:11.160
to like build one. Like I told you, I'm, I'm facing some,

01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:15.200
uh, library. Like, uh, issue and, uh, yesterday, uh, till

01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:18.440
after like, uh, you know, late night. So I went for sleep.

01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:23.060
Uh, so, uh, basically like I'm trying to orchestrate, uh,

01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:26.140
something. So where, uh, there is a agent into a different,

01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:28.860
different frameworks and then all of them are able to

01:39:28.860 --> 01:39:31.300
communicate in between. So heterogeneous, which is going to

01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:35.380
be the real, real use case of eight to eight, right? If I

01:39:35.380 --> 01:39:37.940
am, I'm like going to create 10 agents, just in Lantern and

01:39:37.940 --> 01:39:40.880
then establish a communication that is not going to be a

01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:44.960
perfect example for eight to eight. I'm like, I can, that is

01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:47.120
also going to be the example, but yeah, not a perfect one.

01:39:47.220 --> 01:39:50.620
Uh, so I'm just building that, uh, tomorrow. So we'll, we'll

01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:53.440
try to, uh, like a discuss that particular part. Yes,

01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:55.820
everyone. Yeah. Fine.

01:39:58.660 --> 01:40:04.640
In a chat guys. Yes. Okay. Fine. So let's, uh, resume

01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:08.260
tomorrow and tomorrow, uh, this eight to a practical, we are

01:40:08.260 --> 01:40:13.340
going to do it. Take care of you. Thank you so much.
